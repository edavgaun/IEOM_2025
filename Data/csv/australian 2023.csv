Abstract 
PT XYZ is one of a big company in Indonesia. In daily operations, PT XYZ performs many business processes, one 
of which is the procurement process. This process requires a prediction of the need for goods for the procurement 
process to be carried out because intermittent and lumpy characteristics. This is the background for conducting this 
research. This study aims to predict the level of demand for goods so that it can help the procurement department to 
make purchases of goods. The method used is K-Means for Clustering, Holt Winter for forecasting, and Association 
Rule to find out the combination of items that are often held. The clustering process produces 3 clusters, namely the 
first cluster which has members of 327 items with an average value of 68, the second cluster which has members of 
18 items with an average value of 1281, and the third cluster which has members of 5 items with an average value of 
2474. The resulting forecast covers the upcoming 3 months period with a value of 427 in January, 472 in February, 
and 476 in March. In addition, it is also known which items are likely to appear in that month using the probability 
method and the minimum value of the probability is 50%. In January there are 10 items that are possible to appear, 22 
items in February, and 20 items in March. The rules generated from the association rule process are 24 rules. The rule 
is generated with a minimum support value of 10% and a minimum confidence of 50%. The integration between 
methods is also carried out to cover the existing deficiencies, so that more accurate results are obtained.

1. Introduction
Business processes are an important part of a company. Business processes are one of the determining factors for the 
smoothness, performance, and success of the company. The business process itself is a series of activities that are 
interconnected to achieve the desired results in supporting the running of a company (Harrington, 1991). A company 
carries out various kinds of business processes to support the running of the company. This process can be in the form 
of sales, production, procurement, or other processes. Each of these processes needs to be managed properly to 
improve the overall performance of the organization. One example of a business process carried out by the company 
is the process of procuring spare parts. This procurement is done to maintain the level of availability of these spare 
parts. Moreover, spare parts used for production machines. If the level of availability is not sufficient, it will affect the 
availability and reliability for machines in production. If this continues, it will have a negative impact on the company, 
such as decreased production productivity, longer machine breakdown times, until the production target is disrupted. 
Therefore, the need for spare parts needs to be predicted properly so that the procurement strategy can be made as 
good as possible. On the other hand, in predicting the need for machine spare parts, there are several difficulties to do 
so . According to Bacchetti and Saccani (2012), there are several aspects that cause the demand and management of 
spare parts to become a complicated problem, namely the high number of spare parts being managed and the existence 
of intermittent or lumpy demand. Intermittent requests are requests that occur at erratic intervals and with highly

the data processing carried out there is potential for other developments to find out more knowledge from the existing 
data. 
 
The development that can be done is related to the results of the forecasting method. The forecasting process only 
uses one method without any comparison with other methods. This can be the development of this research to find out 
the most appropriate forecasting method for the available data and reduce the error value of forecasting results. In 
addition, the addition of the data used can be done to improve the accuracy of forecasting because machine learning 
requires a large amount of training data for the learning process. The results of this forecasting have shortcomings in 
providing an overview of material requirements at the individual level. Therefore, research to find out this can be 
done.

5. Conclusion  
Maintaining inventory levels of the required spare parts is important in running the company's operations. If this 
inventory level is not maintained and suffers from a shortage, it will result in the cessation of the operation process 
because machine repair cannot be carried out. One way that can be done to maintain this level of inventory is to predict 
the need for existing spare parts. On the other hand, this prediction process has its own challenges, such as the lumpy 
and intermittent nature of spare parts requirements. Both properties will complicate the prediction process because the 
data on the level of demand becomes very volatile and can be erratic. These problems can be overcome by the results

of research conducted. The results of this research consist of three parts, namely clustering, forecasting, association 
rules, and integration of the three methods. 
 
The results of the clustering show that the cluster formed consists of 3 groups with the division of low demand – non-
moving, middle demand – slow moving, and high demand – fast moving. This division is based on the average value 
of each cluster or on low demand and non-moving has an average value of 67.54 and 4, middle demand and slow 
moving have an average of 1281.17 and 24, and high demand and fast moving have an average the average is 2474 
and 30. In addition, the low demand cluster has 327 material members, middle demand has 18 material members, and 
high demand has 5 material members. 
 
The results of the forecasting show procurement need for January of 1241, February of 201, and March of 500. In 
addition to the prediction of the number of needs, predictions are also made on what materials are likely to appear 
with a minimum probability value of 50%. In January materials 39, 45, 46, 47, 67, 74, 82, and 83 are likely to appear. 
In February materials 47, 64, 67, 69, 74, 78, 82, 83, 85, 86, 323, and 328 are likely to appear. In March materials 32, 
36, 39, 45, 46, 47, 69, 78, 82, 83, 86, 326, and 328 are likely to appear. However, because the material is in the middle 
value, it is necessary to carry out additional analysis to determine the trend of occurrence. 
 
The association rules or material combinations obtained from the AR analysis are 24 combinations. This combination 
has a minimum support value of 10% and a minimum confidence of 50%. The existence of this result can provide 
benefits such as savings on shipping costs and get a discount on a certain number of purchases. 
 
Integration between the three methods can be done to overcome the existing shortcomings. The results of the forecast 
show the level of spare parts demand for the next 3 months, but the results are still aggregate or a combination of all 
existing materials. Therefore, to predict at the individual level, the probability method can be used. The results of 
clustering are added to determine the characteristics of the existing material. Thus, the priority level can be determined 
and the material which has a 50% chance can be identified. With clustering integration, it is known that there are 
several materials that are not recommended to be procured because they are considered unlikely to occur. Rules formed 
from AR analysis can be added to determine the accompanying materials or combinations of materials that tend to 
occur. In other words, the results of the AR analysis are also a weighting factor for a material that will appear or tend 
to occur in a transaction.

Abstract 
The target of this examination is to break down the impacts of hierarchical culture on management of change practice 
in the South African media industry as the nation is situating itself to grasp the fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Led 
through a cross-sectional study of the media houses in South Africa, this research collected data both qualitative and 
quantitative in nature. Questionnaires were distributed to a total of 60 managers in the South African media space, 
with a response rate of 90%. The examination confirmed that change is a procedure driven by a few vital 
contemplations, which include the need for progressively harmonized techniques for conducting work and the 
improvement of business execution. These contemplations regularly are the outcome in organized change issues, 
dependent on the supposition that the management of change involves a compelled course of action of conciliation 
that can be recognized in a for the most part limited timeframe. Practically, the ramification of this investigation is to 
guarantee that firms basically assess all the significant factors and by expansion in this way include all the applicable 
partners for a progressively effective change management procedure in the present period of the 4IR.

1. Introduction
The media business in South Africa has advanced and has moved towards imposing business model gathering 
possession in a couple of hands and spending it to cover more fields. Media proprietors are driven by the benefit 
motive, and they have a restricted government proposition (Information and Communication Technology Policy, 
2008) to constrain cross-media possession. South African's audiences can access diverse media choice; however, they 
are vigorously divided. Group of spectators’ tendencies, inclinations and examples influence media conduct. South 
African's media clients utilize the radio mostly, followed by TV and papers, while exposing themselves to more than 
one channel and media daily. 
The audience in South Africa change rapidly which compels media houses to adjust to their needs and interests 
immediately. In spite of the fact that media literacy is low, trust in the media to react precisely on political issues is 
high (Ipsos, 2011). In spite of these difficulties, the data and innovation revolution has emphatically influenced the 
media in South Africa. 
Innovative convergence has given numerous data stage that have expanded the assorted variety of data hotspots for 
audiences. The technological convergence has additionally gotten more noteworthy in the way the media industry 
operates and energized the development of journalism by citizens. Advanced relocation from simple to computerized 
innovation can carry gigantic advantages to the part as it will profit more TV stations to financial specialists. Since 
the South African government's unwinding of broadcasting guidelines and enactment, somewhere in the range of 74 
percent of South Africans have access to the nation's more than 300 radio stations, be it commercial/public and 
community stations (Businesstech.co.za, 2019), regardless of new technologies enabling online streaming as well as 
enhanced broadband connectivity. Television is the second most famous medium being accessed by 82% percent of 
the population (Statistics South Africa, 2018). A sizable number of individuals in South Africa read newspapers, 
""mobile technology as a media presently rivals radio,"" (Ipsos, 2011). The accessibility of portable TV and radio gives 
individuals access to news at whatever point they need and thus, they do not need to be at a physical area at a specific

Table 6 reports on the analysis of data obtained from respondents in relations to their views on whether they agree or 
disagree with aspects of change management (ACM) existing within their respective organizations. An overall mean 
of 𝜇𝜇𝑥𝑥 = 3.3210 related to ACM indicates that most respondents neither agree nor disagree that their organization. A 
detailed assessment of responses shows 40% of respondents agree that change is being expected without being linked 
to incentives as well as that the project lead assigned the change management is known and project champions aid the 
planning and implementation (ACM2), 32% of respondents agree that there exist logical reasons for change which are 
visible and the goals are transparent (ACM6) and lastly 32% of respondents agree that the process of implementation 
for the change is flexible and reactive (ACM7). 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
To effectively accomplish change, it is compulsory that the company’s executives should conduct an audit of the 
current company culture. This will put the different perspectives under investigation to assess their significance and 
commitment to planning and actualizing the change venture and the essential changes required. Stream of data starting 
with one level then onto the next is postponed should there be numerous levels within the organization’s hierarchy. 
Therefore, it is imperative to decrease of the levels, which will add to effective communication. The research infers 
that for any viable change, there should be hierarchical and social alterations that should be made to oblige and 
continue change. This implies change is fruitful when it gets systematized and almost things are done in an 
organization which as a result implies the organization culture should change. The research has prompted the 
conclusions that various parts of progress have structure or limits.  
 
The human and hierarchical limits cannot be isolated from the processes within the organization’s framework. The 
way that social associations are invented by individuals proposes that they can be set up for an endless assortment of 
objectives. Various circumstances call for various responses henceforth the utilization of proactive, expectant and 
receptive managerial styles to suit the diverse kind of cultures. The study reasons that basic to effective change is great 
planning. Effectively dealing with the multifaceted nature of change is for all intents and purposes outlandish without 
a vigorous plan that is bolstered by a solid project management team. Evaluation of accessible resources and their 
capacity to deal with the change procedure is indispensable. According to Burns and Stalker (2014) who contended 
that, businesses frequently consider it to be a challenging task to conform to change; therefore, one executive's duties 
of first importance is to create an organization’s environment to address the difficulty of things to come. The duty is 
practiced by evaluating the assets and opportunities which are openly accessible, defining and characterizing the 
objectives of the business and productively dealing with the resources assigned to meet these objectives. The 
compelling procedure to arrive at explicit objectives and targets starts to create administrative planning systems so as 
to in the long run produce a powerful organization. 
 
Planning includes features of critical thinking, identification of problems, anticipations of problems and in particular 
basic leadership (Lynch, 2005). The study likewise infers that change is a procedure driven by a few vital 
contemplations including the requirement for increasingly incorporated methods for working and the need to improve 
business execution. Askim et al. (2009) noticed that the management of change is foundational and ought to be 
deployed with sensible reasons and all stakeholders’ participation in the change venture. These contemplations 
commonly are the outcome in organized change programs dependent on the suspicion that the management of change 
comprises of a constrained set of intercessions, which are viewed as target, quantifiable and directly reasonable 
projects that can be acknowledged in a generally brief time.  
 
The study prescribes that before the initiation of any change management procedure, comprehension of the powers 
driving change ought to be acknowledged as it will lead a change supervisory group to a more profound 
comprehension of the setting of change, arrangement of objectives with the main thrusts, and the management of these 
powers all through the change procedure. The investigation further prescribes a cautious evaluation of the accessible 
assets, their skill to deal with the change procedure and above all, kind of organisation culture the company right now 
works in. Hierarchical culture is a significant deciding variable of how any association grasps change.

Abstract 
Any attentive discourse of the present and eventual fate of the financial business at last brings up an essential issue: 
Will present and future clients be fulfilled by the service and quality given by the financial business in Johannesburg, 
South Africa? The goals of the examination are right off the bat, to learn the clients' desires as indicated by the service 
quality provided by the financial business. Also, to decide the view of clients concerning the service quality given by 
the financial business and thirdly, to quantify the gaps between client desires and impression of service quality through 
the use of the 5 components of service quality (tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy). The 
target population for this study was the University of Johannesburg’s students and sample size of 1500 students 
comprised of experts, independently employed and specialists, with 82% reaction rate. Data collected was analyzed 
according to descriptive statistics and the results showed that Reliability scored the highest based on the response from 
the study’s participants. There is a clear indication that customers highly rate service quality from their perception of 
how reliable banks’ services are provided. The findings have also indicated that customers poorly rated 
responsiveness, assurance and empathy in terms of their perception of services provided by the banking institutions. 
This study will assist the management of the banks to understand how the 5 dimensions of service quality contribute 
to their service/product offering by indicating which of the dimensions to improve.

Quality, Customer Satisfaction, and Banking Industry. 
1. Introduction
South Africa is recognised as being one of the leading banking infrastructures on the African continent (Dhurup et al., 
2014). The banking sector in South Africa has been very competitive over the past decade that the quality of service 
delivered by service providers is critical in customer satisfaction and retention (Mujinga, 2019). It is likewise critical 
to express that customer satisfaction has driven forward through a point of convergence of wonderful thought with 
respect to organizations and research people comparably. The essential objective of organizations is to achieve high 
incomes notwithstanding cost minimization. Return growth will, in general, be accomplished through speeding up 
management processes to diminish costs. One of the characteristics which will in general assist in upturning 
transactions is purchaser satisfaction since satisfaction prompts customer steadfastness offers and rehash purchase 
(Ngo Vu Minh, 2016). Customer satisfaction is the central stress of corporate firms of today. Bank's experts are 
persistently steering different research with respect to purchasers explicitly dependent on the affirmations to their 
satisfaction. In like manner, the reason that this issue of bliss concerns the most sporadic individual (the shoppers) 
who once placed put in the professional work environment or exposed to the organization's service should become a 
frequent customer bringing forth repeat business. How to continuously enable this repetition necessitates constant 
research. 
1.1 Background and Rationale of the Study 
Discussing the present and future state of the financial industry raises an important question: Will customers be 
satisfied with the quality of banking services offered by companies in Johannesburg, South Africa? The answer to this 
question largely depends on the financial industry's ability to understand customer needs and adapt to changing 
requirements over time, ultimately leading to increased consumer-centricity and improved efficiency. Building a loyal

this has been established through the analysis of responses that showed that customer perception of service quality 
was higher for the tangible aspects of the service and the reliability of banking services out of the five quality 
dimensions; and (3) To provide recommendations to the banking institutions with regards to which quality dimensions 
should be considered for improvement.

Abstract 
This study identifies prescription variety in patients diagnosed with cancer in regional part of Thailand by mapping 
pattern of prescription diversities from health administrated guidelines. This study examines prescribing variability in 
patients diagnosed with cancer symptoms by mapping prescribing patterns from electronic medical records to 
understand the impact of prescribing differences on patients. This research showed how big data technology and cloud 
computing can be integrated and put into practice to meaningfully support the migration of data from local hospital 
databases to cloud databases. This proposal focuses on optimizing respective software performance and funding in 
actual cloud service deployments. This study can confirm that health services program decisions in the management 
of chronic diseases are influenced despite the prescribing guidelines provided.  The lack of coordination of care has 
been cited as one cause of waste and inefficiency, especially when tests and services are repeated because their results 
are not communicated between providers. For cancer treatments, more than 1,000 preferred brand names and generic 
brands to treat chronic conditions are available in the market. The list is extended triple for non-preferred drugs which 
incurs researchers to define pattern of choices to prevent over-prescriptions and overdiagnosis. Most importantly, cost 
and profit made in compliance with drug choice may be made specific guidelines of health administered programs. A 
conjuncture is also given to researchers on how guidelines designate orders for prescriptions on multiple benefit plans. 
This study acquired data mining techniques to identify prescription patterns in health administered programs, and to 
clarify whether health insurance and benefit plans play role in changing the decision of drug choices. The results from 
this study suggest that ignorance of guidelines occurred more frequently in universal coverage scheme, however, 
physicians tend to override the prescription guideline for cancer and hypertension patients who enrolled in government 
benefit program. This study is able to support the notion that health administered programs may play role in 
determining drug options due to criteria in quality of treatment.

Abstract 
Halal food SMEs play a significant role in Malaysia's economic development, as the halal food industry is a major 
contributor to the country's GDP and employment. However, the industry faces a challenge in meeting the growing 
demand for eco-innovation while also complying with government regulations. This study aimed to investigate 
the implementation of eco-innovation practices among SMEs in the Malaysian food industry. The study included 
four independent variables: technological, organizational, environmental, and individual factors, to measure their 
relationship towards eco-innovation performance. A questionnaire was used to collect data from 150 employees 
in the food SME sector who implemented eco-innovation practices. The study's findings revealed that 
technological, organizational, environmental, and individual factors have a significant positive relationship with 
eco-innovation in Malaysian food industry SMEs. This study contributes to the literature by providing new 
insights into how teleology ethics guide Muslims to consume halal food purposefully, intentionally, mindfully, 
compassionately, and conscientiously. Furthermore, it enhances the knowledge on eco-innovation practices 
among SMEs in the Malaysian food industry, which has been lacking in research. However, this study has some 
limitations. Firstly, the study only focused on the Malaysian halal food industry, which limits the generalization 
of the findings to other industries or countries. Secondly, the sample size was relatively small, and the data was 
collected from a single source. Therefore, future research should consider a larger sample size from multiple 
sources to improve the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, future studies could explore the impact of 
different eco-innovation practices on the performance of SMEs in the halal food industry.

1.
Introduction
Malaysia is recognized as a prominent player in the Halal food industry, largely driven by small-medium
enterprises (SMEs) (Marmaya et al., 2019). The food processing sector in Malaysia is dominated by SMEs and
international investors, making it a hub for multinational corporations (Talib & Ali, 2009). The creation of
opportunities for SMEs to enter the Halal market is a critical step in this regard, as SMEs account for over 80%
of the total number of companies in the food processing industry, according to IMP3 (2006). The food and
beverage industry is a crucial sector for Malaysia's economic development, as highlighted by Ahmad, Ungku
Zainal et al., (2018). It plays a vital role in national economic growth, generating income and employment.
Moreover, Malaysia is poised to become a significant player in the provision of Halal goods and services, which
is a crucial aspect of Islamic practices.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have looked for new businesses to generate additional income. 
Governments, NGOs, and the general public have put pressure on major corporations to prioritize environmental 
protection (Jayakrishnan et al,.2018). However, research on eco-innovation in the food sector is limited, making 
it an area for further research (Bossle, 2015). SMEs are a critical sector for Malaysia's economic development, as 
highlighted in Marmaya, et al., (2019). The Malaysian government has introduced several programs to support 
local SMEs and help them achieve their goal of becoming a high-income country with an established status by 
2020. Despite this, Malaysian SMEs continue to struggle with low productivity and poor outcomes, resulting in a 
lack of competitiveness in the global business climate. Additionally, neighboring countries like Japan, South 
Korea, and Singapore have SMEs that contribute more to their GDP and exports than Malaysian SMEs. 
Eco-innovation is widely supported by academics, businesses, and policymakers as a cost-effective approach to 
achieving environmental sustainability. This is because eco-innovation principles align with the circular 
economy's social ideals and broader sustainability agenda, emphasizing efficient and effective product, energy, 
and human capital usage (Lopes et al., 2019). However, the process of eco-innovation can be challenging, 
67

innovation practices in the Malaysian Food Industry among SMEs. 
 
5.2 Relationship between Organizational Factor and eco-Innovation performance 
The literature suggests that the organizational factor has a positive correlation with eco-innovation practices 
among SMEs in the Malaysian Food Industry. However, the finding of this paper shows that the organizational 
factor did not have a significant impact on the implementation of eco-innovation practices in the industry. Hence, 
the hypothesis was rejected as the coefficient analysis showed that the relationship between the organizational 
factor and eco-innovation performance was not statistically significant (β = 0.011, p = 0.906). 
 
It is worth noting that organizational factors such as leadership, management support, and employee involvement 
are crucial in fostering an environment that encourages eco-innovation practices. In the halal food industry, these 
factors are even more critical as companies need to adhere to strict halal certification requirements. Therefore, 
further research is necessary to explore why the organizational factor did not have a significant impact on eco-
innovation practices in the halal food industry and to identify ways to improve this factor to enhance eco-
innovation practices among SMEs in the Malaysian Food Industry. 
 
 
5.3 Relationship between Environmental Factors and eco-Innovation performance 
The analysis revealed that there is a statistically significant positive direct relationship between the Environmental 
factor and eco-innovation performance, with a β value of 0.189 and p-value of 0.030. This suggests that the 
Environmental factor plays a significant role in the implementation of eco-innovation practices among SMEs in 
the Malaysian Food Industry, as perceived by most respondents. It is important to note that in this study, the term 
Environmental factor corresponds to the definition of ""external environment"" in the literature on organizational 
behavior. External factors such as environmental uncertainty, governmental support, industry type, competition, 
and network relations are considered key determinants of innovative and green behavior in organizations. Two 
significant environmental factors influencing technical innovation and environmental strategy are environmental 
uncertainty and external resource availability. The government also plays a crucial role in providing resources to 
encourage the adoption of new technologies. Based on the model proposed by Lin and Ho (2011), this study 
focuses on the effects of environmental uncertainty, government support, and stakeholder pressures on eco-
innovation practices among SMEs in the Malaysian Food Industry. The findings highlight the importance of 
considering the external environment when examining the implementation of eco-innovation practices in 
organizations. 
 
5.4 Relationship between Individual Factors and eco-Innovation performance 
Table 4 shows that there is a positive correlation between the Individual Factors and eco-innovation performance 
among SMEs in the Malaysian Food Industry. The correlation coefficient value is 0.903, indicating a strong 
relationship between the individual factor and eco-innovation performance. Additionally, the fourth set of 
hypotheses supports the hypothesis that individual factors have a significant relationship with the implementation 
of eco-innovation practices, and thus was accepted. Further analysis in Chapter 4 reveals that the coefficient 
analysis between the individual factor and eco-innovation performance (β = 0.437, p = 0.000) indicates a 
statistically significant relationship between the two variables. The p-value being less than 0.05 indicates that the 
individual factor has significantly influenced the implementation of eco-innovation practices. It is important to 
note that the individual factor encompasses a range of individual-level variables, including knowledge, skills, 
attitudes, and behavior. These individual-level factors are critical in driving innovation and change within an 
organization. 
 
6. Conclusion 
6.1 Implication of the research  
The halal food industry in Malaysia is an emerging sector that requires a focus on environmental sustainability. 
Eco-innovation is critical to achieving this goal, and understanding the factors that significantly influence it can 
help improve the industry's environmental performance. This study contributes to the literature on eco-innovation 
by examining the individual, environmental, and organizational factors that significantly influence eco-innovation 
in the halal food industry in Malaysia. Firstly, individual factors such as personal values, environmental 
awareness, and willingness to innovate significantly influence eco-innovation in the halal food industry. 
Employees who are environmentally conscious and willing to adopt eco-friendly practices can positively impact 
the industry's overall eco-innovation performance. Secondly, environmental factors such as government support, 
environmental regulations, and stakeholder pressure are critical to the implementation of eco-innovation practices 
in the halal food industry. The Malaysian government has shown support for environmental sustainability 
initiatives, and stakeholders are increasingly pushing for eco-friendly practices in the industry. Finally, 
73
Proceedings of the Second Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Melbourne, Australia, November 14-16, 2023
© IEOM Society International","organizational factors such as organizational culture, resource availability, and management support are also 
critical to the implementation of eco-innovation practices in the halal food industry.  
  
6.2 Managerial Implication  
The findings of this study have several managerial implications for SMEs in the Halal food industry in Malaysia. 
First, SMEs should prioritize the adoption of eco-innovation practices as they not only contribute to environmental 
sustainability but also positively impact their performance. SMEs should focus on developing innovative products 
and processes that reduce their environmental footprint, such as using renewable energy sources, reducing waste 
generation, and improving packaging materials. Secondly, SMEs should take into account the individual, 
environmental, and organizational factors that significantly influence the implementation of eco-innovation 
practices. SMEs should ensure that their employees are aware of the importance of eco-innovation practices and 
provide training to improve their knowledge and skills. They should also consider the external environment, such 
as government policies and support, to facilitate the adoption of eco-innovation practices. Thirdly, SMEs should 
focus on developing a supportive organizational culture that encourages and rewards the adoption of eco-
innovation practices. This can be achieved by providing incentives and recognition to employees who come up 
with innovative ideas that reduce the environmental impact of their products or processes.  
 
6.3 Implication of the Policy Makers 
The findings of this study highlight the significant influence of individual, environmental, and organizational 
factors on eco-innovation in the halal food industry in Malaysia. Policy makers can use this information to design 
policies and regulations that support the implementation of eco-innovation practices in SMEs operating in the 
halal food industry. For instance, policy makers can provide incentives and support for technological innovation, 
promote environmental regulations, and encourage organizational practices that support eco-innovation. By doing 
so, policy makers can create an enabling environment for SMEs to adopt eco-innovation practices that reduce 
environmental impact while enhancing their competitiveness.  
 
6.4 Limitation and contribution 
One of the limitations of this study is that it focuses only on SMEs in the Malaysian Halal food industry. Therefore, 
the results may not be applicable to other industries or larger companies. Additionally, the study relies on self-
reported data, which may lead to response bias. Furthermore, this study does not consider cultural or societal 
factors that may affect the implementation of eco-innovation practices. Future research could expand the scope of 
the study to include larger companies and other industries. Additionally, researchers could consider using 
objective measures of eco-innovation practices instead of relying on self-reported data.

Abstract 
Coatings of guidewires used in medical device manufacturing industry are one of the most important aspects. It 
defines its efficiency to penetrate through tightest of canals and curves. Guidewires are put through controlled 
environment to accelerate its age and tested for its mechanical features. Pressure Guidewire failed the lubricity 
testing after being tested by multiple operators and at alternate sites. A cause-and-effect diagram shows all potential 
causes of test failure. The human factor involved in the test failure was investigated through multiple Gage R&R and 
training records. Calibration error with the lubricity tester DL1000 was identified and solved through preventive 
maintenance work order. The failed samples were examined under Scanning Electron Microscope and detailed 
images showed coating wearing off from T=2years samples. A two-factor design of experiment factorial was 
conducted to see the effects of factors on distal and proximal sections of the wire. The actual setting of Corona 
distance 5mm and Dip speed 60mm/min seem to affect the coating of proximal section during aging process. A new 
optimize setting of Corona distance 2mm and Dip speed of 30mm/min proved to provide better coating that can 
sustain the wire over the 2 years. Similarly, for distal section of Pressure Guidewire, UV intensity of 6.0 and Corona 
time of 30seconds showed better results as compared to original setting. A confirmation study was conducted to 
prove the effects of new changes implementation and process capability showed that the results were under control.

1. Introduction
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the coating wear, identify the optimal treatment settings, implement the 
changes, and verify the resulting changes through Design of Experiments (DOE) analysis. This study can help 
optimizing and improving the sustainability of guidewire coating for a longer time. During aging study, a certain lot 
and batch of Pressure Guidewire samples failed the lubricity and durability testing. The results showed that the 
material was out of specification for both, proximal and distal sections of Pressure Guidewire. This study provided 
detailed analysis on different factors that contributed to the lubricity testing failure. The measurement system, 
human factor, and machine, all contributed to testing failure to a certain extent and the variance was calculated using 
DOE. Coating of Pressure Guidewire was the leading factor, as proved both through DOE and SEM images. This 
study helped essentially in fixing the coatings processes of guidewire and make the product more sustainable over 
the time.  
1.1 Objectives 
The primary objective of this research is to identify the optimal settings for corona treatment of guidewire coating. 
The corona distance, corona dip speed, UV intensity and corona time are primary factors influencing the coating 
process of proximal and distal sides of guidewire. The data will be justified based on the interaction of factors given 
in the Table 1 below:

Abstract 
Water is required for the optimal operation of sewerage pipelines, water treatment and wastewater treatment facilities. 
In the absence of water, it is impossible to achieve adequate sanitation. The provision of water and sanitation services 
is acknowledged as a human right for all, both for destitute and affluent individuals. As a developing country, South 
Africa is experiencing rapid growth in its’ number of urban dwellers, and this rapid growth strains sewerage pipelines 
often leading to clogging, leakage, and deformation. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that affect 
the reliability of sewerage pipelines and to identify reliability tools that can be employed at different stages of the 
pipeline lifecycle to enhance reliability. A deductive approach was adopted as the research methodology and a survey 
questionnaire was employed to obtain the research data from a select engineering population in South Africa, with the 
test items deduced from a comprehensive literature review.  The research population was comprehensive, and snowball 
sampling was utilized to obtain information.  The following reliability tools are mostly utilized by industry in South 
Africa to improve the reliability of sewerage pipelines, namely fault tree analysis, reliability-based maintenance, 
failure-mode-and-effect analysis, and hazard and operability studies.  
Keywords 
Wastewater Treatment, Sewerage Pipelines, and Reliability. 
1. Introduction
According to the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Framework, water and sanitation rights have become an explicit 
requirement with respect to health, development, and a reasonable standard of living (Gupta et al., 2010).  In rapidly 
urbanizing developing regions, urban sanitation coverage has expanded marginally in the recent 20 years, whilst the 
number of people without access to improved sanitation has increased by 35% (Hawkins et al., 2013). Although urban 
areas have a higher level of toilet access than rural areas, clean living conditions for destitute individuals are still 
impacted by access to housing, lack of sanitation, and poor drainage disruptions. Although there has been a decline in 
the number of urban inhabitants practicing open defecation, this practice has decreased only marginally in Southeast 
Asia and it has increased in Sub-Saharan Africa (Hawkins et al., 2013).   
There are many types of water services, including water supply, sanitation, and the accumulation and treatment of 
wastewater. Every one of the 58 million individuals living in South Africa utilizes residential water services. 
However, it is estimated that 7 million individuals lack access to satisfactory water services and 18 million individuals 
lack satisfactory sanitation services (Department of Water Affairs, 2013). Efficient provision of reliable water and 
sanitation services are not only fundamental for businesses and industries, but also advance economic development 
and the elimination of destitution.  
The transportation system of water and sewerage pipelines is complex and comprises multiple modes, with each mode 
having its own complexity that coordinates activities to build system resilience of the communities they support (Mohr,

The most widely used internal consistency metric is Cronbach's alpha (Hajjar, 2018). The current research employed 
Cronbach’s alpha using SPSS to test the reliability of the research instrument. According to Hajjar (2018) alpha 
coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, an alpha value of 1 is the highest, indicating full internal consistency. Anything below 
0.7 is regarded as inconsistent and unreliable. The current research opted for an alpha coefficient threshold of 0.7 for 
reliability and consistency.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The research investigated the factors that affect the reliability of sewerage pipelines in South Africa, and identified 
and recommended reliability tools that can be employed at different stages of the pipeline lifecycle to enhance the 
reliability of the pipeline. The respondents suggest that design parameters, environmental factors (corrosion), fatigue, 
third party interference, buckling and leakage affect the reliability of sewer pipelines mostly. In general, welded 
failures result in leakages. The literature data in Figure 1 (Literature Review) is congruent to the current research 
results, the data in Figure 1 indicate that welded failures (leakage), corrosion and excavation damage (third party 
interference) are the largest causes of pipeline failures each contributing 34%, 18% and 15% respectively.  Hence, the 
industry results reflect and support the findings from literature from a South African perspective. 
 
According to the research findings, four reliability tools emerged as the most implemented or utilized in the industry, 
namely HAZOP, FTA, FMEA and RBM.  As such, more focus on these reliability tools will yield the most favorable 
results in improving the reliability of sewerage pipelines, provided that implementation takes place at the correct stage 
of the sewer pipeline lifecycle.

Abstract 
Accounting fraud is defined as the intentional material misstatement of financial statements or disclosures (in notes to 
financial statements or SEC filings) or the commission of an illegal act that has a material direct effect on financial 
statements or financial disclosures. The early detection of accounting fraud is important because fraudulent activity 
reduces public confidence in capital markets and hinders economic development. Therefore, studies have been 
conducted to develop accounting fraud detection models using quantitative data, such as accounting and financial 
information, and qualitative data, such as descriptions of securities filings. Previous studies using Form 10-K extracted 
words that were highly associated with fraudulent accounting activities and used an SVM (Support Vector Machine) 
to construct a fraudulent accounting detection model. To build the model, fraudulent and non-fraudulent accounting 
firms were used as samples. By contrast, this study constructs a fraudulent accounting detection model that samples 
fraudulent accounting periods and other periods (non-fraudulent terms) of companies with fraudulent accounting 
experience and extracts words that capture the signs of fraudulent accounting. A fraudulent accounting detection 
model is constructed following the procedures of previous studies on companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange 
from 2004 to 2017. In addition, we constructed detection models using several classification algorithms (SVM, RF, 
LR, and XGB) and compared their accuracies. The results show that SVM is better at detecting accounting fraud than 
other classification algorithms, with a sensitivity (accuracy rate for accounting fraud firms) of 60%.

Abstract 
The dearth of English information available to international investors for making investment decisions about Japanese 
companies remains a persistent challenge. While previous studies have mainly focused on U.S.-listed companies, it 
has shown that the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) 
section’s readability can negatively impact future performance, while its tone can positively influence it. Given the 
divergent textual characteristics of U.S. and non-U.S. companies, it is unclear whether the relationship between 
readability/tone and future performance for U.S. firms applies to English-language annual securities reports of 
Japanese companies. We examined the effect of tone and readability in the text on future performance (ROE in t+1 
period) by analyzing the MD&A section of the English annual securities reports of Japanese companies. It was 
observed that a higher tone of text in the MD&A section and improved readability are associated with stronger future 
performance. This suggests that even in English annual securities reports, management may adapt the characteristics 
of the text in the MD&A section based on future performance forecasts, similar to the reports in Japanese.

Abstract 
Most listed Japanese companies announce earnings forecasts based on their management (management forecasts). 
Management forecasts are particularly important for investors' decision-making because they are published by 
managers who hold inside information. A previous study conducted an online experiment among Japanese investors. 
Investors looked at the information presented on the frequency of beating (versus missing) and earnings surprises and 
evaluated five items: a common stock valuation of the firm, the desirability of the firm, the future prospects of each 
firm, the competence of management, and trustworthiness. However, the previous study did not compare male and 
female investors. Therefore, we compared male and female investors based on the data of a previous study. First, a 
comparison of the means between men and women showed that, overall, the means of male responses were higher. 
The analysis of variance showed that, in terms of stock evaluation, significant differences were obtained for males in 
the frequency of beating (F1,108 = 27.95, p=0.001) and earnings surprises (F1,104 = 6.07, p=0.015), so that both the 
number of achievements and earnings surprises were considered and evaluated. On the other hand, there were 
significant differences for females on the frequency of beating (F1,108 = 5.26, p=0.024), so it was clear that female 
investors evaluated them by looking at the number of achievements only. For trustworthiness, both male and female 
were evaluated based on the frequency of beating (male F1,108 = 31.41, p=0.001; female F1,108 = 8.04, p=0.005). 
Therefore, for a company to be highly valued as a stock valuation by male investors, it is important to increase the 
number of achievements and earnings surprises, and in the case of female investors, the number of achievements. It 
is also important for firms to be rated highly reliable by both male and female investors.

Abstract 
The impact of COVID-19 has made it difficult to hold briefings on financial results and shareholder meetings in 
person. Consequently, an increasing number of companies are using online conferences. In Japan, there is an initiative 
called ""Net Conference"", which originated as a teleconference (conference call) to hold meetings such as financial 
results briefings over the Internet. A net conference is a place for managers to present to stakeholders their company's 
performance and situation; however, it is also a place for communication between managers and participants. It serves 
as a platform for managers to communicate their company's performance and engage with stakeholders including 
shareholders, investors, and analysts. There are two types of communication in a net conference: verbal and nonverbal. 
Nonverbal communication consists of visual information such as facial expressions, gestures, body language, and 
auditory information such as voice pitch and intensity.Following the procedures of previous studies, this study focuses 
on the nonverbal communication of executives in Japanese companies during net conferences, specifically examining 
vocal characteristics (voice pitch and volume). This study aims to elucidate the relationship between vocal 
characteristics and business performance.The analysis revealed that the fundamental   frequency   had   a   statistically 
significant negative coefficient   （β = -.21,  p < .05） on ROE. The value of the partial regression coefficient for 
fundamental frequency is negative, indicating that managers with a lower voice have a higher ROE.

Interaction Hierarchy to Sustainable Reverse Logistics 
Activities in Indonesia

Abstract 
Many developed countries rely on reverse logistics (RL) to address the increasing amount of electronic waste that 
causes environmental pollution. Unfortunately, many developing countries, including Indonesia, struggle to develop 
RL activities. In Indonesia, these activities actually cause severe environmental pollution through the inevitable 
informal business interactions involved. From the other side, governments in many developing countries admit that 
they still need informal businesses to help manage waste because of the limited number of government officials in 
office. Therefore, it is necessary to study the form and hierarchy of informal business interactions for sustainable RL 
activities, so that decision makers can determine the waste management strategy to be implemented. This study uses 
a descriptive survey approach and applies the snowball sampling technique in collecting data from six provinces that 
are centers of e-waste processing in Indonesia. Awareness, interest, desire, and actions of stakeholders, including 
informal business and government, are measured separately because they cater to different interests. Through the 
analysis, this research is expected to obtain a clear picture of the interaction level of each stakeholder in the 
implementation or support of sustainable reverse logistics activities. The results of the study show that informal 
business and government have a moderate level of awareness. They realize that RL activities can improve people's 
welfare and prevent environmental pollution, knowing that their business processes must strike a balance between 
economic development and public health. They are also aware of the risks that must be borne, in addition to the 
benefits they receive. However, interest and desire level of informal business to implement RL activities are low. 
Conversely, governments have moderate interest and desire to support RL activities. Although informal businesses 
have low interest in and desire to implement sustainable reverse logistics, they engage in real action such as providing 
e-waste bankers, creating a traditional machine to prevent direct interaction between employees and e-waste
components, buying expensive technology to prevent air pollution, and willing to become freelancers for electronic
manufacturers who are unable to treat e-waste in an environmentally friendly manner. In contrast, the government has
a lower level of action in supporting RL activities. They do not have complete data about the existing IEBs, as
important messages about preventing environmental pollution due to illegal e-waste processing do not reach these
groups. They admit that they have not built an SRL governance system, provided facilities and technology, and
implemented strict regulations and mechanisms due to the heavy workload from their main jobs.

1. Introduction
The growth of illegal electronic waste processing activities in Indonesia continued to increase until the end of 2015 
(Maheswari et al., 2017). Although recently the number of waste processing businesses has decreased, the scale of 
this informal business continues to increase in line with the increase in the amount of electronic waste, which is 
predicted to increase by 38% in 2030 (Global E-waste Monitor, 2020) from its position in 2019 of 53.6 million tons. 
The government's encouragement for people to switch to electric cars is predicted to have a significant effect on 
increasing business in the informal sector.  
It is undeniable that the e-waste processing business provides far greater profits than other informal businesses, and 
income can even exceed that if someone works in the formal sector (Maheswari et al., 2020). The high poverty rate 
and the low level of education and skills possessed by community members force some people to engage in business

Figure 3. Collaboration Models between Informal Business and Government 
 
There are four collaboration models that can be built between informal e-waste business and government as shown in 
Figure 3, namely: 
1. 
Providing specific places as disposal bankers or storage points for e-waste; 
2. 
Arranging a green public e-waste disposal, while the IEBs are tasked with collecting, segregating and sorting 
electronic waste based on its type; 
3. 
Developing a mutually beneficial relationship between IEBs and electronic manufacturers 
4. 
Provision of manpower for the collecting, separating, sorting, and dismantling processes. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Local government and environmental agencies in Indonesia have moderate awareness, interest, and desire to support 
sustainable reverse logistics. Conversely, even though informal businesses have moderate awareness, their interest in 
and desire to organize RL activities that are environmentally friendly and pay attention to the harmony of life are very 
low. Surprisingly the findings of this research show that low interest in and desire for IEBs to comply with 
environmental regulations does not prevent community members from trying to achieve environmental goals. To 
prevent a negative impact, they are willing to provide e-waste bankers, create traditional machines, buy expensive 
technology, and serve as freelancers for electronic manufacturers. Their main reason is to survive by conducting 
business that is dangerous but provides far greater profits than other informal businesses.

Abstract 
A job shop casting facility in Southern Minnesota utilizes the green sand molding process in the production of ductile 
iron castings. The foundry’s green sand is produced by mixing recycled molding sand with water, clay, seacoal, and 
other ingredients in a muller. Maintaining consistent sand properties through the molding process is critical to the 
production of quality iron castings. One of the primary measured and controlled characteristics of which indicates 
molding sand quality is compactability. Compactability is measured in-line automatically on every batch of sand; the 
results are used as the sole factor to determine water additions for the subsequent batch of sand. While this formula 
frequently produces sand that is sufficient for molding, various factors exist outside of this calculation that can affect 
the outcome of the next sand batch. These factors are currently not accounted for in the calculation of water additions 
and as such, some amount of inconsistency is generated by the current process. Inconsistent molding sand may result 
in the production of scrap castings as well as downtime at the molding machines. This project utilizes the DMAIC 
improvement process to reduce variation in molding sand by measuring, analyzing, and improving upon the 
parameters used in the green sand control process. The desired outcome of the project is to produce consistently stable 
sand by predicting and controlling water addition rate (therefore resulting compactability) based on the measured 
inputs. Reducing batch-to-batch and overall variation in molding sand will lead to a reduction in sand-related scrap 
and downtime.

1. Introduction
A job shop casting facility in Southern Minnesota utilizes the green sand molding process in the production of ductile 
iron castings. The foundry’s green sand is produced by mixing recycled molding sand with water, clay, seacoal, and 
other ingredients in a muller. Maintaining consistent sand properties through the molding process is critical to the 
production of quality iron castings. One of the primary measured and controlled characteristics of which indicates 
molding sand quality is compactability.  
Compactability is defined as the percent change in height of a given volume of loose molding sand when compacted 
under an established force. Compactability is measured in-line automatically on every batch of sand; the results are 
used as the sole factor to determine water additions for the subsequent batch of sand. A 1% increase in compactability 
will results in a 0.1-gallon decrease in water addition for the next batch of sand made (and vice-versa). While this 
formula frequently produces sand that is sufficient for molding, various factors exist outside of this calculation that 
can affect the outcome of the next sand batch. These factors are currently not accounted for in the calculation of water 
additions and as such, some amount of inconsistency is generated by the current process.  
Inconsistent molding sand may result in the production of scrap castings as well as downtime at the molding machines. 
When sand is dryer than desired, sand is easily washed or broken away from the mold during pouring, resulting in 
sand inclusion defects. Wet sand can lead to pinhole defects and soft molds resulting in poor surface finish. Extremely 
dry sand can result in molds that will crack or fall apart during transport or pouring, while very wet sand can also stick 
to tooling, mold jackets, etc. and cause further issues. Sand-related downtime can occur when sand is produced outside 
of the set parameters (too dry or too wet). Molds cannot be made with this sand, so operators must recycle the sand

water additions based on the temperature range during each phase (cold/dry, tempered, and hot/dry). Table 3 breaks 
down the temperature data into four individual ranges, with their corresponding water addition trend, and the proposed 
water adjustment which was calculated through linear regression. 
 
Table 3. Programming ranges 
 
 
The programming required to implement the proposed water adjustment calculations described in Table 3 was 
determined to be straightforward compared with the current logic and sufficient to provide additional control over 
sand output. This will improve the startup sand issue as well as overall sand consistency by accounting for extreme 
temperatures.  
 
5. Conclusions 
5.1 Control 
As changes were implemented to the process, percent compactability and deviation from the setpoint were monitored 
and trended as the most immediate indicator of the success of the changes. This data is collected in real time on every 
batch of sand made and logged on to an internal server. The feedback is also utilized to determine water additions for 
the next batch of sand per the new adjustment chart in Table 3. Run charts are available to display data and deviation 
from the setpoint will trigger alarms and email alerts if there are more than three instances of the result being at least 
three points from the setpoint. An overview in Figure 9 shows the current typical spread of compactability, a drastic 
improvement from the compactability percent prior to the implementation of the aforementioned improvements.  
 
 
Figure 9. Spread of Compatibility after improvements 
 
Overall system stability was improved, and sand properties have continued to be more stable thanks to the 
improvements made to eliminate excess variation in the sand cooling and mulling processes. Accounting for the 
additional variations in incoming sand temperature and moisture have proven to stabilize the percent compactability 
of sand produced at the muller. Ongoing monitoring through X-bar and R charts as shown in Figure 10 allows us to 
further narrow down additional factors that can impact sand, some of which are discussed in the future improvements 
below. The ongoing use of alarms and email alerts has increased the awareness of sand properties among operators 
and maintenance technicians and allowed issues to be resolved before they lead to excessive downtime or scrap.

5.2 Future Improvements 
While significant long-term improvements in sand consistency and availability are expected as a result of the changes 
made, this project helped to identify more variables that could be further controlled. Currently, compactability is tested 
just after sand is produced. The timeframe between point of sand production and point of use vary depending on rate 
of production and this impacts the final properties of the sand at the point of use, since sand is losing moisture over 
time at varying rates depending on the temperature of the sand and the ambient conditions. Other additional variables 
to consider are the amount of clay added per batch, water temperature, ambient temperature and humidity, and 
moisture (conductivity) of the incoming sand. Future improvements should consider measuring and controlling these 
additional parameters which could result in an even higher level of consistency and increased availability.

Abstract 
The textile sector is one of the most important sectors in Peru. Currently, the Peruvian market is highly competitive 
not only among domestic producers, but also with imports of textile products, which have been increasing 
progressively in recent years. Therefore, for a textile manufacturing company to be competitive in the Peruvian market, 
it must not only focus on offering the best price, but also a high level of service that allows it to differentiate itself 
from other competing companies. In this sense, the use of lean tools such as TPM and 5S integrated with SLP is 
proposed to improve the service level of a textile SME. To support the effectiveness of the model and the improvement 
of the critical indicators, the model is validated through a pilot test and simulation. As a result of the application of 
the model, an increase of 25% in OTIF, 13% in overall equipment efficiency, 11% in production and reduction of 
34.57% in search time were obtained.

5S Methodology, TPM, SLP, Service Level, Textile Sector. 
1. Introduction
In Peru, the textile sector is one of the main industries that has a positive impact on economic development, 
contributing annually 6.4% of manufacturing GDP and generating around 400 000 direct jobs per year (Sociedad 
Nacional de Industrias 2021). In addition, 35 798 companies are registered, of which 99.5% are SMEs with a creation 
rate of 5.4% and an exit rate of 2.2% per year (Produce 2021). Within the textile sector, Peru is known for its various 
products made with quality cotton, t-shirt being the most representative product and with the highest production in the 
Peruvian industry. Despite this in recent years it has been losing share in both the international and domestic market 
due to products mainly from China and Bangladesh. During the first semester of 2020, the participation of national 
textile products represented only 2.9% of the Peruvian market, while imported products had a participation of 97.1%, 
causing a 78.7% decrease in sale of the national clothing industry (Produce 2020). The common problem identified, 
according to the review of the literature, of the SMEs that cannot be competitive in the market is the low level of 
service the offer, failing to comply with the quantity and delivery time of orders. Generating economic penalties and 
inconvenience. Customers in recent years prefer foreign textile products that has been growing progressively in the 
last decade. The motivation to carry out the research is reflected in the need to improve the level of service of a 
Peruvian t-shirt manufacturing company through the integration of various techniques that are mostly applied 
individually to solve various problems related to the low level of service, such as the SLP focused on solving the 
inefficient distribution of the plant, the TPM that allows increasing the efficiency of the machinery and the 5S 
methodology focused on reducing search time and eliminating other waste. For this reason, a combined model is 
proposed implementing the 5S, TPM and SLP tools that empower textile SMEs to comply with the delivery of orders 
on time and complete to their customers, and thus achieve an increase in the level of service in the sector that allows 
them to compete in the Peruvian market.

6. Conclusion
The application of the 5S tool contributed to the reduction of search times from 7.58 min to 4 min, thus increasing the 
performance of each operator. Based on this indicator, we can conclude that the application of the 5S methodology 
contributes to improving the efficiency and performance of companies in the textile sector. The implementation of 
TPM greatly increased the efficiency of the equipment from 69.05% to 86.19%, which influences the availability of 
the machine, the efficiency, and the quality, which increased its production performance through the improvements 
implemented. The SLP technique reduced unnecessary transfers from one work area to another, making it possible to 
streamline the manufacturing process and reduce the operator’s effort. Finally, the use of the 3 tools together allowed 
to raise the level of service of the company that initially was 72% and applying the proposed improvement model 
increased to 97%.

Abstract 
Social networks have become a powerful medium for communication and information sharing, influencing various 
aspects of society, including the organization and participation in community events such as Parkrun. As the popularity 
of Parkrun events continues to grow, effective monitoring and analysis of network data become crucial for event 
organizers to understand participant sentiments, engagement, and overall event success. In this paper, we propose the 
application of the Multivariate Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (MEWMA) chart for social network 
monitoring of Parkrun events, enabling the detection of anomalies and trends surrounding these events. Implementing 
the proposed approach with UK Parkrun events data and analyzing the change points highlights how tracking 
participants' choice of Parkrun site for running can profoundly affect event coordination and enhance the participant 
experience. Such analysis will assist planners in making more informed decisions regarding event logistics, resource 
allocation, and safety measures for Parkrun events. This research demonstrates how monitoring methods can improve 
event management and enhance participant experiences through data-driven insights. 
Keywords 
Social network monitoring, MEWMA, Change point detection, Parkrun events. 
1. Introduction
A network is a collection of interconnected elements or nodes, which represent individual entities, and the connections 
between them are known as edges or links. A social network is a specific type of network that represents relationships 
between individuals or entities in a social context. In social networks, nodes represent people or entities (e.g., 
individuals, organizations), and edges represent relationships between them (e.g., friendship, family ties, professional 
connections). Social networks can be used to study patterns of social interactions, information flow, influence, and 
the spread of ideas or behaviors within a social group (Makagon et al., 2012). In today's interconnected world, social 
networks have become an integral part of our daily lives, revolutionizing the way we communicate, share information, 
and build relationships. With the massive influx of data generated on these platforms, it has become paramount to 
ensure the security, privacy, and overall integrity of the information exchanged. However, social networks are not 
only channels for healthy interactions but also hotbeds for misinformation, cyberbullying, and various illicit activities 
(Darwish et al., 2023). The demand for robust and effective monitoring systems to identify and mitigate undesirable 
behaviors on social networks has nevear been more critical. Existing approaches often fall short in handling the 
dynamic and vast amounts of data generated by users worldwide, leading to delayed or inaccurate identification of 
potential threats. Therefore, this research aims to address the problem of monitoring social-related data of events, to 
improve event management. 
Social network monitoring offers numerous benefits to businesses and individuals alike. It aids in reputation 
management by promptly addressing customer feedback and complaints. Additionally, it provides valuable customer 
insights, facilitates competitor analysis, and supports crisis management efforts. Social network monitoring also helps 
identify influencers for marketing collaborations, enhances brand awareness and engagement, and fosters product 
innovation through customer feedback. Furthermore, it enables businesses to spot emerging trends and opportunities, 
measure campaign effectiveness, and assess potential risks (Bolotaeva & Cata, 2010). Overall, social network 
monitoring plays a vital role in staying connected, informed, and responsive in today's digital age.

participants across all locations—nearly 14 percent higher than the previous event. Notably, this event marked a 
significant change by unfolding across 183 previously unutilized locations, indicating that approximately 32% of the 
locations exert a substantial impact on overall satisfaction and participant attraction to Parkrun events. 
 
The results obtained provide a clear illustration of how event organizers can harness the power of the MEWMA chart 
to glean insights into participants' behaviors, accentuate impactful activities, and swiftly address potential issues 
during and post events. The application of the MEWMA approach proves especially advantageous in the context of 
high-dimensional data like Parkrun data, given its adeptness at effectively analyzing and monitoring intricate systems. 
This approach finds extensive utility in quality control, fault detection, and anomaly identification, yielding enhanced 
process performance and diminished variability across a range of practical scenarios. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Nowadays, the detection of change points in social networks has emerged as a focal point for researchers. Two primary 
approaches, model-based and free-model analysis, corresponding to parametric and nonparametric methods, have 
been extensively studied. While model-based methods have seen significant attention, only a limited number of studies 
have explored the use of Multivariate Profiles for monitoring network data generated from events. To bridge this gap, 
this paper highlights the applicability of the MEWMA chart for social network monitoring of Parkrun events, offering 
event organizers valuable insights to optimize their strategies and create engaging experiences for participants. We 
outline the potential benefits of using the MEWMA chart for event management, including its ability to facilitate data-
driven decision-making, enhance event success, and improve participant experiences. Furthermore, we explore the 
broader applications of this monitoring technique for various other community events and social campaigns. The 
implications of this proposed tool extend across various industries, offering potential applications in gaining valuable 
business insights, conducting marketing analyses, monitoring criminal activities, and tracking the spread of diseases. 
As future research opportunities unfold, there are several areas for improvement in social network monitoring. The 
integration of natural language processing techniques for sentiment analysis, and the incorporation of more social 
media platforms, can significantly enrich the analysis. Additionally, investigating different types of changes can 
contribute to a better understanding of social network dynamics. Such endeavors have the potential to enhance the 
efficiency of monitoring techniques in various real-world scenarios.

Abstract 
The sustainable transformation of the automobile industry's supply chain is a critical endeavor for achieving both 
environmental conservation and long-term economic growth. This research aims to assess and prioritize national 
policies aimed at fostering a sustainable supply chain within the automobile industry, employing the Multiple Criteria 
Decision Making (MCDM) model. This study proposes an integrated approach that considers a diverse range of 
criteria encompassing environmental impact, economic viability, social equity, and technological innovation, ensuring 
a comprehensive evaluation of policy effectiveness. The methodology comprises three main phases: identification and 
selection of relevant criteria, collection and validation of data from authoritative sources, and the application of the 
MCDM model to rank national policies. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is employed to determine the relative 
importance of criteria, and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is utilized 
to establish policy rankings based on their alignment with the identified criteria. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to 
validate the robustness of the outcomes and to explore the impact of varying criteria weights. The outcomes of this 
study provide a nuanced understanding of the strengths and limitations of prevailing national policies concerning 
sustainable supply chains within the automobile industry. By offering a systematic framework for policy evaluation, 
policymakers are empowered to pinpoint areas for enhancement and make well-informed decisions that harmonize 
with broader sustainability and economic objectives. Furthermore, the proposed MCDM model showcases its efficacy 
as a valuable instrument for addressing intricate, multidimensional policy challenges not confined to the automobile 
sector, thereby fostering evidence-based policy formulation and sustainable progress.

Abstract 
Processes involving creative problem-solving are known to be challenging for distributed teams. To better support 
product development teams working in distributed settings with their creative processes, the positive and negative 
influences on creativity need to be known and understood. This contribution focuses on delivering a broad 
understanding of specifically the barriers to creative problem-solving. To reach this goal a systematic literature review 
was carried out where 418 initial results were found and then systematically broken down to the 49 most relevant 
results. 47 barriers were identified, analyzed and integrating into an impact model that now shows not only success 
factors but also barriers to creativity. With the impact model at hand, targeted support can be created to overcome the 
challenges distributed teams face when it comes to creative processes.

1. Introduction
Product development is nowadays a process that often takes place in a distributed setting. Employees are scattered all 
over the world, forming multinational teams. The flexibility that comes with the distributed work setting as well as 
the opportunities that come with working from home and with international team colleagues are part of the umbrella 
term “New Work” (Helmold 2022). These aspects and many more have an influence on the creative problem-solving 
process of the team (Bastian et al. 2023). Activities for which creativity is needed have been identified as critical 
within distributed product development teams. The distributed setting and especially the communication via technical 
communication assistance instead of face-to-face hinders the joint development of creative ideas (Brucks and Levav 
2022). After the success factors for creativity in distributed product development teams have already been studied in 
depth (Bastian et al. 2023), this paper’s goal is to generate a comprehensive understanding of the barriers to creativity 
in distributed product development. 
1.1 Current Understanding 
1.1.1 Distributed Product Development 
Product development is defined by the VDI as a corporate process for developing a marketable product through an 
interdisciplinary team. Hereby, product development is an iterative process where the initial goals and requirements 
for the product in development are continuously adapted (VDI Verein Deutscher Ingenieure e.V. 2019). Furthermore, 
product development is seen as a dynamic, complex and multi-faceted process where people, a product under 
development, associated processes, knowledge, methods and tools in an organizational, micro- and macroeconomic 
context build the relevant elements (Blessing and Chakrabarti 2009). Therefore, product development is not only 
dependent on the product itself, but many aspects play an important role in supporting product development. 
Product engineering can be seen as the iterative development of three different subsystems (Albers et al. 2011) based 
on the system theory by Ropohl (1975). The system of objects is developed to comply with the objectives that are 
specified in the system of objectives. All the objectives as well as their interrelations are noted within the system of 
objectives. Requirements and boundary conditions are included as well. Within the system of objects, the results (final 
product) and intermediate results (e.g., prototypes) are collected. The system of objects is developed to meet the 
requirements defined in the system of objectives. The operation system consists of the necessary resources. Creativity 
techniques are included within this subsystem, as well as financial resources, computers and technical equipment as

5. Conclusion and Outlook 
It has been shown through the results of the systematic literature review that a variety of barriers to creativity in 
distributed product development exists. These barriers have been collected and explained in chapter 4. Barriers to 
creativity in Distributed Product Development to answer the first research question. The individual barriers are 
described and their inhibiting effect on creativity is explained. The majority of barriers stem from the categories of 
Individual, Team, and Organization. Upon closer examination of the individual factors and descriptions, it becomes 
evident that the categories of Technology, Culture, Leadership, and Time also possess essential barriers, which are 
necessary for a comprehensive understanding, differentiation and gathering of inhibitors of creativity. 
 
The interconnections between the barriers as well as the interconnections between clusters are explained and shown 
in detail in Chapter 4. Barriers to creativity in Distributed Product Development answering research questions two 
and three. The barriers were integrated into the impact model by Bastian et al. (2023) resulting in a graphical 
representation of the entirety of success factors and barriers to creativity and the high number of interconnections. 
  
Since the number of virtual teams keeps on rising (Dekoninck and Brenninkmeijer 2022), the need for further research 
on how to nurture creativity is clear. Clear is also, that the barriers found cannot claim completeness, since barriers 
that are not yet described in literature might be found when collecting data in the field. An example from personal 
experience is an additional barrier concerning language barriers. Language barriers can not only be due to different 
languages themselves but also due to domain-specific language. Furthermore, some barriers consist of different 
aspects and might need to be broken down into multiple barriers after further research. Conducting detailed studies in 
the field is the next step for detailing and developing the impact model further in an iterative process. However, the 
impact model serves as a foundation for future research in the realm of fostering creativity. Especially the category 
culture seems to be an interesting starting point for further studies and for developing additional support for distributed 
product development teams since more and more teams are multicultural and distributed. Finding ways to overcome 
the barriers, especially within this category and to enhance the success factors are also next steps within a follow-up 
study.

Abstract 
This paper focuses on the concepts of Just-in-time, Toyota Production System (TPS), and Lean Operations, which are 
introduced and dealt with in depth. The following key elements must be understood as Kaynak (2002) suggested, the 
origins of JIT in Japan and how it became a method of decreasing inventory levels, JIT has evolved into an extensive 
management philosophy. The main aim of JIT is to generate a feasible competitive advantage by focusing on 
conveying superior performance of goods and services in terms of quality, service, and cost. The aim of the JIT 
philosophy is constantly eliminating waste, production efficiency, and quality of a product. The advantages of JIT 
when effectively executed and limitations of JIT in the supply chain. 
The purpose of the Toyota Production System which is to eradicate through development activities of different kinds 
of waste lying concealed within an organization, Ohno (2013). Toyota can make profits during a recession phase by 
lowering costs through a production system that removes excessive stock and workforce, Liker (2014). This literature 
examines the main objective of this production system and how it creates products, moreover in areas where Japanese 
transformation can be seen, Fullerton & McWatters (2004).

1. Introduction
JIT manufacturing is a Japanese management philosophy developed in the 1970s that is used in production which 
entails acquiring the right items of the correct quality and quantity in the right place and time, Sui Pheng & Joo Chuan 
(2002). JIT includes the implementation of old management ideas, however, their modification to the contemporary 
manufacturing firm is the latest practice, Kaynak (2002). It was first endorsed by Toyota Manufacturing plants by 
Taiichi Ohno, subsequently, after the first introduction of JIT by Toyota many businesses followed up, it eventually 
gained support and many companies started using it, Ohno (2013).

problems by involving them in continuous improvement initiatives and giving them the required training and tools 
(Duhigg, 2016). This encourages a culture of continual development and contributes to the success of the entire 
organisation. 
 
5.7 Quality Boosting 
Integrating lean manufacturing emphasises preventing errors and guaranteeing quality at the beginning of the process. 
The manufacturing sector may improve product quality and customer satisfaction by putting error-proofing procedures 
(poka-yoke) into practice, performing root cause analysis, and giving employees more control over quality. 
 
Organisations can significantly increase productivity, quality, lead times, and customer happiness by applying lean 
manufacturing principles to the manufacturing business. It enables the sector to cut costs, quickly adapt to shifting 
market demands, and foster a culture of constant development. However, a methodical strategy for adoption and 
continuous improvement, commitment, leadership support, and employee involvement is necessary for successful lean 
manufacturing integration. 
 
In the last two decades, the concept of staff participation has changed dramatically with the improved suggestions and 
techniques that are being innovated and used for tool cutting and waste management. The other companies have 
approximated the efficiency of the industry with increased reliance on the tools of total quality management (TQM) 
or the more Japanese forms, such as company-wide quality control (CWQC), the Production System of Toyota, and 
lean manufacturing (TPS).

6. Conclusion 
Five primary elements constitute different aspects needed to support a lean manufacturing program, and the full 
distribution of these elements will drive an organization to a greater path of achieving world-class manufacturing, 
Wang et al., (2011). Manufacturing flow is the feature that conveys physical alterations and design quality that are 
distributed as a segment of the cell. Organization facet deals with the recognition of employees’ functions and roles, 
providing training to employees and lastly communicating. Process controls the feature is aimed at observing, 
controlling, maintaining, and following ways to enhance the process. Metrics addresses perceivable, results-based

performance standards, chosen improvements, and teamwork recognition. Logistics ensures rules and mechanisms for 
the implementation of lean operations are planned and controlled for the flow of material. Each of these elements 
focuses on a certain area of development and capitalizes on the activities, these steps should be followed to ensure 
implementation and success of the lean manufacturing program are not criticized and maximum benefit is achieved, 
Pheng et al., (2002).

Abstract 
The development of a more efficient and effective flow of value in an organization or supply chain has been an 
extensively researched topic in the literature. Value stream mapping (VSM) has stood out as one of the most applied 
methods due to its ease of application and practical comprehension. VSM has also been used as a means to enhance 
the sustainability of value streams. With the emergence of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), disruptive technologies may affect the 
way value streams are designed, leading to more assertive decision-making processes and contributing to enhancing 
sustainability of value streams. Nevertheless, few studies have actually combined I4.0 technologies and VSM to 
concomitantly address the flows of value and energy in an organization. This study aims at proposing a I4.0-based 
Energy-VSM approach. This approach integrates different I4.0 technologies with complementary roles throughout a 
value stream, allowing the real-time assessment of the implications of the decisions in both material and information 
flows over the energy flow. To illustrate our proposition, a case study in a manufacturing company was carried out. 
This company has a solid continuous improvement management system, and more recently it has developed a program 
to undergo the digital transformation fostered by I4.0. This case study enabled the verification of the actual benefits 
and challenges inherent to the proposed approach, raising practical and theoretical contributions to the body of 
knowledge.

Abstract 
This paper aims to consolidate the state of the development and evolution of smart cities in Latin America and their 
contribution to enhancing sustainability following a scoping review. To accomplish that, the journal articles from four 
known databases were captured and analyzed to map the conversations about the topic. Latin America has unique 
characteristics, with high rates of population growth intensified with urban migrations and 81.2% of their residents 
living in urban areas, with unplanned urbanization spread in slums, usually located in mountainous areas, and highly 
stratified, making it one of the biggest challenges for their effects on the environment and people. The common topics 
identified, were mapped under 4 categories:  People & Society, Technology & Innovation, Environment & SDGs, and 
Governance & Infrastructure. The findings highlighted the use of technology to support a smart operation on cities, 
from governance to infrastructure and services for the citizens, and many challenges related to data literacy and 
adoption. Even though the concept of smart cities is not new, in the last years it had an important growth in Latin 
America, leveraged by Covid-19 pandemic, facilitating the adoption of citizens, academia, public and private sectors 
to improve communications and services.

Abstract 
The leagile supply chain (SC) approach, merging lean and agile strategies, has gained traction within the dynamic 
landscape of food manufacturing industries. By combining the efficiency of lean practices with the adaptability of 
agile principles, leagile SCs adeptly handle both regular operations and disruptions. This study explores the 
functioning of leagile SCs in various scenarios, highlighting their efficacy in efficient inventory management and 
rapid response to market changes, i.e., demand surges. Additionally, it discusses potential avenues for future research, 
including technological advancements and sustainable practices, aiming to reshape the food manufacturing SC 
landscape for enhanced industry standards and improved customer experiences.

1. Introduction
In the ever-evolving realm of food manufacturing, the emergence of the leagile (lean and agile) supply chain (SC) 
strategy represents a transformative approach that seamlessly amalgamates the efficiency of lean strategies with the 
adaptability of agile frameworks. As businesses experience both normal operational scenarios and disruptive market 
fluctuations, this hybrid strategy has garnered significant attention for its potential to offer a comprehensive solution 
to the challenges faced by the industry (Ivanov, 2021). This paper studies the importance of the leagile SC, shedding 
light on its principles and impact on food manufacturing companies, while also outlining future avenues for research 
within this dynamic field. The leagile SC strategy finds its roots in the complementary nature of lean and agile 
philosophies. Lean strategies, geared towards minimizing waste and optimizing resources, are adept at streamlining 
production processes in a stable environment (Dolgui et al., 2018). Conversely, agile principles, rooted in flexibility 
and responsiveness, empower businesses to swiftly adapt to unforeseen disruptions. The synthesis of these approaches 
positions leagile SCs as adaptable and efficient, equipping businesses to address both routine demand fluctuations and 
sudden market fluctuations effectively (Chowdhury et al., 2021). 
Two pivotal research questions arise in exploring the leagile SC strategy’s potential and implementation. Firstly, how 
does the integration of postponement and just-in-time inventory strategies contribute to optimizing production 
processes and customer satisfaction in food manufacturing companies? This question delves into how leagile strategies 
align production with real-time demand, leading to reduced lead times, efficient inventory management, and timely 
customer fulfillment. Secondly, as leagile SCs prove their strength and resilience during disruptions, what strategies 
can be harnessed to enhance their effectiveness further? Investigating this question entails exploring cutting-edge 
methodologies like simulation and optimization, which can ensure transparency, traceability, and risk management.  
In the subsequent sections of this paper, we will review the leagile SC strategies, sudden risk and strategies to mitigate 
them along with research gaps and problem statement in section 2, present model formulation and proposed strategies 
in section 3, describe results and discussions in section 4 and conclude with future research directions in section 5.

Table 6. Supply chain costs 
for the disrupted scenario 
 
 
Disrupted scenario 
In a scenario of disruption characterized by a 25% surge in demand, the leagile supply chains of food manufacturers 
efficiently cater to heightened customer needs. This is achieved by strategically utilizing postponement and just-in-
time inventory strategies within their production systems. Amid such disruptions, where retailer demands experience 
sudden spikes, manufacturing facilities swiftly adapt. These facilities convert raw materials sourced from suppliers 
into final products, such as meal boxes, aligning precisely with the escalated demand. Given the perishable nature of 
the food product, inventory management is meticulous, aiming to keep stock levels minimal while accounting for 
safety buffers. The combined approach of postponement and just-in-time inventory management empowers these 
companies to fulfill customer demands quickly. This strategy involves delaying certain customization processes until 
the moment of customer order placement, enhancing responsiveness and curtailing lead times. By harmonizing 
production with real-time demand, manufacturing processes are optimized to align with immediate requisites, 
enhancing customer satisfaction at the cost of elevated total SC costs. For detailed production insights, including 
processed meal box quantities and production costs, see Table 4. Additionally, Table 5 details retailer demand 
fulfillment metrics, offering a comprehensive view of demand fulfillment levels. To grasp overall operational costs in 
the disrupted situation, refer to Table 6, which provides a breakdown of expenses across the entire SC.  
 
Therefore, the leagile supply chain model embraced by food manufacturers excels in addressing disruptions marked 
by demand surges. The strategic application of postponement and just-in-time inventory techniques enables these 
firms to respond effectively to customer needs while refining production procedures and maintaining prudent 
inventory levels. 
 
5. Conclusions and future research directions  
The leagile supply chain emerges as a vital strategy in the dynamic food manufacturing landscape, seamlessly blending 
lean and agile strategies. This helps businesses to navigate normal and disrupted scenarios adeptly. Leagile SCs 
employ postponement and just-in-time inventory strategies in the normal scenario, harmonizing production and 
demand for efficient inventory management, reduced lead times, and timely customer satisfaction. The alignment of 
production processes with orders optimizes resource utilization, embodying lean principles. The true strength of 
leagile SCs shines during disruptions, responding swiftly to a surge in demand. By delaying customization until orders 
are received, companies enhance responsiveness, mitigating risks of stockouts or overstocking. This adaptability 
aligns with agile methodology, fulfilling customer needs without compromising efficiency. Looking forward, future 
research could refine leagile strategies. Advanced data analytics and predictive modeling could enhance demand 
forecasting, enabling proactive decisions. Exploring IoT and blockchain may enhance transparency and traceability, 
improving quality control and risk management. Integrating sustainability into leagile SCs balances lean and agile 
principles with environmental concerns, leading to optimized resource use and reduced waste. Therefore, the leagile 
SC model blends efficiency with adaptability, enabling food manufacturers to tackle routine and unexpected 
challenges. As the industry progresses, refining leagile strategies and embracing technology and sustainability will 
reshape food manufacturing SCs, elevating standards and customer experiences.

Abstract 
The growing complexity of contemporary projects increases the chance that project risks with different natures are 
interrelated through complex cause-effect relationships. However, the effects of risk interdependencies and dynamic 
risk propagations are often ignored in previous project risk management studies, leading to inconsistent risk 
assessment results with engineering practice and reduced efficacy of risk treatment actions. This research proposes an 
intelligent decision support system (DSS) to determine an effective portfolio of risk treatment actions by considering 
complex risk interdependencies and project resource constraints. First, a hierarchical project risk interdependency 
network (RIN) is developed systematically based on the interpretive structural modelling process, where all possible 
cause-effect interdependencies among project risks are presented. Then, a Monte Carlo simulation (MCS)-based RIN 
model is devised to prioritise project risks and evaluate the overall project risk level, where the stochastic behaviour 
of risk occurrence and risk propagation effects within a project RIN are captured. Subsequently, a bi-objective risk 
treatment optimisation model is proposed considering limited project resources, aiming to minimise not only the 
project loss due to risk but also the risk treatment cost. To obtain a set of Pareto-optimal risk treatment solutions, the 
non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II is tailored by integrating with the MCS-based RIN model. A case study is 
provided to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed DSS for project risk treatment decision-making. The findings 
from this work help project decision-makers allocate risk treatment budgets more appropriately and determine the

Abstract 
This study formulates a cooking scheduling optimization problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. This 
study seeks schedules for mass cooking of more than 100 servings. Steam convection ovens which can cook multiple 
dishes in large quantities are used in high-volume cooking facilities. Previous studies have proposed a formulation 
that applies a flexible job shop scheduling problem. They have not been able to determine the processing machinery 
for each process. In addition, there is no constraint to prevent contamination. Therefore, realistic schedules were not 
obtained. In many developed countries, sanitation control based on HACCP is mandatory. A cooking facility consists 
of two main areas. They are contaminated areas and uncontaminated areas. The former is an area where meat and fish 
are processed prior to heating. The latter is an area where heat treatment and food cutting are performed. Bacteria can 
spread throughout cooking facilities when they adhere to the floor and cooks' shoes. Therefore, cooks should take an 
air shower and change shoes when moving between the two areas. Three constraints must be considered when cooking 
in large quantities with cooks and machines. First, all cooks must move in only one direction between contaminated 
work areas and non-contaminated work areas. Cross contamination can be prevented by moving these areas in only 
one direction. Second, works on steam convection ovens must be started after preheating is complete. It takes more 
time to lower the temperature in steam convection ovens than to raise it. Preheating time can be reduced by working 
in a sequence of gradually increasing heating temperatures. Cook's workload can be reduced by working as many jobs 
as possible on a steam convection oven at the same time. Unit time is a discrete value of one minute. Third, when 
several cooks work on the same task, they must start at the same time. We seek optimal cooking schedules given the 
number of cooks and machines, the type of machine, and recipes for multiple dishes. A directed acyclic graph called 
a DAG is created by using arcs to connect processes that have priority relationships within a recipe. Within a DAG, a 
job is defined as a set of the nodes with a fixed antecedent relationship. There are pairs of precedence relationships 
between the processes of two different jobs. This information is used to create a constraint equation that adhere to the 
preceding relationship. The purpose of the formulation is to minimize the start time difference between processes 
working on steam convection in addition to the makespan. There are two things to decide in this problem. The first is 
the order in which jobs are worked on each machine. The second is the assignment of processing machines to each 
process.Numerical experiments were conducted on several example problems. As a result, we succeeded in obtaining 
exact solutions for small-scale problems. In the future, we will receive evaluations from workers at cooking facilities. 
In addition, we will make improvements based on them.

Video Based Work Instructions (VWI) and its Role in 
Improving Employee Training, Cross Training, And 
Productivity in Small and Medium Manufacturing

Abstract 
One of the biggest challenges facing small and medium manufacturers in today’s economic environment is the 
recruitment and retention of talent across all functions in an organization. It is extremely challenging to find and keep 
shop floor associates as welders, painters, machinists, and assemblers. Even if an organization can hire skilled 
personnel, training them on specialized equipment and work practices takes a lot of effort and time. Work instructions 
(WI) or standard operating procedures (SOP) are a set of instructions that enumerate all the steps and activities required 
to complete a job. Traditional WI or SOP suffer from many disadvantages: they are hard to control, difficult to 
understand in many situations, time consuming to create and maintain, and do not capture the tacit knowledge of 
trained employees effectively. To overcome the challenges posed by regular SOP, a new way of creating them has 
gained traction in the last few years called Video Work Instructions (VWI). In this approach, a video of the 
manufacturing process is taken while the operation is being carried out. The video is later edited to include the work 
instruction in the frames during the actual operation. In this project, VWI was created for a medium manufacturer in 
Southern MN for welding and assembly processes. The VWI was later used in employee training and cross training. 
It was found that there was a reduction of the new employee training period by approximately 50% and a productivity 
increase by approximately 12%. This paper will talk about the advantages and challenges associated with such an 
approach.

1. Introduction
One of the biggest challenges facing small and medium manufacturers in today’s economic environment is the 
recruitment and retention of talent across all functions in the organization. It is extremely challenging to find and keep 
shop floor associates such as welders, painters, CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machinists, and assemblers. Even 
if an organization can hire skilled personnel, training them on their specialized equipment and work practices takes a 
lot of effort and time. Training period can vary from a few hours to months depending on the complexity of the task. 
The problem is compounded by the fact that a significant percent of knowledge in these jobs is tacit (internal to the 
trained employee) in nature and is difficult to transfer to a new person. The aging pop population of skilled machinists, 
welders, and other machine operators who will be retiring soon has ended this problem. Many of the small and medium 
manufacturing enterprises also operate as job shops and deal with high mix low volume production. This arrangement 
forces them to move shop floor employees among varied tasks depending on the needs of the product and production 
schedule. Hence, both employee training and cross training are crucial in the success of this industry.  
2. Problem Description
There are several methods used for new employee training and existing employee cross training in the manufacturing 
industry. These methods include job shadowing, standard work instructions, seminars, and hands on training. These 
methods rely on the existing knowledge of the trainee and are either time-consuming or cost prohibitive or both. There 
are a lot of benefits to both employer and employees but there are also disadvantages and concerns for employers in

Overall findings of this study showed a positive outcome for the organization where the VWIs were implemented for 
manufacturing operations. Instead of it being a one-time event, this study took a form of an ongoing continual 
improvement where other areas in the manufacturing shop floor learned from early adopters of the new training 
methodology (VWI) and continued developing their own VWIs based on what worked based for their areas.  
 
6. Discussion and Conclusion 
The traditional form of written SOPs has outlived their usefulness on the modern shop floor. Today the shop floors 
have computer terminals attached to each machine and the operators and employees have access to tablets and 
smartphones which can be leveraged for better learning and analysis of operations. In these times, it is important to 
evolve the current practices of standard operations and introduce modern technologies which are easier to implement 
and use in day-to-day operations. Digitization in the training methods is showing a lot of demand in many sectors. For 
example, Bonnes et al. (2020) showed that trainers who attended a course in digital media had higher media-didactical 
competence and media-didactical self-efficacy scores and used digital media more often in training.  
 
Key to the success of many companies in today’s competitive economy is also the implementation of lean 
manufacturing principles which support standardization and use of advanced technologies to reduce waste and 
variations. Companies that have implemented lean manufacturing principles have also reported the knowledge-related 
issues as one of the barriers of success which goes back to simplified training methods (Abu et al., 2019). Stanica and 
Peydro (2016) also found that use of modern cross-training methods aligned as a lean tool has a positive effect on the 
knowledge transfer process within the organizations. Cross-training methods used as a lean tool can help broaden the 
knowledge and the competences of employees and can help companies manage tacit knowledge in the long run. How 
knowledge transfer is happening in an organization plays a key role in an organization's long-term success (Argote & 
Ingram, 2000). Not all lean organizations have achieved the expected results due to many issues such as cultural 
readiness of the organization, employee training, and continuous improvement techniques that are not compatible with 
the organization’s preexisting processes, and programs. Sometimes organizations discount the benefit of training for 
a particular job or for a continuous improvement program in a smaller scale and simplified way such as using modern 
technologies such as VWIs. In other words, companies sometimes complicate the training method by overusing 
technology instead of simplifying it (Biortolotti, Boscari & Danese, 2015).

By converting the traditional methods of training based mostly on paper-based SOPs to video-based work instructions, 
a lot of issues which plague a shop floor can be elevated. In this study, the VWIs were used to train the employees on 
different operations and the effectiveness of this new technique was measured. VWI not only improves productivity 
but helps the employees be trained easier and faster. This technique is easier to implement and can be a source of 
continuous improvement for the plant.

Abstract 
In this research the problem is the generation of wastage in the home dispatch (HD) process and in the reverse 
logistics of a retail sector company, so its main objective will be to reduce them. The DMAIC methodology was 
used for process improvement. The engineering tools used correspond to Lean Six Sigma such as process 
standardization and Poka Yoke. After simulating the improvement proposal with the Arena software, the main 
results obtained were, at 95% confidence, the reduction in the number of reentries, wastage, and absenteeism, as 
evidenced by the decrease in the confidence interval limits. For the quantity of reentries indicator, the simulated 
improvement yields a confidence interval of [43.7081 ; 49.8239] units of product re-entered, resulting in values 
lower than those obtained in the current situation, according to its confidence interval [99.7428 ; 111.3172] units 
of product re-entered. For the quantity of wastage indicator, the simulated improvement yields an approximate 
confidence interval of [6.3968 ; 8.8032] units of product wasted, resulting in lower values than those obtained in 
the current situation, according to its confidence interval [21.4576 ; 25.8744] units of product wasted. For the 
number of absent customers indicator, the simulated improvement yields an approximate confidence interval of 
[2.5717 ; 4.0949] absent customers, resulting in values lower than those obtained in the current situation, 
according to its confidence interval [31.1758 ; 37.1562] absent customers.

1. Introduction
Shrinkage in the home dispatch process represents a loss for any company, not only because it represents lost 
sales, but also because the customer goes through a bad experience and, if it cannot be declared an expense, it 
would also become an economic loss (Donderis et al., 2019). Nowadays, all consumers live in an omnichannel 
environment, using both online and offline channels to shop. The result is an increase in shipments to customers' 
homes, driving companies to improve their freight systems, making them more efficient and sustainable (Buldeo 
et al., 2019). Due to the recent omnichannel boom, the current freight systems of companies that ship products 
directly to the customer's home are still in the process of optimization. This generates customer dissatisfaction 
due to failures of the system itself, causing a high number of product returns to the DC’s inventory. These returns 
imply a greater handling of the product, which increases the probability that it will be damaged, generating losses 
when it turns into shrinkage. Considering that most processes generate shrinkage or defective products, it is of 
great importance for companies to look for ways to reduce these losses, thus improving their productivity 
(Donderis et al., 2019). 
In the same way, the processes involved in home dispatch consume resources such as processing time (H-H), the 
material that was used in packaging and shipping, etc. If to this is added the wastage generated, it results in a 
significant cost. In addition, waste contributes to environmental pollution, as it is part of the company's solid 
waste. Currently, a major problem of concern to society is pollution, which, in turn, is one of the various causes 
of climate change. The latter has negative effects such as global warming, rising sea levels, adverse effects on 
various resources, among others (Condori, J. et al., 2022, p. 1). Given that pollution is the beginning of several 
environmental problems, it is important to mitigate its causes, such as the generation and inadequate management 
of solid waste. The lack of knowledge about the care of the ecosystem and the effects of its deterioration have 
aggravated this problem, since people tend to prioritize their own economic benefit before environmental welfare 
(Delgado et al., 2021, p. 614).  
1.1. Objectives 
The general objective of the research is to reduce the waste generated in the HD process in a retail sector company.

confirmation in the dispatch scheduling method, were related to the Methods factor of the cause-effect analysis. 
In addition, specific improvements were proposed for the mentioned causes, which were the implementation of 
the confirmation call in the scheduling process and the standardization of the loading method. As a result, it has 
been demonstrated that, at 95% confidence, the proposed improvement achieved a reduction in the number of 
reentries, wastage, and absenteeism, as evidenced by the decrease in the confidence interval limits. This fulfills 
the objective of the research by reducing the amount of waste generated in the process. If the company decided to 
adopt the proposed improvements, it would be able to reduce the number of reentries, the shrinkage generated, 
and the number of customers absent during home dispatch. The reduction in shrinkage would result in a reduction 
in the resulting economic loss and the improvement in the scheduling method would reduce the unnecessary 
handling of those products that the customer could not receive due to their absence, which would also reduce 
possible losses due to shrinkage that could be generated during the unnecessary trip and would improve customer 
satisfaction. 
During the development of the research there were certain limitations, one of them being the lack of accessibility 
to carry out a pilot since the operation of the company cannot be stopped or hindered because it would affect the 
level of service. Despite this, the simulation was a useful alternative to obtain consistent results in the study. 
Another limitation was the lack of data standardization of the different company databases. An example of this is 
the database for receiving readmissions, since the reasons for readmissions did not have a standard name, as 
defined in the reasons for claims, but a description made by the person in charge of entering the information into 
the system, and this had to be standardized manually. Finally, another limitation was the existence of atypical 
periods identified in the data, which did not allow a direct analysis without the need to smooth the times 
corresponding to these periods. For future research, it is recommended to strengthen the optimization model, 
taking into account the detail of the logistic variables of the SKUs such as volume, exact dimensions, weights of 
each unit, as well as to perform a more in-depth analysis by families or SKUs, considering the frequency of 
purchase. In addition, it is suggested to explore the possibility of implementing small shelves or racks inside the 
trucks that will be delivered to the customer's home, so that the products do not suffer damage in transit and are 
better secured to the structure. Likewise, this study does not consider the variability of travel times within the city, 
so it would be convenient to take this aspect into account in future research. Likewise, it would be a great 
contribution to consider route optimization as a complement to the improvement to be proposed. Finally, if 
possible, it is suggested to carry out a pilot that could complement the results of a simulation of the optimization 
model to be proposed.

Abstract 
With the engagement of advanced technology in the civil engineering industry, automation and prefabrication of 
fixed assets is in huge demand Fixed assets stand as integral components for the operational efficacy of firms, 
which in return helps in the growth of that whole industry. The primary objective of this study is to find the 
determinants of investment in Fixed Assets in the Construction Industry. The study has considered five 
construction companies selected on the basis of their age, profitability and paid-up capital. The stepwise multiple 
regression models; addition model, constant model, and elimination model, have been employed to analyze and 
check the robustness of the results. The study results align with empirical findings, highlighting the significance 
of profit in business investment choices. The Stock of Net Liquidity plays a more important role in the investment, 
followed by Gross Internal Funds and Change in Sales. Retained earnings impact investments, while dividends 
influence external funding inflow, and earnings affect dividends. Profits have direct and indirect effects on 
investments through retained earnings and external finance. It's essential to balance dividend pay-outs to safeguard 
substantial profits, given the substantial role retained earnings play in investment decisions. The novelty of this 
study will provide valuable insights to understand how to control various factors in order to increase fixed assets 
through investments and in return, grow the firm.

1. Introduction
In the past, there has been considerable interest in many sectors over the level of growth of larger firms in terms 
of increased fixed assets, sales, and profits. This research is limited to the expansion of net fixed assets. Given the 
preceding discussion, it is critical to understand the variables responsible for the expansion of fixed assets and 
plant and machinery separately. India is witnessing rapid financial development now, with numerous investments 
being made in the nation's infrastructure to further its general development. The main factors influencing the 
development of the Indian construction industry include rising productivity and efficiency, giving the sector 
structure and pattern, offering transparency and a better image of the business, modernization, and increased 
competition.(Auti and Skitmore 2008) 
More than 50 million individuals work solely in the construction industry. Includes building, real estate and non-
residential structures in the commercial and industrial sectors as well as infrastructural assets (Singla and Prakash 
2021). The building industry's contribution to the expansion of manufacturing is a distinctive trait. Over the last 
five years, the industry has expanded by an average of 5.2%. However, India's industry is highly fragmented, with 
both listed and unlisted companies present (Behera et al. 2015).

5. Results and Discussion 
The elimination model outperformed rest two models while explaining the behaviour pattern of investment of 
plant and machinery separately and total fixed assets when plant and machinery included. Results obtained from 
the analysis suggest that the Stock of Net Liquidity plays a more important role in the investment in almost all the 
companies in this study. Gross Internal Funds (retained earnings + depreciation), and Change in Sales are the 
second most significant determinants of fixed investment in the present study. The current study's findings imply 
that profit-making is an important part in business investment decisions. Retained earnings and dividend policies 
are influenced by the firm's profits. Retained earnings have an impact on investment. Dividends have an impact 
on the flow of external funding, while earnings have an impact on dividends. External finances also have an impact 
on investment. Profits influence investment both directly and indirectly through retained earnings and outside 
finance. It is crucial to ensure that higher profitability is not lost through dividend payments because retained 
earnings play a significant role in investment decision-making. It could be preferable to support asset expansion 
through internal savings against borrowing since self-financing is not inflationary. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In the past, there has been considerable interest in many sectors over the level of growth of larger firms in terms 
of increased fixed assets, sales, and profits. This research is limited to the expansion of net fixed assets. Given the 
preceding discussion, it is critical to understand the variables responsible for the expansion of fixed assets and 
plant and machinery separately. Through this study, an attempt was made to analyse the fixed investment pattern 
of the construction industry of India. To perform this study, five construction companies and six years of study 
period have been fixed. To find the best model, which determines the investment behaviour in fixed assets, a 
statistical method is used. Observing the financial statement and various literature related to the topic, notable 
variables are selected to perform the required analysis. After completion of calculation and analysis, one can say 
that Stock of Net Liquidity, Gross Internal Funds and Change in Sales are the determinants, which will impart 
high influence in investment policy-making to increase the Fixed Assets in selected firms. These three variables 
are found to be significant in almost every firm and Construction Industry considered as a whole.  
 
7. Limitations of the study 
1. The firms selected are from Indian Construction Industry, so the results are limited for implementation in 
Indian Construction Industry. 
2. There are many packages available to perform statistical analysis in this study. Selecting the right package 
is necessary to perform statistical calculations.

Abstract 
Bell crank is a kind of lever which is used to alter the course of the movement. It is exposed to huge stress but designing 
it with heavier mass creates the requirement of heavier actuation. In the present study, the basic design of the bell 
crank was modelled in CAD software. Four generally used materials for bell crank (1060 alloy steel, Al Bronze, 
AISI4130 mild steel, nodular cast iron) were used in the design. The stress in the bell crank during operation was 
measured using solidworks software. Based on the stress distribution in the bell crank, the Solid Isotropic Material 
with Penalization method was utilized to optimize the shape of bell crank. The manufacturing constraints were also 
considered during optimization. Using the topology optimization algorithm, fifty percentage of mass was reduced 
without compromising the weight to stiffness ratio of the bell crank. The material was removed within the boundary 
of the standard bell crank. The linear static loading was assumed to identify the optimal locations for material removal. 
Among the materials that are utilized, the nodular cast iron is best for the shape optimization although all four materials 
can be used to reduce fifty percentage of the material from standard bell crank. Except the alloy steel, all three materials 
have further room for optimization but due to its low density compared to other three, alloy steel is preferred material 
for the bell crank.

1. Introduction
Bell crank lever is a rectangular L shaped crank which is fixed at the point of intersection of the two arms by a pivot 
joint. This crank is used to change the motion through an angle. The change of angle can be anywhere from zero to 
360 degrees. Bell cranks found their applications in automotive and aircrafts. These industries have huge cost 
operation in terms of fuel consumption. The reduction of the fuel consumption can be achieved by reducing the load 
on the vehicles. The reduction of the weight can be achieved by optimizing the shape and geometry of the components. 
The optimization of structural shape can be for safety like in seismic proof structures (Zakian and Kaveh 2023) and 
for fuel savings in automotives. The reduction of the material by optimizing the shape can lead to complex geometries 
which are difficult to manufacture (Sowjanya et al. 2021). The research to create simple but optimized geometries that 
can reduce the weight of the existing components is of high interest (Fornace 2006). 
The brake pedal and the bell crank are similar products that can be optimized for the shape and topology (Dange et al. 
2014, Patil and Patil 2017). The bell cranks are generally optimized for lowest weight that can carry without damage 
while the brake pedal is optimized for the maximum stiffness and strength. The optimised bell crank weighs 
approximately one hundred and forty grams less than the current design, resulting in a fifty nine percent decrease in 
component weight. This optimization was done by reducing the weight by material removal from the components low

Figure 3. The bell crank after material removal of (a) 10%, (b) 20%, (c) 30%, (d) 40%, (e) 50% and (f) 60%. 
 
The bell crank was unsustainable after 60% of its material was removed. The material removal shown in the above 
figure has been done by considering the manufacturing constraints. All the material removal can be done on a simple 
milling machine. The comparison between the initial mass and the final mass of the bell crank is shown in Figure 4. 
The initial weight is the weight of the bell crank without any optimization and the final weight of the bell crank is 
50% removal of material with manufacturing constraints added. The weight should be half of the initial weight if 50 
% of the material was removed, but, as some parts are difficult to machine those parts were kept as is. 
 
 
Figure 4. Comparison of initial and final weights of the bell crank 
 
From the results, it was observed that the nodular cast iron can have highest performance with maximum stress in the 
optimized bell crank of 25.2 MPa while its yield strength is 562 MPa. This amounts to the factor of safety of nearly 
20. When compared to the 1060 Alloy aluminium, its factor of safety is near to one. If the weight of the bell crank is 
considered, the 1060 alloy aluminium has almost 67% less weight of that of nodular cast iron. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In the current study, a standard bell crank was designed in solid works with four different materials. These bell cranks 
were then studied for the stress distribution. Based on the stress distribution, the areas with low stress were removed 
to reduce the weight. The removed zones were then finished to make the material removal manufacturing friendly. 
The conclusions of this study are 
 
• 
1060 Alloy aluminium-based crank have less weight after optimization compared to other three materials. 
The weight of the 1060 alloy aluminium is 67% lower than the weight of nodular cast iron.

•
The nodular cast iron has potential for further removal of the material but the manufacturing is harder for
further material removal. The optimized nodular cast iron bell crank is more than 20 times safer than the
1060 alloy aluminium.
•
This type of shape optimization helps in reduction of the weight of the machine components with out reducing
the strength of the components. In the present study the final weight of the component reduced by 25 to 30
% from the initial weight.
•
The weight reduction can help reduce the material usage and the fuel consumption of the automobile.

Abstract 
""Bento"" is widely known as a part of Japanese food culture. There are many companies in Japan that produce thousands 
of bento every day. In recent years, the market for the catering bento industry has been expanding, and the demand 
for catering bento has been increasing. Catering bento companies seek to automate demand forecasting. The 
forecasters in the field forecast demand based on their intuition and experience. However, it is difficult for unskilled 
workers to make accurate demand forecasts. It is important to take into account the popularity of bento in order to 
forecast demand with a high degree of accuracy. In a previous study, MCMC sampling was used to estimate the 
popularity of bento. Specifically, based on past data on unit sales of bento, the number of sales of two products were 
compared to estimate which product was more popular. The problem with the popularity estimation in the previous 
study is that the popularity estimation is partially done manually by humans. The objective of this study is to automate 
the estimation of the popularity of bento. The novelty of this study is that products with similar popularity are grouped 
together based on an assumption. The assumption is that the popularity of bento is determined by the words in the 
product name and the characteristics of the dish. The new popularity estimation method is to calculate cosine similarity 
using four element groups and to group products with similar popularity by hierarchical clustering. The four element 
groups are dish name, dish category, cooking method, and the number of units sold. The popularity of the bento is 
estimated by MCMC sampling. To test the usefulness of the new popularity estimation method, we construct a demand 
forecasting model that takes into account the popularity of bento estimated by the new method. The forecasting 
accuracy of the proposed model and that of the conventional model are compared. The popularity of bento proposed 
in this study is used in the proposed model. The popularity of bento proposed in the previous study is used in the 
conventional model. The method used in the demand forecasting model is a gradient boosting decision tree. The 
features used in the demand forecasting model are the predicted total number of units sold on the forecast day, the 
temperature, the popularity of the bento, and the number of bento sold in the past. A numerical experiment was 
conducted using data provided by a bento manufacturing-sales company which manufactures and sells more than 
10,000 catered bento per day. The company sells three types of bento, including daily bento, rice bowl bento and 
noodle bento. In the accuracy comparison using actual data, the proposed model and the conventional model had the 
same level of prediction accuracy. Thus, we conclude that the popularity of bento could be automatically estimated.

Abstract 
According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, school 
lunch is provided in approximately 98.5% of public elementary schools in Japan. Each region has different rules 
regarding the kinds of dishes and ingredients provided in school lunch menus and the frequency of serving dishes and 
ingredients. It is time-consuming and labor-intensive for menu planners to prepare menus when manually adapting 
them to the actual conditions of each region. As a result, the workload of menu planners and nutrition teachers is high. 
In the field of school lunch menu planning, the menu planning systems are needed to support nutrition teachers. The 
menu creation process is time-consuming and labor-intensive because there are many constraints to be taken into 
account, such as nutritional intake standards, ingredient costs, and cooking time. In Japan, the intake of 13 nutrients 
is determined according to the School Meal Intake Standards established by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, 
Science and Technology. Therefore, when preparing menus, it is necessary to keep within the upper and lower limits 
of the standard's intake. Numerous studies have been conducted on automatic menu planning systems for school lunch 
programs. For example, some studies have been conducted on budgets and coloring of dishes, as well as studies that 
focus on the diversity of ingredients and flavors by calculating the similarity between dishes or ingredients. All of 
these studies have been formulated as combinatorial optimization problems and have proposed automatic menu 
creation models. However, it takes a lot of time and effort to reflect the actual situation of each region in the automatic 
menu creation model. In these previous studies, the engineers who proposed the menu planning model interviewed 
nutrition teachers who work in the menu development field many times. After the interviews, they manually modify 
the proposed model based on the feedback they received. Specifically, they manually calculate the frequency of 
serving dishes and ingredients and generate constraints. They have done this work many times to improve the 
automatic menu creation model. In this study, we propose an automatic menu creation model for school lunch that 
automatically reflects the actual conditions of each region regarding the frequency of serving dishes and ingredients. 
We aim to propose a menu creation model that can be used in school lunch programs in elementary and junior high 
schools throughout Japan. First, morphological analysis is used to segment the dishes and ingredients in the daily 
menu into meaningful words such as nouns and adjectives, and to automatically calculate the frequency of serving the 
dishes and ingredients during a month. Next, we use the results of the calculation to construct an algorithm that 
automatically adds constraints to the mathematical optimization problem. As a result of the analysis using actual data 
from school lunch menus, we succeeded in automatically calculating the frequency of serving dishes and ingredients, 
and generating an algorithm for automatically adding constraints.

Lack of Downstream Processing in the Agriculture Sector in 
Papua New Guinea 
Sandy Stephen and Stephanie Laki 
Year 3 Undergraduate, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Papua New Guinea University 
of Technology, Lae, MP411, Papua New Guinea 
Abstract 
Papua New Guinea (PNG) is part of the second largest island in the world situated in the Pacific Ocean. This 
developing nation is rich in many resources from renewable to non-renewable resources, however the act of 
downstream processing for the country’s income is still an issue as it is lacking. Therefore, the 2023 Papua New 
Guinea University of Technology (PNGUOT) Industrial Engineering and Operations Management Student Chapter 
has taken up the initiative to emphasize on lack of downstream processing in other significant resource extraction 
sectors in PNG, which in this case is the Agriculture Sector. PNG has surplus agricultural crops and livestock, 
however, there is a lack of PNG owned companies that can carry out downstream processing, that can allow income 
to be generated from the exported finished products in the agriculture sector. This paper focuses on investigating the 
condition and presenting factual information on the condition and recommendations that could be implemented to 
rectify the lack of downstream processing in PNG. 
Keywords 
Agriculture, downstream, processing, and resources. 
1. Introduction
On the month of March, 2023, Papua New Guineans all throughout the nation encountered a situation regarding 
downstream processing in the mining industry that caused an uproar and has come to the attention of many students. 
There are so many sectors that can be looked into when downstream processing is discussed, narrowing it down to the 
Agricultural sector will help to emphasize on this sectors importance apart from the many other sectors experiencing 
lack of downstream processing in PNG. Agriculture is defined as “the art and science of cultivating soil, growing 
crops and raising livestock” (McDaniel, et al., 2023) and is one of the most rewarding and much needed field 
throughout the world as every physical being requires food products to sustain life. PNG has many small-scale 
businesses and markets where the agriculture sector is thriving, but more can be done. 
At the moment, there is a significant lack of downstream processing businesses in the country that is hundred percent 
PNG owned, where fresh agricultural crops and livestock can be produced, developed and exported out to other 
countries for commercial and economic reasons.  By the production of this paper, the Student Chapter hopes to bring 
awareness across on the effect of the downstream processing operations in PNG and how it is being managed and its 
contributions to the country as a whole with factual information.  
2. Literature Review
To define downstream processing, it involves the procedures for the recovery and purification for the final products 
of interest (Fan & Chen, 2007). In this case, the products of interest include agricultural crops such as coffee beans 
and livestock, fisheries, wood, fibers and many more. These raw materials are needed not only for satisfying biological 
and physical needs but can also contribute to creation of more local businesses, increase in jobs, country’s economic 
growth and development. Basically, apart from the human needs being provided, it can immensely contribute from a 
commercial and economic point of view because agriculture plays a dominant role nationwide. 
Papua New Guinea has fertile soils and favorable climate and ecosystems for animals and plants from the highlands 
to the islands. Traditional extraction methods such as farming and hunting has been done for decades and centuries as 
a way to sustain life, however, with globalization and development, people are able to further improve living with 
agricultural technology. At the moment, the main agricultural exports of the country include cocoa, coffee, copra, 
palm oil, rubber and tea and not only that PNG also accommodates extensive and valuable marine resources (Price 
230","Proceedings of the Second Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Melbourne, Australia, November 14-16, 2023 
processing and other value adding innovations” (PNG Business News, 2022). From this statement it can go on to 
prove that there is definitely a lack of downstream processing within the country especially in agriculture.  
 
5.4 Proposed Improvements 
Giving more attention to improving the lack of downstream processing will be beneficial in the following ways along 
with all the aforementioned benefits: 
• 
Creates added value to agricultural resources and the economy 
• 
Create more job and income-earning opportunities for thousands of unemployed citizens 
• 
Helps reduce inflation and over pricing of store-bought products, lowering the economy’s vulnerability to 
effects of fluctuations in international commodities that have been processed downstream and sold as a 
finished product back to the country 
• 
Diversified and increased food production that can cater for the country’s growing population  
Listed above are just some of the main and most important factors that can help grow PNG’s economy and improve 
the livelihood of thousands of Papua New Guineans. In recent years the government has come to realize that vital 
nature of promoting downstream processing of certain commodities and therefore, have set policies in place. These 
policies are aimed at promoting greater downstream and domestic food processing, however, factors such as land use 
and increased cost in processing raw materials, negate the promotion of downstream processing. This is where the 
nation’s Department of Commerce and Industry comes into play to formulate, coordinate, implement and monitor 
policies that provide a conducive economic environment, promoting international competitiveness and achieving the 
Governments goals. So far, the Government has been proactive in encouraging downstream production, as stated by 
PNG’s Prime Minister James Marape, “We are focused on downstream processing as far s going forward is concerned 
instead of exporting raw products, we want to go downstream to satisfy our local markets as well as to export to 
economies around us” (PNG Business News, 2021). Therefore, there are certainly improvements on the way to 
promote downstream processing in PNG’s growing nation. 
One of these improvements include the government launching the National Agriculture Development Plan (NADP) 
early in 2007. This plan is ambitious and broad with the vision of overcoming various obstacles in the agricultural 
sector. The key area’s for NADP included research and technical services, food and horticulture, tree and industrial 
crops, livestock, apiculture and aquaculture, spices and strengthening the NADP management (Department of 
Treasury, 2008). Also, apart from the NADP, the government seeks to increase the value of exports by PNG’s 
manufacturing sector, focusing on the downstream processing or raw materials from the extractive industries. The 
strategy is to remain commercially driven and to target PNG’s areas of current and emerging competitive strength 
such as the palm oil industry.  
 
5.5 Recommendations 
Some of the recommendations that can be made to improve the lack of downstream processing, starts from small 
efforts that will create a bigger impact include intellectuals and leaders of the country taking up the initiative to 
enhance the skills of country men and women, start local PNG owned businesses that create downstream products, 
investing into the industrial and technological facilities, proper maintenance of downstream processing facilities, 
promoting local finished products on a global platform and most importantly emphasizing and promoting the 
downstream processing of the agricultural sector, which is by far the most prestigious. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Lack of downstream processing in PNG is an issue that affecting the economy of this country. It is a serious issue that 
cannot be ignored, if government would want to improve its economy and the citizens of its citizens. The government 
has to work on to implement the necessary facilities and infrastructures that will aid and improve the processing of its 
agricultural produce. This is by ensuring that proper basic services such as roads, bridges, electricity, water, etc. are 
provided to accommodate for processing of its raw produce. And also, by creating processing factories and market 
opportunities in the country will enable minimizing the issue. Two classical examples of lack of downstream 
processing in the coffee and palm oil has been explained by providing challenges and the proposed improvements. 
Therefore, this will in turn improve the livelihoods of the local citizens and also the economy of the country.

Abstract 
In the healthcare field, workload management is important because the workload of healthcare professionals such as 
nurses affects the safety and quality of treatment and care for patients. However, changing circumstances surrounding 
operations are inevitable in healthcare, and workloads change from time to time in response to changing 
circumstances. Therefore, management is required to accommodate such changes. For this purpose, it is necessary to 
predict the workload in real time based on various factors such as the state of workers under changing conditions and 
reflect this in management, but no method has been established to predict the workload in healthcare in real time in 
response to changing conditions. Therefore, in this study, focusing on the development of Internet of Things (IoT) 
technologies, we conducted a simulation experiment in a simulated ward environment and acquired data that could be 
acquired by wearable devices available in real time to analyze the workload change during tasks. Several indicators 
showed a significant main effect on workload (p < 0.01), suggesting that multiple indicators of patient and ward 
conditions can be obtained in real time are effective in the evaluation of workload.

For the ward information, Table 3 shows the role of participants in the ward and the WWL scores. Although the 
standard deviation is relatively large from one-way ANOVA, the main effect of the role of participants was significant 
(F (2, 1450) = 15.4, p < 0.01). The mean of the WWL score tended to be higher in the two patients case than in the 
one patient case, and the mean of the WWL score tended to be even higher in the leader case. The higher workload of 
the leader may be attributed to the physical workload of assisting other participants as well as the mental workload of 
managing the ward. The result suggested that the indicator related to the number of treatment and care tasks was 
associated with increasing workload levels, suggesting that situational factors such as the number of patients also 
influence workload.

The above results suggest that information on participants (healthcare professionals), patients, and wards, which could 
be obtained in real time using IoT devices during the task, is sufficiently effective for workload prediction, and that 
these measurable indicators could be expected application to visualize individual workloads in real time by using them 
in a comprehensive manner. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In this study, a simulation experiment was conducted in a simulated hospital ward environment to analyze workloads 
in healthcare aiming at applying for measuring and visualizing workload in real time. Each of the information on 
workers, patients, and wards conditions, measured during the experiment showed a certain relationship with the 
workload variation. It was suggested that the indicators obtained in real time using a wearable device are sufficiently 
effective for workload prediction, and it is expected that such devices will be used to support by using data related to 
healthcare professionals.

Abstract 
Shorter innovation cycles and an increase in market demands and regulations force companies to change the way they 
work. Especially in engineering, several departments are closely working together to achieve a company’s goals and 
increase its innovation potential. Studies show, that knowledge has a positive effect on the operational performance 
of a company and product innovation. Therefore, it is necessary to manage knowledge effectively and efficiently. 
Several approaches and models already describe how knowledge management could be realized. Some focus on 
knowledge transfer as part of knowledge management but rarely describe how to support the improvement of 
knowledge transfers in product and production engineering. Therefore, the InKTI – Interdepartmental Knowledge 
Transfer Improvement method was developed to support the improvement of knowledge transfers (in terms of speed 
and quality) in product and production engineering. This method has been applied in a field study. The findings and 
improvement potentials have been considered in the further development of the method. This paper contributes to the 
continuous validation of the InKTI method through a second field study at the company Witzenmann GmbH 
(Witzenmann), which is a world market leader in the area of flexible metal elements. The research need is to improve 
knowledge transfers at Witzenmann. Based on this, a concept for the validation of the InKTI method at Witzenmann 
is developed and implemented. Lastly, the results and findings of the first and second validation studies are compared.

1. Introduction
To become an innovation, an invention needs to satisfy a demand situation in the market and successfully penetrate 
the market (Albers, Heimicke, et al. 2018). Nowadays, short innovation cycles, increasing market demands and 
regulations as well as the challenge of aging employees force companies to reconsider their way of working (VDI 
5610 2009). One of the main factors for companies, that has a positive effect on product innovation is knowledge (Bas 
et al. 2015; Al-Sa'di et al. 2017; Lee et al. 2013). Therefore, managing knowledge within a company is important to

those for further investigation. The defined interventions should be continuously evaluated and further improved to 
increase their benefits at Witzenmann. In general, the application of the method should consider several human factors, 
e.g. their motivation to participate, their competencies, and experiences since those are essential for a successful 
application. An additional tool, e.g. an action guide or training could further support the application of the InKTI 
method.

Abstract 
It is essential to develop products that are successful in future markets. However, product engineering often takes 
several years or even longer, and anticipating the needs and requirements for products is necessary. Strategic foresight 
provides a solution for identifying future product needs and requirements as well as product properties. Given the 
constantly changing environment, it is necessary to continually adapt the results of strategic foresight. Changes can 
be identified through shifting forecasts and trends. To ensure the success of the product in development, changes in 
the environment must be continuously integrated into the product engineering process (PEP). Thus, the relationship 
between monitoring changes in the future through foresight approaches and in the product during the PEP is important. 
This paper aims to analyze the integration of monitoring into the product engineering process based on elements of 
strategic foresight. The main objective was to identify whether existing approaches support this integration, by 
conducting a systematic literature review analyzing 1,664 research results. Here, no suitable approaches were 
identified in the literature. Therefore, to enable the integration of such approaches into the PEP, existing foresight 
approaches were examined to determine the extent to which monitoring approaches can be linked to them. During the 
examination of existing foresight approaches, especially scenario methods, commonalities were identified. Although 
these run individually, they generate the same results, such as influencing and key factors. These commonalities can 
be used as starting points for monitoring. To define these starting points, general monitoring approaches were 
examined to compare their structure and process. Here, different processes and structures of the approaches were 
identified, making it challenging to derive uniform elements for linking to foresight approaches in PEP. The central 
finding of this research work is that a design support must be defined to enable linkage and integration into the PEP. 
Initial preliminary work is suitable, in which product properties are derived from the scenarios themselves, as well as 
key factors. A link between product properties, scenarios, and key factors exists, which can be used for the 
operationalization of monitoring but has not yet been defined. In summary, different approaches to monitoring exist, 
but they have different procedures and structures, making integration into the PEP challenging. However, the 
uniformity of the scenario processes provides a good starting point for developing support for the monitoring of 
environments, which can help derive the impact on product properties in the event of changes. This enables the PEP 
to react to changes in the future and develop products that are robust for the future.

1. Introduction
To develop a product that is successful on the market, development must always be future-oriented (Cooper and 
Kleinschmidt 1993). This is relevant to competition for all companies (Siebe 2018). Only through future-oriented 
development an advantage can be gained in the future market, leading to a successful product (Lindemann 2016). In 
future-oriented development, all features of the product are adapted to the future customer. The requirements of future 
customers can vary greatly from the requirements and features a product must have for today's customer. (Siebe 2018) 
Since the development of a product always takes time and therefore always addresses the future customer, future-
oriented development is essential for a successful company (Fink and Siebe 2016). Especially for products with long 
development times, foresight is very relevant to be able to plan reliably. (Gausemeier 2019)

Abstract 
Adding internet technologies to mechatronic system solutions is the next step for Industry 4.0 and has a high potential 
for digital platform business models linked with cyber-physical system (CPS). The model of SGE – System Generation 
Engineering describes the development of systems on subsystem level. So far, no known research investigated a 
coherent definition explaining a digital platform business model in the model of SGE according to CPS. Within a four-
phase methodology, a systematic literature analysis identifies and processes 55 relevant definitions and extracts a data 
set of 32 definitions after eliminating 23 duplicates. In a semantic analysis, crucial primary and externally linking 
terms, combined with five case study findings, reveal the artefact, an economic platform with five characteristics. 
After initially validating the artefact, a workshop and academic discussion result in an intermediate artefact, further 
validated in a subsequent expert workshop. Findings suggest the terms value added, infrastructure, exchange, 
interaction, and openness describe digital platform business models. Essential defining aspects must entail facilitating 
value added through a multisided market by integrating specific entities, providing an open and/or closed infrastructure 
for flexible and compatible networking components, integrating data between the CPS and the platform, creating 
trustworthy and economic value added through entities, and scaling by network effects. This paper shows how to 
extract a precise, coherent, valuable, and iteratively validated definition to create a common understanding within a 
research field. Practitioners can learn about the digital platform business model concept within the model of SGE, 
supporting knowledge creation, research, and product development of CPS in generations. The originality of this work 
lies in extracting a validated definition by applying sophisticated tools and methods to guarantee its robustness.

Abstract 
The study of queueing systems has been around for decades. Since, at its most basic level, queueing systems are 
considered as continuous-time Markov Chains, the study of queueing theory must adhere to numerous assumptions. 
Most of these assumptions deal with the distribution and behavior of customer arrivals and service times, as these are 
often illustrated as Poisson processes. Service prioritization, capacities, and customer behaviors such as balking and 
reneging are also often considered in model assumptions. Often not considered are the physical constraints associated 
with real-world queueing systems. In several real-world queues, customer movement is constrained by the available 
physical space, such as consecutive toll booths or grocery counters. There are multi-server queues with only one lane 
wherein a customer that has been served by the initial server cannot move out of the system if subsequent servers are 
still busy, thus rendering the initial server still occupied. In addition, servers located after the initial one cannot be 
accessed even if they are vacant if the initial server is still occupied. Due to this, the behavior of the system greatly 
differs from those of similar queueing systems where physical constraints are assumed to be non-existent. Through 
simulation, the study has evaluated that the performance of the physically-constrained queueing setup can lead to 
waiting times and queue lengths of up to 6 times greater than that of a traditional M/M/2 queue, especially for a 
relatively high level of customer arrivals. Improvements to these metrics are also measured upon the implementation 
of proposed corrective schemes that aim to ease the physical restrictions of queueing.

1. Introduction
Queueing systems are characterized by arrival of entities that are in need of some type of servicing. Once these entities 
are served, they exit the system. The queue serves as a waiting area for the entities until they can transfer to a server. 
Queueing theory is the study of these systems. The Kendall-Lee notation is used in queueing theory to describe various 
aspects of a queue, such as customer arrival and service time distribution, queue capacity, number of servers, and 
service behavior (Kendall 1953). Two main metrics are used to assess queue performance: the average time spent by 
customers in the system Ws and the number of customers in the system Ls. 
In the process of evaluating the behavior of queues, numerous assumptions are made. These assumptions often include 
(but are not limited to) a fixed distribution and magnitude for customer arrivals/service times, singular customer 
arrivals into the system, and absence of customer behavior such as jockeying, reneging and balking.

In addition to this, in the two-server, physically-constrained queue setup, its performance is best when the service rate 
is equal for both servers, which may be due to blocking being minimized. An interesting phenomenon occurs when 
there is a significant difference in the service times of the two servers. If the first server is faster than the second, the 
system generally performs worse than if the second server is faster than the first. One reason for this is that the server 
utilization in this setup is much higher for the second server, primarily because it is the first server to be chosen if both 
are available. If the slower server is utilized more than the faster one, the queueing system would obviously be worse 
off. Another reason is that a slower second server would lead to more instances of blocking when the first server is 
done and the second server is still serving. To avoid this scenario, it is recommended that the queueing system 
operator/manager implement the quick and easy solution of putting the faster server on the second position. 
 
Based on the results, we can see that converting a physically-constrained queue to a standard M/M/2 setup drastically 
improves performance, especially for high customer arrivals. In real-world scenarios, if the space and financial 
considerations permit, it would be a very valid option to construct solutions to reach an M/M/2 setup, such as physical 
channels for free travel of customers within the queueing system. 
 
It is important to note that for customers stuck with S1 while waiting for S2 to complete servicing, the simulation model 
is currently unable to capture the duration of blocking (i.e. time from service completion to S2 being available). This 
time is also important to record as it contributes to the total time the customer spends in the system. On the other hand, 
for customers that are waiting behind S1, who in an otherwise unblocked setup can be already served by S2, their 
waiting times capture the time where they could have already been served by S2. Being able to separate this time from 
the recorded waiting time will help provide insight into how much of the customer waiting time is solely due to the 
presence of the physical constraint.

The study was able to compare a physically-constrained two-server queueing system to traditional 2 M/M/1 queues 
and a single M/M/2 queueing system. The difference was quantified and it was found that W and L are both 
significantly larger (up to 600% greater) with the physically-constrained setup compared to the M/M/2. This 
significant performance decrease should be put into consideration when designing physically-constrained queueing 
systems, and a simple alternative of creating a departure channel specifically for customers at server 1 would be of 
great benefit to system performance. 
 
As future work, it is recommended that further analysis be done on the blocking time of the servers to provide more 
insight into the queueing system. This study could also be extended to scenarios with multiple servers beyond two 
servers.

Abstract 
 
Tech startups' popularity has attracted investors, entrepreneurs, policymakers, and scholars for decades. Furthermore, 
a tech startup is a concept of entrepreneurship that utilizes the role of new and innovative technology to drive the 
firm's scalability in terms of investment and profit creation. In the Western world, a tech startup is not new, and the 
emergence of the world's renowned tech startup ecosystem, such as Silicon Valley, has inspired other parts of the 
world to do so in developing entrepreneurship. In this paper, a systematic literature review was conducted to 
investigate the success factors of tech startups in both developing and developed economies. The search string found 
3,062 academic papers, and 57 studies were selected and analyzed due to the systematic review. The result shows 13 
success factors identified in developing economies and 15 success factors in developed economies. The initial result 
of the systematic review of the startup success factors reveals a significant difference between success factors in 
developing and developed countries. In developing economies, external and organizational factors are the most 
relevant to the startup's success. On the other hand, in advanced economies, the most relevant factors are driven by 
individual factors.

1. Introduction 
Tech-startup (startup technology) or currently renowned as just a startup ecosystem, has gained popularity among 
entrepreneurs, investors, policymakers, and scholars for decades (Auerswald, 2015; Isenberg, 2011; Mack & Mayer, 
2016; Motoyama & Knowlton, 2014; Spigel, 2016). There is an increasing trend towards developing new innovative 
businesses worldwide, in which many technology-based ventures are established each year (Hormiga et al., 2010). 
Although tech startups were first emerged in advanced economies such as the U.S. during “tech bubble” in the late 
1990s, the trends in emerging markets have seen to rise since 2010s (Subrahmanya, 2022). Nowadays, developing 
economies such as India and Indonesia have joined the ranks among the top five countries with the most startup 
globally. India was in second place with 13,325 companies, and Indonesia was in fifth place with 2,347 companies 
(Artem Minaev, 2023). The growing number of startup companies in developing countries shows the significant 
opportunity for growth due to large markets, rapid adoption of internet technology, and the thriving entrepreneurial 
ecosystem for technology-based ventures in emerging markets (Google, Temasek, and Bain, 2022; Subrahmanya, 
2022).",,,australian 2023

Abstract 
Managing employee emotional stress is one of the most significant global challenges in the manufacturing sector 
today, and it is anticipated to exacerbate the trend in the coming years. Notably, employee work-related stress is 
responsible for 12 billion lost workdays and a cost of over US$1 trillion to the worldwide economy annually. 
Furthermore, Australian businesses incur an annual cost exceeding $11 billion due to insufficient attention to their 
employees' mental health needs. Employee emotional stress occurs when there are discrepancies between the 
physiological demands of a workplace and the inability of employees to manage the work demands. There is a 
need for fresh viewpoints in light of recent scholarly discussions on employee emotional well-being, particularly 
the psychosocial safety climate, due to its features connected with employee emotional stress. The commitment 
of management and their support for employee psychological health to mitigate work-related stress is referred to 
as the psychosocial safety climate. It represents organisational policies, practices, and procedures for protecting 
workers' psychological health and safety. The authors propose investigating the relationship between 
psychological safety climate and emotional stress, optimising lean manufacturing environment, and upholding 
robust occupational health and safety practices. It will also allow the creation of the appropriate conditions for 
establishing and sustaining a psychosocial safety climate among manufacturing firms to mitigate employee 
emotional stress levels. This transformation involves shaping workplaces seamlessly, integrating efficiency and 
empathy, and propelling toward a future where manufacturing synchronises with the cadence of human resilience.

balance the rigors of lean methodologies with strategies that uphold psychosocial safety, fostering an environment 
conducive to enhanced employee well-being and operational efficiency. This equilibrium is pivotal in promoting 
individual employee health and discretionary effort and overarching organisational success and resilience. 
Ultimately, the study advocates for a symbiotic approach, where lean principles and psychological safety are 
interwoven, steering modern manufacturing towards holistic excellence.

Abstract 
A corporate credit rating is an index that evaluates a company's ability to fulfill its debt obligations on a 22-point scale 
from AAA to D. Since obtaining corporate credit rating is very costly, corporate credit rating estimation using machine 
learning has attracted much attention in recent years. The problem with conventional research is that certain features 
become noise in the estimation of specific companies, resulting in localized loss of accuracy. In the previous studies, 
the overall accuracy was improved by using new features in addition to financial indicators in the estimation of 
corporate credit ratings. However, because the new features became noise in the estimation, the accuracy of some 
companies was lower than that of the corporate rating estimation using only financial indicators as the features. On 
the other hand, the stacking suppresses the accuracy loss due to noise. The stacking is built in two stages: in the first 
stage, the base model is built, and in the second stage, the meta-model is built using the estimates of the base model 
as features. The design of the base models is critical to the accuracy of the model with the stacking. In this study, we 
design the base models based on the groups of classified features. For example, the groups of features related to 
financial indicators includes profitability and safety, etc. The objective of this study is to construct a proposed model 
using the stacking with base models based on the groups of classified features. In addition, to confirm the usefulness 
of the proposed model, we compare the accuracy of the proposed model with that of the conventional model that does 
not use stacking. In this study, the corporate credit rating estimation is treated as a 22-class multi-label classification 
problem. The method used in the corporate credit rating estimation model is the Light Gradient Boosting Machine. In 
this study, the proposed model uses rating estimates of seven base models. The seven base models include a 
conventional model, five models using financial indicators, and a model using investment and loan network indicators. 
The financial indicators used in the five models are based on five groups of financial indicators classified by Nikkei 
NEEDS-FinancialQUEST. The five groups are profitability, return on capital, cash flow, return on equity, and safety. 
We used corporate ratings from Japan Credit Rating Agency, Inc. for the period from 1999 to 2021 as the labeled 
training data. Numerical experiments were conducted using data from 1,972 firms with 167 indicators. As a result, the 
proposed model improved the estimation of 53 firms compared to the previous model. The accuracy of the proposed 
model is 0.798, which is 0.027 points higher than that of the conventional model. The Quadratic Weighted Kappa is

Abstract 
This study aims to present how agile methods can contribute to the success in developing a new business unit 
within one of Brazil's largest technology companies. Additionally, it seeks to demonstrate the value of using 
agile methods in managing and supporting managers during the implementation of new disruptive business 
ventures. A case study was conducted in a technology sector company that applied agile methods concepts to 
the launch of a new business unit. The research methodology employed included data collection, document 
analysis, and interviews. Concepts from prominent agile methods currently in use, such as Kanban, Scrum, and 
the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe), were explored. Data were collected from January to July 2023 at the 
Curitiba, Brazil. The findings highlight that the application of agile techniques in the computer technology 
services sector, intended to aid in managing and governing transformative projects, substantially influences 
overall performance. The active engagement of senior management in transformative projects proved 
indispensable for the successful integration of these strategies, assuring appropriate prioritization amidst daily 
demands. Propagating an agile ethos across all tiers of the organization and forming a team receptive to 
innovation and adaptability stand as essential prerequisites for adhering to the established strategy. However, 
it's crucial to underscore that the absence of task prioritization and inadequate task completion might entail 
risks. Contemplating the critical factors tackled in this study, companies can adopt preventive actions to curtail 
the prospects of suboptimal implementation. In conclusion, the study asserts the applicability of agile 
methodology and its substantial advantages in inaugurating novel business units in the realm of technology 
services. The present study serves as a pivotal foundation for researchers and professionals vested in this 
subject. Nevertheless, it's vital to accentuate that the conclusions and insights delineated herein are grounded 
in a specific scope and data pool collected over a definite timeframe. As such, future research endeavors are 
warranted to expand and delve deeper into these findings, encompassing alternate vantage points and contexts. 
Subsequent investigations have the potential to furnish supplementary insights and further augment the 
evolving knowledge in this domain. The study extends a unique contribution by scrutinizing a fresh causal 
nexus between essential elements (agile methodologies, computer technology services sector, process 
performance, and strategic outcomes) germane to project administration within this specific milieu. By 
exploring the ramifications of agile methods on project administration within the computer technology services 
sector, this study broadens the existing knowledge base and proffers valuable insights for researchers and 
practitioners in this arena. This innovative approach engenders a heightened comprehension of the distinctive 
benefits and challenges characterizing this milieu, thereby fostering the advancement of project administration 
and agile practices.

operations. 
 
Furthermore, the study underscores the significance of a skillfully executed adaptation strategy that seamlessly 
blends diverse methodological approaches such as Kanban, Scrum, and SAFe. This astute fusion not only 
addresses the varied needs of companies but also enables a more streamlined and flexible project management 
methodology. The successful amalgamation of these methodologies, facilitated by sophisticated computerized 
systems like Azure DevOps - Microsoft, amplifies data storage, monitors information, and informs decision-
making. This all-encompassing project management  
approach enhances day-to-day operations with heightened transparency and well-informed decision-making, 
nurturing innovation and success throughout the organization. 
 
By considering the critical factors addressed in this study, companies can adopt preventive measures and reduce 
the chances of inadequate implementation. Furthermore, it is essential to emphasize the significance of 
disseminating the agile culture at all levels of the organization and forming a team open to innovation and 
flexibility to ensure the successful implementation of agile methods and achieve the desired benefits in 
launching new business units in technology services. However, it is crucial to recognize that the lack of activity 
prioritization and inadequate task fulfillment can pose serious risks to delivering expected results. 
 
It is important to note that this work represents only a starting point, and further research is needed to broaden 
and deepen the presented findings. The author acknowledges the opportunity to conduct more comprehensive 
studies on the practical applicability of agile methods in the information technology services segment, filling 
the gaps identified throughout this study. These future research endeavors will contribute to advancing 
knowledge in this specific area, providing a more comprehensive and enhanced understanding of the benefits 
and challenges of agile methods in this context. 
 
This article is expected to have provided a comprehensive overview of the utilization of agile methods in 
technology companies, sparking readers' interest and encouraging further discussions and research in this field. 
A thorough understanding of these methodologies is fundamental to achieving effective results, promoting 
flexibility, process control, team engagement, and a focus on customer needs.

Abstract 
Supply chain resilience and supplier reliability are crucial for highly perishable agricultural goods. The disruptions in 
these supply chains can severely affect perishable goods, leading to revenue loss. This research proposes an approach 
that integrates iterative simulation and machine learning techniques to assess the supply chain's resiliency and predict 
the supplier's reliability in the perishable strawberry supply chain. The methodology begins by generating data for 
involved entities to replicate real-world dynamics. A discrete-event simulation environment helps in modeling 
intricate supply chain interactions, capturing time-dependent events, and evaluating the impact of disruptions in a 
controlled virtual environment. The model forecasts supplier reliability scores, introducing dynamism and uncertainty 
into the simulation. The model is trained for machine learning, training, and evaluating multiple classifiers, such as 
XGBoost, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree, for predictive and 
comparative performance. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to test the robustness of the predictive model by varying 
input parameters. Integrating this predictive model with the perishable product supply chain enhances decision-
making, enabling proactive measures to be taken in response to potential supplier shutdowns. The proposed approach 
provides a comprehensive and practical solution for improving supply chain resilience and managing supplier 
reliability in the strawberry supply chain. Integrating simulation and machine learning techniques helps the supply 
chain decision-makers optimize involved operations and mitigate disruptions, benefiting the entire food supply chain 
ecosystem. Hence, this research offers valuable insights into improving the supply chain for perishable goods and 
supplier reliability. The findings help decision-makers devise strategies and timely choices to sustain a robust and 
reliable supply chain.

1. Introduction
Food supply chains (FSCs) are dynamic and complex, with many interrelated processes, players, and difficulties. 
Those intricate networks consist of a series of interlinked processes involving multiple stakeholders, transportation 
systems, storage facilities, and distribution channels (Ali et al. 2021; Messina et al. 2020), as shown in Figure 1. FSCs 
have a complicated network of activities, including cultivation, processing, distribution, and consumption, from 
production to consumption. Hence, it is crucial to ensure the quality of food and its safety through the supply chain 
(SC). Each stage involves a balance of resources, planning, and coordination to ensure a seamless flow of goods (Singh 
et al. 2021). FSC disruption is a breakdown in a SC's production, distribution, or consumption processes due to 
unanticipated incidents, risks, or accidents. They are vulnerable to disruptions, and global coverage makes them more 
susceptible to risks involved in transmissions (Ali et al. 2021). Natural disasters like hurricanes, floods, and droughts 
can adversely impact agricultural production and transportation, leading to crop failures, delayed shipments, and 
increased prices. Extreme events, such as droughts, heavy rains, and plant diseases, also reduce crop yields and cause 
food shortages, resulting in food insecurity (Reardon and Swinnen, 2020). Geopolitical tensions, trade conflicts, and

decision-making. Additionally, the Gaussian Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression models showed promising 
performance, providing choices for prediction tasks, further enhancing the versatility of the approach.  
 
The ability to predict supplier reliability allows for proactive decision-making, reducing the overall risk and impact 
of supplier shutdowns on the SC. By combining simulation-based assessments and ML predictions, this research 
contributes valuable insights into improving SC management in the context of perishable goods and supplier 
reliability. While every effort has been made to design a comprehensive and robust research methodology, certain 
limitations are acknowledged. The primary limitation is the reliance on simulated data, which may not perfectly 
represent the real-world complexities of the strawberry SC. Supplier reliability scores are assumed to follow previous 
trends, which may only partially capture some variations in supplier performance. 
 
Additionally, the accuracy of the predictive model may be affected by the quality and quantity of historical data 
available for training.  Despite certain limitations, such as data availability and complexity, this research is an essential 
steppingstone toward better SC resilience and efficiency. Overall, this research's contribution to the field lies in its 
innovative and holistic approach to evaluating SC resilience and predicting supplier reliability, paving the way for 
enhanced management strategies and strengthened SC systems in the perishable food industry. 
Future research could focus on enhancing model characteristics for training, improving the ML model accuracy, and 
exploring advanced techniques like ensemble learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. Incorporating real-
world data from PFSCs like strawberries could enhance simulation and ML models for improved accuracy in specific 
scenarios. Moreover, integrating these models into a comprehensive framework considering multiple objectives such 
as cost, lead time, and supplier reliability could enable dynamic SC optimization, facilitating robust and efficient 
designs. Extending research to collaborative SC resilience and its interactions among multiple entities could offer 
valuable insights for industries with complex SC structures.

Abstract 
Although a lot of research has been done on reward-based crowdfunding, scholars pay little attention to how 
multiple cues affect the quality perception of crowdfunding products under information asymmetry. To bridge this 
gap, this paper utilizes a cue diagnosticity framework to differentiate between high-scope cues (the founder’s social 
capital and online comments) and low-scope cues (the number of pictures, sentences and videos), and empirically 
investigates how these two types of cues are diagnostic in the process of assessing the product quality. Based on the 
cue diagnosticity framework, under different high-scope cues, this paper puts forward hypotheses about the 
influence of low-scope cues on backers’ quality perception of crowdfunding products. The findings show that 
regardless of the social capital and comments of founders, the number of pictures and videos in the introduction of 
reward-based crowdfunding will have a positive impact on the quality perception of crowdfunding products. When 
at least one of the founder’s social capital or comments is good, the number of sentences will have a positive effect. 
However, when the founder’s social capital and comments are poor, the number of sentences will have a negative 
impact on the quality perception of products. Furthermore, we replace the dependent variable and change the 
classification method of backer’s social capital to ensure the robustness of the results. This paper enriches the 
research of reward-based crowdfunding, and provides important implications for founders to raise more funds from 
backers by publishing more effective information.

Abstract 
This study focuses on analyzing the barriers that Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) face when 
implementing Lean tools and how these barriers are related to Human Resource Management (HRM) practices. 
Through a systematic literature review, 45 academic articles were examined, identifying 20 Lean barriers that hinder 
the successful adoption of these tools. Lack of understanding (15.56%), Lack of financial capacity (11.11%), and 
Resistance to change (11.11%) were the most common barriers. In addition to identifying barriers, this study highlights 
critical factors characterizing these limitations and establishes a correlation between these critical factors and the three 
dimensions of the AMO model (Ability, Motivation, and Opportunity) focused on Human Resource Management. 
This suggests that proper talent management and employee motivation are essential elements to overcome barriers in 
Lean implementation. By expanding the understanding of specific obstacles that SMEs face on their path to Lean 
implementation, this work provides valuable insights for organizations to design more effective strategies. The 
contribution of Human Resource Management in employee engagement and commitment is also highlighted as a key 
factor in achieving a successful and efficient Lean development process. With this study, it is hoped that SMEs can 
address the identified barriers and adopt Lean practices more effectively, enhancing their competitiveness and 
operational efficiency. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
The interest in Lean Manufacturing is experiencing steady growth in most large companies. However, in the majority 
of SMEs, this methodology remains unknown due to its perceived implementation difficulty. The Lean Manufacturing 
approach involves the participation of personnel at all levels, from executives to workers, to achieve success. Often, 
the main obstacles include resistance to change by employees, a lack of leadership, and the necessity for executives 
to understand and believe in the potential benefits (Sanz and Gisbert 2017). On the other hand, these barriers manifest 
themselves in both internal and external aspects, such as the financial and capital realm, the acquisition of knowledge 
and human resources, the understanding of management concepts and philosophies, and the accessibility to Lean tools 
and techniques, all of which constrain the development and implementation of the Lean methodology in SMEs (Zhou 
2016). In relation to SMEs in the automotive sector of Malaysia that are undergoing a transitional process towards 
adopting Lean methodologies, the most prominent barriers are the lack of understanding of Lean tools, the absence of 
experienced administrators, and average administrative attitudes. Additionally, in the case of SMEs that are already 
in the implementation process, the lack of knowledge and understanding of Lean tools, as well as the attitude of the 
workers, are identified as the main barriers (Nordin et al. 2010).

outlining their development according to the identified critical factors. In this way, they can be measured during the 
execution of the proposed solution model. 
 
5.4 Validation 
According to the research conducted by Lozano and Sánchez (2019), it is highlighted that: ""The implementation of 
formalized and properly developed human resource management systems (following the guidelines and orientations 
of the AMO model) influences the improvement of SMEs' results"". 
 
This statement is supported by the results obtained by Lozano and Sánchez in a study carried out in Spain with 1136 
SMEs. In this study, it was found that 99.99% of the companies exhibited a high level of competitiveness at an 
individual level due to the robust implementation of the AMO model, based on its three fundamental pillars: 
• 
Establishment of more rigorous selection systems and implementation of more intensive training programs 
(Ability). 
• 
Adoption of more formalized employee evaluation systems and introduction of performance-based 
compensation and incentive plans (Motivation). 
• 
More extensive planning of employees' career development and promotion of their involvement in 
decision-making (Opportunity) (Lozano and Sánchez 2019). 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research highlights various barriers encountered in the implementation of lean methodology in SMEs. The 
primary obstacle, identified in our study, is the lack of understanding, followed by financial constraints and resistance 
to change. To address these barriers, it is crucial for all personnel to participate and commit to organizational 
improvement. For this purpose, the AMO model, focused on HRM, was applied due to the identified relationship 
between critical barrier factors and the three dimensions of the model. This approach involves implementing rigorous 
selection systems, intensive training programs, employee assessments, and initiating performance-based 
compensation and incentive plans. Furthermore, employees' professional development is planned, and their 
involvement in organizational decision-making is promoted. 
 
To measure the progress of the proposed solution, the following indicators have been established: Compliance with 
the training program, training budget compliance, total investment in training, attendance rate in training courses, 
productivity index, internal promotion, performance index, and employee participation in company meetings, 
knowledge sharing, and training. However, it is important to consider that these indicators may vary depending on the 
various lean barriers encountered during the implementation of the methodology in SMEs, as each barrier has unique 
critical factors that characterize it. 
 
The lack of knowledge and understanding constitutes the primary barrier to achieving success in lean implementation. 
It requires a high level of familiarity with lean methodology and demands a cultural change within the organization. 
However, effecting this change requires an economic investment, the magnitude of which will depend on the tool 
being employed. Additionally, due to the time required for benefits to materialize, many companies shy away from 
implementation. There is also a scarcity of guiding models for SMEs in future implementations. 
 
Literature analysis reveals that several authors, when implementing lean tools, achieve different results and encounter 
varied barriers due to the unique characteristics and circumstances of each company. Furthermore, an important 
limitation was identified regarding the limited availability of information on methodological models implemented in 
SMEs that could serve as a guide for future implementations of lean tools in companies. There is also a lack of research 
addressing proposed solutions to overcome these lean barriers. This is significant, as this research has confirmed the 
existence of a considerable number of lean obstacles highlighted by various authors. 
 
This research is designed to assist the organization's top management in understanding the most common barriers and 
adopting appropriate measures before implementing lean methodology. Furthermore, a solution centered on HRM is 
proposed due to the need to involve all personnel to achieve success in lean implementation, as demonstrated in this 
study. 
 
In future research, it is crucial to explore diverse approaches to address these obstacles and highlight the importance 
of presenting, in a case study, the implementation of the AMO model focused on HRM in comparison to lean barriers.

Abstract 
Electric drives are widely used to regulate the flow of power supply between source to motor either due to Process or 
Operation requirement and as means to lower motor’s inrush current. The use of AC electric drives is expected to 
increase due to pressing need to reduce operational cost, increase productivity and energy saving in line with 
company’s efforts towards electrification. There have been records of failure of electric drives in the past which have 
caused major production loss within Petroleum Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) operations. Common drives’ failure 
mechanisms are converter malfunction or electronic component failures, voltage dip susceptibility, insulation 
degradation and so on which could be avoided through effective preventive maintenance and condition-based 
monitoring via data analytics. This paper describes a methodology on Electric Drive Health Assessment (EDHA) and 
as a web-based data analytical tool to assess and monitor electric drives’ key components and parameters that 
contribute to a drive health index. Based on the drive health index and corresponding risk, operators are able to closely 
monitor the condition of electric drives in their facility which will prompt them to carry out necessary intervention. 
EDHA was developed based on PETRONAS installation, operation and maintenance practices, maintenance data and 
lessons learnt gathered from assets which have been operating for more than 30 years.  
Keywords 
Electric drives, Motor, Health Index, Digital tool, Web-based application. 
1. Introduction
Electric drives performance has direct impact to load and subsequently affecting production reliability. As multi-
national oil & gas corporation, PETRONAS occupies tens of AC high-voltage drives and hundreds of low-voltage 
drives consist of Variable Speed Drive (VSD), Soft Starters, Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) and Current Source 
Inverter (CSI) or Load-Commutated Inverter (LCI). With the organization’s aspiration towards Net Zero Carbon 
Emissions by 2050, electrification efforts by means of Turbine-to-Motor conversion and demand for energy efficiency, 
the use of electric drives is expected to grow significantly.  
Electrical drives play a vital role in ensuring smooth load start-up with various load profile, meeting process 
requirement and stabilizing electrical network during transient condition. High Voltage (HV) drives are normally 
associated with high criticality loads, which failure of these consumers will lead to major plant production interruption. 
Over time, the performance of drives decreases due to ageing, parts obsolescence, wear-and-tear, and stresses (Hamid 
2021). Preventive maintenance activities for electric drives typically involves detailed visual inspection and supported 
with Original Equipment Manufacturers’ (OEM) offline condition-based monitoring. In our assets, this maintenance 
practices are normally performed during a plant turnaround which occurs every 4 to 6 years. Electric drive electronic 
components degradation and other failure mechanisms could go undetected until the next inspection and maintenance 
task is performed which pose a risk of drive unexpected failure. Thus, Electric Drive Health Assessment (also known 
as EDHA) was developed to establish drives centralized data depository and to achieve maximum reliability and 
availability of drives by monitoring drive key components’ parameters. The application built-in algorithms will assist 
operators in prioritizing maintenance activities based on drives’ component parameters. Likelihood of failure (LoF) 
methodology of individual drive was derived from key parameters found in maintenance and operation records which 
is presented in an intuitive graphical user-interface dashboard. The future state of EDHA will leverage on cloud 
computing services and machine learnings, integrating Internet-of-Things (IoTs) based sensors in providing 
wholesome overview of drives health status with better accuracy of failure prediction capability (David et al.2021).

Parameters with quantitative data will be trended to assist operators to recognize early signs of drive failure. Risk 
rating will also be recorded and trended at every inspection performed by operator. 
 
The integration of EDHA with another application or platform will require stable and reliable backbone supporting 
network with compliance to High-Performance Computing platform (IEEE 1588), (Strangasy and Aviyente 2015). As 
the platform evolves towards maturity, data exchange across multiple platforms potentially can be vulnerable and 
cause severe data breaches to the users. To ensure data security and minimizing data leakages, up-to-date cyber 
security measurement must be in place as part of user data security management framework (Panagiotis and Elias 
2023). 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommended Improvement 
Based on the development of EDHA as a digital tool, it will be an essential digital solution in supporting PETRONAS’ 
growth and sustainability agenda. The platform not only aims to improve drives’ reliability and prevent ad-hoc failures 
but also ensuring PETRONAS operating units align to each other in driving down the operational expenditures through 
integrated dashboards and optimizing maintenance intervals. Nevertheless, there are further improvements to the 
application. Generally, most of the drives installed do not subscribe to online condition-based monitoring as they are 
not equipped with measurement sensor. Integration with Internet of Things (IoTs) based sensors on drives and motors, 
artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms with EDHA platform will provide online parameters of the 
drives for better accuracy in predicting failure. This enhancement is crucial towards making the platform fit for future 
and scalable throughout PETRONAS operating units.  
 
As the journey towards digitalized asset management is being implemented across the globe, readiness of 
infrastructure backbone and effective cyber security policy are crucial to support the company’s digitalization agenda. 
The algorithm for electric drive analysis can be combined with diagnostics for induction motors, transformers, and 
switchgear; to provide an overview of the integrated machine and drive string with the aim of realizing an intelligent 
substation (David et al. 2021). Greater collaboration among technical society members and industry players on this 
cyber-security issue will foster the adoption of digital twin technology and cut the cost of ownership significantly.

Abstract 
Scheduling is a vital function for efficiently operating flexible job-shop systems. Traditionally, that function considers 
assigning jobs to machines and their sequence. However, machines need to be operated by another set of resources 
(i.e., workers). Due to the fact that operators are skilled workers, the available pool is limited. Hence, the interaction 
of machines and humans needs to be studied in an integral manner to address the scheduling problem. In this article, 
a novel precedence variable-based, mixed-integer linear programming model is developed for the dual-resource 
flexible job-shop problem. The mathematical formulation deals with the optimal assignment of machines and workers 
to operations and the operation sequence in both resources by minimizing the makespan. The model gives an exact 
solution by solving both the assignment and the sequencing problems concurrently. The model was implemented in 
Docplex and was run on three instances of varying sizes. The model solved the three introduced examples, including 
a large instance involving 20 operations with 4 workers and 4 machines, using only 1662 variables and 5217

1. Introduction
Manufacturing systems have evolved to adapt to the changing requirements, and while they have experienced several 
industrial revolutions and moved from manual operations to automation, human-centred manufacturing systems are 
still required. Skilled workers are needed to operate the systems. Hence, to optimize the efficiency of manufacturing 
systems, the consideration of workers’ capabilities is required.  
Scheduling has been an integral part of every organization, which might involve the interaction of humans and 
machines, the dual resources, to carry out the organization's principal function (i.e., manufacturing). Each resource 
group (e.g., machines or workers) can interact with one or more resources in flexible environments. The schedules for 
every entity of the two resource groups must be feasible and optimal to carry out the process without any clashes 
efficiently. Therefore, the scheduling for the dual-resource problem needs to be studied.  
Various iterative or search-based methods for solving the scheduling problem involve breaking down this problem 
into two parts. First is the optimal assignment of a machine and worker pair to the different operations. Second is the 
optimal sequence of the other jobs based on the optimal assignments. However, it is to be noted that these two parts 
need to be solved simultaneously or concurrently because the optimal assignment depends on the optimal sequence as 
well. Therefore, the objective of this study is to propose a novel precedence variable-based, mixed-integer linear 
programming (MILP) model which provides an exact solution to the dual-resource flexible job-shop scheduling

Table 5 provides insights into the algorithm’s performance and its ability to solve scheduling instances of varying 
complexity by using the minimum number of variables and constraints. These results are essential for evaluating the 
algorithm’s efficiency and effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, they serve as a basis for comparing the 
proposed approach to existing methods and showcasing the potential advantages of the proposed algorithm. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study provides a novel MILP that offers an exact solution for DR-FJSP. The model is formulated using mixed 
integer and precedence variables and optimizes the total makespan. The model succeeded in providing optimal 
machine - worker assignments and schedules. Moreover, the model was tested on problems of various sizes, and their 
solutions were reported in the form of both machine and worker Gantt charts, along with their solving times. It is 
shown that this model uses a minimum number of variables to solve this problem, making it both simpler and faster. 
 
It is worth mentioning that the model does not use worker-machine eligibility sets; instead, a high processing time 
value is assigned for infeasible pairs. This can cause a problem if the size of the problem grows and the total makespan 
is comparable to the high value assigned for the infeasible pair. Hence, measures to deal with this problem need to be 
devised. 
 
Future research includes the development of efficient solution methods, such as metaheuristics, hyperheuristics, and 
the integration with machine learning. For instance, this model will provide optimal solutions for labeling training 
examples required in supervised machine learning models. Also, the model presented is uniform and unbiased towards 
the two kinds of resources. Therefore, this can be extended to formulate a general model for a multi-resource flexible 
job-shop scheduling problem.

Abstract 
Project schedule overruns are a significant problem in South Africa and globally. This research investigates the factors 
that cause the late completion of government funded construction projects in South Africa and the mitigation measures 
that may be implemented to minimize the delays. The research is anchored in the Project Management Book of 
Knowledge (PMBOK) as a theoretical framework and the research employed a quantitative research design.  Primary 
data was collected from built environment professionals registered with the South African Council for Project and 
Construction Management Professionals through an online questionnaire survey. The results indicated that the top 
five ranked project delay factors include poor performance of contractors, labor unrest and strikes, slow decision-
making, poor project planning and rework due poor quality. The top five mitigation measures noted by the respondents 
appeared in both the literature review and the PMBOK framework, and include the use of competent contractors and 
professional service providers;  securing project funding before the start of a project;  proper project planning and the 
use of comprehensive project plans; the implementation of comprehensive change management systems, and effective 
stakeholder management.

1. Introduction
The construction industry plays an important role in the growth of the economy of any country and South Africa is no 
exception. Economically, construction contributes significantly towards the gross domestic product (GDP of a country 
(Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB), 2017) and in South Africa, infrastructure projects contribute 7% 
the national GDP (National Treasury, 2016). According to the South African Mid Term Expenditure Framework 
(SAMTEF) released by the National Treasury in 2016, the country spent ZAR865.4 billion on infrastructure projects 
from 2013 – 2016. The report further states that the government planned to spend ZAR900 billion on infrastructure 
from 2019 - 2021 (National Treasury, 2016). The past and planned expenditure indicates the importance of 
infrastructure projects towards economic growth in South Africa.  
Apart from the contribution of the construction industry to the GDP and the growth of the economy, the industry 
contributes significantly to job creation for both the formal and informal sectors. According to the CIDB construction 
monitor report (2017), the industry contributes 10% to South Africa’s employment index. The 2030 National 
Development Plan (NDP) indicates that the South African government plans to reduce unemployment by 6% through 
the implementation of infrastructure projects until 2030. Hence, it is important to manage projects well and complete 
projects timeously given the signficant resources invested in government projects (Construction Industry Development 
Board, 2017).

The conclusion provides comparative review of the research findings and literature review to enable the researchers 
to answer the stated research questions.  
 
5. Conclusion 
The researchers sought to identify key factors that lead to project delays of government-funded construction projects 
and the mitigation measures that can address and improve these delays. The literature review identified the key delay 
factors and mitigation measures from various global research studies, and studied the theoretical propositions of the 
PMBOK framework. In this section the research data and findings are analysed to respond to the two research 
questions “What are the key factors that lead to the late completion of government funded construction projects in 
South Africa?” and “What mitigation measures may be implemented in order to minimise construction delays in 
government funded construction projects South Africa?”.  
 
Interestingly, the only common factor found in both the literature review, and confirmed by the research respondents, 
was poor project planning.  The respondents did not consider regular designs and scope changes, a client’s financial 
problems and late payment of contractors and service providers as constituting the top five factors that lead to the late 
completion of government funded construction projects in South Africa. Instead, the respondents stated that poor 
contractor performance, labour unrest and strikes, slow decision-making, and rework due to poor quality as being 
amongst the top five factors leading to project delay. Labour unrest and strikes is the only delay factor which was not 
present in the literature review and confirms that it is a unique factor in South Africa. Due to the close-ended nature 
of the questions, the research findings did not highlight the cause of labour unrests and strikes.  
 
The PMBOK framework suggests ten project management knowledge areas and five process groups to be used to 
mitigate delays (Alyad, 2017; Kerzner and Kerzner, 2017).  For example, proper project planning and the use of 
comprehensive project plans are mitigation measures that appear in the literature review, the PMBOK framework and 
the research findings. The pattern suggests that this factor can reduce the risk of project delays. Respondents noted 
the following four factors identified in the literature review as mitigation measures that may be implemented to 
minimise construction delays in government funded construction projects in South Africa: 
 
• 
The use of competent contractors and professional service providers; 
• 
Securing project funding before the start of a project; 
• 
Proper project planning and the use of comprehensive project plans; and 
• 
The implementation of comprehensive change management systems.

Abstract 
It is undeniable how remanufactured products provide a promising solution that would reduce the burden on the 
environment and enhance sustainability solutions. However, in countries like the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which 
are developing in a high-speed pattern, the usage of remanufactured products is still in its early stages. This study aims 
to assess the awareness and utilization of the remanufactured products as well as addressing the factors that prevent 
people in the kingdom from using these products Studying remanufactured product awareness and utilization in Saudi 
Arabia can support sustainability, resource efficiency, economic growth, and policy formulation for sustainable 
consumption and production. Among university students, faculty members, engineers and non-engineers, a total of 57 
participates completed a validated questionnaire survey. The survey contained two parts; questions aimed to collect 
demographic information about the participants and questions to test awareness, usage, and willingness to purchase 
remanufactured products, as well as factors that impact the decision to purchase remanufactured products. Descriptive 
analysis was used to describe and summarize the research dataset we obtained. Our analysis indicated that 31.58% 
purchased remanufactured products while 68.42% did not have the opportunity to buy a remanufactured product 
before. However, the remanufacturing industry and products will have a bright future in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 
as long as more promotions are shared on social media on these products and keep a large price difference compared 
with the new products.

1. Introduction
The burden on the environment has reached a level where creative solutions should be introduced to reduce it. 
Remanufacturing promotes a promising solution that would mitigate the impact on the environment as it extends the 
product life cycle. This is a true fact since it reduces the usage of resources, provides better control of waste as well 
as fewer production processes and chemical reactions. In remanufacturing, the products are completely disassembled 
and some parts are machined to like-new condition, which sometimes includes cosmetic operations as shown in Figure 
1.  
Globally, the popularity of the remanufactured product has increased over the last few years. This increase has created 
new potentials from a different perspective. In 2030, it is estimated that the European market would generate from the 
remanufacturing industry an annual value of $84 billion-$120 billion as well as it would create about 600,000 
employment opportunities (Parker et al 2015) (Parker et al., 2015). 
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a great landscape for remanufacturing. The Saudi Vision 2030 promotes an 
opportunity for such an industry to grow as one of the top goals and potential of the National Industrial Development 
and Logistics Program is to develop existing industries and localize promising manufacturing industries. Thus, it is 
important to understand the awareness and perception of remanufactured products in the area, which can inform the 
development of this new industry. In this paper, we investigate the awareness of the remanufactured product in the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

For those who have not purchased a remanufactured product before, almost 45% of the male and female agreed on 
the right pricing to convince them to buy a remanufactured product is when it is 30% – 40% less than the price of the 
new product as demonstrated in Figure 4.  
 
 
 
Figure 4. Price range preference of each gender to purchase remanufactured products. 
 
Other than the price, the quality factor of these products was a concern for about 56% and 54% of the males and 
females, respectively, which prevented them from purchasing the remanufactured products, see Figure 5. Taking into 
consideration the quality factor of the remanufactured products during the advertisement period may result on a 
significant different on the purchasing behavior tendency of people in KSA as they already have the willingness to 
buy them.

6. Conclusion 
This study aimed to test the awareness and willingness to purchase remanufactured products in the Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia as well as the factors prevent purchasing them. From the survey we conducted, the future of remanufactured 
products is very promising in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The majority of the participant in the survey have an idea

about the remanufactured product although a small portion had the experience of purchasing this type of product. 
What also supports our prediction is the industrial revolution that has been taken in place since the launch of the Saudi 
Vision 2030 in 2016. To increase the popularity of remanufactured products, social media would play an important 
factor in this role. As expected, to increase the consumer willingness to purchase these products, the price would be 
the top motivation for both males and females in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. However, females tend to have the 
appearance of the products (e.g. color or shape) as another motivation to purchase the remanufactured products. on 
the other hand, besides the price, males would be also willing to purchase these products if a promotion is associated 
with their purchase. Even though both male and female in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia trust the original manufacturer 
as a channel to purchase a remanufactured product, male shows a bit more flexibility to purchase these products from 
different channels (e.g. maintenance and repair stations) compared to female. To extend this work, it would be better 
to do further statistical analysis to statistically validate the obtained results.

Abstract 
The Japanese 5S technique is one of the important lean manufacturing tools which can extensively help to enhance 
efficiency and productivity, reduce waste, and improve organizational culture. This paper reports a case of 5S 
implementation where one of the labs of a university was unorganized and subjected to inefficiency, long activity time, 
ineffective use of space, and excess inventory. 5S technique was implemented along with the input of Safety as the 6th 
S, after having an initial study based on some preliminary data collection, discussion with lab technicians and students, 
and their analysis. The major objectives were to organize the workplace, remove unnecessary items and manage the 
inventory, and minimize the time required to perform tasks and activities in the laboratory. The 5S implementation 
was found impactful and changed the work culture to a great extent with the removal of unnecessary items and a 
managed inventory, orderliness, cleanliness, significantly lower activity time, and safety enhancement.

1. Introduction
In the last decade, the global market has become highly competitive due to improved technologies and increasing 
customer demand. The industry and academia sectors have witnessed tremendous changes, involving changes in 
management approach, production processes, relationship with supplier and customer satisfaction as well as 
competitiveness. As a result of the continuously growing competition, manufacturing industries, both secondary and 
tertiary are under pressure to change their way of doing things by adopting innovative methods of manufacturing. Non-
value-added operations increase the expense of a process or operation while adding no value to the company. Lean 
manufacturing is a methodology that helps organizations improve their quality and productivity by removing waste or 
non-value-added activities (Choomlucksana and Ongsaranakorn 2015). Longer waiting times are one of the major 
causes of employee dissatisfaction and lower morale, which leads to lower productivity. Other factors that contribute

4. Conclusion 
The main purpose of this research was to apply the concept of lean manufacturing to obtain a sustainable university. 
The lean manufacturing tool that was studied is the 5S methodology. From the findings and observations, it can be 
concluded that the laboratory that was not a safe space for occupants, have become organized, clean, and safe that 
greatly reduced the activity time, waste, and productivity and efficiency indirectly. The results of time study show that 
the activity time has been drastically reduced upto seven times, after 5S implementation. Implementing the 5S together 
with the 6thS which is safety has resulted in, elimination of unnecessary inventory, improved work flow and work 
performance, safety for occupants and an organized work space and a bigger storage density. Due to a great deal of 
insects and dust particles within the laboratory it can be recommended that the laboratory makes use of proper 
ventilation and effective insecticide. This study has shown that 5S is an excellent strategy to solve the problems within 
the university work area such as laboratory and workshop. For future work, in the planning stage, the implementer

Abstract 
In this article, a review of the available literature on the machining (specifically turning) of aluminum is systemically 
presented. Through this work, a fundamental understanding of the machining of aluminum was developed together 
with the understanding of the effects of process parameters on machinability indicators. Selected articles from the past 
two decades have been considered. Turning of aluminum using different cutting tool inserts under different machining 
environments is presented. Out of the literature discussed, some are based on the modelling and optimization of turning 
parameters to facilitate the machining of aluminum. Overall, it can be concluded that since aluminum is a soft material 
and therefore difficult-to-machine, that necessitates various interventions like sustainable cooling and lubrication, tool 
treatment and texturing, and process optimization, to obtain the desired machinability.

1. Introduction
Due to some superior mechanical properties, aluminum has succeeded in replacing steel and cast iron in the fabrication 
of parts for the aerospace and automobile industries (Stanojkovic and Radovanovic 2022, Qazi et al. 2021). Since the 
1930s, aluminum alloys have been used in the construction of aircraft components and have since been the go-to 
material for industries where a high strength-to-weight ratio is vital in part production (Totten and MacKenzie 2003). 
In other words, the demand by the automobile and aerospace industries for lighter, durable, and environmentally 
friendly materials for manufacture makes aluminum and its alloys a suitable material which is of major research focus 
these days. Its availability and the vast area of the application make aluminum the ideal material for such research. 
Aluminum alloys are classified by four major factors, namely cast, wrought, strain hardenable, and heat treatability 
(Mário et al. 2016). These factors also impact the machinability of the materials and thus machinability groupings are 
also used in the classification. The principal alloying elements are detrimental to the tool selection and machining 
parameters in order to ensure an economic process. In the case of cast alloys, machinability challenges are imposed 
by those that contain copper, magnesium, or zinc as the principal alloying element, such that the tool rake angle has 
to be considered. A small rake angle is normally preferred on the tool since it produces little danger of burring the part 
(Mário et al. 2016, Okokpujie and Tartibu 2022). The aluminum alloy 7075 is one of the strongest aluminum alloys 
that can effectively replace steel in strength and keep most of the desirable properties of aluminum (Soren et al. 2019).

While turning aluminum metal matrix composite (MMC), Bansal and Upadhyay (2016) found that the presence of 
hard ceramic particles in the MMC reduces the MRR and cutting speed improves surface finish. Another important 
work on the machining of aluminum composites conducted by Kannan et al. (2020), highlights the effectiveness of 
the TOPSIS optimization technique that resulted in significant improvement in machinability indicators i.e. 16% 
decrease in roughness, a 22% decrease in tool wear, 32% reduction in machining force.  
Machado et al. (2022) investigated the turning of Al-Si-Mg alloys. Two varieties of samples i.e. as-cast and heat-
treated were examined where the later was found to produce stable machinability due to better microstructure and 
mechanical properties. Vilches et al. (2021) conducted a study and found tool wear very influential to affect form 
deviations like cylindricity, especially at high feed rates and cutting speeds. In an interesting study, Pattnaik et al. 
(2018) found the superiority of polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tool inserts in obtaining the best machinability of 
aluminum alloys. Saravanakumar et al. (2018) successfully optimized turning parameters and minimized surface 
roughness and roundness error. Taguchi's robust optimization technique resulted in the minimization of roundness 
error from 0.089 mm to 0.062 mm and surface roughness from 1.52 µm to 1.16 µm. A recent investigation conducted 
by Roy et al. (2021) identified the effectiveness of the textured tool in enhancing the machinability of A1100 alloy 
under a dry environment. Table 1 summarizes some of the important past work conducted on turning aluminum and 
its alloys. 
 
3. Conclusion  
A brief review on machinability of aluminum under the influence of different machining conditions has been reported 
in this article. Since aluminum is a soft material, therefore it is difficult-to-machine and necessitates novel techniques 
of machining. Along with novelty, sustainability is also a major concern and has been taken care of by researchers in 
the form of successful dry and near-dry machining of aluminum. Prolonging the tool life by reducing tool wear is 
detrimental to the sustainability of the machining process. There are various methods of coating and texturing that 
have been explored but little work has been done to explore the advances in tooling together with advances in 
lubrication and cooling systems for aluminum machining. The combination of these techniques for sustainable 
machining allows room for research which can influence the way in which manufacturers operate. The use of 
microwave radiation for tool pre-treating before and after texturing presents a huge gap in research which is an 
important future research avenue.

Abstract 
Tungsten carbide (WC) composites are specialized materials that have been found effective and useful for many 
industrial applications. This article reports the results of a research study conducted on wire electric discharge 
(WEDM) of WC-Co composites. Effects of WEDM parameters such as wire feed rate, voltage, pulse-on time, and 
pulse-off time on root mean square surface roughness of WC-Co samples have been investigated by conducting 
twenty-nine experiments. Process productivity in terms of material removal rate has also been investigated. It was 
found that the discharge energy is the key to obtain the desired surface quality during WEDM of WC-Co. Sample 
machined at low discharge energy parameter setting has better surface roughness and corrosion resistance as compared 
to one machined at high discharge energy parameter combination at a compromise with the material removal rate. 
Wire morphology study also confirms the suitability of low discharge energy parameter setting at which low wire 
erosion can be obtained.

1. Introduction
Composites are specialized materials developed to replace the traditional engineering materials for fulfilling the 
special application requirements in defence, aerospace, automotive, and scientific fields. Tungsten cobalt (WC-Co) 
composite is one of the important composite materials and is used for a number of industrial applications such as 
cutting tools, machineries, instruments, and jewellery etc. (Mehrotra et al. 2015). The cobalt present in this composite 
acts a binder and according to the percentage of binder the mechanical, physical and chemical characteristics alters. 
This is widely accepted material for the cutting tool, die and punches etc. due to its unique characteristics of high 
strength, high temperature resistance and excellent corrosion resistance (Mehrotra et al. 2015). These properties make 
this material unique and need appropriate manufacturing processes which can impart these properties into it. 
Composite materials including WC-Co, are difficult to process by conventional machining methods (Banerjee et al. 
2021). An alternate can be to process by non-traditional or advanced type machining technologies. Spark erosion (or 
electric discharge) based machining processes have gained popularity to machine a wide range of difficult-to-machine 
(DTM) materials (Akıncıoğlu 2022, Sidhu 2021). Wire electric discharge machining Wire-EDM or WEDM, is one of 
the important variants of electric discharge machining. The material removal in the WEDM process takes place by the 
localized heat developed by repetitive sparks generated due to energy discharge between workpiece and a travelling 
wire. The debris induced during the machining process are removed by the flowing dielectric (deionized water). The 
control of WEDM process via its parameters such as pulse duration, pulse off time, voltage, current, and wire feed 
rate, is an important aspect to obtain a balance from the point of view of part quality and process productivity (Singh 
et al. 2020, Chaubey and Gupta 2023).  Like other machining operations, WEDM performance can also be evaluated 
by considering various machinability indicators such as product surface roughness and geometric accuracy, process 
productivity, and sustainability etc. (Perec 2022, Zolpakar et al. 2021). Surface roughness parameters help to 
determine the part quality by providing an estimate of irregularities on the machined surface. Rq which is the root 
mean square RMS parameter is one of the important and can be considered to analyse the performance of machining 
processes like WEDM.

on wire. At one place, lumps are also observed, which are due to the deposition of material being flushed by dielectric 
on wire during the passage of discharge energy. Figure. 4c shows the wire morphology corresponding to sample 2 of 
Table 2. Due to high discharge energy in the spark gap, a high erosion of wire has taken place. In addition, large-size 
craters were observed on the worn-out wire. This morphology of wire-electrode depicts the high amount of wear.

4. Conclusion 
The following conclusions are drawn from the present research: 
1. In WEDM of WC-Co composites, discharge energy plays a prominent role to obtain the desired surface quality. 
High discharge energy combination/setting of parameters can lead to high productivity but at the cost of high wire 
erosion, and poor surface roughness; whereas low discharge energy setting of parameters produces low wire wear 
and better surface quality.  
2. The variation of Rq with WEDM parameters indicates machining to be done at medium wire feed rate, medium 
servo voltage, medium pulse-off time, and low pulse-on time to obtain better surface quality characteristics. 
3. The corrosion rate of WC-Co composite machined at low discharge energy parameter setting is 0.35067 mm/year 
which is 265% lower than that of the sample machined at high discharge energy parameters combination 0.92992 
mm/year. 
4. The outcomes evidenced the presence of a trade-off between quality and productivity while machining WC-Co 
composites using WEDM.

Abstract 
The continued increase in economies in most developing countries is associated with the requirements for construction 
materials such as cement and concrete. Globally, cement production continues to increase further into year 2030 with 
expected increase to level that is 5 times year 1990, which is close to about 5 billion tones. Manufacturing of cement 
is associated with emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) during the clinker production process stage. There is further 
expectation that the cement industry is most probable to exceed the total amount of emissions of CO2 of the emission 
standards. The industry in then under pressure to deploy strategies aimed at reduction of carbon dioxide and South 
African cannot afford to be left behind in reducing the CO2 emission levels. Utilization of Supplementary Cementitious 
Materials (SCMs) (fly ash, Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag and limestone) has been proven as one of strategic 
levers in manufacturing of cement at lower CO2 emissions. To assess the South African industry’s implementation of 
this strategy, the types of cements being manufactured as guided by SANS 5097-1 2013 and with respect to product 
offering to the market in terms of the formulation using raw materials in the manufacturing process were used for the 
evaluation purpose. The South African cement industry indicated to have 7 manufacturers that have integrated plants 
for producing cement thus associated with clinker production and 10 cement producers who manufacture cement by 
commencing the manufacturing process at the blending process stage.  Based on the market survey for the cement 
types being supplied in the market, the product offering ranged from CEM I, CEM IV and CEM V which made use 
of fly ash, GGBFS and limestone for reduction of clinker factor. The percentage clinker substitution was as high in 
the range of 6 to 62. This indicated a potential CO2 reduction of between 0.054 ton and 0.558 ton per 0.94 ton and 
0.38 ton of clinker utilized in producing the cement respectively. Although utilization of SCMs alone cannot be enough 
to reduce the emissions to 100% acceptable limits, the manufacturers were advised adopt additional potential 
decarbonization options such as decarbonization of the heat of burning through and Carbon capture, utilization, and 
storage as additional CO2 reduction strategies.

1. Introduction
As the economies grow and get wealthier, cement and concrete as construction materials increase in demand and this 
is particularly evident in emerging economies. Globally, the cement industry in facing challenges in business 
sustainability while reducing its carbon intensity from processes of production, uses of fuel and its end use of product. 
The world must reduce the greenhouse emissions by 80% below the 1990 levels. 
Utilization of waste process streams from other industries such coal fired Power Stations which releases fly ash, steel 
industry which releases Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) from and Limestone from quarry have been 
used as Supplementary Cementitious Materials (SCMs) mainly as the “nice to have” raw materials for producing 
cement. Their use has been to reduce the cost of manufacturing cement and for enhancement of properties of cement 
for suitability in different applications.

produce the composites cement types.  The benefits of manufacturing these cement types are due to potentially offer 
further usage of lowest clinker of 50% and 35% for CEM II/C-M and CEM VI manufacturing respectively.  
 
Evaluation of other cement manufacturing process technologies such as decarbonization of heat required for 
calcination of limestone and carbon capture storage and utilization are still required to further reduce carbon dioxide 
emission per ton of clinker produced. Furthermore, Limestone Calcined Clay Cement is a cement type that is gaining 
traction within South African context due to its potential to offer acceptable performance with respect to quality and 
reduced CO2 emission. This type of cement has a potential of being produced at lower clinker usage, lower temperature 
requirement on calcination of limestone which is about 800℃ relative to 1450℃ for clinker production. However, 
various quality clay deposits need to be identified, evaluated for lifespan so the sustainability of this option can be 
quantified to attract the investment. The implementation of these strategic projects to re-engineer the existing plants 
has a potential of improving employment rate in South Africa which was at 32.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023 as 
reported by Statistics South Africa (2023). 
 
7. Conclusion  
Based on the conducted cement supplier market assessment in South Africa, the transition of CO2 emission reduction 
through utilization of Supplementary Cementitious Materials was being fairly achieved. Though the percentage clinker 
substitution with SCM is of a certain threshold as per SANS 50197-1 as it affects the properties of cement being 
produced. There was a relationship between per-centage SCM usage for reducing clinker usage and CO2 emission. 
The relationship was based on what was known that 1 ton clinker production produces 0.9 ton CO2, thus per-centage 
amount of SCMs composition resulted with the same per-centage in CO2 emission reduction. The percentage clinker 
substitution with SCMs was as high as within a limit of 36% and 55% which reduced the CO2 emission between 0.576 
ton and 0.405 ton respectively. Most manufacturers with integrated plants had cement types ranging from Portland 
composite cements (CEM II) to composite cements (CEM V), thus indicated the manufacturers’ commitment to reduce 
CO2 emissions. The third party cement blenders are reliant on SCMs in order to manufacture eco-blended cement , 
thus contributing to lower CO2 emission in the cement value chain. 
 
Conclusion was also drawn that other consumers of cement produced with the supplementary cementitious materials, 
benefit in their final products quality improvements such as increased durability and strength, reduced alkali-silica 
reactions and sulfate attack meanwhile reducing CO2 emission during production.

Abstract 
Most manufacturers are striving to manage and improve their operations at the perspective of manufacturing costs. 
Equipment failures and breakdowns should be kept at minimal as possible, thus to increase availability of equipment 
within a production line. A coal fly ash processing plant experienced continuous equipment breakdowns or failures 
which resulted in loss of production time. Data was collected on a 31 days period to identify types of failures or 
breakdown and their frequency of occurrences, and time spent by maintenance personnel to rectify the failures. Cause 
and effect diagrams were used in order to assess the causes that lead to overall effect of failures. It was identified that 
pipe conveyor belt failure was as a result of torn metallic structures, belt not fitting fully on idlers, deformed idlers 
and belt was unfolding at any point on the station while running. Furthermore, pipeline leakages were also identified 
as contributing factors to failures. Pareto chart was used to analyse the failures and it was identified that 80% of the 
pipe conveyor belt failure are caused by belt not fitting fully on idlers, torn metallic structure and deformed idlers, 
meanwhile 20% are caused as a result of belt unfolding at any point while running. Meanwhile in the case of pipeline 
leakages, 80% of pipeline leakages caused by high coal fly ash operating flow rate and coal fly ash being corrosive 
which resulted with pipeline being torn, while 20% of the leaks were due to improper sealing on divetor valve.  It was 
concluded that incorrect maintenance procedures lead to the overall continuous failures at the plant and 
recommendations were made which mainly emphasised the implementation of maintenance program.

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
The quest for Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) strives for digitalization, machine learning and improvements within
existing operations for smart factory design through automation and less human intervention. Critical machine failure
within a manufacturing line results with unpredicted downtimes which ultimately which lead to high operational costs
and lose in profits within the facility. The unexpected failure of equipment halts the whole production line and it is
not cost effective to bring the system of production running while under conditions of emergency conditions which
further results with lose in customer’ trust (Kotwal et al. 2015; Zasadzień 2013). Maintenance activity within the
manufacturing facility has a potential of costing between 15% and 40% of total production cost (Mobley 2002), while
it is necessary to implement maintenance strategies for conservation of quality and share of market with product in a
production line (Nwadinobi & Ezeaku 2018). Equipment failures follow laws of nature accurately , for instance, if it
is loaded above its tensile strength, it breakdown while in the process of reaching the high pressure it does not break.
Efficient maintenance of equipment to ensure its available to production lines is an ever-challenging requirement due
to continued ever-changing pressure due to time and financial savings needed by a manufacturing facility. The volume 
of production might change due to seasonal requirements of manufactured products which apply much load on
equipment which later increases frequency of equipment failure when operated outside the required conditions
(Zasadzień 2013). Figure 1, illustrates the theoretical function of failure intensity λ(t) of equipment.

4. Conclusion  
Based on the failures being identified and analysed through cause and effect diagram, pareto chart, it is clear that 80% 
of the pipe conveyor belt failures or breakdowns is due to operational challenges that are linked to maintenance of 
plant equipment in general. In the case of pipeline leakages, the failures were related to requirements of improving 
the productivity of equipment by operating at higher flow rates with coal fly ash being corrosive and this affecting the 
lifespan of the pipeline based on its material of construction which were prone to corrosion.  
 
5. Recommendations 
Inspect and replace all torn idlers on the pipe conveyor belt station in order to minimise the rate of wear and tear due 
of the belt. Installation of additional idlers at the back of the idler station to assist the belt to fold and keep the piping 
structure/shape as is running. Welding of the structure groves to minimize belt damage as its running. The counter 
weigh needs to be at the required design for the belt to ran properly.

Abstract 
Although there has been a growing interest in the literature on supply chain ecosystems, there is still a lack of 
comprehensive understanding regarding ecosystems. There are gaps in knowledge, particularly in relation to the 
transformation of supply chains into ecosystems or their integration into existing ecosystems. While many academics 
advocate for supply chain networks to adopt an ecosystemic structure in order to increase their resilience and 
sustainability, there is a dearth of literature describing the precise procedures that enable the conversion of supply 
chains into ecosystems. The existing research indicates that a significant proportion, exceeding two-thirds of supply 
chain networks, encounter difficulties in transitioning into ecosystems. Notwithstanding the potential advantages that 
supply chain networks could reap from transitioning into ecosystems, a gap in understanding persists regarding the 
process of such a transformation. There is a limited amount of literature available regarding the optimal integration of 
information technology within supply chains as well as the appropriate levels at which such integration should occur 
within business processes and decision-making. This study adopts a grounded theory perspective to investigate the 
manner in which supply chain networks within the healthcare supply chain in Ghana expand their networks into 
ecosystems. The research focus has been directed towards the healthcare supply chain in Ghana due to the current 
efforts towards digitization and platformization. These efforts aim to enhance the ecosystemic orientation of supply 
chain networks within the sector. The primary aim of this investigation is to examine the mechanisms through which 
supply chain networks evolve into supply chain ecosystems through digital transformation and integrative capabilities. 
The author employs a qualitative approach and a case study design to utilize snowball sampling in order to ascertain 
the supply chain network of selected healthcare facilities in Ghana.  The present study employs social network analysis 
and thematic analysis techniques to analyze the transcribed interviews to explore the transformation processes across 
supply chain networks and how they integrate technology.

Abstract 
Literature reviews are important systematic ways of gathering relevant information on subject of interest. The 
emissions of carbon dioxide as one of the greenhouse gases during cement manufacturing impacts the environment 
through change in climate which results in temperature rises. Globally, the cement industry is under pressure to 
implement practical measures for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and achieving reduced emissions by 2030 
and carbon emission neutrality by 2050. This means that mitigation measures need to be developed for reduction of 
carbon dioxide emissions for every ton of cement produced. The manufacturing strategies available includes 
decarbonization of heat (for kiln burning), decarbonization through Supplementary Cementitious Materials, limestone 
calcined clay cement (LC3) production and carbon capture storage and utilization. The implementation of this 
strategies can be bring about strategic value by assisting in generating a framework for cement manufacturing with 
reduced carbon dioxide emissions and for long term, reducing unemployment rate. These strategies can be 
implemented within South African industry having noted that majority of cement manufacturers with integrated plants 
needs innovative ways of reducing emissions.   
Keywords 
Gases, emissions, climate, neutrality and framework. 
1. Introduction
Globally, climate change is an ongoing concern as contributed by industrial activities such as in the manufacturing of 
cement, steel and electricity from coal. This is because change in climate result with high ambient temperatures which 
ultimately leads to alterations of rain patterns, high rates of evaporation and droughts. The cement industry contributes 
to change in climate through the release of flue gases that constitute oxides of Sulphur, Nitrogen and mostly, carbon 
during limestone calcination process in a kiln.  
This means that as the production output of cement increases, the amount of CO2 emitted per ton ton of cement also 
increases based on its ratio. 
The industrial sector contributes a considerable share of emissions of greenhouse gases globally as noted between 
1990 to 2014 as the emission increased by seventy per cent on average or 2.2 per annum on average (de Pee et al. 
2018). Furthermore, the global production of cement was projected to grow by five times more than the levels in year 
1990 which is about 5 billion tones worldwide. When 1 ton of cement is produced, it emits approximately 0.89 tons 
of CO2 per ton of the cementitious material. The cement sector contributes approximately 5% of man-made emissions 
of carbon dioxide globally, meanwhile the in South Africa it contributes less than 1% in terms of the SA National 
Inventory gazetted (Association of Cementitious Material Producer 2011).  
The emissions within the cement manufacturing process are contributed as 50% due to production of clinker 
(limestone calcination in kiln), 40% due to usage of electricity and 10% due to transportation (Association of 
Cementitious Material Producer 2011).

The utilization of alternative fuels for reduction of carbon dioxide can only assist to a certain extend in manufacturing 
cement due to their potential of affecting the chemistry of the cement being manufactured, thus this is the limitation 
potential of alternative fuels.  
 
Reduction of carbon dioxide through heat reduction of thermal losses on flue gases also assist in reducing the amount 
emissions of the greenhouse instantly to the environment, however after enough heat is being recovered from the flue 
gases are being emitted to environment. Reduction of carbon dioxide through usage of supplementary cementitious 
materials in accordance with SANS 50197-1 2013 also assist in reducing carbon dioxide as clinker usage is less and 
is utilized for production of final cement product by making use of ground granulated blast furnace slag and coal fly 
ash in most South African manufacturers. Also, Limestone Calcined Clay Cement (LC3) production has a potential of 
less clinker utilization though use of calcined clay which required heat that is about 50% of the heat required for 
clinker production and this subsequently reduces carbon dioxide being emitted. Carbon capture, storage and utilization 
seems to be a promising option; however, it requires hectares of land for underground storage. For long term, this 
option can result in employment opportunities when implemented which can help to reduce the unemployment rate in 
South Africa.  
 
5. Conclusion  
The use of alternative fuels has a potential of reducing waste from other industries that are intended to be send to 
landfills, for instance, hydrocarbon sludge and tyres that have reached end of use, while heat recovery from flue gas 
assist in reducing heat losses and emission directly to the environment and meanwhile the utilization of SMCs can 
assist with clinker factor reduction to a certain extend thereby reducing use of clinker which subsequently reduces 
amount of clinker production which is associated with carbon dioxide emissions.  
 
Carbon capture, storage and utilization also requires hectares of land and other carbon dioxide conversion technologies 
to various useful forms. Most Portland cement manufacturers that have integrated plants are situated in North-West 
province of South Africa where land is limited, making it challenging to adopt this option.  
 
6. Recommendations  
Combination of these strategies within a cement plant can generate a framework which can be teste to 
reduce carbon dioxide emissions during cement production and subsequently converted into a patented 
model.

Abstract 
Project management is essential for achieving objectives within specified timeframes, but real-world projects are 
prone to various risks that can impede progress. Developing robust risk management systems can reduce associated 
costs and enable proactive risk mitigation. Yet, current risk analysis methods struggle with modern project 
complexities, leading to the exploration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. AI, particularly machine learning, 
crafts predictive models from past data for precise risk assessment. But AI's opacity sparks transparency and fairness 
concerns. To address these, eXplainable AI (XAI) enhances model interpretability. In project risk management, the 
incorporation of explainable AI (XAI) techniques is crucial due to the socio-economic impact and ethical perspectives 
associated with each project, and stakeholders are responsible for ensuring that decision-making processes align with 
logical reasoning and conform to ethical perspectives. However, the popular XAI technique, Local Interpretable 
Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), has limitations in capturing complex interactions and class imbalances. To 
address this, a novel approach integrates the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate meaningful samples and a 
rule-based decision tree model for complex interactions and nonlinearity. The expected contributions of the proposed 
study include improved interpretability and accuracy, handling complex models, and advancing XAI techniques in 
project risk management. To accomplish these goals, the study begins by selecting instances for the explanation, 
generating synthetic neighbourhoods using VAE, and fitting a rule-based decision tree model to capture complex 
interactions. This integrated approach strives to enhance interpretability, generate meaningful samples, and provide 
transparent explanations for informed risk strategies in project risk management.

Abstract 
Inflation has been one of the main issues that the Philippines has been dealing with, especially in navigating life with 
COVID-19 in the new normal. This study aimed to address the food security problems in the Philippines by comparing 
various fertilizer alternatives namely, organic fertilizer, chemical fertilizer, and used coffee grounds fertilizer. A field 
experiment was conducted to see the effect of organic fertilizer, chemical fertilizer, and used coffee grounds fertilizer 
on the yield and growth of Ipomea Aquatica (kangkong) in home gardening. An interview was also conducted with 
sixteen (16) respondents with regards to human preference on the physical characteristics and taste of the kangkong 
crop. The data between the relationships between the independent variables and fertilizers regarding physical 
characteristics was analyzed through One-Way ANOVA and the data for human preference was analyzed through the 
use of Kruskal-Wallis Test through SPSS. The results on the data for human preference showed that the kangkong 3 
(chemical fertilizer) stood up compared to the other two kangkongs, which was indicated by 62.5% overall appearance 
and 37.5% on overall taste among the kangkong. The proponents recommend using the coffee ground as a fertilizer 
as based on the computed data, the percentage of each fertilizer doesn't have a huge gap, especially on the taste, which 
is the criterion that is the most important for people who source their vegetables on planting. This study will help 
future researchers to consider a fertilizer with a high acidity level. Additionally, it will contribute to the community 
that promotes home gardening to have a much healthier and breathable air.

1. Introduction
 Fertilizer, a compound containing nutrients that improve plant growth and yield, has been used since the 19th century. 
The industry has evolved due to slow production caused by nutrient deficiency in organic fertilizers. Chemical or 
synthetic fertilizers have become more popular due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused fertilizer shortages 
worldwide, higher input costs, and fuel prices.The researchers aim to emphasize the use of organic fertilizer using 
coffee grounds, which can be easily found in households. This research is relevant to the daily livelihood of people in 
the Philippines, where the economic crisis has led to increased interest in backyard gardening. However, many 
Filipinos have lost jobs, leading to rising prices and food shortages. The country is a net importer of agricultural and 
food products due to limited land resources and the deliberate destruction of natural resources.The fluctuating inflation 
rate is a major issue, with many struggling to make ends meet as the cost of everything continues to rise. The Russia-
Ukraine conflict has also contributed to the increase in global agricultural and food commodity prices. The economic 
blockade imposed by Western countries on Russia has resulted in price increases for oil and its byproducts, such as 
fertilizer. The ongoing rise in unemployment rates is another issue to tackle. Many Filipinos have lost their jobs due 
to the COVID-19 lockdown, and opportunities have been limited, making it difficult for families to put food on the

Abstract 
During recent years, sustainability has been a relevant topic of common interest for organizations due to several 
factors. Likewise, continuous improvement is essential for the competitiveness of any company and the Lean 
Manufacturing philosophy is a fundamental pillar to fulfill this purpose. The objective of this research was to identify 
the contribution that Lean Manufacturing tools can make to sustainability. To do this, it began with a description of 
the background, history, and pillars of sustainability. Then, the foundation of the main Lean Manufacturing tools was 
explained, to finally relate the contribution of these tools to the seven sustainability principles included in the ISO 
26000 standard. The results obtained showed that several tools contribute to all the sustainability principles, while 
others only do so indirectly, the contributions identified were economic, social and/or environmental in nature. Thus, 
companies could initiate sustainability initiatives from the basic and early stages of production without having to resort 
to complex or specialized management systems.

1. Introduction
Lean Manufacturing is an oriental philosophy created by the Toyota company whose objective is to optimize processes 
and tasks within an organization, the philosophy that was built around this philosophy was the reduction of waste and 
elimination of tasks that do not add value to the final product. This improvement is achieved through tools, each one 
of them is different and has an individual purpose. However, they lead and contribute to the principles of Lean 
Manufacturing. Each tool contributes in different ways, for example, there are tools that help to better organize the 
activities of a process, if these tasks are organized, resources are optimized, unnecessary movements are eliminated 
and thus there is a better result. Similarly, there are other tools that are visual and allow finding unnecessary tasks and 
movements that are using resources unnecessarily, knowing these activities can be eliminated or improved and thus 
add value to the tasks, there are also tools that allow avoiding flaws or failures and even tools that apply to management 
level (philosophy).
On the other hand, we have sustainability, which for many people is also applied as a philosophy, which mainly seeks 
the social, economic, and environmental benefit of an environment. According to Miranda Pegueros et al., (2022) 
sustainability focuses on the balance between the economic, social, and environmental spheres in society so as not to 
compromise the quality of life of future generations. This topic is currently of common interest in society and is being 
considered in many aspects of daily life, mainly in organizations, which play a key role in the social and economic

but rather that there is an indirect contribution. That is, the benefits are derived from the initial purpose of the tool and 
are not directly appreciated. 
 
The analysis carried out in this work demonstrates that many of the lean tools can have an impact that goes beyond 
the technical improvement of productive and administrative processes. Usually, these tools and their application are 
designed to have their greatest application in production and operations environments, however it has been shown that 
their usefulness can go beyond what is usually thought. 
 
Certainly, when these tools were created, contributions to sustainability were not thought of, however, the potential 
that these tools continue to have is demonstrated and this work can serve as a starting point for future work where 
more in-depth recommendations can be made on how these tools can be used. tools can be used to promote 
sustainability and social responsibility.

Abstract 
The majority of the South Africans stay in the townships. Historically, townships have been segregated and reserved 
for blacks, Indians, and mixed-race. These areas were deliberately located far from economic activities such as 
shopping centres and other businesses. This gave birth to minibuses to transport township dwellers to work as they 
stayed far from work and mini shopping stores known as tuck shops. These townships have many other challenges 
that they face such as crime and poor economic activities with most of the businesses operating informally. This study 
aimed at outlining and understanding who are leading contributors to the township economy, the challenges faced by 
the township, and the opportunities they provide. In addressing this objective, this study followed a bibliometric 
analysis. The data that was collected was further analysed using the VOSviewer computer program. The research 
objectives were achieved in this study. About 688 publications for 64 years from the Scopus database were used in 
this study. The first publication was first recorded in 1959 to the last paper was recorded in 2023. It was found that 
China is the leading country in terms of publications and this is followed by South Africa. South Africa has more 
institutions that they are affiliated with for their research publications. Future research should focus on the importance 
of social entrepreneurship in addressing challenges faced by township dwellers.

1. Introduction
The township economy comprises businesses and markets that are based in the township. Therefore, in a broad sense, 
the township economy is referred to as the microeconomy that takes place in the township setting. It should be noted 
that the majority of these businesses and markets are informal and are basic survivalists. Unfortunately, 70% of them 
do not last for three years. The term township refers to urban areas (Omonona et al. 2021). Manyaka-Boshielo (2017) 
argues that townships are underdeveloped urban areas. In the South African context, townships were meant to racially 
segregate racial groups and use them as a labour pool for the colonial and apartheid economy (Strauss, 2019; Omonona 
et al. 2021). During the apartheid times, these places were strictly reserved for non-white South Africans. This means 
they were strictly for mixed race and Africans (Manyaka-Boshielo 2017). Mathibe et al. (2021) state townships were 
isolated from the economic activities. They were made to be far from commercialisation and economic activities. The 
township houses were made in a dormitory style. This setup changed the post-apartheid government when they 
introduced policies that addressed housing. About 50% of the South African inhabitants live in the townships. Sadly, 
South African townships are challenged by social issues such as a high unemployment rate, crime, and poverty 
(Kubone 2019; Omonona et al. 2021). Mbambo & Agbola (2020) posit that in the 1920s, many South Africans moved 
to the urban areas seeking economic emancipation.  
The township economy plays a very important role in addressing the high poverty rate, and unemployment rate and 
stimulating entrepreneurship in townships (Mathibe et al. 2021). The township economy consists of both the informal 
and the formal economy. Most importantly, the township economy plays an important role in providing skills, and 
work experience and creating and; maintaining social networks for the people who work and reside in the townships. 
Additionally, the township economy provides an opportunity for the youth to be lifestyle entrepreneurs and start and 
manage family businesses (Charman 2016). van Gaalen (2021) posits that the township economy creates employment 
for 17% of the total labour force and they contribute 6% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country. 
Omonona et al. (2021) argue that townships have a great influence on the political, social, and economic spaces of

6. Conclusion 
This study aimed at outlining and understanding who are the leading contributors to the township economy, the 
challenges faced by the township, and the opportunities they provide. This was achieved through the use of 
bibliometric analysis using Scopus databases for data collection and analysis. The data that was collected was further 
analysed using the VOSviewer computer program. The research objectives were achieved in this study. About 688 
publications for 64 years from the Scopus database were used in this study. The first publication was first recorded in 
1959 to the last paper was recorded in 2023. The top ten leading authors who are cited the most with the number of 
publications was identified in this study. Countries that have published and collaborated were also discussed in this 
study. China is the highest contributor and then followed by South Africa. It is recommended that for South Africa to 
increase the number of publications they contribute per year, the should be incentives and research grants for scholars 
who would like to do research in this discipline. Partnerships between government departments and institutions of 
higher learning should be forged so that they can address the unemployment crisis and professionalise township 
businesses. Future research should focus on the importance of social entrepreneurship in addressing challenges faced 
by township dwellers.

Abstract 
The increasing global warming temperature has caused pressure on all manufacturing companies to reduce their 
production emissions. Carbon dioxide (CO2) remains the highest greenhouse gas that is emitted daily. The beer 
industry is among companies that utilise fossil fuels to generate energy for production. This study explores the energy 
efficiency improvement opportunities that exist in African breweries to reduce CO2 emissions caused by beer 
production processes. To be able to identify improvement opportunities, the research determined the causes of high 
heat energy usage in the beer manufacturing process. Quantitative and qualitative secondary data and records from 10 
African breweries of Company X were used to analyse the relationship that exists between heat energy utilisation and 
CO2 emissions from breweries. High heat energy utilisation is caused by poor practices that exist in the breweries. 
The findings showed that when steam production has high boiler efficiency the total heat energy used will be reduced. 
The total steam usage by brewery processes and heat energy utilisation had a positive relationship. Statistical analysis 
showed a strong correlation between both boiler efficiency and steam usage with CO2 emissions for most of the 
breweries. The findings highlighted the importance of breweries being able to identify sources of heat energy 
inefficiencies. For sustainable improvements, capital investment into energy-saving technologies can be explored 
when energy wasters are eliminated.

Introduction
Africa reported its third warmest average temperature year in 2021 with a temperature of 1.33°C above average 
(NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, 2022). Climate change poses a higher risk to disadvantaged 
communities that contribute minimally to its cause and do not have means of protection. Global warming has caused 
increased natural disasters such as floods and disruptive storms, leaving many human beings without shelter (World 
Health Organisation, 2021). The 2020 Emissions Gap Report stated that 65% of the total greenhouse gases are from 
CO2 emissions caused by fossil fuels (United Nations Environment Programme, 2020). In 2021, global CO2 emissions 
increased by 2.58 parts per million, making the year the 5th highest increase in 63 years (Lindsey, 2022).  
The African beer industry is continuing to grow year after year with a total of 141 million hectolitres of beer produced 
in 2021. In the year 2021, South Africa was the highest producer of beer at 31 million hectolitres followed by Nigeria 
at 19.4 million hectolitres (Conway, 2022). This growing demand for alcoholic beverages is creating a need for green 
sustainability in the beer industry. Breweries utilise steam for brewing, packaging, and cleaning purposes. This steam 
is generated mainly from the coal-fired boilers that release CO2 emissions because of the carbon content in coal. The 
study will focus on the heat energy inefficiencies that are caused by African breweries during the production of beer 
and how this has an impact on CO2 emissions. 
Company X has committed to reducing CO2 emissions in the production of its beverages by 25% in 2025. Company 
X has managed to reduce greenhouse gases by only 13.58% in 2021 when using 2017 as the baseline. Heat energy 
usage is one of the ten KPIs used in the continuous improvement management system used by Company X. For a 
brewery to be rated world-class for heat energy usage, it had to achieve a 2021 target of 55 MJ/hectolitres of beer

equipment with the highest energy usage. Equipment are designed with specified energy requirements, the energy 
balance findings should be compared with these specifications to identify waste points. The current breweries studied 
do not have energy-saving technologies installed. When waste is eliminated, it is also recommended that breweries 
invest capital in installing energy recovery systems to have energy savings (Gross, 2020). The current 10 breweries 
utilised coal-fired boilers, and coal has been identified as the fossil fuel with the highest CO2 emissions. It is 
recommended that breweries explore the modification of the current boiler to start using natural gas for steam 
production. Breweries should install an air monitoring system that will measure the air supplied to the boilers. This 
will ensure that sufficient air is supplied to improve combustion efficiency. Production teams need to do regular plant 
walkabouts to identify steam leaks in their areas of work. When all breweries across Africa move towards greener 
beer production, the journey toward the 2050 goal of Net Zero Emissions will be accelerated. 
 
7. Conclusion and Recommendations 
7.1. 
Conclusion of the study 
The purpose of this study was to understand how the causes of high heat energy usage impact the amount of CO2 
emitted to the environment. The study did not only look at the production of steam by the boiler but also considered 
the usage of the produced steam by the beer processes. From the statistical analysis, the study was able to identify that 
boiler efficiency and steam usage have a strong correlation with the amount of CO2 released by the boiler during steam 
production. When breweries utilise a high amount of steam for beer production processes, that increases the kilograms 
of CO2 emitted. The global warming crisis increases the risk of human and animal deaths and natural disasters. It is 
the responsibility of all industries to implement technologies that will reduce the amount of CO2 they release. The 
study highlighted opportunities that exist in the beer industry that can be used to assist the current global warming 
crisis.  
 
7.2. 
 Recommendations for further research 
This research focused on the coal-fired boiler that produces steam, future research could study the heat energy usage 
for fuel types such as natural gas, biogas, and light-fuel oil to understand their impact on CO2 emissions. Breweries 
can utilise steam or hot water at very high temperatures for production and cleaning purposes, it is recommended that 
the two products be compared to understand how they can impact boiler efficiency, coal usage, and CO2 emissions. 
Breweries with implemented energy-saving technologies should be studied to further understand how technologies 
improve the total amount of CO2 that is emitted. The supply chain network for breweries also includes the 
transportation of raw materials and finished products. The amount of CO2 emitted by the mode of transport should be 
studied to understand the severity of its impact on carbon emissions. The research revealed a strong relationship 
between both boiler efficiency and steam usage to CO2 emissions. The causes of low boiler efficiency and high steam 
usage should be studied to identify solutions that can further improve heat energy utilisation.

Evaluating Applications of IoT and its Potential in South 
Africa’s Agricultural Sector

Abstract 
The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential of reshaping South Africa's agricultural industry, yet reservations about 
the sector's preparedness persist. Through a systematic literature review (SLR), this research endeavors to assess the 
implementation and prospects of IoT in the agricultural industry in South Africa. Among the research's key outcomes 
is that effective IoT use in the agricultural industry could boost production and profitability, although small-scale 
farmers find it exceedingly difficult to obtain substantial access to technologies owing to infrastructure and financial 
impediments. Furthermore, the government ought to engage in two tasks: 1) coordinating initiatives to garner funding 
and building infrastructure enabling smallholder farmers; 2) adopting data protection regulations. The research 
pinpoints a gap in previous literature covering the subject of the provision of resources for farmers in deploying IoT. 
It also offers valuable insight to farmers and investors, alongside proposals about investment and farming 
technologies. The most significant features in this research are firstly the aspect alluding to farmers’ upskilling and 
training on incorporating IoT and other innovative technologies in their farming practices; and secondly that the 
revenue growth of the agricultural industrial base becomes prioritized for new farming approaches. These suggested 
practices are envisioned to aid farmers integrate the latest technologies into their farming activities

1. Introduction
Food security for the world's expanding population depends on informed choices supporting farmers that are crucial 
for the world's food supply (Ramundo, Taisch & Terzi, 2016). To guarantee food security, the agricultural sector must 
balance demand alongside supply. Farmers might locate alternatives to fulfill their expectations with the use of the 
Internet of Things (IoT). Innovation using digital technology could boost agricultural output while lessening its 
adverse ecological effects (Ramudo et al., 2016). In certain areas globally, this might lessen prevailing food security 
threats (AIOTI, 2015). AIOTI (2015), argued that data collection, edge intelligence, data processing, analysis, and 
automation technologies can enhance food security and enable the improvement of management. Farmers must weigh 
their options and make trade-off decisions to maximize margins (Wen & Chen, 2014). Considering maize crops 
produced by thousands of smallholder farmers and 9 000 commercial maize producers within the Southern African 
Development Community (SADC) (Farming-Portal, 2020), research contrasts emerging and developed world 
contexts. South Africa's livestock business, comprising 13.8 million cattle and 28.8 million sheep, remains its largest 
agricultural sector (Farming-Portal, 2020).  
The United States (US) Department of Agriculture (2017) discovered that breakthroughs in risk management, business 
approaches, and cultivation techniques optimized farmers’ output without increasing input. The deployment of crucial 
inputs nevertheless plunged indefinitely. Between 1982 and 2007, the share of farming land in the US utilized declined 
from 54% to 51%, including 40% and 30% reductions in technician-based occupations and compensated labor. 
Through adopting technology, improved efficiency, and fertilizers, farmers managed to obtain over 50% of output 
(US Department of Agriculture, 2017).   
Historically, agriculture has been an indispensable aspect of life from the inception of humanity, yielding food and 
beverages, among other vital supplies (Greyling & Vink, 2015). Presently, agriculture is bolstered by manual data

Abstract 
The health and safety of women in construction in the form of the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) 
and sanitary facilities to female workers in South Africa was explored in this study. This specific focus is largely 
overlooked in the South African context. The study explored, through a qualitative approach, the perspectives and 
experiences of female construction workers (end-user) on the provisions of sanitary and personal protective 
equipment. The main source of data collection was through semi-structured interviews and further supported with site 
observations to triangulate the interview responses. The key findings of the study revealed that the availability of PPE 
for females in the certain parts of the construction industry in South Africa has improved as women are provided with 
female size PPE. However, quality and advanced gender sensitive PPE still needs attention. Sanitary facilities at 
established sites are generally up to standard. However, female workers still share these facilities with their male 
counter parts. Sanitary facilities at unestablished sites still need attention. Participation of women in construction will 
struggle to increase, as long as these issues persist.

1. Introduction
The specific needs of individuals should be considered, in relation to personal protective equipment (PPE) and sanitary 
facilities, that are sized and designed precisely, for a workforce that is increasingly made up of women (Hsiao et al., 
2016; Milligan, 2019; Oo and Lim, 2020). Through a scientometric review and meta-analysis of publications on the 
health and safety for women in construction, Mariam et al., (2021) found that the USA, South Africa and Australia 
had conducted more research on women’s health and safety in construction than other countries. There were, however, 
only four publications per country for South Africa and Australia. There is thus a scarcity of research in the South 
African context on health and safety provisions for women working in construction. 
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is designed to protect the body and is worn for protection against health and 
safety hazards within the work environment (Wagner et al., 2013). The safety-oriented design and production of PPE 
are critically important for the protection of all workers regardless of their gender, age or disability (Hsiao et al., 2016; 
Milligan, 2019; Oo and Lim, 2020). Studies have found that the poor provision of personal protective equipment 
emphasise the anthropometric differences that lead to ill-fitting PPE. (Hsiao et al., 2016; Milligan, 2019), that may 
allow hazardous material to come in contact with the user of the PPE (Mohd Amir Shazwan and Ee, 2018). Protective 
gear including fall protection harnesses are often too large and require adjustments to fit women and may hook on to 
objects on site (Cannon and Shah, 2019). Providing PPE that is tailor-made for women in the construction workforce 
is critical for ensuring their safety and providing an inclusive environment that promotes their well-being and success 
(Cannon and Shah, 2019; Milligan, 2019). 
Recent studies have also recognized that the health burden associated with absent or poor sanitation facilities falls 
disproportionately on women (Winter and Barchi, 2016).  Ness (2012); Thenguzhali and Veerachamy (2015) and 
Wong et al., (2020) argue that many of the problems that female construction workers face, are made more severe 
than in other industries by the construction industry’s temporary, dynamic, and decentralized nature. Temporary

Abstract 
As more tissues are harmed, wounds progress. Measurements of wound's surface area are taken at regular intervals 
to determine wound's progress toward healing. Measuring this method is time consuming, and routine evaluation is 
laborious. In general, wound healing may be broken down into two categories: contact & noncontact. Goal of this 
job is to make a reliable evaluation of wound's progress toward recovery. Taking pictures of the wound is first step 
in making a proper diagnosis. Pre-processing the wound picture to decrease noise by using effective filters and 
effective de-noising algorithms, & then segmenting wound region from wound image. Classifying wound pictures 
requires efficient classifiers. Chronic wounds are a major problem for many individuals. It's a huge issue in 
healthcare all throughout the globe. Treatments for chronic wounds involve routine examinations of wound's 
appearance and shape. This assessment frequently occurs via qualitative observation & manual wound measures. 
Many groups of scientists are now working on methods to evaluate the clinical progress of chronic wounds. The 
purpose of this research is to examine how imaging techniques may be used to treat chronic wounds. Research on 
the use of imaging techniques for chronic wounds is discussed. We evaluate their practicability, accuracy, & 
dependability. Planimetric approaches, volumetric methods, & tissue categorization make up remaining methods.

1. Introduction
Performing a precise and exhaustive wound evaluation is crucial for providing the best wound care possible. First, it 
helps doctors calculate how long a wound will take to heal and what kind of therapy is necessary, & second, it 
provides a valid outcome measure which may be utilized to evaluate efficacy of wound treatment program. Extent 
of wound is an important factor that must be considered throughout evaluation process (Kerstein 1997). Wound 
depth (Zhang et al. 2001), surface area (Kane 2001 and Coulomb 1986) width and length (MacLeod 1981) & 
volume (Mekkes 1995) are only a few of the measures that were established and verified to assess wound size. Both 
of these approaches have been compared. Although there are advantages and disadvantages to each technique, it is 
generally accepted that methods that estimate wound surface area as opposed to wound depth or volume are most 
accurate &reliable (Thomas 2002, William 1997, Herbin 1993 and Thomas 2004). While stereophotographic 
decisions might be most accurate way to determine wound surface area, alternative techniques, such as tracing 
wound on a sheet of transparent acetate or using  product of wound's width and length, have been found to be just as 
accurate and convenient (Plassmann et al. 1994). Assessment of wound bioburden and wound severity are additional

6. Conclusion 
The next step of this research is to create WIAC for accurate monitoring of wound recovery. Creating a robust 
classifier for quantifying the wound-healing process. Images of wounds are labeled according to their severity using 
classifiers. Color image processing methods such as categorization, filtration, denoising, & transparent overlay were 
employed to provide a useful tool for analyzing the wound-healing process. Helping a doctor diagnose condition 
of wound noninvasively by detecting cells in picture of wound & estimating how healthy those cells are. This 
instrument makes it simple to evaluate wound deterioration. Tool's efficacy may be determined by 
comparing pictures it uncovers with database of actual wound images.

Abstract 
They say the only thing that stays constant is change, and with technology, changes seem to happen more frequently 
than ever. The question that arises is how well the changes have been implemented and how well-equipped the systems 
in different industries are to carry them out. Despite being a medical disaster, COVID-19 has a bright side. Everyone 
has had to adjust to using technology. People in many industries were compelled to make sure they picked up the new 
working methods. Working from home became the norm, which in turn made connectivity through internet platforms 
essential. When smart cities were still in the planning and policy-development stages, ""jugaad"" technology started to 
play a part in them. This ""jugaad"" technology will function for the foreseeable future and will undoubtedly start the 
process of creating fully interconnected communities of people and businesses. The goal of this paper is to explore 
the obstacles to using technology in the education sector. The education industry has a wide range of stakeholders that 
can be considered. It is impossible to consider every aspect in a single study. Our goal is to identify the challenges 
teacher trainers have when providing online training. In order to further establish the cause-and-effect group between 
the criteria, we employ the multicriteria decision making tool DEMATEL. It is essential to eliminate the causes of the 
effects, improve the educational system, and produce smarter people.

Abstract 
Product sales and demand forecasting are crucial for future technological investments and technology strategy 
formulation. Forecasting technological diffusion plays a vital role in short and long-term product development 
planning. Extant literature has showcased the significance of diffusion modeling approaches in accurately predicting 
the production or sales of new products. The present study proposes forecasting the production trends of non-CNC 
and CNC-based metal-cutting machine tools in the Indian market. The study employs the Bass model to forecast the 
production of Turning and Milling machines introduced in the last five decades (1970-2019). The results demonstrate 
a decreasing production trend for non-CNC-based Lathes and Milling machines and an increasing trend for CNC-
based Turning and Machining Centres. The study findings also highlight the co-existence of multiple technological 
generations and its impact on dynamic market demand trends. The study has implications for machine tool 
manufacturers in anticipating market demand and strategizing technology and product development planning.

1. Introduction
Increasing uncertainty and ambiguity have raised concerns and challenges for product manufacturers and R&D 
managers regarding future production and sales of units. However, multiple techniques and approaches have been 
identified in the literature for effective product planning and strategic decision-making. Extant literature has identified 
forecasting as an efficient technique for gauging technological diffusion and innovation (Kang et al. (1996), Kim et 
al. (2009), Cho and Diam (2016), Lee et al. (2017), Duwe et al. (2018), Heymann et al. (2021)). Petropoulos et al. 
(2022) systematically reviewed the theory and practice of forecasting. The forecasting technique, in general, is used 
to predict future values based on patterns identified from current and historical values. In the case of technological 
diffusion and innovation, forecasting is employed for strategic anticipation (Meade & Islam, (2006) Peres et al. 
(2010)). Forecasting is usually employed to gain insights into market demand trends or technology emergence to 
enhance competitive advantage. The findings from forecasting aid R&D managers in effective resource allocation, 
directing innovation efforts towards adopting key technologies for product development. 
Diffusion and subsequent adoption of emerging and advanced technologies in new products can be measured using 
diffusion models. Forecasting methods are utilized to predict the future integration of emerging technologies into 
products and their consequential influence on markets, socio-economic factors, and technological systems. Among 
the fundamental and widely used diffusion models is the Bass Model, first introduced by Bass in 1969. Originally 
formulated for consumer marketing scenarios, this model will be further explored in the following sections.

5. 5 Managerial Implications 
The diffusion modeling approach assists R&D managers in strategizing and formulating new product development 
planning. The anticipation of production trends provides key actionable insights into future market trends and, thus, 
enhances firms' competitive advantage. Additionally, the model aids in demand forecasting for new products, 
facilitating informed production and inventory management. The study findings have significance in identifying 
technology obsolescence, forecasting new product introduction, and effective demand management. The study has 
implications for R&D managers anticipating market demand trends and aligning business goals/objectives for 
adopting future machining technological generations such as 3D or Additive Manufacturing, Digital Twins, and CPS. 
  
6. Conclusion  
Forecasting technological diffusion and adoption is significant for strategizing technology planning and product 
development. Technological competitiveness and development affect technological diffusion and adoption of 
advanced and emerging technologies. The current research aims to forecast production trends for two major product 
families – Lathes-Turning Centres and Milling-Machining Centres in the context of the Indian market. The study 
employed the Bass model to investigate technological generational diffusion patterns in machining technologies. The 
Bass model effectively captures the synergy among market potential, innovators, and imitators. The findings from the 
Bass model showcase a declining trend for the older technological generation and an increasing trend for new and 
advanced technological generations. In addition, the study highlights the co-existence of multiple technological 
generations. The study has implications for machine tool manufacturers in anticipating future market demand and 
strategic technology planning.

Abstract 
Many companies in Japan operate cafeterias in universities, offices, factories, and other locations. Cafeterias offer a 
wide variety of menu items, including set menus, rice bowls, and noodles. Japanese cafeterias have a variety of styles 
to serve food. In particular, a la carte menu is preferred by many users. In the a la carte menu, dishes such as the staple 
meal, main dish and soup are sold as individual items, rather than as a set meal. The menu allows customers to freely 
select dishes according to their tastes, quantities, and economics. Therefore, customers can be very satisfied. In the a 
la carte menu, it is important to combine dishes of various tastes and prices and to use ingredients with different 
textures when preparing a menu for a day. If there are similar dishes and the number of choices is small, the number 
of visitors to the cafeteria may decrease, which will lead to a decrease in sales. In addition, when preparing a menu 
for several days, it is necessary to consider constraints such as frequency of service, cooking methods, and budget. It 
is very difficult to manually find combinations of dishes that satisfy many of these constraints. In addition, the menu 
contents vary depending on the menu planner, making it difficult to continue creating high-quality menus over a long 
period of time. Therefore, there is a need for an automatic menu planning model to improve operational efficiency.The 
purpose of this study is to propose a menu planning model that considers the characteristics of a la carte menu based 
on mathematical optimization. We regard menu planning as ""finding the optimal combination of dishes that satisfies 
various constraints in the field for multiple periods from several sets of dishes"". Then, we formulate a menu planning 
model for a la carte menu as a ""combinatorial optimization problem"" in mathematical optimization. In this study, we 
took into account constraints on dish categories, frequency of serving some ingredients, and cost. To demonstrate the 
usefulness of the proposed model, numerical experiments are conducted using actual data from a cafeteria that serves 
a la carte menu. The cafeteria serves approximately 25 dishes per day, including staples, main dishes, and side dishes. 
The menu creator manually prepares menu lists for multiple periods over a long period of time.Numerical experiments 
using the mathematical optimization solver Gurobi Optimizer produced a menu for one month. The menu consisted 
of six dishes that is composed of staple meals and main dishes. The results of the numerical experiments were 
evaluated by menu planners of the cafeterias. They regarded the menu created by the proposed model as a menu that 
can be served in the field. The time required to output a menu was less than one minute. Compared to manual menu 
creation, the time required was significantly reduced.

Abstract 
The textile and clothing sector is one of the activities that contributes the most to the economy. In 2019, it contributed 
6,345 million soles to Peru's manufacturing gross domestic product (GDP); however, in recent years, this sector has 
lost participation due to the contraction in its production. The objective of this research is to reduce the production 
cycle time of baby socks, which impacts the monthly production levels and productivity in a clothing Micro and Small-
sized Enterprise (MSE). Success cases previously obtained through literature review were analyzed, and a proposed 
model was designed by applying lean manufacturing tools such as Value Stream Mapping (VSM) in the diagnosis 
component, Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) to improve Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) score, and 
Single-Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) to reduce setup time. The model was validated through simulation in Arena 
software. The result obtained showed a decrease in the production cycle time of 5.45% (from 1,829.53 minutes to 
1,729.77 minutes). This result is explained by the expected improvement of OEE by 13.88% and the expected 
reduction of setup time by 36.61%, so monthly production is expected to increase from 1,134 dozen socks to 1,200 
dozen socks. Finally, the initial productivity of 1.82 dozen/man-hours reached a final value of 1.92 dozen/man-hours, 
representing an increase in productivity of 5.49%. This case study can lead to the implementation of the model in 
MSEs in the textile and clothing sector that seek to improve productivity. Likewise, it can guide MSEs on the inclusion 
of lean manufacturing tools as an opportunity for continuous improvement.

1. Introduction
According to the Institute of Social and Economic Studies (2021), the textile and clothing sector is the third activity 
with the highest contribution to Peru's manufacturing GDP. In fact, in 2019, it had a 6.4% participation rate, which 
represented 6,345 million soles, only behind the industries of oil refining (13.6%) and non-metallic products (6.7%). 
However, since the last decade, the contribution of the textile and clothing sector to the Peruvian economy has 
decreased due to the contraction in the production of the textile sub-sector and the clothing sub-sector. 
The Ministry of Production of Peru (2023) indicated that in 2022, Peru recorded growth in the production of baby 
clothing compared to what was reported in 2020 and 2021; however, it is still below production level registered 
between 2013 and 2016 (see Figure 1).

5.4 Validation 
By validating the proposed model through simulation in the Arena software, the company is expected to reduce its 
production cycle time by 99.76 minutes, or 1.50 hours, due to the expected improvement in OEE by 13.88%, which 
means that the knitting machines would go from having a regular score of 69% to having an acceptable score of 
82.88%. This result is related to other success cases, such as the case of a MSE in the textile and clothing sector in 
Peru, which, by implementing the TPM tool, increased its OEE by 16.17% and production efficiency by 5.12% 
(Quispe et al. 2020). The same situation happened in a company dedicated to the manufacturing of clothing, which 
increased its OEE from 56% to 84% (Mejia and Rau 2019).  
 
This reduction in production cycle time is also due to the expected reduction in setup time by 36.61%, going from 
115.84 minutes to 73.43 minutes. This result obtained is related to the literature review, as is the case of a company 
in the Asian textile sector that, by implementing SMED, reduced the setup time of its machines by 18% (Bukhsh et 
al. 2021). Another company in the sector that implemented the SMED tool reduced the setup time by 52% 
(Campoblanco et al. 2022). 
 
It should be noted that some potential constraints or challenges could be evident during the proposed improvement 
process, such as the lack of prior knowledge of the company's workers regarding the lean manufacturing methodology 
and resistance to change in the organization because workers will have to put into practice new standardized 
procedures when applying lean manufacturing tools. 
 
6. Conclusions 
It was identified that the main causes of the problem related to the high production cycle time in the company are 
machine downtime and high setup time. Therefore, successful cases obtained through the literature review were taken 
as references, and a model was designed that proposed that the company apply TPM and SMED. As result, the 
company is expected to reduce its production cycle time by 5.45% and finally increase its monthly production by 
5.82% and its productivity by 5.49%. These indicators were obtained due to the expected improvement in OEE by 
13.88% and the reduction in setup time by 36.61%, so the objectives set at the beginning were achieved. 
 
Likewise, there is little research that proposes a model to reduce production cycle time in MSEs, so this case study 
can guide MSEs from different sectors, mainly those that belong to the textile and clothing sector, on the inclusion of 
lean manufacturing tools as an opportunity for continuous improvement. Additionally, the validation of the 
improvement proposal through simulation in the Arena software makes it possible to analyze the company's current 
and future production processes and predict scenarios, so it can serve as a theoretical basis for future academic 
research. 
 
Finally, for future research, it is suggested to extend the analysis in larger companies that belong to other industries. 
It is also recommended to carry out a pilot study to validate the results obtained through a literature review and the 
simulation and expand the scope of the research by focusing on other processes that are part of the supply chain 
management that will allow finding new opportunities for improvement in companies.

Abstract 
The significance of adoption and application of technological innovation in coal processing and/or beneficiation plays 
an important role in coal mining.  Organizations that are competitive and gain global recognition. The South African 
coal mining industry has been moving towards changing the narrative in coal process technologies over the past years. 
Therefore, it attracts coal mining process technology manufacturers to see opportunities for improved coal circuit 
designs that are simple, lean structural design, dry, and cost-effective solutions for quality coal processing and 
production. Hence, identifying the types of innovation solutions available for coal operations to explore the need for 
less intensive capital cost technologies to use for the production of Eskom coal product quality at 21MJ/kg.  The study 
looks into the impact of technology innovations applicable throughout the coal industry and the effects it has on 
production, separation efficiency, environment, and health and safety. However, more importantly, the research 
identifies the need for coal companies with a focus on understanding the need for process development and 
technological transformation to adopt new technologies. The drive-by technology transformation is reshaping the coal 
mining operations. The need for systematic capacity building and partnering with digital technology companies will 
equip the skills for real data analytics. Therefore, companies are recognizing the need for upskilling to operate 4IR 
and closing the capability gaps and improvement opportunities within the organization. The study findings reveal that 
SA is transforming its coal mining operation with the opportunities available for technology transformation. However, 
more needs to be done by established coal mining companies to collaborate with small and junior coal miners to also 
move towards realizing the benefits of using innovative coal process technologies. The involvement and partnering of 
the government, miners, and equipment manufacturers are vital for realizing and fostering business, economic growth, 
and job opportunities. Also, there is a need for mining organizations to upskill and reskill their employees to be 
empowered to perform their work effectively and improve business operations to be safer, sustainable, and profitable.

1. Introduction
A study by the Mineral Council South African Report (2019), states that the economic value chain for South African 
mining has a greater reach to unlock a substantial R213 billion of which 20% is in the coal commodity.  SA coal mining 
companies need to put more focus on adopting and implementing new technological innovations in the coal processing 
types of equipment and the benefits thereof. The study will also evaluate the technical improvements and economic value 
the adoption and implementation of these new technologies bring to the industry. 
In the past few years, the South African coal industry has been put under competitive pressure to find innovative ways to 
improve coal processing research and development for new technological equipment and methods. Therefore, the study 
evaluates the multi-case studies on plant process designs and the impact of new technology and new digital transformation 
will have throughout the beneficiation processes. The focus is placed on establishing the effects of the slow adoption of

6. Conclusion  
The overall data gathered from DMRE and McKenzie (report 2020), indicate the need for technology adoption throughout the 
full coal value chain for mining companies around the world and also in SA coal mining. However, due to the extensive use of 
water and medium costs, this technology is more effective for coal separation with near-dense material. The major impact of wet 
DMS technology is its significance to operations flowlines and management of slime dams, operations maintenance, and high 
management costs.  
 
The costs for putting up the dry FGX and DMS separation plant in SA have shown a significant difference in the capital cost as 
indicated in Table 7. The evaluation criteria of technology, innovations is the performance of the equipment to reach a criterion 
for quality and price. This research performed in SA coal has shown innovation adoption for using dry FGX separation 
technology for the production of Eskom products as an alternative to the wet DMS technology for producing Eskom products 
(CV values) of up to 21 MJ/kg 
 
The effect of selective mining and automation has a huge impact on job displacement thus South Africa needs to focus on creating 
new opportunities in the upstream sector, especially in the production of equipment used in mining operations such as truck 
fleets, excavators, crushers, and conveyor belts, and the chemical solutions used for extraction leaching processes. The emerging 
digital technologies in automated material characterization and online analysis can be built into the equipment and pre-
programmed for specific mines in South Africa.  
 
The implementation of new technologies studies and investigation in the South African context is the much-needed answer to 
competitiveness improvement, coal quality, and the required expansion of coalfield usage and reduction of environmental 
pollution and CO2 emissions.  The move towards a low-carbon growth trajectory and the realization of the potential of the Fourth 
Industrial Revolution enable systems of production and consumption to generate a clearer picture of how exactly the mining 
industry and the technological advancement, performance improvement of separate stages of coal processes and liquefaction 
products processing that significantly increases method efficiency is carried out in most countries

1. Introduction
Intelligent Substation (IS) is a cyber-physical solution that integrates intelligent-based electrical equipment and 
systems (those controlled by microprocessors) with the electrical supply chain. This enterprise solution aims to reduce 
operating expenses (OPEX) through increasing asset reliability and improving energy efficiency. In the past, many oil 
and gas assets would face high OPEX when electrical equipment failure and network disturbances caused unplanned 
plant shutdowns. Based on the series of situational assessments, studies, understanding of technical functionalities, 
and capabilities of the respective electrical equipment technology and systems, IS was developed to address the 
electrical equipment challenges and pain points. IS was established to address the pain points on “How Might We 
Integrate Artificial Intelligence (AI) on electrical equipment and system to visualize the real time conditions of 
electrical equipment towards eliminating unplanned downtime?”.  
IS is also referred to as Electrical Digital Twin, will make diagnostic of existing electrical equipment and asset, 
feasible. IS allows the digital twin to exchange information autonomously, enabling remote operation and control of 
equipment such as initiating actions of starting, stopping and synchronizing generators, opening and closing breakers 
and much more. The IS applications were developed using in-house algorithm, which utilize both real-time and offline 
data for prognosis, trending, artificial intelligence and big data analytics for real time electrical system and equipment

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
IS equipment analytics (particularly AHI) effectiveness and precision will continue to be enhanced with several key 
improvements. Firstly, expanding the range of monitored parameters beyond the basic ones currently observed would 
provide a more comprehensive understanding of the alternator's health. This could include variables such as voltage 
fluctuations, temperature differentials, and load variations, offering a holistic view of the alternator's performance. 
Additionally, integrating advanced machine learning algorithms into the AHI system would enable it to recognize 
subtle patterns and trends within the data, enhancing its predictive capabilities. Moreover, enhancing the AHI's real-
time monitoring features and integrating it with Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) sensors, technologies and robotic 
applications would allow for instant alerts and remote monitoring, ensuring rapid response to any irregularities. 
Furthermore, investing in research and development to incorporate new predictive maintenance models based on 
historical data would enable organizations to anticipate potential issues and plan maintenance schedules more 
efficiently. Lastly, to address the critical aspect of decarbonization, the AHI application will be incorporated into an 
enhanced green variant version, known as EverWatt. EverWatt stands as an end-to-end power generation optimizer, 
emphasizing the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions without compromising reliability. This innovative 
approach integrates machine health, energy system optimization, and GHG accounting within an AI power platform. 
Thus, with these comprehensive improvements, coupled with the integration of decarbonization via EverWatt version 
enhancement, it will collectively elevate the Generator Alternator Health Indicator, making it a robust and 
indispensable tool for proactive, sustainable and environmentally conscious equipment maintenance strategies.  
 
6. Conclusion  
This paper has presented the concept of Intelligent Substation (in realization of Electrical Digital Twin), that was 
developed and established based on guided pathways and trajectory of Remote Autonomous Operation (RAO) 
methodology. The paper has also demonstrated an example of equipment analytics application (AHI) that was patented 
and implemented in oil and gas facilities. 
 
In summary, the Intelligent Substation (IS) and its key Equipment Analytics application (e.g. AHI), have heralded a 
new era in industrial maintenance strategies, particularly within the oil and gas sector. IS, integrates intelligent 
electrical equipment with the supply chain, aiming to reduce operating expenses through increased asset reliability 
and enhanced energy efficiency. The success of IS and AHI has been evident across many oil and gas assets, 
showcasing substantial improvements in generator reliability and operational efficiency. IS applications value creation 
for the industry is expected to grow even more in the coming years. IS applications is currently being developed to 
cater for other electrical equipment, such as Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS), Switchgear, Protection Relay, 
Motor and Ex equipment. It will soon to be rolled out to more oil and gas and utility assets in the industry. The

establishment of IS is a key achievement in pursuit of PETRONAS techno-digital excellence. IS is future proof for 
PETRONAS as it provides the key foundation towards achieving the aspiration of attaining higher level of Remote

Abstract 
Healthcare organizations in the United States had significant financial difficulties following the COVID-19 outbreak. 
These were made worse by the healthcare industry's fast-evolving workforce, which was influenced by years of 
physical and psychological stress on personnel and led to retirements, resignations, and relocations. The cost of 
operating for healthcare organizations increased as a result of the need for more adaptable working conditions, greater 
wages, and better benefits. In the beginning, the government's pandemic funding was frequently used to subsidize 
expensive temporary or contract labor as a response to the healthcare personnel shortage. Healthcare organizations 
struggled with increasing labor costs and declining reimbursement rates when these funds ran out and inflationary 
pressures remained. This article describes a complete 6-week program held from July 6 to August 11, 2023, within a 
community-based healthcare system, to educate and empower clinical and operational teams in problem-solving and 
financial responsibility. Five guiding concepts (Pillars) were used by the Sustainable Management Above 
Reimbursement Transformation (SMART) initiative to direct cost-cutting activities: Practice Efficiency, Access 
Improvement, Working Differently, Expense Reductions, and Revenue Generation. The goal of an advisory panel 
supported by sub-teams was to find areas for improvement without sacrificing patient care while evaluating cost-
saving targets and suggested measures for various service areas. With an average predicted cost savings of 13% across 
service lines, the outcomes exceeded expectations. This successful initiative represents a significant stride toward 
financial sustainability in healthcare institutions, demonstrating the resilience and adaptability of healthcare providers 
during challenging economic times and offering valuable lessons for the future.

Introduction
Healthcare organizations around the United States and across the world have been impacted by significant financial 
pressures, especially in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic (Kaye et al., 2021; Moynihan et al., 2020; Gupta et 
al., 2021; Blumenthal et al., 2020; Xu et al, 2021; Leite, Lindsay and Kumar, 2020; Tessema et al, 2021). The 
healthcare workforce has been rapidly shifting given many years of physical, emotional, and health burdens on the 
staff resulting in early retirements, resignations, or relocations. Like many other industries, existing and new healthcare 
workers demanding flexible work hours, higher salaries, and better benefits resulted in higher costs for healthcare 
organizations (Ray and Cryan, 2021). Initially, the shortage of healthcare workers was mostly covered by temporary 
or contract workers at a much higher cost than the employed workforce. At first, these additional costs were 
supplemented by pandemic funds created by the United States government, however, upon expiration of these funds, 
many healthcare organizations focused on reducing these contract labor costs swiftly (COVID-19 financial impact on 
physician practices, 2021). However, given inflationary pressures and strong demand from the existing workforce 
keep driving overall healthcare labor costs higher for many healthcare organizations which are simultaneously 
struggling with lower reimbursement rates. According to Moody’s, a financial rating agency, salaries, and wages 
measured at a median growth rate of 7.3 percent in the first quarter of 2023 for healthcare organizations. Many 
organizations responded initially by restructuring or streamlining their administrative alignment and reducing their 
non-executive workforce. Nonetheless, ongoing financial pressures resulted in the layoff of 40,947 healthcare workers 
in the first seven months of 2023; a 101 percent increase from the same time period in 2022 (Kayser, 2023).

approach to reshaping healthcare stand as profound lessons imparted by the challenges posed by the COVID-19 
pandemic.  
 
As noted by Cardenas and Roger-Dalbert (2022), to facilitate accelerated innovation, the necessity for adaptability, 
resilience, and collaboration with the broader healthcare community and technology partners was recognized, and as 
time progresses, it will be observed which changes were temporary and which will be incorporated into the new 
process, but one thing is certain: a return to the pre-pandemic state is not anticipated. Wei et al. (2022) also advocate 
that current implementation process models overlook the need for rapid response and lack guidance for emergency 
scenarios like the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers suggest the creation of a swift response framework to guide the 
development of efficient and enduring strategies for addressing diverse healthcare policies and forthcoming research 
priorities in the healthcare sector. Bulent and Gozde (2022) promote a similar strategy by stating that the healthcare 
organization leaders i.e. administrators and managers need to exhibit greater dynamism and agility to thrive in a 
competitive landscape, ensuring they address the needs, expectations, and demands of both patients and staff to foster 
organizational flexibility. The capacity for quick adaptation and the rapid overhaul of different healthcare system 
processes might not have been a choice for numerous healthcare organizations; however, it became imperative due to 
regulations enforced by local and federal authorities as well as served as the sole means of surviving the disruptive 
pandemic (Bhandari, Badar, and Childress, 2021). Rapid transformation in healthcare delivery such as improving 
existing care delivery models and the adoption of digital and virtual care options is also on the rise on the onset of the 
COVID-19 pandemic as seen in recent years (Anil et al., 2022; Iqbal et al., 2022; Bartlett et al., 2023; Ramjewan et 
al., 2021; Hennek et al., 2023; Bhandari et al., 2022; Farrugia & Plutowski, 2020; Temesgen et al., 2020; O’Horo et 
al., 2021; Haddad et al., 2021; Ganesh et al., 2021; Lin et al., 2020; Bharucha et al., 2021; Mueller et al., 2023).  
While these insights are not new to healthcare institutions such as ours, they certainly merit acknowledgment and 
dissemination, fostering collective learning and advancement as healthcare providers are doing their best to provide 
care to their patients in this tough economic landscape.  
 
3. Conclusion 
No sector including healthcare is unstirred from the impact of the global pandemic (COVID-19) especially in the 
financial realm. This study which was conducted in a community-based hospital in a rural midwestern region showed 
that a structured team-based approach can be fruitful in bringing different functional groups (departments and clinical 
areas) on the same page in a time of difficulty in a very brief timeline. The outcome of the final implementation of the 
proposed improvements is yet to be seen but the proposed improvements can be taken as a positive sign to setting a 
positive tone within the organization within the clinical areas through the highest level of leadership.

Abstract 
This study is aimed at using various statistical analyses within the Design of Experiments (DOE) technique to 
investigate and analyze the effect of welding process parameters on the tensile strength of A36-grade mild steel. 
Three process parameters and two corresponding levels were considered and the MIG welding process was 
performed. The ideal conditions to achieve the highest strength were determined and the results were obtained by 
running the design on a statistical software Minitab. This experimental study found that the only factor having a 
significant contribution to the tensile stress of the plates in the selected scenario is the weld speed. In addition, 
this study provides valuable insights for enhancing welding procedures and techniques. The paper concludes with 
a reasonable interpretation of the test results and justifies the research questions that were proposed.

1. Introduction
Welding processes are used in various industries such as manufacturing, construction, automotive, and aerospace. 
The strength of the welded material is of immense importance as it directly indicates the overall quality of the 
parts produced. A failing welded part can not only cause huge losses to manufacturers but can also compromise 
the safety of end users. A good quality weld can always help with product durability and longevity. A statistical 
methodology such as DOE can be incorporated to optimize the welding parameters and establish the preferred 
quality and strength.  
Process and quality improvement tools especially utilizing lean and Six Sigma concepts are widely used in both 
manufacturing and service sectors (Freimut et al., 2005; Soković et al., 2009; Verma et al., 2021; Alblooshi et al., 
2022; Bader et al., 2020; Badiru, 2005; Bhandari et al., 2021; Soltani and Bhandari 2023; Bartlett et al., 2023; 
Verma et al., 2022).  Design of Experiments (DOE) is a powerful technique that is often used as an applied 
statistical tool that deals with planning, conducting, analyzing, and interpreting controlled experiments in a 
laboratory to explore and evaluate the factors that control the value of a factor or various factors (Bower, 2023). 
This technique can be used in various situations including but not limited to improving processes and systems, 
understanding the relationship between the response variable and different factors, and identifying factors that 
significantly impact the outcome of the response variable (Srebrenkoska et al., 2016; Walston et al., 2022).  
DOE is also a systemic approach to studying cause-and-effect relationships. Technology commercialization and 
product realization operations, such as new product design and formulation, manufacturing process development, 
and process improvement, all heavily rely on experimentation (Montgomery, 2017). DOE helps predict the 
changes in input variables, also known as factors, onto the output variable, the response variable. DOE also helps 
in identifying the crucial interaction effects and takes into account all the possible combinations of factors 
considered in the experiment (Anderson & Whitcomb, 2017).  
Powerful and dynamic statistical software like Minitab is most suited to experiments with large amounts of data. 
The program interface is designed to be simple and user-friendly. In addition to the tools required to design and 
analyze experiments, Minitab supports most of the other statistical analyses and methods such as basic descriptive 
and inferential statistics, SPC, reliability, Gage R&R studies, and many more (Mathews, 2004). 
The combination of these various tools and techniques gives businesses methodical ways to improve their 
operations, output, and customer service. These advancements enable focused improvements by first assisting in 
the identification and analysis of inefficient or defective areas. Secondly, they facilitate data collection and

5.2.9 Contour Plot 
 
Figure 19. Contour Plot 
From the contour plot (Figure 19), values lying in the dark green region would yield the highest tensile stress for 
the plates. 
5.2.10 Response Optimizer 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 20. Response Optimizer Solution 
The Response Optimizer in Minitab (Figure 20) yielded the ideal welding process parameters. The wire speed 
should be 40 inches per minute, the voltage setting should be at 3, and the travel speed should be maintained at 9 
inches per minute.  
 
6. Discussion 
The analysis using statistical software validates the interdependence of these welding factors and the response 
variable, and further study using the response optimizer confirms the interaction between them. It was found that 
the only parameter with a significant influence on the tensile stress of the steel plates was the travel speed. As 
shown by Swami et al. (2018), the filler material tends to settle evenly while welding at slower rates and can 
positively affect the microstructure of the joints. This clearly asserts that to achieve a higher strength of the steel 
plates, one needs to weld at lower travel speeds.  
 
In welding procedures, ensuring the quality and safety of manufactured products is of prime importance. Novice 
workers play a crucial role in this setting. Kobayashi et al. (2001) have highlighted the importance of specialist 
training for these individuals. Such training helps to maintain a safe working environment in addition to improving 
the skill sets of employees. These efforts guarantee the safety of people involved in the welding process as well 
as the quality of the final product by bridging the gap between theory and real-world application.

To summarize, this study has thoroughly examined various welding parameters through statistical analysis in order 
to determine how they affect the tensile strength of mild steel. The results reveal the intricate relationships between 
key variables and provide insightful information for improving welding procedures. The results of this study also 
support the ongoing improvement of welding techniques since it is important to maintain exceptional tensile 
strength in steel applications. Overall, this work provides a push toward improving the effectiveness and efficiency 
of steel welding procedures in a range of industrial settings.

Abstract 
The utilization of carbon fiber 3D printed specimens is progressively expanding across various applications that need 
exceptional levels of strength and stiffness. Nevertheless, the impact strength of these specimens may be influenced 
by several parameters, including carbon fiber content, infill pattern, density, printing speed, and layer thickness. This 
research study uses the design of experiments (DOE) methodology to examine the parameters that influence the impact 
strength of carbon fiber 3D printed specimens. A statistical model has been established to forecast the impact strength 
of carbon fiber 3D printed specimens, taking into consideration the elements. The study's findings indicate that the 
impact strength of carbon fiber 3D printed specimens is mostly influenced by the infill density in comparison to other 
parameters. The impact strength is significantly influenced by the interaction effects of layer thickness, infill pattern, 
and infill density. The statistical model created in this research may be used to ascertain the most suitable 
amalgamation of variables to get the intended level of impact strength for a certain application. This phenomenon has 
the potential to enhance the overall performance, longevity, and safety attributes of many items.

1. Introduction
Carbon fiber is a lightweight yet durable material that is composed of carbon atoms bonded together in a crystalline 
structure. It is known for  the composite material known as polylactic acid (PLA) and is characterized by its ability to 
combine the strength and stiffness often associated with carbon fiber, while also offering the user-friendly and versatile 
properties of PLA filament. The use of this material is widely favored in 3D printing applications that need exceptional 
levels of strength and stiffness, particularly within the aerospace, automotive, and sports equipment sectors. The 
strength of carbon fiber material in a 3D printed component may be influenced by many variables, such as the infill 
pattern and the thickness of each layer. Identifying the key determinants of impact strength from an extensive range 
of variables has significant importance. The use of Design of Experiments (DOE) is a methodology that enables the 
examination of various factors and their impact on a given result. 
The use of Design of Experiment (DOE) is a statistical technique that enables the optimization of product or process 
design. The use of this method facilitates the examination of the impacts of multiple variables on a given response 
variable. The DOE methodology is founded upon the notion of randomization, whereby the parameters under 
investigation are systematically modified in a random sequence. This approach aids in mitigating the impacts of bias 
and confounding variables. 
The DOE is often carried out in two phases, the first is the planning phase where the researcher focuses on the variables 
to be investigated and the response variable to be measured. Additionally, a statistical model is constructed by the 
researchers to forecast the response variable by considering the various aspects.  During the experimental phase, the 
researcher carries out the experiment in accordance with the established statistical model. Subsequently, the 
researchers proceed to gather empirical evidence pertaining to the response variable, followed by a comprehensive

5.4. Conclusion 
Upon the successful completion of the experimentation and data analysis, three main key insights were observed: 
1. With the experiment carried out, it is evident that Infill Density stands out as the sole main effect 
parameter with significant influence on the response. This significance is likely attributed to the fact 
that as density increases, approaching its maximum value of 100%, the part transitions to a completely 
solid state. Consequently, the importance of the other two factors hinges upon the chosen infill density.  
2. Secondly, all of the two-way interaction effects, namely Layer Thickness - Infill Density, Layer 
Thickness - Infill Pattern, and Infill Density - Infill Pattern, prove to be noteworthy factors in affecting 
the response.  
3. The experiment reveals that the maximum response value, indicating the maximum energy required to 
fracture the part, is achieved when employing a layer thickness of 150 µm, an infill pattern of gyroid, 
and an infill density of 50%. These findings collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding 
of the experimental outcomes.

for vehicle and passenger safety. To fulfill the purpose, ADAS are responsible for generating, processing and utilizing 
huge amounts of instant and real time data to make decisions, even in critical moments. This paper aims to investigate 
the importance of Database Management Systems (DBMS) in the management of data generated and processed by 
ADAS. The paper also discusses the various types of data used by ADAS, how data plays a role in the functionality 
of ADAS, and the challenges faced to manage data. This paper also explores the importance of DBMS in managing 
ADAS data, highlighting how it assists the system to store, retrieve, and manage data with the assurance of data 
integrity, consistency, and security. The paper includes elaborated case studies of ADAS implementations that have 
effectively used DBMS. It studied trends in ADAS and DBMS and discussed how these trends will play a role in the 
future of ADAS. The paper concludes with recommendations for effectively implementing DBMS in ADAS. The 
study done in this paper is important for automobile manufacturers, ADAS developers, and database administrators 
as it gives valuable insights into the effective management of data in ADAS, which contributes to enhanced safety of 
the vehicle and passengers.

become more widespread and standardized globally. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In ""A Comprehensive Study on The Role of Database Management Systems in Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems,"" 
we have meticulously examined the symbiotic relationship between DBMS and ADAS. Our exploration has 
underscored the indispensable role of robust data management in bolstering the efficacy and advancement of ADAS 
technologies. As vehicles grow increasingly autonomous, the streams of data they produce and rely on become more 
voluminous and complex, necessitating advanced DBMS solutions that ensure real-time processing, impeccable 
integrity, and stringent security. 
 
Looking ahead, the fusion of DBMS and ADAS is poised to spearhead a revolution in vehicular technology and 
transportation safety. With the integration of real-time data processing, edge computing, and AI-driven analytics, 
ADAS is set to transcend its current capabilities, paving the way for vehicles that are not only self-reliant but capable 
of predictive self-maintenance, and highly personalized user experiences. The impending trends within DBMS — 
enhanced cybersecurity, scalability, and regulatory compliance — will ensure that this technological progression 
unfolds within a framework of safety and privacy. 
 
In conclusion, the future of vehicular technology is inextricably linked to the evolution of DBMS. The continued 
advancement of ADAS depends on a foundation of secure, efficient, and intelligent data management systems that 
can handle the increasing demands of sensor data processing, machine learning models, and global communication 
networks. As these systems evolve, they promise to enhance the safety, reliability, and enjoyment of transportation, 
transforming our roads and shaping the future of mobility. The journey ahead for ADAS, underpinned by robust 
DBMS, is not only exciting but also vital in our quest for a safer, more efficient, and interconnected world.

Abstract 
As the world's greenhouse emissions increase, there is a worry about the need to address the role of development in 
the transportation industry responsible for the majority of emissions. The sector consumes vast quantities of fuels 
forcing nations to enact guides on regulating the use of fossil fuels. One measure includes diversification of energy 
sources for transportation through consideration of biodiesel. The choice is motivated by the simplicity of integration 
of the supply chain for a resource that relies on raw material links with other core components. In UAE, biodiesel 
consideration demands the enactment of a collaborative institutional approach in developing a biodiesel supply chain. 
As part of the proposal to develop an integrated supply chain, this text describes measures and tactics for developing 
the integrated supply chain for biodiesel in the UAE. The process will connect users of cooking oil, with the 
manufacturers of biodiesel, and consumers of biodiesel in the transportation industry. The analysis for evaluating the 
violability of the supply chain involves the use of Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), and Supply Chain 
Management Globe software. The process will help access the prospects and the potential of the raw material Used 
Cooking Oil (UCO), which is an essential component in determining stakeholder's willingness to supply their use coil 
cooking oil for the manufacture of biodiesel. Part of the research involves data collection using questionnaires 
disseminated to the UAE society, afterward, the analysis of the same using the structural equation modelling technique 
follows. As per the SEM results, there is a prospectus of people championing recycling due to awareness of UCO 
recycling that eases the donation of household waste for biodiesel manufacture. The study conducted using SEM 
revealed a lack of public awareness regarding UCO recycling in the United Arab Emirates but highlighted a 
willingness to participate, particularly among larger households. It is equally promising that the Supply Chain 
Management Globe software is facilitating optimization of UCO collection bin placement, and simplification of the 
UCO donation by inspiration communal participation in biodiesel production.

Introduction
The changing times are witnessing the consideration of biofuels as alternative sources for fossil fuels responsible for 
increasing greenhouse emissions.  The prospectus for the energy source is ignited by the urge to address the challenges 
of urbanization. The viability for the biofuels which will likely transform the energy sector is also arising due to 
transformation in perceptions of the rising costs, (Maxime Merheb, 2018). There is awareness of the ecological risks 
of carbon-intensive fuels ignited by global demand for clean energy sources. Part of the transformative advances in 
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is driven by the urge for maximization of the potential benefits of biofuels. As part 
of the nation's agenda, the UAE aspires to lead advances and technologies for renewable energy through sustainable 
global energy production initiatives. The action aligns with the aims of improving air quality in the nation as part of 
the 2021 National Agenda, (Environment, 2019)

about UCO recycling and suitable/ proper disposal methods for used oil. The process of sensitization can be initialized 
through public campaigns and educational initiatives. 
 
Incentivization: There exists viability in encouraging the donation of UCO in exchange for volunteering hours. As 
noted, the incentive-based approach is critical in boosting recycling rates. In the proceeding section a critical task is 
discussed regarding the location of the UCO bins. In that stage, a heavy reliance on population density data was needed 
to determine the right number of bins. In order to adequately meet Dubai's population demand. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In summary, the study shed light on the UAE's consumption patterns, emphasizing the prevalence of larger 
households and the limited awareness about Used Cooking Oil (UCO) recycling. These findings underscore the 
immediate need for targeted sensitization and educational programs that promote sustainable practices among 
residents. 
The SEM analysis validated the critical link between recycling awareness and biodiesel production, emphasizing the 
pivotal role of education and incentivization. Additionally, the integration of Supply Chain Globe software, coupled 
with the Center-of-Gravity Method, revolutionized the UCO collection process. Through strategic placement of ten 
hubs and optimized routes, the supply chain achieved heightened productivity and reduced transportation costs. This 
strategic approach not only ensured operational excellence but also seamlessly aligned with the sustainability goals. 
Therefore, the outcomes from utilizing SCM Globe in this paper are substantial. This advanced supply chain modeling 
tool enabled the comprehensive planning of the UCO collection network. The strategic placement of bins, optimized 
collection routes, and detailed analyses of costs and emissions significantly reduced transportation costs and 
minimized emissions, validating the efficacy of this approach. Beyond affirming the feasibility of the biodiesel supply 
chain, SCM Globe provided invaluable insights crucial for shaping future sustainable initiatives. 
This study underscores the urgency of integrating cutting-edge tools like SCM Globe into environmental projects. 
Through education, meticulous planning, and innovative technologies, this can pave the way for a greener UAE. By 
fostering recycling awareness and enhancing biodiesel production, it is not just addressing immediate challenges but 
also building a sustainable future for generations to come.

Abstract 
In order to transmit real-time video, a CCD camera was implemented as the transmission medium. To process the 
input facial image, an MPEG file was created using DirectShow SDK, which supports multimedia streaming in 
MicroSoft Windows. Based on the 20 input feature points, the location of the feature point in each frame was based 
on the location of the same feature point in the previous image. The two-dimensional facial features were tracked 
using a template matching method using a coarse-to-fine tracking method that changes the template size in the search 
area of this particular region. The coarse-to-fine tracking method is one of the registration strategies that performs 
registration while increasing the resolution. When performed in real time, a transition image with appropriate 
resolution can be obtained within the desired time. However, if the data is acquired incorrectly at low resolution, there 
is the potential for errors to propagate. Matching refers to the task of selecting candidate feature points in the second 
image that can correspond to a particular feature point in the first image. Using the 2D coordinates tracked from the 
right and left images, 3D coordinates could be obtained using stereo image tracking points. The 3D data obtained 
allowed the creation of a compatible file in 3D Studio MAX, a 3D package.

1. Introduction
In face recognition and expression recognition, a lot of research is being done to extract facial parts from images and 
extract areas and features such as eyes and mouth from the extracted facial parts. The study of facial expression has 
been studied in various scientific fields and significant achievements have been achieved. Based on this knowledge, 
many technical challenges need to be overcome in order to display 3D animations naturally, and facial expression 
recognition, which can estimate a person's internal state from facial images, is also being actively researched. In this 
study, we used two CCD cameras that input facial movements to generate MPEG files using the DirectShow SDK. 
We have developed a system that tracks 3D positional movements based on multiple facial features and maps the 
resulting coordinate values to a graphics package. The camera used for location determination has a wealth of 
information that allows a versatile response to stored image analysis and can extract features from stored data. We 
created a package compatible program to convert the data for use in 3D graphics. 
2. Body
The DirectShow framework defines how multimedia data streams are controlled and processed using modular 
components called filters. Filters have inputs and outputs or all pins and are connected together in a configuration 
called a filter graph. The application uses an object called the Filter Chart Manager to assemble and move data through 
the filter chart. The Filter Graph Manager automatically manages the data flow. The Filter Graph Manager provides a 
COM interface to allow applications to access the Filter Graph. An application can call the Filter Graph Manager 
interface directly to control media streams or use the Media Player control to play media files. Therefore, you can 
access DirectShow through the media player control, which is a COM interface, or you can access DirectShow through

In this article, two CCD camera devices were used to save the left and right images of an MPEG file using the 
DirectShow SDK. 
 
As a result of tracking with the template matching method using the coarse-to-fine method that changes the template 
size, two-dimensional coordinates were created. This method allowed us to create a file compatible with 3D Studio 
MAX, a 3D graphics package, using a 3D tracking algorithm. 
In this study, it became possible to move function points, such as expressing different facial expressions, using 3D 
data. However, this study had 
 limitations in installing light-blocking film, fixing the camera, and using marked feature points in facial images. 
As a result of the research of this work, methods of connecting two CCD cameras using a personal computer and 
methods of tracking feature points using unlabeled facial images should be investigated. 
Through this study, it is expected that it can be applied to various fields such as natural composition and real-time 
animation, similar to existing characters rather than virtual ones. 
 
3. Conclusion 
The problems of visualizing and analyzing key issues using R-program word cloud techniques are first caused by the 
omission of technical terms and new words in the Korean dictionary (KoNLP), secondly, the analyst's poor use of R-
program and poor interpretation of third visualization. Heuristic preprocessing and post-processing processes are very 
important, which must be extracted from low-frequency but high-importance words, and which are not included in 
the commercial Korean dictionary are manually added. Therefore, the proposed problem solving and refining model 
are evaluated to be very useful for increasing the reliability of the verification result data and analysis results, and 
these measures are meaningful as practical application guidelines for word cloud techniques. 
 
Future research should be conducted on commercial word cloud techniques that can improve the reliability of 
unstructured text analysis, not interest-oriented or text-design word cloud, by complementing the problems of the 
development and research results for big data analysis.

Abstract 
In this study, a four-legged walking robot with legs is selected so that it can be applied to different surfaces, and 
studies on gait, structure and control were reviewed, with a greater emphasis on stable walking. What is important 
about walking is to ensure stability so that the center of gravity (or ZMP) is within the polygon formed by the legs 
supporting the ground. For this purpose, a mathematical model for kinematics and inverse kinematics suitable for the 
robot's leg joints was established. The motion trajectories of the torso and each foot were generated using third or 
higher order functions, and the angular values of each leg joint were obtained through their relative motion and an 
inverse kinematics model programmed in MATLAB. The angular value obtained as above was applied to ADAMS, 
a dynamics simulation software, in the form of a spline. The ADAMS model used at this time was constructed by 
importing 3D CAD CATIA data from an actual produced dog-shaped robot, creating constraints and joints for each 
joint and providing contact relationships between the toes and the ground. ADAMS simulation results confirmed that 
the planned walking pace was sufficiently stable. These gait patterns were again applied to the robot itself to confirm 
its walking ability, and the distance sensor was installed to improve the robot's navigation ability by equipping it with 
obstacle detection and response capabilities.

1. Introduction
Recently, the role and importance of robots has increased and expanded into our everyday lives. Research on different 
types of mobile robots is constantly evolving, and robots with legs are classified into bipedal, three-legged, four-
legged and multi-legged robots according to the number of legs. Below them, four-legged robots walk on two legs. 
Legs Compared to robots, it is generally better able to adapt to its environment and can walk more efficiently than 
robots with many legs. In order to implement the stable walking of a four-legged robot, first study the data and research 
results on observing animal walking, adopt or develop an appropriate theory among the existing theories to ensure the 
stability of walking, and apply it to the robot at. A stable control algorithm must be created. 
Accordingly, the subject of this study was a four-legged walking robot that has excellent adaptability to the 
environment, is capable of various walking movements and is suitable for performing various tasks by moving objects. 
2. Body
Among the various running patterns in animals, walking is the most common pattern. When walking, the robot has no 
special acceleration force and at least three legs are in contact with the ground, and at some point all four feet are in 
contact with the ground. The order of the feet is shown in Figure 1. In tigers, a weight of 1.2 times body weight is 
exerted vertically on the forefeet; when walking, a weight of 0.9 times body weight is exerted. hind feet. And when

3. Conclusion 
Existing research results on four-legged walking were examined and analyzed. Based on the walking of four-legged 
animals, a stable robot walk was developed and verified through simulation. In addition, an experimental four-legged 
walking robot system was fabricated and experiments were conducted on basic movements such as walking, obstacle 
detection and reaction. 
 
When planning the movement of the toe based on the movement of an animal, it is very important to use a smooth 
curve with a cubic function or more, and when building a mathematical model to calculate the exact joint, derive an 
inverse kinematic solution angular value corresponding to the path the toe This has been confirmed. Meanwhile, the 
plan was to achieve the animal's general duty factor by designing the running patterns to go forward and forward. 
 
The walking movement was planned assuming that the robot's body moves parallel to the ground. On the other hand, 
the dynamic analysis includes friction with the substrate and there is slippage on the contact surface. The stability was 
predicted by kinematic analysis and the stability of the stage was checked by dynamic simulation of the pattern created 
on this basis. This showed that stability prediction was possible by comparing kinematic analysis and dynamic analysis. 
The manufactured four-legged robot has the advantage of being small, cheap and easy to manufacture, but especially 
the RC servo motor for joint drive has the disadvantage of insufficient position and speed control. 
 
In the future, there is a need for research in the field of running technology that can move autonomously to the 
destination while avoiding obstacles through the use of faster and more sophisticated DC servo motors and PC-based 
control units.

Abstract 
Recently, the importance and usability of facial recognition technology has gained more attention over time. 
Applications include access control, attendance management system, e-commerce, financial transactions, ATM, 
online banking user authentication system, electronic payment system and airport search. It is used in various fields 
such as systems, web user authentication systems, intelligent video surveillance devices, computer security and 
information security systems. Facial recognition technology is superior in terms of ease of use because it requires no 
special contact or action from the user and has the advantage of being able to perform a surveillance function by 
storing facial images. A representative method for face recognition is the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) 
algorithm. However, facial recognition technology uses a person's face as biometric information, so it is very complex 
and has many variables such as diversity of facial information and lighting conditions, so there is a problem of low 
recognition speed. In this paper, we use wavelet analysis to implement a face recognition system that is robust to the 
diversity of face information and illumination of the traditional principal component analysis method. To evaluate the 
performance of a face recognition system using wavelet transform and principal component analysis, a comparative 
analysis is performed using the traditional principal component analysis method and the Fisher linear discriminant 
analysis method. The recognition speed is improved by changing the image data for wavelet analysis to conditions 
that are robust to light and facial expressions. Experiment and simulation results show that wavelet transform and 
principal component analysis methods show a more stable improvement rate for face recognition than the traditional 
PCA method.

Abstract 
In Paraguay, numerous companies engaged in the production and marketing of pet food strive for continual process 
improvement to remain competitive in a dynamic and globalized market. Therefore, the formulation of a set of 
strategies directed towards tackling the challenges encountered by a company specialized in the marketing of pet food. 
In this context, this project aims to propose enhancements to logistics and commercial processes within these 
companies. The methodology comprises three main phases. Firstly, interviews with business owners are conducted to 
comprehend their service expectations, identify perceived strengths and weaknesses, and pinpoint market 
opportunities and threats. In the second phase, historical company data is analyzed. In the third phase, data is examined 
through process observation and interviews with involved staff members. The processed information is then used to 
create process flowcharts, offering a detailed insight into their functionality. Finally, considering market demands, 
company policies, and efficient resource utilization, solutions are formulated to constitute a comprehensive 
improvement plan. With these enhancements, the company experienced a 200% increase in sales. The improvement 
plans involved reducing task interactions from 2 to 1 employee, enabling logistic planning for product delivery and 
sales representative visits. Additionally, eighteen distribution zones were established, each with an assigned sales 
representative.

1. Introduction
In an era characterized by globalization, rapid information flow, technological progress, customer-centric paradigms, 
and the perpetual evolution of markets, enterprises are confronted with an inexorable need to continuously bolster 
their competitive edge. Achieving this necessitates the establishment of streamlined processes that yield positive 
repercussions on productivity, cost efficiency, product quality, and punctual delivery. 
A noteworthy characteristic of the subject company lies in its reliance on outsourcing as a linchpin of its production 
processes. This strategic orientation enables the organization to focus its energies on higher-level functions, 
encompassing administrative intricacies, supply chain orchestration, marketing strategies, logistics optimization, 
intellectual capital management, and more. By harnessing the inherent advantages of this approach, coupled with a 
well-structured synergy between the company and its outsourcing partners, there is an auspicious outlook for realizing 
substantial benefits (Smith and Johnson, 2021). 
However, following an initial scrutiny of the logistical and commercial procedures in the pet food industry, discernible 
opportunities for refinement have surfaced, poised to augment the overall operational efficiency of the company.

5.3.2. Order Tracking 
The implementation of an application that allows monitoring the status of orders registered by sellers is proposed. 
The advantages associated with this proposal can be summarized as: 
• Customers with higher levels of satisfaction and loyalty towards the company. 
• Reduction of possible product shortages due to undetermined causes, fraud and/or theft. 
 
5.3.3. Quality control 
The improvement proposals corresponding to the quality control of raw materials and the finished product produced 
by the outsourced company are presented. The quality control proposal focuses mainly on the standard production 
process, which initially occurs in the raw materials supplied by the company and the finished product in the outsourced 
company. It is shown in the Table 3. 
 
For the reception of the raw material, the quality specifications must be defined, that is, the criteria that the raw material 
must meet in order for it to be acceptable for use in production. This may include characteristics such as appearance, 
odor, taste, size, texture, moisture, and chemical composition. 
 
For finished product control, it would include criteria such as nutrient, protein, fat, carbohydrate, fiber, and vitamin 
content, as well as other important characteristics such as particle size, appearance, aroma, and taste.

6. Conclusion 
The company experienced a remarkable 200% increase in sales due to a comprehensive strategy focused on enhancing 
operational efficiency and competitiveness. These improvements streamlined order-taking processes, optimized 
delivery logistics, and integrated a robust enterprise management system. Task interactions were reduced from two 
employees to one, allowing for better logistical planning, and eighteen distribution zones were established, each with 
an assigned sales representative. 
 
Moreover, these changes significantly reduced operational costs and greatly improved customer service. Sales 
representative performance saw a substantial boost as they could allocate more time to effectively serve customers, 
strengthen client relationships, and promptly address their needs. This enhanced customer service resulted in increased 
customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
 
Furthermore, the strategic enhancements led to more informed decision-making through the generation of detailed 
reports. Geographic categorization of customers enabled more efficient distribution and reduced transportation costs. 
Customized visit frequencies were implemented to cater to the unique requirements of each zone. Quality control 
measures were enforced for input materials, ensuring a higher-quality and more consistent final product. 
 
The positive impact of these improvements extended beyond operational efficiency, positively affecting the company's 
market position and profitability. This case study highlights the transformative potential of strategic enhancements in 
driving efficiency and competitiveness in the pet food industry, making it a valuable reference for other companies 
facing similar challenges.

Abstract 
In recent decades, there has been a notable surge in eco-friendly investments among prospective and current market 
participants. It has now evolved into an imperative standard for contemporary business decision-making. The critical 
challenge lies in the adept selection of investment portfolios that can effectively address both sustainability and 
profitability concomitantly. This task inherently involves a multi-dimensional nature, necessitating the consideration 
of various, sometimes conflicting, metrics. Consequently, this study proposes an advanced decision-making 
framework that amalgamates Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) with Artificial Intelligence (AI). In contrast to prior 
research, which predominantly focused on determining investment portfolios based solely on target profitability, this 
study extends its purview to encompass sustainability considerations. This expansion aligns with the prevailing 
business trend that prioritizes fostering an eco-friendly atmosphere. While the DEA-based approach has demonstrated 
its supremacy in performance evaluation, it exhibits a notable limitation – a dearth of forecasting capability. To address 
this limitation, we introduce the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), an AI methodology renowned for its superior 
predictive capacity. This integration is inspired by ensemble learning principles, aimed at harnessing complementary 
insights from diverse contributing models. Through the incorporation of this model, the role of market participants 
undergoes a profound transformation, shifting from retrospective and current monitoring to proactive future planning.

1. Introduction
Global warming has caused international issues in recent years, prompting the whole world to take action to reduce 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, enhance sustainability, and find ways to deal with it. According to the World 
Economic Forum’s Global Risks Report 2023, more than half of global risks relate to the environment. Many countries 
have formulated related policies/strategies on sustainability issues, and Taiwan also follows this path and has 
announced its Climate Change Response Act handled by Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) and has set 
the goal of “net zero carbon emission by 2050”. They aim to impose a carbon fee on 287 large carbon emitters that 
emit over the 25,000 metric tons. Furthermore, regulators also require publicly listed companies to disclose 
sustainability reports that cover greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and how their operations affect the environment. 
The semiconductor industry in Taiwan is a strong economic booster and also plays a core role in the supply chain for 
electronic devices. Even as this specific industry brings considerable economic benefits, it also is accompanied by 
large energy consumption and poisonous material generations, thus impeding sustainability development. Most studies 
formulate their investment portfolios by just consider the target’s financial performance, ignoring the side effects 
generated from the investment target when they run their own business. To fill the gap in the literature, this study 
formulates an investment portfolio that considers both economic and sustainable performances of investment targets. 
How to develop an appropriate performance evaluation architecture turns out to be a critical task, especially in a highly 
turbulent economic atmosphere. Most studies rely heavily on financial ratio analysis, such as returns on assets, and 
returns on investment. However, these performance evaluation architectures just look at a one-input and one-output 
variable, which cannot capture the inherent business operations. To combat this, data envelopment analysis (DEA) 
with its merit of handling multiple input and output variables has been its usefulness in performance evaluation. By 
broadening the factors of investment portfolio generation, users have a higher chance to gain profitable returns under 
anticipated risk exposure.

6. Conclusion  
This study introduces an innovative investment portfolio selection strategy that integrates DEA and AI techniques by 
considering financial and sustainable indicators. The results show that the investment portfolio selection strategy that 
considers the sustainable indicator performs better than the strategy without considering the sustainable indicator. 
Users can thus consider the potential implication of formulating a future investment strategy as well as maximizing 
their personnel wealth through this model.

Abstract 
Every year, a significant number of people are injured while using products in their homes or as a result of their 
misuse, emphasizing the importance of risk communication. The purpose of this study is to assess the consistency of 
color perception and hazard rating among male and female participants in Pakistan with American National Standards 
Institute (ANSI) recommendations. Undergraduate students from various academic backgrounds participated in the 
study. 
The findings show that color perception and hazard rating differed between male and female participants. Participants 
showed significant mean differences when comparing colors, with some colors rated as more dangerous than others. 
Surprisingly, the perceived hazard ratings generally matched ANSI recommendations. However, there were some 
inconsistencies, especially in the differentiation of certain colors. Notably, neither male nor female participants 
distinguished significantly among ""Blue"", ""Green"", and ""Yellow."" Females did not distinguish significantly between 
""Blue vs. Orange."" Males, on the other hand, did not perceive ""Green and Orange"" as significantly different. In 
addition, they (males) did not significantly distinguish between ""Yellow and Orange"", and similarly they did not 
perceive a significant difference between ""Red and Black."" Both (male and female) participants perceived Red as the 
most hazardous. However, Female participants provided lower scores as compared to male participants.  
These findings offer valuable insights into the complexities of color perception and its implications for warning label 
design. These results underscore the need for further research to better understand the relationship between color 
perception, cultural influences, and hazard communication, particularly in the context of product safety.

1. Introduction
A significant number of people are injured each year while either using or misusing products in their homes (Wogalter 
2006). Prevention of injuries has constantly been a top priority for all (Gopang et al. 2017). Safety standards (guides 
to good practice) should be instituted to reduce the number of accidents (Khahro et al. 2020). As noted by Borade et 
714","Proceedings of the Second Australian International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management, Melbourne, Australia, November 14-16, 2023 
© IEOM Society International 
These findings provide important insights into how Pakistanis interpret the use of colors in product warning labels. 
When color was examined as a variable, the study found that it had a significant influence on participants' perceived 
hazard ratings, regardless of gender. Notably, the sequence of perceived hazard levels, from low to high, closely 
mirrored the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) guidelines in ANSI Z535.4. To indicate increasing levels  
While the overall color ranking corresponded to ANSI recommendations, no significant differences were observed 
between specific color pairs. For example, among male participants, Blue had the lowest perceived hazard rating, but 
this rating did not differ significantly from Green and Yellow. Female participants, on the other hand, perceived Green 
as the least hazardous color, and it did not significantly differ from Blue and Yellow in terms of perceived hazard. 
These color perception nuances highlight the complex interaction of cultural factors and individual preferences in 
shaping how warning colors are interpreted. 
 
Similarly, participants in this study could not tell the difference between Blue and Green. This finding is consistent 
with the findings of Zielinska et al. (2017), who discovered a lack of significant differentiation between these two 
colors. Interestingly, Blue received the lowest mean score ratings from male participants in this study, mirroring the 
perceptions of participants in the United States as reported by (Lesch et al. 2009). 
 
Female participants in this study, on the other hand, rated Green as the color associated with the lowest level of hazard. 
This observation is consistent with the preferences of Indians, who rated Green as having the lowest perceived level 
of hazard, as documented by Borade et al. (2008). 
 
Furthermore, both male and female participants consistently rated Red and Black as the most dangerous colors. 
According to these findings, Red and Black have distinct perceptual significance among both groups of respondents. 
This is consistent with the findings of a study by Lesch et al. (2009) which found similar results among Chinese 
participants. Surprisingly, participants in the United States demonstrated significant differentiation between these 
colors. In contrast, a study published in 2022 by Buchmüller et al. (2022) found that German participants rated Black 
as more dangerous than Red. According to a study conducted by Borade et al. (2008), Indians perceived Black as less 
dangerous than Red and even Orange.  
 
These findings witness that cultural differences in color perception exist. These color perception differences spotlight 
on the impact of cultural and regional factors.  
 
6. Conclusion 
This study investigated the perception of warning colors within the context of Pakistani culture and its implications 
for hazard levels, with the goal of aligning these perceptions with the ANSI recommendations. The findings provide 
useful information about how Pakistanis interpret warning colors on product labels. Color had a significant impact on 
participants' perceived hazard ratings regardless of gender. Notably, the perceived hazard levels closely matched 
ANSI's recommendations in ANSI Z535.4, where the colors Yellow, Orange, and Red are used in ascending order to 
represent increasing levels of hazard. Certain color pairs, however, did not show significant differences in perception, 
unfolding the complex interplay of cultural elements and individual preferences in designing perceptions of warning 
colors. These cultural differences in color perception highlight the importance of different cultural backgrounds and 
individual perspectives on how colors are associated with hazard levels.  
Integrating these suggestions into future research endeavors has the potential to make significant contributions to the 
development of more impactful and culturally tailored product warning labels. Such efforts would, in turn, improve 
consumer safety and comprehension not only in Pakistan but also on a larger scale. Furthermore, the findings of this 
study will be critical in guiding Pakistan in the formulation of product warning labels, which is a highly concerned 
missing aspect in the Pakistani context. The study presented the findings for one critical factor, the color of product 
warning labels. Other discrete components, such as symbols, signal words, and their combinations, should also be 
investigated in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of creating impactful warning labels that cater to the 
cultural and anthropological needs of the Pakistani population.

Introduction
Industrial engineering plays a vital role in swiftly delivering solutions of the utmost quality and affordability to 
prevailing challenges. One such challenge that has garnered attention is the issue of water shortage. This concern spans 
both local and global dimensions, presenting formidable obstacles to sustainable progress and environmental 
preservation. Recent times have witnessed a model shift towards pioneering strategies for conserving water resources, 
particularly within the area of irrigation systems. A notable factor contributing to water wastage is the suboptimal 
efficiency of irrigation methods. Conventional techniques, while historically employed, now prove to be inefficient. 
For instance, the standard irrigation approach of supplying 12–15 liters of water per day for every square meter of 
land yields a staggering 30% loss due to evaporation. This is a point of major concern in desert lands like the UAE. 
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a nation grappling with a scarcity of freshwater resources.  According to 
EcoMENA, UAE ranks among the top ten countries in the world facing water scarcity challenges. In addition, it has 
one of the highest rates of water consumption globally. Enhancing water resource management in the United Arab 
Emirates can benefit numerous regions by rejuvenating their groundwater systems, conserving water, and improving 
water and irrigation quality. The capital city, Abu Dhabi, is notable for hosting the most extensive network of 
wastewater treatment facilities.  
2. Literature review
Water scarcity is a crucial concern especially in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since it has one of the highest per 
capita water usage rates in the world at 550 liters per day, a country characterized with a dry climate and limited access 
to freshwater resources. With the country's primary emphasis on agricultural diversification and the development of 
exotic plantation, good water management strategies become urgent.  
Historically, traditional irrigation methods like floods, furrows, and 'Aflaj' systems were used to water agricultural 
lands in the UAE. Today, and with advancements in technology and growing concerns about water scarcity, modern 
irrigation techniques have gained popularity in the region.  Notably, a (2019) study undertaken by India's Department

This proposed technology has the potential to ensure a long-term sustainability of the UAE's exotic plants by 
mitigating water scarcity, maximizing growth of plants and crops around the country by addressing challenges such 
as landscape distortion (caused by cluttered irrigation pipes), improper plant irrigation, and wastage of water due to 
extended watering periods. This irrigation system will operate with increased efficiency and effectiveness, aligning 
with the desired outcomes sought by industrial engineers when tackling challenges.

1. Introduction
Today, thanks to human capacity, the development of various societies with great achievements in various fields has 
allowed the survival and comfort of the population. However, this only sometimes considered the impact of industries 
and everyday tasks on Earth. Given this, the question arises about the efforts and possible improvements that help to 
reduce the environmental impact they generate. One of the fields with the most significant effect on environmental 
deterioration is the energy generation industry since it uses non-renewable resources. In consequence, the 
dissemination and innovation of clean solutions is sought. However, it is necessary to consider some factors, especially 
if these will be implemented in cities, such as the factors: economic, existence of the resource, efficiency for the 
utilization, and social and environmental factors (Barragán-Escandón et al., 2019). If developed and utilized 
efficiently, renewable energy sources will go a long way toward providing energy security, ecological employment, 
and sustainable growth and development (Maji, 2015). 
Following a review of the relevant literature, a technology capable of generating energy was identified, allowing a 
society to meet its requirements. Energy harvesting (EH) is a technique for collecting and generating energy from 
diverse sources, such as mechanical stresses and vibrations. Due to the pervasiveness of motion and vibration, 
mechanical energy harvesting technology has attracted considerable interest (Ali et al., 2021). The energy research 
works on a tile prototype that has installed piezoelectric sensors that make possible energy transformation when people 
step on it. Also, a system capable of reducing or eliminating negative environmental impacts is recommended. In 
2018, Martínez and Alcántara (2019) demonstrated a 3.8% increment on using clean energies.  
In addition, even though the Multidimensional Energy Poverty Indicator (MEPI) has progressively decreased, Coello 
et al. (2018) declare there are still approximately 7.3 million Peruvians who still do not have access to electricity. 
Gouveia et al. (2019) demonstrate that energy poverty vulnerability assessment at such a disaggregated regional scale 
could bridge the divide between conventional country-wide analyses and local-scale initiatives aimed at vulnerable

10 peak hours and 74 standard hours a week are considered, as well as an input of 140 and 30 people per hour, 
respectively. Considering a conversion of 4.3 weeks per month, 394131.12, 489328.33, and 526052.97 volts were 
obtained for the first, second and third tours, respectively. If an intensity of 0.4 A is maintained in all the routes, a 
total of 563.8 KW per month would be generated. This allows us to verify the viability of the tile since the ""Multicenter 
Benavides"" consumes an average of 450 KW per month. 
 
Likewise, it seeks to identify the benefit-cost of the tile, which has a cost of 10,000 PEN for the implementation of 50 
tiles, which have a useful life of 10 years. For the ""Multicenter Benavides,"" 200 rafts of 40 cm x 40 cm would be 
needed, thus having an investment of 40,000 PEN and a cost-benefit of 1.30. A simple energy metering rate 1E is 
used, which has a cost of charge for active energy of 0.784 PEN/KW.h, with this obtains that the ""Multicenter 
Benavides"" has an energy charge of 434.34 PEN per month; that is, 5212.03 PEN per year. 
Likewise, it seeks to identify the benefit-cost of the tile, which has a cost of 10,000 PEN for the implementation of 50 
tiles, which have a useful life of 10 years. For the ""Multicenter Benavides,"" 200 rafts of 40 cm x 40 cm would be 
needed, thus having an investment of 40,000 PEN and a cost-benefit of 1.30. 
 
6. Conclusion 
To conclude, it is determined that the application of the prototype under study is feasible because the test and 
confirmation of positive results in the analysis of the objectives are achieved.    
Regarding the main objective, after comparing the results of the three runs. It is concluded that the first case has an 
efficiency of 316.4 volts per person, which allows covering in its totality the demand of KW for the ""Multicenter 
Benavides"". 
Similarly, it can be concluded, based on the results of the specific objectives, the feasibility of the implementation, 
since the cost of conventional energy consumption is wholly eliminated since the capacity of kW generation per month 
is greater than what is consumed monthly in the market.  
Finally, a cost-benefit of 1.3 is obtained. This means that for each tile invested for ten years, there will be a return of 
1.3.

Abstract 
In Paraguay, the opportunity to use soybean hulls in paper production stands out thanks to its cellulose content (around 
40%). Therefore, the most economically convenient process has been identified in this work providing an estimated 
cost per tonne of paper pulp obtained from soybean hulls, in order to be installed in paper industries seeking to expand 
their product portfolio. The methodology adopted was based on a bibliographic review that allowed the theoretical 
analysis of soybean hulls characteristics as a raw material in paper production and the analysis of cellulose extraction 
processes from agro-industrial waste. Using only 6% of the total soybean hulls produced in the country in one year 
(203,566 t), a profit of US$ 1.6 million will be obtained at a sales price of US$ 775/t, making its economic value 
higher when it’s used in paper production than in exportation or animal feeding.

1. Introduction
Soybean hulls holds a high cellulose content (40%) (Camiscia et al., 2018), and its utilization as a raw material could 
be of interest to the paper industry. With large-scale production of paper made from soybean hulls, there would be a 
reduction in the quantity of imported paper reels and fiber pulp, whose values range between 600 and 900 US$/t 
(Dirección Nacional de Aduanas [ADUANAS] 2019, Banco Central del Paraguay [BCP] 2019, Veritrade 2020). 
Additionally, the identification of the most economically viable process is expected to facilitate its application in 
cellulose pulp industries seeking to broaden their product variety. 
During 2019/2020 harvest, Paraguay ranked fifth among the world's leading Soybean producers with 9.9 million 
tonnes and, ranked fourth as an exporter of Soybean with 5.9 million tonnes (CAPECO 2020, CAPPRO 2020). 89% 
of Soybean seeds used for planting in Paraguay come from Brazil (MAG 2019).

Figure 6. Profit vs. soybean hull utilization according to main uses. 
 
With a sales price equal to US$700/t of cellulose, the value of soybean hulls used in paper production will be similar 
to that exported internationally (US$97/t), while with a sales price equal to US$770/t, it will have a value close to that 
used for animal feed in Paraguay (US$130/t). 
 
Regarding the opportunity to produce printing or writing paper from soybean hulls and offer it to the market, for each 
tonne of cellulose pulp, 425 paper reams with a total of 212,500 A4-sized sheets (21 x 29.7 cm) would be obtained. 
The cost of A4 sheets of soybean hulls paper would be close to 15.6 Gs/sheet and, it is expected that at a sales price 
similar to unbleached sugarcane bagasse paper (43 Gs/sheet), its profit value would be close to 175% (JW Enterprises 
S.A. 2020; Bringco 2020). 
 
Assuming only 6% of usage of the total amount of soybean hulls produced in a year, calculated using the Simple 
Moving Average Formula, the percentages corresponding to each use of soybean hulls are shown in Table 11.

6. Conclusion 
The literature review allowed to identify methods for Soybean hulls utilization. Process studied by Carvajal et al. 
(2016) stands out as the most convenient in economic and efficiency terms. In combination with a reagent recovery 
system of 85%, more than 40% of yield is expected at a cost of 484 US$/t of cellulose extracted from soybean hulls.  
 
The utilization of soybean hulls in paper production could reduce the costs associated with importing cellulose pulp 
for paper production, which currently amount to US$4 million per year locally.  
 
A pulp production’s line setup at a cost of US$ 484/t, using only 6% of the total amount of hulls produced in Paraguay 
in a year (203,566 t), would generate US$ 1.6 million of profit at a sale price equal to US$ 775 and having a higher 
economic value than the hulls exported or used as animal feed.  
 
It is expected that the valorization of this residue will generate a positive socioeconomic impact in Paraguay. With the 
40% of available hulls utilization, about 48,000 tonnes of wood and more than 330,000 m3 of water would be saved. 
 
For future work, there is a need to characterize Paraguayan soybean hulls to determine the real amount of cellulose 
that can be extracted from them, along with the costs and benefits that their extraction implies.

Abstract 
Low productivity is a persistent challenge in diverse industries, necessitating ongoing efforts to identify and rectify its 
underlying causes. Factors influencing productivity, such as workplace conditions and management practices, are of 
paramount importance. This study focuses on the crucial steel industry, which plays a foundational role in the economic 
development of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), serving as a catalyst for numerous associated businesses. The primary 
objective is to conduct an in-depth exploration of the factors affecting productivity within the UAE's steel industry. 
This research aims to comprehensively identify these factors, assess their relative significance, and evaluate their 
impacts using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) as a decision-making methodology to provide insights that can 
empower productivity improvement initiatives and enhance the overall efficiency of the steel manufacturing system. 
According to the outcomes of the research, visionary management (with a weightage of 24.28%), government policies 
and regulations (16.75%), and financial stability (12.60%) are important factors for productivity improvement in steel 
manufacturing industries.

Introduction
The steel industry is a cornerstone of global manufacturing, vital for constructing buildings, electrical appliances, 
automobiles, and machinery. However, its production process is characterized by intensive energy use and substantial 
environmental impact. Steel production primarily employs two methods: the blast furnace and the electric arc furnace. 
The former, accounting for over 70% of steel production, relies on recycled iron ore, coal, and steel. In contrast, the 
electric arc furnace predominantly uses recycled steel and electricity. This process involves filling the furnace with 
scrap steel, generating heat through electrodes, and reaching temperatures of 1600°C to melt the scrap. To achieve 
desired metal properties, ferroalloys are added while oxygen is injected to purify the metal. The growth of China's steel 
industry, catapulting it from the fifth-largest producer in 1980 to the largest in 1996, has raised environmental concerns, 
including adverse impacts on coal mining regions, substantial water consumption, and significant greenhouse gas 
emissions. To mitigate these challenges, the adoption of circular economy principles, involving recycling materials like 
zinc and slag, holds promise for conserving energy in steel production (He et al. 2020). 
In the pursuit of profitability and operational efficiency, productivity stands as a paramount goal for organizations. 
Within manufacturing industries, various influential factors can significantly influence productivity outcomes. A 
conducive work environment, as highlighted by Malhan (2019), plays a pivotal role in fostering employee satisfaction 
while minimizing errors. Environmental aspects within the workplace, such as temperature and lighting, exert 
substantial influence; suboptimal conditions can hinder concentration and job performance. Organized workstations 
contribute to reduced stress and enhanced focus among employees. Equally significant is the provision of suitable tools, 
ensuring employees can work efficiently and effectively. Comprehensive employee training holds vital importance in

6. Conclusions 
In conclusion, productivity is a crucial factor that significantly impacts living standards. Our choice to focus on the 
steel industry among various sectors was motivated by its role as the cornerstone for numerous everyday objects, 
including electronics, bridges, machinery, and various devices. This project aimed to identify and analyze the factors 
influencing productivity in the steel industry, with each factor bearing substantial importance. 
To fulfill the project's objective of assessing the determinants of productivity in steel manufacturing, we exclusively 
utilized the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). Through AHP, we established scales and determined the most 
favorable alternatives based on expert opinions from Emirate steel companies. The results highlight that visionary 
management holds the highest criteria weight among all factors, signifying its paramount importance. As indicated in 
Table 4, factors like energy saving, manpower, skill requirements, and technology were found to have relatively lower 
impacts on productivity. Conversely, visionary management and government policies and regulations emerged as the 
most influential factors. 
 
In summary, our analysis using the AHP methodology consistently identifies visionary management as the predominant 
driver of productivity, followed by the influence of government policies and regulations. Steel industry leaders and 
policymakers should prioritize these factors to enhance productivity, complemented by the implementation of robust 
control plans and strategies.

Abstract 
PT XYZ is one of the renowned printing industries in Indonesia. One of the main products of PT XYZ is Security 
Printing, where the production process is located in the Smart Card department. The fluctuating production quantity 
necessitates that the company is capable of implementing an optimal production process to achieve high-quality 
outcomes, as well as ensuring the effective and efficient operation of the production process. The issue at PT XYZ is 
the persistent occurrence of product failures or defects that are difficult to avoid, leading to a product quality that has 
not yet met the company's expected standards. Hence, it is evident that the existing issues necessitate improvement, 
which will be conducted using a method suitable for production quality control, namely the Failure Mode and Effect 
Analysis (FMEA) method. In addition, improvements can also be made with other supporting concepts such as the 
Kaizen concept and the Five-Step Plan or 5S (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu, and Shitsuke) concept. This research 
concludes that it can generate alternative improvement while considering the company's investment feasibility aspects, 
thereby reducing defects in the production of Telco products at PT XYZ.

1. Introduction
The rapid growth of industries in Indonesia has had an impact on various sectors, including the printing industry. The 
global industrial competition is expected to intensify due to the increasing demand from consumers. Companies are 
required to produce high-quality products. The quality of a product is considered one of the critical aspects that a 
company needs to focus on. 
PT XYZ is one of the renowned printing industries in Indonesia. One of its primary products is Security Printing, with 
the production process located in the Smart Card department. Despite PT XYZ's best efforts in implementing 
production and quality management systems, there are still instances of unavoidable product failures or defects, 
resulting in product quality that falls short of the company's standards. Telco products are among the output of PT 
XYZ. In practice, product failures or defects continue to occur frequently. From August to September 2022, out of a 
total production of 1,100,000 units, 33,128 were defective, accounting for 3.01% of the total.  
In light of these issues, it is essential to employ an appropriate method to address the existing failures and reduce the 
defect rate within the company. Based on previous research studies, there is a similarity in the problems encountered,

f. Payback Period (PP) 
The payback period calculation is used to determine the time it takes to recover the capital invested in the improvement 
proposal. Below is the payback period calculation for the improvement proposal (Table 10). 
 
Table 10. Payback Period (PP) 
 
 
 
So, the payback period for the investment of design improvements is 2.5 years. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The conclusions drawn from the research conducted at PT XYZ are as follows: 
1. 
During the production process of Telco products in the period of August to September 2022, four dominant 
defects were identified in the Smart Card department at PT XYZ. These defects include 9,931 reject printings, 
6,972 ATR dead units, 5,227 one-sided card bodies without a chip, and 2,288 bad implants. 
2. 
The most influential failure mode causing defects in the most dominant Telco product in the Smart Card 
department at PT XYZ, with the highest Risk Priority Number (RPN), is the suboptimal machine setting failure 
mode. This is caused by the potential failure factor of operator precision. The calculated Risk Priority Number 
(RPN) based on an interview with the quality control leader is 120 RPN. 
3. 
Proposed suggestions for consideration include providing shelves for storing operator equipment in the 
workspace, distinguishing between necessary and unnecessary items to prevent clutter in the workspace, 
allocating specific boxes for different types of equipment, particularly in the sorting or quality control area, 
conducting a 5-minute cleaning before and after work processes, providing dedicated bags for disposing of 
rejected products in the sorting area, and assigning specialized personnel for workspace cleaning, not solely 
relying on operators or related workers. 
4. 
The improvement proposal is considered feasible and implementable by PT XYZ. This conclusion is based on 
the positive NPV, indicating that the investment in the improvement proposal is acceptable. The IRR is above 
the discount rate, further supporting the feasibility of the improvement proposal. The payback period for the

1. Introduction
The lean manufacturing demand for plastic originated in South Africa when the price and competition increased 
globally. The plastic industry of South Africa is facing some major constraints; the pricing of raw materials, lack of 
advanced machinery, import prices, and limited investments. This research focused on lean manufacturing techniques 
which include plastic recycling, local production of materials, and packaging of medical devices. The employees 
should be aware of lean practices, their implementation, and working towards achieving competitive advantage 
(Berhe, 2022). According to research by (Adeniran & Shakantu, 2022), plastics are one of the most used materials in 
every field of life. As China is producing a large number of plastic products in bulk that are sold at a relatively cheaper 
price, it has shown an adverse impact on other local plastic industries.

As shown above, the correlation table is interpreted based on the Pearson correlation value and the significance value. 
The independent variables are quality improvement, product improvement, customer satisfaction, employee 
satisfaction, and supplier whereas, the dependent variable is the Kaizen method (Table 13). 
 
6. Conclusion 
The implementation of lean manufacturing helps in the development of a continuous environment of culture that 
reduces the waste of the industry. The researcher has set several different objectives and questions that have to be 
answered later in the study. In this study, the researcher has achieved different terminologies that explain the role of 
managers in this industry and the way they treat their employees more appropriately and positively. Due to these 
improvements in the case of costs, the quality of the product and performance involves the assuring of the climate.  
The researcher also concluded that educating and creating awareness among firms and plastic manufacturers is 
essential for the manufacturers who know how to benefit lean manufacturing to achieve the goals of an organisation. 
Effective lean manufacturing techniques can be implemented to achieve quality products (Ferreira et al., 2017), 
improved environment (Santos et al., 2016), safety (Bastos et al., 2014), and social responsibility (Santos et al., 2018).

Abstract 
Quality is one of things considered by consumers in selecting products. Therefore, each company definitely has quality 
control department having job to make sure that resulted products have met desired quality standard. One of the 
companies is PT XYZ which is engaged in the textile industry. Quality control of PT XYZ always tries to maintain 
good quality of shirts and trousers as the company’s product. However, many defects are still found in the production 
process. Up to now, quality control carried out by the company is considered not yet optimal in controlling number of 
defects produced. Hence, this research aims to analyze potential causes of failure or defect in apparel production of 
PT Sri Rejeki Isman Tbk and offer suggestions regarding kinds of improvement and investment that need to be taken 
by the company, also find out whether the investment costs incurred can be returned for investment or not. Thus, the 
company can minimize the occurrence of defects Moreover, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree 
Analysis (FTA), and Feasibility Study method were used in this research to identify and analyze the occurrence of 
defects. Based on the research findings, the highest Risk Priority Number (RPN) value obtained was Run Off Stitch 
defect with number of 210. Besides, the highest RPN value is priority which requires immediate corrective action.

1. Introduction
The growth of textile and garment industry continues increasing. Based on the statistic data from Ministry of Industry 
of Indonesia (KEMENPERIN), it records the highest growth in the third quarter of 2019 for 15.08%. The achievement 
surpasses the economic growth for 5.02% in the same period. It can lead to fierce competition in the textile and 
garment industry. The competition in this industry manages to get the companies try to provide some satisfactions for 
the customers. Quality becomes an important factor in determining the customers’ satisfaction to the product, because 
good product quality can fulfill consumers’ wish and need. Furthermore, good quality products with low price will 
attract consumers’ interest to keep using and purchasing the products. Quality control is needed to produce good 
quality products. In addition, quality control is engineering and management activities measuring product quality,

BCR value here has value of 4.89, in which the value is >1. It shows that the investment is feasible to be taken and it 
can provide benefits for the company (Table 9). 
 
Table 9. Calculation of PBP 
 
 
The result of PBP value here is 0.17 year, in which it is 0.17<n (5 years). Therefore, it can be concluded that the 
payback period is feasible. It shows that the investment is feasible to be undertaken and it can provide benefits for the 
company. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the analysis result, there are 21 types of defect. The most dominant types of defect which become focus of 
improvement on the Comtex brand based on Pareto diagram is hi-low with cumulative percentage of 15.43% and run 
off stitch defect with cumulative percentage of 28.52%. Furthermore, based on the calculation of RPN, the greatest 
value obtained is on run off the stitch and hi-low defect. Run Off Stitch defect is caused by lack of precision from the 
operators because they complete their job in a rash. Then, Hi-Low defect is the effect of lack of accuracy done by the 
operators resulting inappropriate handling, so it makes the results unbalance. The improvements carried on to 
overcome defect problems in the production process at Garment 3 of PT XYZ are providing sufficient rest time, 
creating comfortable work environment, and reaffirming and reviewing the applicable SOPs. Improvement proposals 
in term of routinely maintenance of sewing machine and improving the quality of sewing needles are worthy to be 
carried on. It is due to the calculation of obtained NVP value, with amount Rp 52,208,979,714.9; it means that the 
investment made is feasible to be carried out. Moreover, based on the calculation of BCR value, it obtains 28.90 which 
means the investment made is feasible to be carried out. Then, the PBP value obtains 0.146 year, it means the 
investment made is also feasible to be carried out.

Abstract 
Renewable energy has gained immense attention due to its potential to reduce the world's dependency on fossil fuels 
and mitigate climate change. As the energy harnessing rate from renewable sources depends on some external 
parameters like solar radiation, wind speed, direction, and turbulence, the generation rate in such sources comes with 
a high level of fluctuations. Fluctuations in their output can increase operating costs for the electricity system and be 
quite challenging for utility companies to always maintain a proper balance between the generation and usage of 
electricity. To reduce the operation cost and increase the reliability of the system, robust forecasting models are used 
to predict the generation rate and energy demand. This review paper offers a thorough examination of cutting-edge 
data-driven forecasting models utilized in forecasting renewable energy generation and demand. The paper organizes 
previous studies into five distinct groups based on prediction time frame: immediate, very short-term, short-term, 
medium-term, and long-term. It subsequently assesses the performance of various forecasting models, including three 
primary categories: time series, machine learning, and ensemble models, concerning predicting energy demand and 
generation rates across different time frames, using standard performance evaluation metrics. The findings indicate 
that ensemble models employing neural networks and support vector machines demonstrate notably higher accuracy 
rates in predicting energy demand and generation rates compared to the other models.

1. Introduction
Energy, particularly electrical energy, is essential for social, industrial and economic development for countries. 
Previously, a major proportion of electricity was produced using only fossil fuels. But, use of fossil fuels worsened 
environmental issues (Lian et al., 2019) and the swift depletion of this source has led to a global energy crisis. 
Therefore, renewable energy sources have become increasingly popular in recent years. Renewable sources of energy 
are considered ""clean"" as they do not emit greenhouse gases or other pollutants associated with traditional sources of 
energy (Lv et al., 2022). Utilization of renewable energy offers numerous advantages including reduction of 
environmental pollution, sustainability, energy security, job creation, and easy energy access for people in remote 
areas (Lian et al., 2019). 
Taking the advantages of clean energy into consideration, the share of renewable sources in electricity generation is 
getting higher compared to other sources. Despite several advantages, many challenges such as high initial investment 
cost, unpredictable output, limitation in energy storage, requiring a significant amount of land,  and public acceptance 
are common in utilizing renewable energy (Lian et al., 2019).  
As the generation rate of renewable sources is heavily influenced by the unpredictability of external parameters such 
as weather conditions, solar radiation, and wind speed, the generation rate comes with stochastic characteristics. 
Fluctuations in outputs from renewable sources can increase operating costs for the electricity system and also pose 
potential risks to the reliability of the electricity supply. So the unexpected changes in the generation rate can be quite

Abstract 
Urban logistics is an extremely important and yet disturbing activity for cities. On the one hand, it plays a key 
role in the development of cities by distributing goods to retail, commercial establishments, and homes. On the 
other hand, its operations negatively impact the environment, economy, and society in general. In addition, urban 
logistics is a complex and evolving system shaped by various uncertainties and driving forces. Its development 
cannot be projected by simply extrapolating past and current trends. Foresight exercises help planners and 
stakeholders identify key drivers of change, including trends, challenges, and technologies, that might effectively 
shape the future. This paper presents insights from an ongoing foresight study on the future of urban logistics in

Abstract 
Expected to surge, around 30% of the world's final energy consumption is in the building industry. Such a figure 
shows how important is the role of this sector in energy demand and supply. Governments have tried to encourage 
designers and clients to move toward low energy building designs through incentives like subsidies and tariffs. In line 
with this trend several solutions have been proposed in both academia and industry. However, a conclusive pathway 
that can highlight the suitable sustainable energy efficient design is yet to be investigated. The main key to reach this 
goal might lay in the concept of ‘vernacular architecture’ that focuses on the local style or indigenous designing 
pathways. Such a concept falls within the passive design solutions that have long been discussed in many studies to 
not only reduce energy consumption in the building industry but reaching sustainability. The importance of integrating 
this concept in building energy demand reduction is to consider building energy designs beyond the general regulations 
and seek the answers in the past design mindsets. It should be noted that in the olden days when the heating, ventilation 
and air conditioning (HVAC) systems were not developed, people used to design their buildings in a way that was 
most adapted to the local environment and could harness its powers in the favor of providing the heating and cooling 
demand. One of the well-known systems that was invented thousands of years ago is the wind-catcher structures. This 
magnificent design provided cooling energy without any need for the modern HVAC systems. With all said, the main 
solution in building energy consumption reduction lies in passive design strategies by integrating vernacular 
architecture concept in energy designs.

Abstract 
The clinical analysis laboratory plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and prevention of diseases, consequently, the 
results of the examinations must be issued under optimal conditions of quality and precision that allow safe medical 
decisions to be supported. Accreditations such as ISO 15189 are instruments that allow laboratories to ensure, through 
their criteria and characteristics, results that meet quality standards, ensure traceability, and have high reliability, 
furthermore, the analysis and application of this Standard contribute to the continuous improvement and optimization 
of resources in clinical laboratories, which generates greater productivity in the processes. In the present investigation, 
a simulation model of the laboratory service process in a medical center was designed to which proposed 
improvements were applied considering the evaluated criteria of the ISO 15189 Standard. The simulation model was 
developed in the Arena software and executed the initial system model and the one proposed for comparison, where 
the processing time of patient care capacity in the laboratory was increased by 33%, achieving an increase from 12 to 
16 clinical analyses performed per day. Likewise, the improvement in laboratory efficiency is directly related to the 
32.3% increase in the medical center's monthly income from the tests performed in its laboratory. This demonstrates 
that implementing the ISO 15189 Standard can generate positive impacts that only translate into the quality of the 
service but also the profitability of the laboratories.

1. Introduction
The clinical analysis laboratory is a medical support area and serves as a diagnostic assistant, these confirm a diagnosis 
or provide valuable information about patients' status and responses to treatments (Rodríguez et al., 2019). According 
to Galván-Cervantes et al. (2016), the objective of a clinical laboratory is to establish prognoses, classify diseases, 
monitor them, and, in some cases, present diagnoses. Rodríguez (2019) mentions that laboratory tests have improved 
at an accelerated pace thanks to technological advances, and this has managed to improve people's quality of life 
through innovative and convenient treatment proposals. Vega et al. (2015) point out that quality is essential for 
managing results in a laboratory as it ensures the minimization of errors. As expressed by Ug et al. (2014), quality is 
not only related to the means, technology, equipment, knowledge, and skill but is mainly linked to the aptitude and 
attitude of those in charge of providing the service, aware that the most important thing is the people to whom the 
services are directed. Figueroa-Montes (2017) points out that each clinical laboratory manager, whether private or 
public, must commit to implementing mandatory regulations or standards, through a quality management system that 
allows consolidating the appropriate process so that its results are positive and reliable, for the benefit of doctors and 
patients. 
According to Nasser et al. (2018), ISO 15189 accreditation combines the provisions of the quality system of ISO 9001, 
a standard that accredits the quality of laboratories before the creation of ISO 15189, with management and technical 
requirements of a laboratory, in which considers the general analysis that includes the preanalytical, analytical and

With the increase in the patient care capacity in the laboratory service in the proposed model, an increase of 32.3% is 
evident in the monthly income of the medical center from the clinical analyses performed in the laboratory concerning 
the income obtained in the flow. of current processes. 
 
5.4 Validation 
To verify that the model simulation is valid, the Output Analyzer tool was used, which is a complement to the Arena 
software, it was possible to perform an analysis and compare the results of the current model against the proposed 
model, to demonstrate that the simulation works as expected, guarantee that the behavior of the system represents a 
real scenario and identify if the changes proposed to the initial flow of the process have positive effects. 
Initially, 30 replicates were executed for the simulation of the initial model and the proposed model, with the result 
obtained from the analysis of the confidence interval on the mean and considering a mean width of a maximum of 
10% of the value of the mean resulting from the interval. After the calculation, the number of 314 replicates required 
for the simulation. 
Two indicators were evaluated in Output Analyzer: the number of patients treated (Output 1) and the number of 
samples analyzed by the laboratory technician (Output 2), both in one day. 
Finally, in the comparison of the indicators in both scenarios, an increase of 33.1% was evident in the number of 
patients treated per day, as well as an increase in the number of samples analyzed by the laboratory technician by 
16.3%.

6. Conclusion  
In the research, the ISO 15189 Standard was analyzed to propose possible changes in the laboratory service of the 
medical center under study to achieve improvements in the process. By simulating the model in the Arena software, 
it was possible to visualize the procedures carried out during the laboratory service through a practical animation; 
Furthermore, with this, it was possible to verify that the proposed changes to the selected processes can generate 
positive results which provide useful information for future decisions within the laboratory. 
The proposed and simulated model presented favorable results by showing a decrease in the length of stay of patients 
within the laboratory, which allows for a greater number of samples to be taken in one day, which is directly related 
to the increase in the income of the medical center; In addition, the change in processes also resulted in optimization 
of resources through the decrease in the utilization rate of laboratory personnel, which can have a positive impact on 
their work performance. 
Although the process model proposed in the research can provide certain suggestions to obtain better results in the 
laboratory service, the study has some limitations that can be developed to complement the research, such as the 
performance of the laboratory staff, who have different types of experience and skills that can impact their 
development. Also, the wear generated during workdays can be considered, which has effects on productivity at work. 
In this case, staff performance was assumed to be constant without any variation among participants in the process.

Abstract 
Efficient inventory management is a crucial aspect that companies must consider to reduce unnecessary costs. XYZ 
CORP, a fertilizer company, currently faces an issue of packaging bag overuse. The aim of this study is to identify the 
root causes of this issue and provide solutions to mitigate it. Furthermore, the proposed solutions will be simulated to 
evaluate their effectiveness, along with a calculation of the costs and benefits for the company. The research 
methodology includes Root Cause Analysis, incorporating the 5 Whys approach, and various inventory management 
methods such as Safety Stock, Just-in-Time, Bin Size, and Reorder Point. Data for this study is derived from the 
company's historical data and interviews with relevant parties. The results reveal a true occurrence of packaging bag 
overuse at XYZ CORP, amounting to a total of 180 bales of packaging bags or equivalent to 90,000 pieces. The 
application of Safety Stock, Bin Size, and Reorder Point in Proposed Improvement 2 proves beneficial to the company, 
both in optimistic and pessimistic scenarios. In optimistic conditions, the implementation of Proposed Improvement 
2 yields a profit of Rp 388,750,000, while in pessimistic conditions, it still results in a profit of Rp 92,750,000.

1. Introduction
The fertilizer industry is an industry that has been developing over the years. This development is based on the 
increasing need for fertilizer along with the development of the agricultural industry in Indonesia. Apart from that, the 
fertilizer industry is also one of the industries whose development continues to be encouraged by the government 
because it plays an important role to realizing national food security. One of the largest fertilizer companies in 
Indonesia is the state-owned company XYZ CORP. There are various kinds of fertilizers produced by XYZ CORP, 
one of the most well-known products is the NPK fertilizer product called the ABC BRAND. 
NPK fertilizer is a compound fertilizer consisting of the elements Nitrogen (N), Phosphate (P), and Potassium (K) so 
it can be used for various purposes from agriculture to plantations. Based on Adiele et al. (2020), the use of N, P and 
K elements in plants can have an impact on significantly increasing crop yields. To meet these needs, in 2022, XYZ 
CORP succeed in producing more than 2.5 million tons of NPK fertilizer. In order to achieve such a large production 
amount, XYZ CORP has several production units that can produce NPK fertilizer. Among them are the NPK I, NPK 
II NPK III, and NPK IV. The NPK I-IV units contributed more than half a million tons of NPK fertilizer in 2022, or 
more than 20% of XYZ CORP's total NPK fertilizer production.

5.7 Cost Validation 
One way to assess the feasibility and benefits of implementing a proposed improvement is by calculating the costs 
and benefits involved. The cost components of the proposal implementation are outlined in Table 9, along with their 
corresponding values as displayed in Table 10. Using Table 9 as a summary for comparison, a cost-benefit analysis 
was conducted, and the results are presented in Table 11.

In Table 11, an optimistic scenario is also included, assuming that the proposed improvement’s implementation would 
have a 40% drop on packaging bag overuse, reducing the total packaging bag overuse. The 40 % is calculated by 
averaging the average inventory improvement of Proposed Improvement 1 and Proposed Improvement 2. The results 
indicate that in the pessimistic scenario, where no improvements occur in the case of packaging bag overuse, the 
implementation of Proposed Improvement 1 would result in a loss of Rp 393,000,000, while Proposed Improvement 
2 would yield a profit of Rp 92,750,000. On the other hand, in the optimistic scenario, Proposed Improvement 1 would 
lead to a company loss of Rp 113,000,000, while Proposed Improvement 2 would result in a profit of Rp 388,750,000.

6. Conclusion 
Based on this research, it can be concluded that there is a ABC BRAND packaging bag overuse in Units NPK I-IV. 
During the period from January to July 2022, there was a total of 180 wasted bales. Various factors contributed to this 
wastage, including employee negligence, misuse of bags, a dirty working environment, non-compliance with 
production quality standards, and lack of standard rules on the inventory management.

Several standard rules, such as Safety Stock (SS), Bin Size, and Reorder Point (ROP), can be applied for inventory 
management. According to the simulation results of the implementation of SS, Bin size, and ROP in Proposed 
Improvement 2, there is a potential 55% reduction in average inventory, a 63% decrease in inventory standard 
deviation, and a reduction of 57 bales in total bag shipments. This has the potential to result in cost savings of 
Rp90,750,000 under pessimistic conditions and Rp384,750,000 under optimistic conditions. 
 
XYZ CORP may consider implementing inventory management based on SS, Bin Size, and ROP. Prior to 
implementation, proper employee training and socialization should be conducted. For future research, further 
investigation is needed regarding the production process leading to off-spec products, sales processes, and quality 
control processes with suppliers to reduce packaging bag overuse. Additionally, a more in-depth analysis of the 
relationship between inventory conditions, such as average inventory and inventory standard deviation, and bag 
wastage behavior is essential.

Abstract 
PT. XYZ is a company operating in the garment and textile industry in the city of Solo. In the Sewing division, there 
are busy work stations and idle times, then high waiting times and idle operators due to irregular workloads, so the 
concept of line balancing needs to be implemented to achieve company goals. The aim of this research is to determine 
the optimal number of work stations. The research method used is a qualitative data method, with data collection 
techniques using field research and observation. Based on the calculations that have been carried out in calculating 
the ranked positional weight, it is known that in the production line process, line 2A style MS LS Sewing Division 
has a takt time value of 94 seconds. After improvements were made to the production line with Line Balancing, which 
originally had 60 work stations, it became 35 work stations. The results for line efficiency, namely 80%, indicate that 
the ratio in making a series of assembly activities in the work station has a good percentage. Then the results obtained 
in the balance delay state that in organizing work assembly activities in the work station it is 20% while in the 
smoothness index the results obtained are 138.83 seconds

1. Introduction
The manufacturing industry is an industry or business that processes goods raw or semi-finished goods become 
finished goods by using assistance with tools, production machines, operators, structured management, and others so 
on with a large production scale. The manufacturing industry consists of: various types, one of which is the textile 
industry. 
In the problems that often occur in the production process, the authors overcome the problem of searching for educated 
paths in the company so the production trajectory method is used that uses the method of positional weight rating 
(RPW) is one of the heuristic solutions to solve combinatoric problems that try to find solutions. Based on the problem 
as explained before, it causes bottlenecks at the work station which causes an imbalance in the production line. In 
completing this conversation, the production line balance is used using the Rank Position Weight (RPW) method. This 
settlement is done in order to increase the productivity of the production process. 
Unbalanced production lines result in bottlenecks. Bottleneck is a condition where several work stations do the full 
process and several other work stations are idle because they are waiting for input from the previous work station. To

6. Conclusion  
The conclusions drawn from the research conducted at PT XYZ are as follows: 
1. The causes of low levels of efficiency are identified using a fishbone diagram and divided into four variables, 
namely man, machine, method and material. These causes consist of unbalanced processing times at each station, 
interference with the machine, poor object inspection processes, inappropriate work procedures, and poor quality 
yarn fibers. 
2. After line balancing was carried out using the Ranked Positional Weight (RPW) method by sorting and grouping 
work stations based on position weight, there was an increase in line efficiency calculations, as well as a decrease 
in the values of balance delay, smoothness index, and total idle time with the number of work operations reduced

from 60 work became 35 work stations and line efficiency was 80% from the previous 32%. Increasing efficiency 
causes a decrease in total idle time and balance delay, namely total idle time from 5272.15 seconds to 712.69 
seconds and balance delay from 68% to 20%. 
3.
The proposed improvements are considered feasible and can be implemented by PT XYZ. This conclusion is
based on The NPV is positive, indicating that the investment in the improvement proposal is acceptable. The
IRR is above discount rate, which further supports the feasibility of the improvement proposal. Payback period
for estimated 2.03 years, investment in changes to the production process to increase production line efficiency
at PT XYZ is useful because it will provide benefits for the company in the future.

Abstract 
As an agricultural country that has many plant commodities, the need for Fertilizer in Indonesia is very high and there 
are often shortages, especially of subsidized Fertilizer. Based on information from the website of the Directorate 
General of Agricultural Infrastructure and Facilities, Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia, it is stated 
that there are often cases of shortages of subsidized Fertilizer. Rules for Fertilizer distribution have been regulated 
through Minister of Agriculture Regulations. The large demand for Fertilizer will of course affect the production of 
Fertilizer factories which will also increase. The production and distribution processes that go through various stages 
will also influence Fertilizer uptake in each region that will receive Fertilizer distribution. According to the increasing 
of factory’s production, warehouse capacity must be upgraded. The new rule from Board of Director to prohibit open 
storage, also reducing company’s warehouse capacity. Hence, PT XYZ decided to rent a warehouse and need some 
feasibility analysis to prove that renting is the right decision. By the use of Net Present Value, Equivalent Uniform 
Annual of Cost, Cost Benefit Analysis, and Cost-Effective Analysis results Construct a new warehouse on company’s 
land as the best way to reduce the storage cost. 
1. Introduction
As an agricultural country that has many plant commodities, the need for Fertilizer in Indonesia is very high and there 
are often shortages, especially of subsidized Fertilizer. Based on information from the website of the Directorate 
General of Agricultural Infrastructure and Facilities, Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic of Indonesia, it is stated 
that there are often cases of shortages of subsidized Fertilizer. Rules for Fertilizer distribution have been regulated 
through Minister of Agriculture Regulations. Previously, the Government allocated subsidized Fertilizer in 2023 
amounting to 9,013,706 tons. This amount consists of 5,570,330 tons of urea Fertilizer, 3,232,373 tons of ABC 
FERTILIZER, and 211,003 tons of special formula ABC FERTILIZER. In its current implementation, the Fertilizer 
that has been input and approved by the regent through the eAllocation application is 4.6 million tons of urea, 3.1 
million tons of ABC FERTILIZER and 114,033 tons of Special Formula ABC FERTILIZER. The large demand for 
Fertilizer will of course affect the production of Fertilizer factories which will also increase. The production and 
distribution processes that go through various stages will also influence Fertilizer uptake in each region that will 
receive Fertilizer distribution. In short, the Fertilizer production flow from raw material to the consumer is Fertilizer 
production in the factory, then it will be sent to the UPP or Fertilizer Packing Unit where the fresh Fertilizer comes 
from the factory in bulk condition. After the Fertilizers are in bag condition, they will then be sent to the Warehousing 
Department Warehouse or also known as Line 1 Warehouse. The purpose of sending to the warehousing department 
is not only for the storage process but also to wait for the vehicle used to send the Fertilizers. The transportation used

6. Conclusion  
PT XYZ's decision to rent the third-party warehouses to increase the storage capacity of the Line 1 warehouse is not 
appropriate for a long period of time. This option should be exercised in a short period of time (temporary). The 
proposed alternative is building a new warehouse on PT XYZ's internal land, building a new warehouse on new land, 
or continuing to rent the warehouse. The results of the investment feasibility analysis, found that the option of building 
a warehouse on PT XYZ's internal land is the best alternative because it requires the smallest investment value of IDR 
115,027,949,163, the largest NPV value is – IDR 133,789,477,582, the smallest EUAC value is IDR 32 ,916,272,389, 
the smallest Cost-Effective Analysis value is IDR 6,724 per ton, and the Cost-Benefit Analysis value is 0.8017. In this 
way, minimal storage costs are obtained. Hence, alternative B is the best alternative whether PT XYZ planned to gain 
profit in the future by selling their property and costs about IDR 1,727,603,929,435.

Abstract 
Annually, all U.S. hospitals that accept reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid are required to submit quality 
data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS operates the Hospital Compare program, a 
consumer-oriented website offering insights into ""the quality of care provided by hospitals to their patients."" Hospital 
Compare presents data on more than 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals, encompassing acute care hospitals, critical 
access hospitals (CAHs), children’s hospitals, Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Medical Centers, and hospital 
outpatient departments. The CMS employ a five-star quality rating system to evaluate the experiences of Medicare 
beneficiaries with their health plans and healthcare systems, known as the Star Rating Program. A component of a 
hospital's overall rating is derived from its patient satisfaction survey scores. CMS endeavors to account for how well 
patients are treated by their healthcare providers. This study explores the correlation between the overall CMS star 
rating and the patient satisfaction score, as well as identifies the survey questions that offer the most meaningful 
insights into a hospital's overall quality. This information proves invaluable for the management of healthcare facilities 
and guides CMS in enhancing their annual survey questionnaire.

Abstract 
This study looked at the impact of Total Quality Management in improving customer satisfaction for South African 
banks. In addressing this, the study had one primary and three secondary research objectives. The study is mono-
qualitative, whereby a desk review was conducted. PRISMA methodology was adopted. 200 publications were 
considered for review. However, after a rigorous process, 18 publications were eligible to be used in the study. It was 
found in this study that banks that have used Total Quality Management have improved customer satisfaction and 
ultimately improved their profitability. However, challenges were presented from culture, employee involvement, and 
several others. Publications on this topic date back from 1993 to date. It is recommended that banks should take 
advantage of TQM. However, they must also do evaluations to check the impact of TQM in their banks. There should 
be high involvement of all employees in the bank that is affected. Future research will focus on the use of the Fourth 
Industrial Revolution technologies such as the Internet of Things in the adoption and implementation of TQM in 
banks. This research is unique as it focuses on the implementation of TQM from the context of banking.

1. Introduction
The first modernized banking system started in Renaissance Italy in the 14th century. During this time the Medici 
family was the only key player in developing the banking practices (Vlašić et al. 2022). By the 18th the Bank of 
England was established which opened a new era of central banking practices and systems. Major Banks like Bank of 
America and HSBC emerged in the 19th century. In the 19th century, the fractional reserve banking system became 
widespread worldwide. In South Africa the first bank, known as Union Bank of South Africa was established in the 
18th century (1838). During the first introduction of the banking system in Africa, the intention was to serve the mining 
industry's needs. Due to the apartheid system, there was a separation between the whites' and non–whites' banking 
system which changed after the 1990s as the apartheid ended. The end of apartheid marked the introduction of the 
South African Reserve Bank. 
The banking sector plays a crucial role in the global economy, serving the diverse needs of individuals, businesses, 
and industries (Chang et al. 2021; Daga et al. 2021). To effectively meet the evolving demands of its customers, the 
banking sector needs to continually improve its operations and enhance customer satisfaction (Vlašić et al. 2022). One 
approach that holds promise in achieving these goals is Total Quality Management (Tareke 2020). 
Total Quality Management (TQM) began to be used in the 1980s as a response to the decline of United States 
manufacturing competitiveness. The roots of TQM have been proved to have been first used by Japanese quality gurus 
like William Edwards Deming, Joseph Moses Juran, and Kaoru Ishikawa. These quality gurus successfully promoted 
quality in general as the key driver of any organization's performance and success. The theory and practical sense of 
TQM philosophy was first pioneered by Toyota and Motorola as a response to the mass production of United States

Abstract 
Based on prior research, it was found that only a limited number of studies have addressed approaches for enhancing 
procurement management involving the selection of factory and warehouse construction contractors, along with the 
control of contractor construction efficiency. Furthermore, the decision-making process in contractor selection was 
frequently delegated to the procurement department or an individual within the department, potentially introducing 
personal biases. Consequently, contractors who submitted the lowest bids often secured projects, particularly in 
fiercely competitive industries. Relying primarily on cost-based decisions may lead to the selection of less qualified 
and less suitable contractors. This research aims to provide relevant criteria for selecting main contractors for factory 
and warehouse construction projects with areas greater than 10,000 square meters (sq.m). This is to reduce the risk of 
low-quality work or construction job abandonment. To not based purely on cost, supplier selection process is a Multi-
Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) process. The proposed evaluation criteria are analyzed using Analytic Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) technique, data were collected from seventeen experienced experts in the field of factory and 
warehouse construction contractor selection to ensure result reliability. It was found that the decision-makers gave the 
past and present performance of the construction contractor performance factor as the first priority with a relative 
weight of 0.32. This is followed by operational technique at 0.19, staff at 0.18, financial at 0.17, and lastly, partner 
relationship at relative weight of 0.16. The relative importance weights were later used in a large-scale factory and 
warehouse contractor selection process as a case example. Using Conjunctive method with three inclusion criteria, 
five alternatives were shortlisted from a total of 40 companies. As a result, Company E received the highest score was 
chosen as the construction contractor of choice. The study also revealed that certain critical decision-making criteria, 
such as management expertise and technical proficiency, frequently lack sufficient available data, requiring the 
acquisition of this information directly from contractors. Therefore, it likely is inadequate for risk assessment and 
perhaps efficient scoring when selecting alternatives. Consequently, an end-to-end procurement risk management 
process is also proposed utilizing the top three relatively significant criteria to develop a tool for monitoring contractor 
performance during operations. Additionally, implementing a vendor checklist for their inclusion in the annual 
Supplier List is also recommended.

Finally, Phase 3 is the process of annual suppliers evaluating after implementation. It should be done in order to select 
them into the Supplier List which will be considered for selection in the next construction project. in evaluating and 
rating contractors who have completed the project. It could be done according to the proposed key measurable 
indicators which can also be gathered from the monthly progress report data. 
6. Conclusion 
The analysis of gathered research data from 17 experts using AHP approach results in the relative weight of importance 
of proposed five criteria and their sub-criteria for MCDM of large-scale factory or warehouse construction contractor 
selection to ensure that procurement department does not selects contractor focusing merely on cost. The authors apply 
proposed criteria in a case example on select the suitable main contractor for construction projects of factories and 
warehouses, and alternative that meets the requirements the most gained the highest score is Company E. Company E 
is efficient in terms of past and present performance of the construction contractor which is an important criterion that 
is first and foremost used as a major decision criterion. Moreover, the company does lack in other criteria as well, it 
makes Company E appear to be reliable to win the project and expected to be able to complete the project as planned. 
Furthermore, this research identified certain vital factors for contractor selection that face challenges in data collection, 
specifically in terms of information related to project management expertise and construction technical proficiency. 
Since this information is pivotal for gauging reliability and efficient management expertise, its absence from each 
bidding company's presentation can obscure potential project shortcomings. This, in turn, hinders decision-makers 
from obtaining adequate information to assess risks and score operational technical aspects. Subsequently, an end-to-
end procurement risk management process is also proposed using top three relative important criteria, with 
""performance"" and ""current contractor construction workload"" being the first and foremost. The second and third 
ranked criteria, ""operational technique"" and ""staff,"" are essential components as well. This approach is aimed at 
developing tools for ongoing contractor performance monitoring during operations, as well as establishing a vendor 
checklist for their inclusion in the annual Supplier List.

Abstract 
Nowadays, manufacturing companies consider ergonomics as a relevant factor in workstations, since it is a means to 
ensure productivity in the company and comfort and safety of employees. However, there is still resistance to the 
implementation of postural assessment methods during the various production processes of different manufacturing 
companies. Consequently, the main objective of this article is to analyze the advances in the application of ergonomics 
methods to improve productivity in manufacturing companies in America, Europe or Asia during the last 13 years. To 
fulfill this purpose, a systematic review of the literature was carried out, as well as a bibliometric analysis. The results 
will be of great value to manufacturing companies, especially those aiming to improve the efficiency of their processes, 
reduce musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and increase productivity. Therefore, the implementation of ergonomics 
involves the inclusion from the corporate level to the operational level; in addition, the participation of the workers 
who work directly in the production processes is important, since they play an important role in guaranteeing and 
optimizing the smooth and safe work of the processes. This article evidences the increase of productivity in 
manufacturing companies through the application of ergonomics and a considerable reduction of MSDs along the 
production processes.

1. Introduction
Due to globalization, manufacturing companies have found it necessary to remain competitive and meet market 
demands, which leads them to reduce their operating costs to a minimum. In addition, the lack of competitiveness can 
affect the sustainability of the organization in achieving its objectives. Therefore, the search for competitiveness 
generates that the company focuses more on results and leaves aside the human factor; originating inconsiderate and 
mistreating working conditions (López et al., 2012). Human factors and ergonomics (HF/E) play an important role in 
ensuring and optimizing smooth and safe work processes (Reiman et al., 2021). In this regard, Boulila et al. (2018) 
note: ""Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) constitute one of the most important problems in the manufacturing industry 
as they cause absenteeism and decreased performance of workers and generate significant consequences for 
companies."" For a transition to sustainable manufacturing, human-centered factors play a central role in achieving 
sustainability-oriented operations throughout the supply chain (Nguyen et al., 2021). MSDs contribute to about 37% 
of recorded occupational hazards and 29% reduction in working hours between the years 2018 to 2019, which resulted 
in 6.9 million working hours lost in Great Britain and the annual cost of treating MSDs is estimated at about $171.7 
million in industrialized countries (HSE, 2019). According to the General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI), 
69,000 occupational injuries were reported in Saudi Arabia in 2014. According to Brokers, in 2016, this increased to 
approximately 355,000 occupational injuries (as cited in Hadidi et al., 2019, p. 6). For such a reason, ergonomic design 
of workstations is a way to improve two aspects: productivity for the company and comfort and safety for employees.

improving working conditions through preventive measures induce on a long-term financial benefits with a coefficient 
of 1,445 in manufacturing industries (as cited in Constantinescu et al., 2020, p. 1).  
 
6. Conclusion 
The present research work has focused on a field of study that has been explored and which is in constant revision 
since it is in a constant transition of research, innovation and implementation of technology, which allow ergonomics 
to adapt to the current needs and of the present study. The context of a dynamic world and prevailing in a high rate of 
competitiveness, demands the need to implement various methodologies and analysis of ergonomics application in 
manufacturing companies; such as: RULA, REBA, OWAS, symptomatological questionnaires and others; have 
facilitated and provided the collection of information, data and ways to implement ergonomics in production processes 
where a low rate of productivity is evidenced; in addition, they have served as a starting point for the exploration and 
implementation of new feasible solutions. However, it was evidenced the existence of limitations and disadvantages 
that directly and indirectly affect the traceability of the implementation of ergonomics evaluation methods, so it is 
important to focus future studies towards the implementation process and the significant role played by the various 
ergonomics evaluation methods in improving productivity at the organizational level. It is important to give an impulse 
to the exhaustive analysis carried out on the role of ergonomics in the large number of studies on the application of 
ergonomics in production processes through a systematic approach of bibliographic review. Currently, large companies 
are looking for the coupling of ergonomics as part of their production processes, in search of obtaining positive results 
in processes where low productivity due to musculoskeletal disorders has been evidenced. Finally, after performing 
the bibliometric analysis, it is evident that research on the various ergonomics methodologies to be used for the benefit 
of workers belonging to manufacturing companies, are under constant research analysis. The suggested review aims 
to explain the link between ergonomics and productivity and the benefits at the organizational level through the 
implementation of ergonomics during the production processes and with the purpose of reducing musculoskeletal 
disorders and increasing the productivity rate throughout the process.

Abstract 
A geothermal resource is one that is accessible. A geothermal resource constitutes quantity of stored energy between 
the earth surface and specific depth in the earth’s crust underneath a specified area and is measured from local mean 
temperature. The most common criteria to classify geothermal resources is the enthalpy of geothermal fluids which is 
the energy carrier. It is the enthalpy that influences or determines the classification of the geothermal resource as low 
enthalpy, medium enthalpy, or high enthalpy geothermal resource. Geothermal sysems can be classified as convective 
dominated systems, which include liquid-vapour dominated hydrothermal system, conductive dominated system 
which include hot rock and hybrid systems which source from convection, conductio and high heat producing source 
e.g. magma. A geothermal system is made up of three main elements namely, a heat source, a reservoir, and a fluid,
which is the carrier of the heat. The heat source can be either a very high-temperature (greater than 600 °C) magmatic
intrusion that has reached relatively shallow depths (5 to 10 km) or, as in certain low-temperature systems. Most
geothermal resources are near the boundaries of the earth's tectonic plates. The most active geothermal resources are
usually found along major tectonic plate boundaries where most volcanoes are located.

1. Introduction
The word ""geothermal"" is derived from the Greek word’s geo, meaning earth,"" and therme, meaning ""heat.""  Therefore, 
geothermal energy means heat from the earth(Kabeyi, 2019; M. J. B. Kabeyi & A. O. Olanrewaju, 2022).  Geothermal 
resources are reservoirs of hot water or steam that exist at varying temperatures and depths on the Earth's surface. A 
geothermal well is drilled   is drilled into the earths crit to reach the reservoirs to tap steam and hot water for delivery 
to the earth’s  surface for  various applications including  electricity generation, direct use, and heating and cooling.   
2.
Geothermal Resource Capacities
The heat that comes from deep within the Earth's crust is known as geothermal energy. Water and/or steam transport 
geothermal energy to the Earth's surface. The first commercial use of geothermal technology to generate electricity 
was in 1913, when a geothermal power plant with a capacity of 250 kW was built in Italy (Stober and Bucher, 2013). 
Recently, geothermal energy met a considerable portion of the electricity needs in countries like Iceland, New Zealand, 
El Salvador, the Philippines, and Kenya as well as it meets over 90% of Iceland's heating needs. Compared to recent 
years, capacity expansion was rather slow in 2020 (due partly to disruptions caused by the epidemic), with nearly all 
new facilities being situated in Turkey (Global Status Report, 2021; Statista, 2021a). In this regard, approximately 
0.15 GW of new geothermal power generation capacity went online in 2020, increasing the global total to roughly 
14.1 GW(M. J. B. Kabeyi & A. O. Olanrewaju, 2022). The capacity of Turkey was raised by 99 MW, whereas the US, 
New Zealand, and Italy all saw smaller increases. Overall, the power generated using geothermal energy has increased 
from 1 GW in 2010 to 14 GW in 2020, with a 14% increase rate. Figure 1 depicts the recent global expansion of 
geothermal power capacity (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2021). The top ten geothermal power producers 
by 2020 were the US, Indonesia, the Philippines, Turkey, New Zealand, Mexico, Kenya, Italy, Iceland, and 
Japan.(Bakken et al., 2012; M. J. B. Kabeyi & O. A. Olanrewaju, 2022)

The commonly observed manifestations of geothermal energy are related to convective heat flow, and they include 
hot springs, geysers, fumaroles, volcanic activities like movements of magma to land and sea floors and existence of 
some economically Significant ant minerals deposits that are geothermally heated by geothermal fluids and deposited 
and regions of low temperature on or near the surface of the earth (Goldstein, et al. 2010). 
 
 While geothermal power plants (GPP) remain much more environmentally friendly and clean than traditional power 
plants, but no technology is without negative environmental impacts, as various research have emphasized (Figure 13) 
(Sayed et al., 2020; Bošnjaković et al., 2019; DiPippo, 2012; Dhar et al., 2020; Bravi and Basosi, 2014). The various 
environmental impacts related to geothermal power systems are summarized, which include land usage, geological 
hazards, workers' health, biodiversity impacts, the release of contaminated wastewater, solid waste, gaseous emissions, 
thermal pollution, noise, waste heat, and social impacts (Bošnjaković et al., 2019; Dhar et al., 2020). GPP can also 
increase water and air pollution levels. In this regard, the typical noise level during different phases of GPP power 
production includes air drilling, mud drilling, discharging wells, well testing, heavy machinery operation, and the 
machines that provide electricity should be 120 dB, 80 dB, up to 120 dB, 70–110 dB, up to 90 dB, and 55 dB, 
respectively (Bošnjaković et al., 2019; Dickson and Fanelli, 2004). Bravi and Basosi (2014) conducted a 
comprehensive assessment of GHG emissions resulting from four GPP in Italy and found that the emissions rate in 
terms of global warming: 80–1045 kg CO2eq/MWh, acidification: 0.1–44.8 kg SO2eq/MWh, and human toxicology: 
1.1–31.6 kg, 1.4-dB eq/MWh. The major contributors to the effects are the high levels of NH3, CO2, CH4, and H2S 
gases found in each plant's effluent. Moreover, arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), antimony (Sb), and 
chromium (Cr) are also found in geothermal gases released by GPP(Bakken et al., 2012).

6. Conclusion  
 A feasible geothermal resource is accessible, and it constitutes quantity of stored energy between the earth surface 
and specific depth in the earth’s crust underneath a given area and obtained based on the local mean temperature of 
the resource. There are many ways classifying geothermal resources, but the most common criteria are to classify 
geothermal resources based on the enthalpy of geothermal fluids. The geothermal fluid which is the energy carrier has 
varying characteristics for different geothermal fields in terms of energy content, thermal and chemical properties. 
Based on enthalpy, geothermal resources can be classified as low enthalpy, medium enthalpy, or high enthalpy 
geothermal resources. Geothermal energy sysems can be classified as convective dominated systems, which include

Abstract 
Geothermal energy has a potential for several applications including geo-exchange, direct thermal application, and 
power generation.  Whereas the untapped capacity is over 100 GW globally, its growth realizes only 3-4% growth per 
year. Limitations of geothermal energy includes scarcity of exploitable sites, remote locations often far from load 
centers and undesirable gaseous emissions. Project development faces challenges of poor funding, technology, and 
long gestation periods of between 5 and 10 years for conventional power plants. Smooth implementation of geothermal 
project requires, social acceptance, through minimization of environmental effect, avoidance of adverse effects on the 
people and giving direct benefits to local communities. It is through both subsurface and power plant technologies 
that environmental challenges of geothermal power plants are addressed. Research and development into new, 
efficient and cost-effective technologies will enhance safety and environmental integrity with respect to geothermal 
energy and electricity development. A geothermal power plant project generally goes through exploration or 
prefeasibility stage, drilling or feasibility stage and development stage which involves development of production 
wells, reinjection wells, steam gathering system and power plant construction and commissioning. The last phase is 
power plant operation and maintenance before the plant is finally retired upon end of the generation contract or license. 
These phases of the cycle before generation combined take relatively long and there is need to improve. The use of 
Wellhead power plants currently provides a quick access to geothermal electricity ahead of full development of a 
conventional power plant hence enabling quicker access to geothermal electricity. Better technology in upfront 
activities will significantly reduce the high risks and costs while power plant conversion technologies and better 
reservoir management and engineering will increase output, resource availability and efficiency of resource 
exploitation.

Introduction
 Geothermal energy resource is a renewable form of energy extracted  as heat from the ground for various applications 
in heat and power ( Dipippo 2007).  As a renewable source of energy, geothermal, heat and electricity have an 
important role to play in the realization of the Paris agreement (Kabeyi and Olanrewaju 2022). Since, most of the 
geothermal resources are classified as low and medium temperature reservoirs, the organic Rankine cycle will prove 
useful for maximum power generation from geothermal fluids (Quoilin et al, 2013).  Geothermal energy contributes 
less than 1% of the global power generation output hence the need to identify more feasible geothermal resources 
while efficiently exploiting discovered or developed resources for electricity generation. Various technologies can be 
used to generate electricity from geothermal all employing flash steam technology. They include dry steam 
technology, flash steam, organic Rankine cycle or a combination of the basic technologies depending on costs required 
and financing as well as the resource (Kabeyi et al, 2019).    
 Geothermal energy is produced by drilling deep into the Earth’s crust for harnessing to generate electricity or thermal 
energy. Feasible geothermal resources are available where the thermal gradient is above 30°C/km, permeable rock 
structure, natural or artificial water replenishment, and an impervious cap rock. Geothermal contributes less than 1% 
of global electricity generation even though we have significant potential such that it can meet the entire energy needs 
of humanity at current rates of consumption. As a renewable energy resources, geothermal energy is constantly

Abstract 
The economic viability of a power plant is dependent on the cost of the electricity generated which is influenced 
by a wide range of factors and inputs from the inception to end of economic life. The Levelized cost of energy or 
electricity (LCOE) is a model used to estimate the cost of electricity before the powerplant is constructed. The 
cost of building a nuclear power plant and any financing cost is the most important contributing factor to the cost 
of from nuclear power plants. Although modern nuclear power plants are generally large and expensive, their long 
project lifetime effectively reduces the cost of nuclear power can still be relatively low. Nuclear energy has 
generally been regarded by public opinion as a harmful energy resource.  The growing concerns over global 
climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have changed this belief and nuclear is now considered   a reputable 
green power source that can generate significant amounts of energy with low carbon emissions. Nuclear energy 
is currently a mature low-GHG emission energy resource that is ideal for use as baseload power. However, the 
share in global electricity generation has been declining globally but its share of global electricity generation has 
been declining since the year 1993 because of various barriers and risks. The life cycle GHG emissions from 
nuclear power are less than traditional fossil sources but assumptions and conditions under which they are 
deployed can have serious impact on the magnitude of life cycle GHG emissions compared to renewable 
technologies. The published median, interquartile range (IQR), and range for LWR life cycle GHG emission are 
13, 23, and 220 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (g CO2-eq/kWh), respectively. Upon 
application of harmonizing methods to use consistent gross system boundaries and values important system 
parameters yielded 12, 17, and 110 g CO2-eq/kWh, respectively. Based on ongoing improvements, median life 
cycle GHG emissions could be 9 to 110 g CO2-eq/kWh by 2050

Introduction
 Nuclear power is low-emission source of electricity, accounting for about 10% of global electricity generation. 
Nuclear energy can complement renewables in reducing emissions and contributing to electricity security as a 
dispatchable power source. Nuclear energy can also be used to produce low low-emission heat and hydrogen. 
There is need to get nuclear power on track with the Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario. Lifetime extensions 
of existing nuclear plants has proved to be one of the most cost-effective sources of low-emission electricity. 
Other measures include promotion of  small modular reactors, which can help  expand the  range of low-emission 
options and increase options  to net zero power(IEA, 2022). 
Nuclear power plants have been in operation for more than 50 years now, during which they have avoided 66 Gt 
of CO2 emissions globally by replacing fossil fuel like coal, natural gas, and oil. Developed economies will 
generate 20% higher emissions over the past 50 years, led by the United States and European Union if nuclear 
power is abandoned. Emerging and developing  markets like China and India  have recently increased their 
nuclear power capacity leading a reduction in emissions by   9 Gt of emissions (IEA, 2022). 
 Nuclear power generation capacity reduced by about 3 GW globally in 2021 due to retirement of old power plants 
since new reactors could not compensate for over 8 GW of retirements. All new capacity in 2021 came from 
emerging markets and developing economies while Germany accounted for the majority permanent shutdowns 
(IEA, 2022). To achieve the Net Zero Scenario, nuclear power generation should expand by about 10-17 GW per 
year to 2030 to reduce fossil fuel consumption while at the same time increase the share of renewable sources of 
energy in power generation(Kabeyi & Olanrewaju, 2022a, 2022b).  Measures like prioritising lifetime extensions

classified as large, medium, and small-sized nuclear reactors. There is a growing trend for development of small 
sized reactors away large nuclear reactors which have become less attractive. Small-sized nuclear reactors were 
originally used to facilitate the development and demonstration of early reactor technologies to develop 
operational experience for the nuclear power sector. Basic of reactors is concerned with reliability, safety, and 
passive safety systems. A brief review of the design and safety aspects of some small nuclear reactors have been

low. Nuclear energy has generally been regarded by public opinion as a harmful energy resource.  The growing 
concerns over global climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have changed this belief and nuclear is now 
considered   a reputable green power source that can generate significant amounts of energy with low carbon 
emissions. Nuclear energy is currently a mature low-GHG emission energy resource that is ideal for use as 
baseload power. However, the share in global electricity generation has been declining globally but its share of 
global electricity generation has been declining since the year 1993 because of various barriers and risks. The life 
cycle GHG emissions from nuclear power are less than traditional fossil sources but assumptions and conditions 
under which they are deployed can have serious impact on the magnitude of life cycle GHG emissions compared 
to renewable technologies. The published median, interquartile range (IQR), and range for LWR life cycle GHG 
emission are 13, 23, and 220 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt-hour (g CO2-eq/kWh), respectively. 
Upon application of harmonizing methods to use consistent gross system boundaries and values important system 
parameters yielded 12, 17, and 110 g CO2-eq/kWh, respectively. Based on ongoing improvements, median life 
cycle GHG emissions could be 9 to 110 g CO2-eq/kWh by 2050

Conclusions  
The cost of building a nuclear power plant and any financing cost is the most important contributing factor to the 
cost of from nuclear power plants. Although modern nuclear power plants are generally large and expensive, their 
long project lifetime effectively reduces the cost of nuclear power can still be relatively low. The economic 
viability of a power plant is dependent on the cost of the electricity generated which is influenced by a wide range 
of factors and inputs from the inception to end of economic life. The Levelized cost of energy or electricity 
(LCOE) is a model used to estimate the cost of electricity before the powerplant is constructed. The cost of 
building a nuclear power plant and any financing cost is the most important contributing factor to the cost of from 
nuclear power plants. Although modern nuclear power plants are generally large and expensive, their long project 
lifetime effectively reduces the cost of nuclear power can still be relatively low. Nuclear energy has generally 
been regarded by public opinion as a harmful energy resource.  The growing concerns over global climate change 
and greenhouse gas emissions have changed this belief and nuclear is now considered   a reputable green power 
source that can generate significant amounts of energy with low carbon emissions.

The costs of the system are ultimately borne by society, and so, given the increasing use of variable renewable 
energy, it is important that system costs are internalized to ensure that policy decisions can be properly directed 
towards maximizing affordability. Negative effects beyond the system itself (i.e. negative externalities) related to 
the provision of electricity are increasingly being recognized as significant and complicate the picture further. 
Negative externalities related to electricity generation – most notably the emissions of greenhouse gases and other 
pollutants – represent a social cost that may impact the true affordability of different electricity supply options. It 
is well documented that the social and economic costs of climate change and air pollution are significant. In order 
to better-understand the socially optimal level of externalities (relative to production) it is imperative that the 
relative costs of different supply options include a reasonable estimate of their impacts on emissions and the 
climate(World Nuclear Association, 2022). 
 
Nuclear energy is cost-competitive based on a simple LCOE comparison, particularly at low discount rates. Its 
unique attributes of providing predictable, reliable supply that is low-carbon means that inclusion of system costs 
and negative externalities both markedly improve the relative affordability of nuclear energy(World Nuclear 
Association, 2022) (Figure 7).

Abstract 
 Solar energy has been the most renewable type of energy-producing electrical power from 2013 to date. Solar PV and 
concentrating solar-thermal power (CSTP) are the two primary forms of solar energy technology . The generation of 
electricity from both types of solar energy has witnessed a significant increase compared to any other renewable 
source, with new installations totaling up to an estimated 130 GW by the end of last year. Solar photovoltaic (PV) 
systems, are effective measures to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions related to the generation of power. However, 
the large exploitation of solar PV modules, leads to undesirable waste accu-mulation, impacting the environment. 
Solar PV waste management research is an emerging field which has received more attention recently, affected by the 
increase volume of solar PV disposal.

Introduction
Grid-connected utility-scale solar PV has emerged as a potential pathway to ensure deep decarbonization of electricity 
in regions with fossil fuel-dominated energy mixes. Research on utility-scale solar PV projects mainly focuses on 
assessing technical or economic feasibility. Environmental performance assessments of large-scale solar applications 
are scarce. There is limited information on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy footprints of utility-scale 
solar energy systems. Earlier studies conducted on small-scale solar systems have limited application in the grid 
system (Mehedi, 2022).   
 Photovoltaics is a renewable source of energy that converts solar radiation to electricity, which provides a perfect 
alternative to tradi-tional fossil fuels as the world transitions to a renewable energy-based economy. The application 
of this technology has been in existence since the 1980s, but the 1990s has been recorded as the year of the first 
appreciable application of power from solar photovoltaics (Padoan et al., 2019; Tao and Yu, 2015). Solar energy is 
non-polluting, efficient, reliable and safe. There is a global interest recently in solar energy particularly PV technology. 
This has seen the use of solar PV modules climb sharply because of government’s effort to achieve clean energy 
globally. PV technology is to become one of the main energy sources worldwide because of its expectation to 
significantly produce a portion of the world’s energy consumption (Al Shetwi, 2022).

Solar Power Generation
 Solar power generation involves converting energy from the sun into electricity. Heat and electricity are the two forms 
of energy generated from the sun use.  Energy is generated by means of solar panels, which vary in size from residential 
rooftops to 'solar farms' spread over large land space. The global commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
while achieving significant cost reductions, have generated demand for solar electricity making it one of the fastest 
growing renewable energy resources. The global solar power deployment increased from  40 GW in the year 2010 to 
586 GW in the year 2019 (Wu et al. 2022).  
Power fluctuations cover short and mid-term power variations in a timescale from seconds to hours. Intermittency is 
deemed to cover long-term power variations in the timescale from hours and days to years. Intermitence for solar 
energy is considered more challenging than power fluctuations. It is the deterministic astronomical diurnal and

Conclusion  
Globally, the electricity sector is among the major greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters, mainly because of the use of fossil 
fuels. A radical transformation of the sector through a steady and evolutionary process towards a high share of 
renewable energy sources is vital to achieving the 1.5 °C climate change target. This is more relevant for fossil fuel-
dominated energy mix jurisdictions. Grid-connected utility-scale solar PV has emerged as a potential pathway to 
ensure deep decarbonization of electricity in many regions. Research on utility-scale solar PV projects mainly focuses 
either on technical or economic feasibility, and literature assessing on environmental performance is scarce. 
Evaluating the life cycle environmental benefits is essential to provide scientific insight to policymakers to support 
decisions in the wide deployment of solar to ensure the transition to a low-carbon economy. Utility-scale solar PV is 
still in the early stages in Canada, hence the environmental consequences need to be investigated and compared to 
conventional sources of electricity. This research aimed to develop a bottom-up process-based LCA to evaluate the 
energy and environmental performance of large-scale solar PV farms in Alberta, Canada. The study provides robust 
life cycle inventory data based on the most recent commercially available technologies and maps the entire value 
chain. Models were used to simulate a utility-scale solar power plant and determine the required equipment sizes, 
thereby improving the reliability of the results. The electricity generation models developed used location-specific 
solar insolation data and considered changes in performance from snowy conditions. The life cycle energy profile for 
a utility-scale solar power plant shows that most of the energy is consumed during raw material extraction, production, 
and assembly of solar panels, which together account for 53% of the total consumption. Energy associated with battery 
manufacturing also has an important contribution, around 28% of the total consumption. 
 
The two-axis sun tracking system offers the highest mean NER value (6.6), which indicates that the system is a net 
energy producer. Continuous improvements in efficiency and lifetime solar PV technology would further increase the 
NER. The life cycle GHG emissions range from 98.3 to 149.3 g CO2 eq /kWh with a mean value of 123.8 g CO2 eq 
/kWh. Battery manufacturing has the largest emissions contribution (54%) which results from anode and cathode 
production processes. The trade-off between energy efficiency and GHG reduction can also be understood through 
sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. The study provides key insights to policymakers to support decisions on the wide 
deployment of solar to ensure the transition to a low-carbon economy.

Abstract 
Modern wind turbines capture the kinetic energy of moving air and convert it into shaft power to drive an electrical 
generator/alternator. The turbine is typically comprised of three basic parts: the rotor, the nacelle, and the tower. The 
rotor includes the turbine’s blades (most often 3 in horizontal wind axis turbines) and the nose cone/hub. The nacelle 
contains the driveshaft, transmission a, the unit’s generator/alternator, the electronic controls to convert the generators 
or alternator’s electrical output to quality suitable for use, and the tail vane or yaw drive that keeps the turbine oriented 
to the wind, either upwind or downwind depending on the turbine’s design. Because wind speed generally increases 
and turbulence decreases with height, a tower helps the system increase its energy production and reduces turbulence-
induced mechanical stresses, thus enhancing its economic benefit. The ability of a turbine to produce energy from the 
wind fundamentally depends on the wind resource and the swept area of the turbine. Simplifying somewhat, the power 
output of a turbine is proportional to the cube of the wind velocity and the square of the blade length. A doubling of 
the wind speed thus yields an eight-fold increase in wind power while a doubling of a turbine’s blade length yields a 
four-fold increase in energy capture (all other things kept constant). Larger turbines with longer blades not only 
produce more energy for a given wind resource, but they are also more capital cost-effective as well, because of 
inherent economies of scale as well as inefficiencies in the market for smaller turbines. The installed cost/kW for a 
small turbine is twice that for a mid-scale turbine and can be several times as expensive as that for a utility-scale 
turbine. While these factors argue for choosing the windiest sites and installing the largest turbines on the highest 
towers that are cost-effective for the site – an argument understood by wind farm developers – residential and 
commercial site hosts cannot follow this logic to its conclusion. It is a rare home or business owner that is going to 
move their establishment simply to take advantage of a windier site. And several practical constraints prevent home 
and business owners from using the giant turbines typically found in utility-scale wind farms. Neighbors might object 
to the presence of a turbine hundreds of feet tall because of safety, noise, and visual concerns. The turbine’s capital 
costs are an additional consideration: even if a site host has the space for a giant turbine, the multi-million-dollar 
capital cost can be difficult to finance for someone not in the wind industry. As a result of these constraints, most 
distributed wind turbine installations are sized roughly equivalent to the site host’s electrical load and use turbines 
much smaller than those found in current-day wind farms. This analysis therefore assumes that residential customers 
will install turbines with nominal capacity ratings of 1-9 kW, while commercial customers will install turbines with 
nominal capacity ratings of 10-100 kW.

Introduction
Global warming is a reality today  and according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), human 
activities have caused an  approximate warming of 1.0 °C above pre-industrial levels, and this may  reach 1.5 °C 
between 2030 and 2052(Kabeyi and Oludolapo 2020). The energy sector is the largest contributor to the global 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This has led to the development of renewable energy resources with lower carbon 
footprints. Wind energy, for example, became the second largest power generation source in Europe, just after gas, 
with an installed capacity of 169 GW in 2017 (Kabeyi and Oludolapo 2022). However, wind energy comes with 
intermittency and unpredictability, due to variable wind conditions (Kaddoura et al, 22020), requiring substantial 
support technologies for load balancing. Wind power is also perceived as noisy and visually interfering( Vargas  et al,

and analysis of wind turbine design and operation.  An updated version of Hau’s book on wind technology (2000) 
provides a detailed account of a range of issues, including turbine design, manufacturing and economics.   
This report is intended as a general primer on wind energy technology, with a focus on technological characteristics 
and how they relate to the economics of wind energy.  It draws upon the three major sources mentioned above, as well 
as a variety of additional sources, to provide a concise survey of four wind energy topics: 1) characteristics and extent 
of wind resources, 2) fundamentals of wind turbine technology, 3) intermittency of wind energy and the roles of 
transmission and storage, and 4) the economics of wind energy.  Within these topics, there is an emphasis on the 
theoretical aspects of converting wind energy into electricity, was well as subsequent conversion of electricity into 
hydrogen.

Conclusion  
Wind energy is a form of kinetic energy generated by the flow of air caused by temperature differences in various 
places and hence air pressure leading to air flow. Solar radiation received and the long-wave radiation energy released 
by different surfaces of the earth are different which is the cause of temperature differences at different paces.  Wind 
energy is inexhaustible energy in the form of air that flows from an area with high air pressure to one with low air 
pressure. Wind is considered an attractive energy resource because it is renewable, clean, socially justifiable, 
economically competitive and environmentally friendly (Burton et al., 2011). Therefore, the outlook is for increasing 
participation on wind power in the future, up to at least 18% of global power by 2050 The fluctuating nature of wind, 
despite the high penetration of wind energy, poses several challenges when integrating wind power into the electric 
grid, since high costs can be involved for construction of wind farms as well as prior and ongoing assessment studies. 
Contrary to conventional energy sources, wind speed varies both spatially and temporally, generating fluctuations in 
wind energy output. Weather variables such as wind direction, temperature, pressure, and humidity, among others, 
influence wind power production. Hence, to integrate wind power into the electric grid requires estimates, at least, of 
future wind speed values.

Abstract 
The technical potential for hydropower worldwide is between 31 petawatt-hours a year (PWh/y) to 127 PWh/y, while 
the economic potential is between 9 PWh/y to 15 PWh/y, the report notes. Hydropower, which is the dominant 
component of renewable energy, is also under the threat of climate change. Climate change has a large impact on 
water resources and thus on hydropower. Hydropower generation is closely linked to the regional hydrological 
conditions of a watershed and reacts sensitively to seasonal changes in water quantity. Hydropower is one of the oldest 
sources of mechanical power and the largest source of renewable electricity generation in use. Global capacity is 
around 1300 GW. Hydropower is site-specific and so each project will be unique. Hydropower plants are classified 
according to their size into micro, mini, small, and large hydropower. In terms of generating the capacity the large 
plants are the most important. These can be either dam and reservoir plants or run-of-river stations. The latter are the 
easiest to construct and least disruptive, but the former stores energy and is therefore much more flexible in the way 
it can be used. Energy is taken from hydropower plants through turbines and a number of designs such as Pelton, 
Francis and Propeller turbine exist to exploit different head heights of water. Most hydropower developments have 
environmental effects which must be taken into account before constructionHydropower potential is a function of 
available water and suitable terrain The main advantages of hydropower are low unit cost, low emissions, ease of 
control and storage.  The challenges   of hydropower are huge land requirements for storage, soil erosion, ecosystem 
disturbance and seasonal variability. About 75,000 hectares of land and 14 trillion liters of water are required on 
average basis to produce 1 billion kWh annually    Hydropower plants have a reservoir developed behind a dam to 
supply water to the hydraulic turbine for generation of a highly flexible, dispatchable electricity supply. Hydropower 
can be combined with wind, solar and other sources to supply reliable steady and affordable grid electricity. 
Hydropower can also be exploited from run-of-the-river resources which have less environmental impact but with 
overreliance on steady supply of rainwater whose supply is unsteady and unpredictable. Apart from power generation, 
reservoirs can control floods, supply water, and power from stored water even during drought. Hydroelectric electric 
power plants are useful for grid electricity sustainability particularly during peak hours where plants that generate 
flexible and cheaper electricity are on high demand.

1. Introduction
 Hydropower is a renewable energy source where electrical energy is derived from the potential energy of water 
moving from high to lower elevation. Hydropower is a mature technology and widely used; in 2016, a total of 159 
countries in the world reported to have developed hydropower. Hydropower is among the most efficient technologies 
for production of renewable electrical energy, with a typical efficiency of 90% or better for, “water-to-wire.” 
Hydropower is cost competitive, and is today the only renewable technology that can produce electricity at equal or 
lower cost, compared to thermal energy sources like coal, oil, or gas, typically in the range of US2–5 c (kWh)− 1 (2–5 
US cents per kilowatt hour)(Mohamed, 2021). 
Hydropower has a high potential for carbon emissions reductions in the global electricity system due to low 
greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), and a large potential for further capacity increase with low generation cost, 
compared to both other renewables and to thermal power plants. In total, generation by hydropower contributed nearly

  This section presents the impacts identified for the three large hydropower projects and compares them with the 
accumulated impacts from the small plants. The impacts are classified in impact categories, varying from 'Very large 
negative impact' to 'Very large positive impact', according to (Vegvesen, 2006). The type of environmental topics used 
as basis for comparison are to a very large extent based on the categories given by the guidelines for developing EIAs 
for hydropower projects;(NVE, 2010), (OED, 2007) and (Jensen et al., 2010), but to some exstent adapted to match 
the available data of this study. The impacts for Vestsideelvane and Vigdøla are taken directly from the EIAs, where 
the categorization has been made by consultants, while impact categories for Trollheim hydropower development 
project have been assessed and set by the authors of this paper. The 'average large HP project'. The environmental 
impacts of the 27 small-scale hydropower plants have been summed by the authors (expert judgement) and categorised 
according to (Vegvesen, 2006), as the large projects, in order to provide a uniform basis for comparison(Bakken et 
al., 2012)  
The need for increased energy production in India is high priority and hydroelectric power has been identified as 
having the greatest potential for achieving energy independence. The Indian government has continually created more 
streamlined methods for efficient implementa-tion of hydroelectric facilities with an emphasis on small-scale (<25 
MW) and micro (<5 MW) facilities in the more remote regions. Himachal Pradesh has effectively achieved one 
hundred percent electrification due to these initiatives and realized some of the most successful development in the 
nation with respect to rural electrification and improved infrastructure such as roads, schools, and hospitals. 
Hydroelectricity, and especially that produced through run of the river type systems, is generally embraced as a 
renewable source of energy by many established standards. Small scale run of the river facilities are also heralded for 
the minimal impact to the environment. However, with increased development and construc-tion in continually 
industrializing areas, measureable human impacts have in-creased felt within the environment and ecosystems. Several 
studies and papers published by the Indian government, as well as the state government of Himachal Pradesh, identify 
these impacts as low to nonexistent. In contrast, a growing num-ber of studies refute this claim and deserve 
consideration. There is a diversity of opinion on this subject. Some secondary sources indicate minimal to non-existent 
environmental impacts stemming from projects less than 25 MW, considered as Small Hydro Power (SHP); while 
other sources express significant concern. Inter- views with government officials and researchers in the Indian states 
of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand as well as in the capital city of Delhi revealed a wide range of views. This paper 
presents observations and argues for greater exploration of these issues through future research. 
6. Conclusion  
Hydropower is a form of energy obtained from the flowing of water. Waterpower is one of the most cost-effective 
ways to generate electrical energy and is often the favoured technique when available (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2011). 
For example, hydropower accounts for 99% of all the electricity generated in Norway (Bakken et al., 2012). In China, 
the Three Gorges Dam, with a capacity of 22.5 GW, is the world's largest hydroelectric project. It generates between 
80 and 100 terawatt-hours of electricity per year, enough to power between 70 and 80 million homes (Zarfl et al., 
2015; Heming et al., 2001). The use of hydropower, as an example, has significantly enhanced energy access in 
Cambodia, where the power generated from hydropower increased from 32 to 4370 GWh between 2010 and 2019 
(Baird and Green, 2020). It is essential to mention that micro-hydropower projects on a small scale can make a 
tremendous difference in rural areas (Fujii et al., 2017). Even though hydropower accounted for the largest share of 
global renewable power capacity, with a cumulative capacity of 1211 GW in 2020, the annual increase in hydropower 
electricity is much less than solar and wind energy in recent years. Overall, the installed capacity of hydropower 
energy worldwide.

Abstract 
In recent years, the continuing development of automobiles and road transportation systems have changed to more 
sophisticated ones incorporating inter-vehicular communication and automated driving technology. However, many 
problems still need to be solved in the road traffic system. One of them is the deterioration of traffic flow at signalized 
intersections. Deterioration of traffic flow at signalized intersections affects the smoothness of traffic and the fuel 
consumed by vehicles. One of the leading causes of poor traffic flow is that intersections confine the traffic volumes. 
The need for appropriate signal cycles and traffic demand also leads to traffic congestion. Over the last few decades, 
there has been much research on improving traffic flow at signalized intersections to achieve smooth traffic flow. 
Among them, the idea of adjusting the signal cycle according to the traffic volume of each intersecting road is a major 
one. Additionally, the traditional approach in signalized intersections is adjusting the signal cycle according to the 
time of day in actual road traffic. However, changing the signal cycle to a suitable depending on the current traffic 
load is not expected to improve the traffic capacity in the intersections. Observation reveals that shorter signal cycles 
result in a better flow of under-saturated traffic. However, more frequent signal switching increases the intersection 
loss time, reducing the effective green time needed by traffic, i.e., reducing traffic capacity and worsening traffic flow. 
To solve these problems, a control method that reduces the time wasted during signal switching is considered effective. 
Therefore, this paper proposes an optimal control method in which an automatic vehicle decides on appropriate pre-
start before a signal changeover at a signal intersection from a far distance that is determined optimally. In this model, 
by receiving the signal cycle information, the first vehicle starts a few seconds before the signal changeover, arriving 
at the intersection at the green time with a higher speed. Thus, drivers can cross the intersection at an increased rate 
and faster than conventional human traffic. In this study, the automated vehicle is controlled using model predictive 
control (MPC). The model was evaluated by simulating ten vehicles and one signal intersection. The described model, 
where only the lead vehicle used automatic driving control and the trailing vehicles used a conventional motion model, 
was compared to the traditional motion model with all ten vehicles using a human following motion model. The results 
demonstrate that the proposed model improves the crossing time for the ten vehicles by 9.5% compared to existing 
traffic, which is expected to increase the road traffic similarly to mitigate congestion.

Abstract 
The safety and security of tourists, goods, and infrastructure are greatly influenced by customs and airport security 
procedures. To find and identify forbidden objects including explosives, firearms, drugs, and other contraband 
materials, a variety of scanner types are used. The security inspection technologies utilized at airports and customs 
facilities across the world now include X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and trace detection systems. The research 
also examines Rapiscan Systems, Smiths Detection, and NUCTECH as the top three rivals in the security inspection 
market. Each organization has its own strengths and problems when offering efficient security solutions for diverse 
industries. While these scanners' detection capabilities have substantially increased, there is still a key gap in the 
integration of several technologies for a more complete and efficient screening procedure. Closing this gap will 
improve the overall efficacy of security measures and help to the future creation of a more robust and seamless security 
inspection system. Customs inspection is an important process that involves verifying the contents of goods, ensuring 
compliance with regulations, and detecting any attempts to smuggle contraband or illegal goods. The inspection 
process typically involves examining documentation such as bills of lading, invoices, and packing lists, as well as 
physically inspecting the goods themselves. Customs officials may use a variety of techniques and tools, including X-
ray machines, sniffer dogs, and physical inspections, to ensure that the goods being imported or exported are legal, 
safe, and comply with all relevant regulations. The goal of customs inspection is to prevent illegal activity, protect 
public health and safety, and promote fair trade practices. Effective customs inspection can help to facilitate 
international trade and ensure that goods move efficiently across borders while maintaining high standards of safety 
and security. The purpose of this project is to develop a new inspection for Dubai Customs by Developing a 3D 
scanner that shows shipments without any manual intervention.   
1. Introduction
Because of its increased capabilities in detecting and identifying forbidden objects, computed tomography (CT) has 
become a crucial tool in the field of security inspection, particularly in airports and customs facilities. Despite its 
numerous advantages, the introduction and operation of CT scanners in these situations is fraught with difficulties 
and restrictions. The study's goal will be to increase the efficiency, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of CT scanners 
in security inspections while overcoming present restrictions such as restricted space, high energy consumption, and 
regulatory compliance. There is an urgent need to investigate novel tactics and strategies for improving the 
performance of CT scanners in security applications. This involves looking into ways to reduce false alarms, 
improve detection of a wider spectrum of threats, and lessen the impact on passenger flow and cargo processing 
delays. Additionally, to establish a more thorough and smooth security screening process, CT technology should be 
integrated with other security inspection systems like X-ray and trace detection. Resolving these issues will help to

6. Conclusion  
The literature analysis emphasizes the continuous development of customs check technology at airports, with a 
focus on balancing security, efficiency, and privacy. It profiles three key security inspection solution providers: 
Rapiscan Systems, Smiths Detection, and NUCTECH. The study also emphasizes the importance of improving 
Computed Tomography (CT) technology for customs inspections. The suggested Multi-Slice CT scanner with 
integrated AI capabilities is proposed as a solution to enhance security screening. This technology has the potential 
to improve security, reduce false alarms, and provide a smoother travel experience for passengers, with applications 
in transportation hubs and high-security zones.

Reliability Demonstration Tests – Challenges and 
Opportunities in the Automotive Industry

Abstract 
In the automotive industry, the reliability of products is often defined by a so-called B10-value. That means, that at a 
defined point in time, the maximal failure probability is 10 %. Due to the fact that the B10-value correlates to the 
required service, it is quite challenging to proof a service life expectation, for example 250.000 km for a passenger 
car, in a quite short time frame for testing activities within a product development project. If the test duration 
corresponds to the service life requirement, then 22 test specimens must pass the test procedure without failure in 
order to confirm the required minimum reliability. However, if the test has to be carried out in a shorter time, more 
test specimens must be tested without failure. Assumptions regarding the failure characteristics are then required to 
determine the number of test specimens. In some applications, the sample size can easily reach three-digit values and 
therefore often reaches the limits of feasibility. During the development of products, the proof of product reliability is 
therefore a challenging activity. In addition to a procedural flow of test planning, correlations between reliability 
requirements and various test parameters such as test duration and sample size are shown. The test quality is evaluated 
by the confidence level, whose dependencies are also determined. Especially uncertainties and their consequences are 
part of this study. One example is the estimation of the shape parameter of a Weibull distributed failure characteristic 
in the planning phase. Possible sources for the estimation and the consequences of uncertainties of the estimation are 
analyzed. After performing a reliability demonstration test, the impact of uncertainties on the results are under 
consideration. The effects of uncertainties of the planning phase, e.g. uncertainties of the estimation of the Weibull 
shape parameter, to the demonstrated reliability and the confidence level are shown. Finally, case studies give an 
impression of the importance of the uncertainties.

Abstract 
Industrial Engineering (IE) has been active in Australia prior to and since 1959. Initially IE focused on basic IE tools 
such as Time & Motion and Work Study, as well as Operations Research Techniques, Project Management etc. The 
practitioners of IE were mainly vocationally trained in the Technical and Further Study (TAFE) system. Since the 
1990’s, the majority of IE practitioners have been University Trained usually outside of Australia. There are now 3 
universities that deliver degree-based IE training, 2 of which are accredited by Engineers Australia. 
Please note that this is an observational finding presentation and not an academic research paper.

1. Introduction
In most developed and even developing countries, Industrial Engineering (IE) has been a major recognised component 
of engineering and business management. IE’s are employed in traditional manufacturing enterprises as well as in 
service, finance, hospitality, health care, aviation, planning, supply chain and digital and automation industries. 
In the case of Australia, the impact of decreasing industrialisation and value adding,  especially since the 1980’s, the 
need for employing IE’s has been reducing. The requirement for undertaking traditional time and motion and work 
studies has been replaced by other IE techniques. Many of these techniques such as Lean, Six Sigma and Operations 
Research, have been delivered by organisations specialising in these management tools. These organisations in most 
cases are unaware of IE or utilising IE based techniques. 
Industrial Engineers Australia (IEA) the professional body representing IEs in Australia (incorporated in 1959), has 
seen it membership fall from a high of over 1300, to a present of approximately 120. Membership in the past 4 years 
has doubled.  
The IEA, over the past four years, has endeavoured to co-ordinate the training of industrial engineers, promote IE in 
industry and represent IEs in Australia. This has been achieved to some extent. The requirement for IEs in industry is 
still a challenge. This is evident, since many companies in Australia are not knowledgeable of industrial engineering 
especially in Western Australia. Victoria with a larger base of larger industries, does provide more opportunities for 
industrial engineers. 
1.1 Objectives 
The objectives of this paper are to highlight the history of Industrial Engineering in Australia from the 1950’s until 
2023, including the methodology followed to promote IE in Australia. 
2. Training of Industrial Engineers
There are 3 universities training IEs in Australia, 2 of which are accredited engineering qualifications by Engineers 
Australia. These include Curtin University in Perth, Western Australia, University of Melbourne in Melbourne, 
Victoria. Recently La Trobe University, also based in Victoria has initiated IE training. 
The number of students and graduates, please Reference 1 (Table 1).

Training 
-The training of Industrial Engineers in Australia in universities 
-Promoting IE to first year engineering students. This being undertaken by delivering presentations to the 
students promoting aspects of Ien and its benefits. 
-The IEA has been working with Curtin University to upgrade the Industrial Engineering Degree by identifying 
the required IE skill requirements. 
-There are plans to promote IE to school students via STEM learning activities as well as introducing IE to the 
various State and Federal bureaucracies. 
 
STEM- science, technology, engineering and mathematics 
 
Promoting Industrial Engineering in industries in Australia 
-This has been undertaken by inviting various organisations to deliver presentations about their industry with an 
industrial engineering influence. 
-Also on site visitations with a focus on IE, have been undertaken 
-Promotion of IE at associated professional engineering organisations such as Engineers Australia. 
 
Promoting Industrial Engineering within professional Engineering Bodies(Engineers Australia)(EA) 
-The IEA has been very active in promoting industrial engineering within Engineers Australia.  
-This has been a challenging endeavour especially with the every changing personnel within the organisation. 
-The other challenge within EA is overcoming the challenges in getting Industrial Engineering recognised as an 
Area of Practice(AoP) 
 
5. Obstacles to Recognising Industrial Engineering 
-A major challenge is getting IE fully recognised as an Area of Practice(AoP)(as mentioned previously) in 
Engineering in Australia by Engineers Australia. 
-Accomplishing Industrial Engineering becoming a mainstream element of engineering in Australia 
-Universities recognising the importance of IE as a major contributor in the engineering profession. 
-Other unrelated consultative operations “high jacking” IE techniques such as LEAN, SIX SIGMA, Circular 
Economy and even business management…. 
 
6. Challenges and Opportunities 
As with other professional practitioners, technology and other new methodologies, impacts on the workplace and 
workplace practices. Computerisation, digitisation, autonomation and now AI have had major influences in the way 
IEs in Australia and around the world undertake their profession. Undertaking time and motion studies, method 
studies etc have been replaced by workplace electronic observations and sensors over the decades. Accurate, timely 
and pertinent data, is now the most beneficial and necessary tool, allowing IEs to undertake their tasks far more 
efficiently. AI will impact immensely in this area and can be called Industry 5.0. IEs, utilising consensus decision 
making tools such as Game Theory, will be at the forefront, guiding organisations to effectively implement optimal 
solutions. 
 
7. Conclusion 
Industrial Engineering has a great future in Australia. Together with academic, industry and professional 
recognition, Industrial Engineering graduates, will be well placed to take the lead in moving Australia into a more 
productive value adding economy.  
The challenges recognising Industrial Engineering as a mainstream aspect of Engineering, will continue, Great 
strides are being made by Industrial Engineers Australia to correct this situation. 
Thus Industrial Engineers communicating effectively their ideas, will be in the forefront in the future, to lead to 
making the world a better place.

Abstract 
New graduates in automotive engineering are expected having both technical skills and developed personal 
qualifications like creativity and teamwork. Owing to these requirements, the engineering education system should 
consist of a curriculum depending on the industrial revolution 4.0. Project based learning approach, a kind of 
process innovation, can be taken into account as a key to ensure this expectation. It is also an exit point to get the 
success in the pandemic period because project based learning can give the advantage to the students to study in 
online meetings. It’s not obligatory to have face-to-face communication. This study aims to show the project based 
learning opportunities in Automotive Engineering Department in Çukurova University, Turkey. The students taking 
this course have the chance to develop themselves by working in group projects and this innovation course is based 
on the real problems round the world. Therefore, being a member of these groups lead the students to research, share 
their opinions and respect the others’, prepare the report as it’s required. In other words, it is possible to find a 
solution in a professional way and this helps the students add a different qualification in their resumes. It’s no doubt 
that the university and industry collaboration needs this kind of students, having an experience in the real-life 
projects. The perceptions of the class in this course were further investigated through a questionnaire and the 
conclusion shows all the class is satisfied with this implementation. Furthermore, the performance of the students is 
appreciated and finally, project based learning is strongly recommended especially in pandemic terms in case of 
relevant.

1. Introduction
With the usage of digital platforms, life does not have a way out except for experiencing in industry 4.0. This rapid 
change 
also 
makes 
the 
world 
transform 
into 
systematic 
and 
ecological 
paradigm 
from 
a 
mechanistic one. Especially, digitalization trends depending on this transformation become more popular in 
pandemic term than before. For instance; having a chance to take the course in online way leads both the 
academician and students to prefer interactive learning mostly because it’s easier to search for the students and faster 
to perform the students in academicians’ side. 
In this aspect, it can be said that education field should constantly be developing and progressing such as the other 
ones. It is very important for academicians to renew themselves and follow the tendency in the face of developing 
education methods to catch the current information of the modern world. Therefore, an effective way should be 
selected for the students so as not to make them forget the courses. In this point, project based learning, a student-
oriented approach, is taken into consideration with its effectivity when compared to textbook-based and academician 
or teacher centered approach, which are traditional teaching methods. Moreover, it is a well-known fact that 
business life is framed of a project based world where many ideas are discussed and creativity comes to the fore. 
The authorities also support these kinds of courses to educate the students with the real problems.  
In Turkey, university and industry collaboration prepares a platform for a strong and sustainable synergy by using 
project based learning method because the future graduates are requested to search, discuss problems and bring 
solution proposals. In other words, every step includes a project in itself and project-based approach can be 
considered as a process innovation in education field.

Figure 2 Average Total Point of Each Statement in the Questionnaire 
(for students in PBL) 
 
When the figure 1 and 2 are compared, the PBL results are better than traditional learning expectations. While 
observing each statement of the questionnaire about PBL, it shows that the minimum performance was good because 
there is not any point less than 4. According to this fact, it can be concluded that the course has been implemented 
well (assessed from the student's perspective). As it is seen, there is a meaningful difference in academic 
achievement levels in the favor of experimental group. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study was conducted with the aim of evaluating the effects of using Project Based approach in “Innovation and 
Cooperate Entrepreneurship” course to young automotive engineer candidates compared to using traditional 
methods and techniques. It is also aimed to investigate the expectations of students on PBL teaching. 
 
The findings of the implementation elicit that teaching innovation through PBL ensure more successful scores than 
teaching by the use of more traditional methods and techniques. PBL is an outstanding approach as it is applicable to 
all grades of learners and almost in all areas of education. It provides an active process for students enabling them to 
cooperate with each other and motivating them through the activities and with a product that is presented by students 
to real audiences. In other words, PBL can be taken into consideration as a process innovation that leads peer-
learning, too. Especially, in pandemic terms PBL is a practical and future-oriented way of students’ evaluation. It is 
also thought as a future based method  
 
Furthermore, PBL may be recommended for use in other courses depending on implementation. In essence, PBL 
supports peer-learning by means of group working and learning principles. Before the process, a brief knowledge 
about projects may be given, thus this may help the students manage the time. Also group work in crowded 
classrooms can be a little bit hard and may create class management problem which can be a negative situation for 
timing. In that situation, number of group members may be limited by the academician. The full implementation of 
PBL in the curriculum is not easy to do, so the first experience can be a partial implementation, too.

Abstract 
Cat pet care services are increasingly popular amid the current trend of keeping cats. However, cat-sitting services 
dimensions and quality aspects must be precisely defined to match customer expectations and provide quality services. 
The SERVQUAL approach is used in this study to determine the dimensions of quality and Attributes of quality of 
service quality that characterizes pet hotels for cats. 7 service quality dimensions were identified through a literature 
study and Focus Group Discussion (FGD) involving consumers and veterinarians as the voice of customers, namely 
Tangibility, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, Empathy, Ethic Veterinary and Pet Safety, along with their 31 
attributes. Reflecting customer expectations and needs. The findings of this study provide detailed insights into the 
quality of pet hotel services for cats, assist business owners in improving service quality, and assist potential customers 
in selecting cat day care services based on their preferences.

1. Introduction
Caring for animals is a trend that is happening now because pets can reduce the stress experienced by animal owners. 
The benefits of having a pet, apart from reducing stress, are the feeling of having friends and feeling safer and even 
having an impact on health (Hussien, Soliman, and Khalifa 2021). According to a survey conducted by Rakuten Insight 
(Rakuten Insight 2021), Indonesia is ranked in the top four in Asia for residents who have pets, with the most pets 
owned being cats. Indonesia is also ranked first in Asia with the largest population of pet cats, with a percentage of 
47%. The large population of pets, especially cats in Indonesia, indicates that raising animals is very popular with the 
community. 
Caring for animals means that the owner must also fulfil the pet's needs to maintain its survival, such as providing a 
proper place, providing adequate food, washing it with shampoo to maintain its appearance, and even giving vaccines 
and taking it to the Vet for examination (Applebaum et al. 2020). Animal owners often give special treatment to their 
pets compared to just meeting their needs. 70% of animal owners think pets are like their own children (Quinn 2005). 
However, this closeness triggers concerns for pet owners when they have to leave their pets alone when they have to 
go on business, vacation, or other interests (Dowsett 2019). Because pets are being abandoned, there is no one to pay 
attention to and take care of the pets' needs. With these concerns, animal owners are made easier by the existence of 
a pet hotel business. 
A pet hotel is a service business that leaves pets for a certain period to be looked after and cared for properly. The 
services available at pet hotel cats vary, including living cages, dry food, wet food, snacks, drinks, places to eat and

dimensions, where the 5 quality dimensions are the standard SERVQUAL dimensions plus 2 additional dimensions, 
namely the ethics dimension obtained from the writings of Kabadayi and Cirpin and the pet safety dimension as a 
result of findings from stakeholder opinions and consumer comments as the voice of the customer. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Utilizing the SERVQUAL approach, this study seeks to determine the dimensions and aspects of service quality that 
characterize cat pet care services. Seven dimensions of the quality of cat care services have been successfully 
developed through analysis of literature reviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGD) involving consumers and 
veterinarians as the voice of customers, namely Tangibles, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, Empathy, 
Veterinary Ethics, and Pet Safety; along with 31 attributes that reflect the expectations and needs of customers. 
The results of the literature study show various characteristics that apply to the Tangibles and Assurance dimensions, 
while the Responsiveness, Empathy, and Veterinary Ethic aspects were identified through FGDs with input from the 
literature study. The Pet Safety dimension appears as a new dimension due to FGP, which prioritizes animal safety 
and health factors during maintenance. It is very important to include the consumer as the voice of the customer in the 
FGD when conducting this study so that the dimensions and quality created represent the actual expectations and 
demands. The SERVQUAL method also allows a systematic way to measure service quality. It is hoped that the 
findings of this study will add to overall knowledge about the quality of cat day care services, help company owners 
improve service quality, and guide potential customers in choosing cat day care services that match their expectations 
and needs.

Abstract 
Making strong predictions about the project completion time under uncertainty is crucial for project management. 
Therefore, when a project task duration is not exactly known, a probability distribution can be fitted to the duration to 
model randomness. However, choosing the wrong distribution can lead to serious errors. Triangular and beta 
distributions are generally preferred as task time probability distribution, but it can be very difficult for an expert to 
estimate the maximum value for triangular distribution and the mean and mode for beta distribution. Due to such 
shortcomings, instead of beta and triangular distributions, using lognormal and Weibull distributions which have long 
right tails may provide more accurate results when distributions that can take large values albeit with small 
probabilities are appropriate for a task time. In this study, data including task dependencies and task time estimates 
like minimum, most likely, and (probabilistic) maximum time is collected for 120 tasks of an electric vehicle 
production project. Then, triangular, lognormal, and Weibull probability distributions are fitted to all task times, 
respectively, and Monte Carlo simulations are performed to produce project completion times.  Finally, the probability 
distribution function of project completion time is obtained for each of the three distributional settings. The 0.9, 0.95, 
and 0.99 quantiles are used to analyze project completion time distributions and it is revealed that lognormally 
distributed task times yield significantly larger quantiles than others, also Weibull distribution causes greater quantiles 
compared to triangular distribution. It shows how unconscious selection of probability distribution can have 
misleading results.

Abstract 
Project failures resulting from requirements instability in enterprise asset development projects can detrimentally 
affect the strategic goals of sponsoring organisations. Previous research in project management has primarily 
concentrated on evolving business needs, technological changes, and socio-political complexity as drivers of 
requirements instability. However, emerging evidence suggests that the decision-making of project owners is also 
shaped by their emotional responses to various contextual conditions, such as the physicality of the asset, project scale 
and duration, asset lifespan, and perceived environmental uncertainty. In this paper, we draw on the psychological 
ownership theory to investigate how different configurations of contextual conditions contribute to requirements 
instability in enterprise asset development projects. Our empirical findings, delivered from a global survey of 274 
project management professionals, further elucidate the influence of project owners' emotions and perceptions on 
requirements change management decisions. Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we identify five 
distinct project configurations of contextual conditions that lead to high levels of requirements instability in enterprise 
asset development projects. We contribute to behavioural project management literature by offering a configurational 
perspective on how varying contextual conditions across projects impact project owners’ decision-making behaviours 
and choices.

Abstract 
In today’s dynamic business landscape, sustainability has become a defining concern, driven by increasing demands 
for eco-conscious practices from consumers, regulators, and stakeholders. This has put immense pressure on supply 
chains to undergo a fundamental transformation. Blockchain technology, renowned for its security and decentralized 
architecture, emerges as a promising solution to promote sustainability within supply chains by enhancing 
transparency, traceability, and trust. Blockchain contributes to economic sustainability by mitigating transaction costs 
and facilitating the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of supply chain operations. Blockchain benefits environmental 
sustainability by reducing carbon footprints through traceability practices. By fostering fair trade and protecting 
sensitive data and identities, blockchain can play a pivotal role in ensuring social sustainability. As such, many 
forward-thinking businesses are drawn to blockchain for sustainable business operations. However, reluctance remains 
due to uncertainties surrounding the factors influencing blockchain’s implementation. In this paper, we delve into the 
synergy between blockchain and sustainable supply chain, aiming to provide an overarching insight into the 
opportunities and obstacles presented by this integration. By shedding light on the transformative potential of 
blockchain, we hope to inspire a broader adoption and realization of sustainability goals within supply chains.

1. Introduction
Within the complicated landscape of global business, supply chains have tremendously evolved (Oppon et al., 2023; 
X. Zhang et al., 2023). The intricate supply chain networks span continents, seamlessly connecting producers,
suppliers, manufacturers, and consumers (Ali & Govindan, 2021; L. H. Zhang et al., 2023). While this unprecedented
interconnectedness has delivered remarkable efficiencies, it has also underscored a set of pressing challenges,
envisioned as the imperatives of environmental responsibility, ethical sourcing, and transparency (Ali et al., 2023;
Zhu et al., 2023). Therefore, achieving sustainability in supply chains is no longer an option; it has become an
indispensable goal for businesses and consumers alike (Mondal & Giri, 2022; Zeng et al., 2023).
Blockchain technology has emerged as a powerful tool to address these challenges and usher in a new era of
sustainable supply chains (Kayikci et al., 2023; Paul et al., 2021). The inherent characteristics of blockchain—
transparency, security, and decentralization—hold the potential to revolutionize the way supply chains are managed
and monitored (Holmqvist & Kowalkowski, 2023; Yavaprabhas et al., 2023). It can generate an immutable, tamper-
proof ledger of transactions and activities, instilling trust among stakeholders and enabling the traceability of products
and materials back to their origins (Creazza et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2023) supporting supply chain sustainability.
The objective of this paper is to delve into the potential of blockchain in transforming supply chains into sustainable
and responsible entities. Further, by exploring both the benefits and challenges of implementing blockchain

Abstract 
Digital resilience, the ability to withstand and recover from digital disruptions, is a critical aspect of contemporary 
organizations in the competitive business world. In this research, we explore the foundational concepts of digital 
resilience and emphasize the pivotal role of ethical imperatives in achieving its desired outcomes. This research poster 
makes a significant theoretical contribution to the arena of digital resilience by introducing a novel conceptual 
framework that extends existing literature and incorporates ethical imperatives and sustainable business practices. 
Drawing upon prior research on digital resilience and its outcomes, our study enriches the understanding of this 
concept by introducing a comprehensive and multidimensional framework. This framework is valuable for researchers 
and practitioners, offering insights into the intricate relationship between digital resilience, ethical imperatives, and 
sustainable business practices. Through a systematic literature review and thematic analysis, this study extracts 
essential dimensions and characteristics from previous research, shedding light on the most relevant aspects of digital 
resilience. Notably, our research represents the first attempt to conceptualize digital resilience in the context of

Abstract 
The recent surge in popularity of OpenAI's chatGPT, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, has 
highlighted the potential of these large language models for a variety of tasks. More and more people are using 
chatGPT as a virtual assistant in their daily lives, from work to personal tasks, to enhance efficiency. The rise of GPT-
related technology could transform the interaction between humans and machines into a collaborative team. This 
requires shared situational awareness, a level of understanding and agreement among team members on common 
aspects of the situation. Large, general-purpose multi-modal models like GPT have the potential to meet this 
requirement. Large global manufacturing organizations face many challenges in daily operations and management. 
These include the time and cost-intensive process of designing and developing new products and manufacturing 
processes, limited communication between factories in different countries, and the need for improved supply chain 
flexibility and risk management. The paper proposes a framework for a smart manufacturing system powered by a 
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model. The system is designed to construct a human-AI team and aims to 
reduce costs and time in product and process design, enhance operational efficiency, and boost internal and external 
communication effectiveness.

1. Introduction
The explosive growth of chatGPT, an AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, in the past few months, has attracted a huge 
amount of attention among the public to the capabilities of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models, a family 
series of large language models that is suitable for general non-specific task related applications. There is already a 
trend showing that more and more people are starting to use chatGPT, either with base model GPT3.5 or GPT4, as a 
virtual assistant in day-to-day life, from work to personal life to handle things more efficiently. The newest technology 
release of the chatGPT also enables the model to decide when and how to use web browsing or plugins during the 
conversation. Being the first series of large language models that is able to solve a variety of tasks well, the GPT 
models attract people through the chatGPT platform to learn their potential capability (Zhou et al 2023; OpenAI 2022). 
Many add-ons and AI tools are developed and deployed in various applications through API integration for better user 
experience and further exploration.   
With the rapid advancement of AI and other technology, the concept of Industry 5.0 has been proposed. Unlike 
Industry 4.0 where the focus is on data digitization and machine automation to reduce human involvement, Industry 
5.0 aims to rebuild a human-centric environment where humans and machines work together to boost work efficiency

4.6 Communicate 
Effective and efficient communication boosts the productivity of organizations in a way that streamlines workflows, 
minimizes misunderstandings, and fosters collaboration among team members. By participating in all working 
scenarios along with human employees, the GPT-powered tools can analyze the progress of different projects based 
on content from meetings, chats, emails, etc. Since the model is connected to the internal database, project-related 
financial reports and planned timelines are also accessible by the tools. With all the information available, the GPT-
powered tool is able to calculate the percentage of completion of the projects and predict whether the project can be 
finished on time and budget or has the risk of being delayed and over budget. This type of project management tool  
 will be an integral part of organizations seeking to optimize project planning, enhance resource allocation, and 
improve overall project execution.  
 
Communication with upstream suppliers and downstream targeted customers is as important as communication with 
organizations’ internal teams. An AI-based chatbot for handling customer complaints and requests will significantly 
increase the response time, leading to enhanced customer satisfaction. Likewise, an AI-based supplier collaboration 
platform enables timely information exchange and improves visibility across the supply chain.  
 
5. Discussion and Limitations  
Although the potential opportunities of integrating a general-purpose GPT model into a smart manufacturing system 
are promising, limitations and challenges still exist. The first is the need for substantial computational resources for 
training and fine-tuning the model. Additionally, the construction, maintenance, and management of such a large-
scale multimodal model also require significant technical expertise and human capital. The second challenge is the 
risk of data privacy and security when handling sensitive organizational information. Thirdly, the performance of the 
model along with the GPT-powered tools largely depends on the quality of training data, which may not always be 
readily available or adequately representative of a specific task. Lastly, when an AI system becomes a part of a team, 
the “black box” nature of complex AI models creates more challenges for human teammates to understand and trust 
the model’s outputs, which is crucial for effective collaboration. Thus, addressing challenges of transparency, 
explainability, and accountability is critical to the successful integration of a generalized AI model into a smart 
manufacturing system.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The paper proposes a framework for a smart manufacturing system powered by a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 
(GPT) model. The system is designed to construct a human-AI team and aims to reduce costs and time in product and 
process design, enhance operational efficiency, and boost internal and external communication effectiveness. The 
general-purpose GPT model is pre-trained on public data and then fine-tuned with specific organizational data to better 
perform tasks related to the specific domain. The model is integrated into the smart manufacturing system, connecting 
to the organization's internal database, internet, and smart sensors to gather relevant, up-to-date, and accurate data. 
 
The system is constructed to handle various tasks in a manufacturing setting. In the design phase, GPT-powered tools 
can help with market research, technical parameter calculation, and concept design generation. During the 
development and programming phase, these tools can assist in establishing a basic framework for the program and 
generate codes for robotics applications. In daily operations, the tools can extract and analyze unstructured data, 
enhancing shared context and situational awareness. For documentation, GPT-powered tools can generate text-based 
documents efficiently. In communication, these tools can analyze project progress, predict project outcomes, and 
handle communication with suppliers and customers. In essence, the GPT-powered smart manufacturing system is 
designed to act as a collaborative team member, enhancing various aspects of the manufacturing process from design 
to communication while supporting the adoption of new technologies.

Abstract 
The rapid evolution of customer demands has posed new challenges to manufacturing, leading to a shift towards mass 
customization and customer-centric approaches. This paradigm shift, driven by advancements in technologies such as 
additive manufacturing and digital technologies, has transformed assembly systems into smarter and more autonomous 
entities. However, the design and planning of assembly systems in this new context require greater speed and resilience. 
This paper proposes a digital twin-enhanced smart assembly system design for resilient operations to confront this 
challenge. The proposed design process leverages digital twin features and identifies several possible services enabled 
by digital twin. The paper also presents a framework for the digital twin-enhanced smart assembly system and 
discusses its implications and future directions.

1. Introduction
The rapid-evolving customer demands have presented new challenges to manufacturing. The need to satisfy customer 
demands drives manufacturing companies to focus on mass customization, a more customer-centric approach.  Mass 
customization recognizes the diverse needs and preferences of individual customers and aims to provide unique and 
tailored products at a scale (Jiao et al., 2003, Brettel et al., 2017). This paradigm shift involves remarkable 
advancements in various technologies, for instance, additive manufacturing, design technologies, and digital

motor continues running as a result of the malfunction of a sensor, the line can detect the fault status and stop 
automatically using SCADA, PLC digital twin, and servo motor digital twin, it can be found.  
 
5. Discussion and Limitations 
For a digital twin-enhanced assembly system, the digital twin technology is not the only keystone. Furthermore, the 
leverage of intelligence in the smart assembly system driven by the integration of digital twin technology is more 
important. Digital twin-enabled services and applications are the main characteristics of a DT-enhanced smart 
assembly system. Suitable digital twin design based on the services and applications in the system can implement 
proper use of the collected data which transfers the unstructured data to important information for system design 
decision-making, system maintenance, and system analysis. There are three major limitations of this work. Firstly, a 
general design method is not proposed. Secondly, the lack of technical methodology for some services and applications 
in the system framework. Thirdly, the lack of case studies for validating the proposed design process and new system 
design. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This paper proposed an original concept of the digital twin-enhanced smart assembly system for resilient operation. 
By presenting a general design process of the proposed system, the advancements enabled by digital twin technologies 
are clear. The advancements are not only in accelerating the design process but also in the post-design stage. 
Furthermore, the term resilient operation is also defined by the scope of the assembly system. Four unique services 
and applications based on digital twin technology are identified which are DT-enhanced operator training, DT-
enhanced self-awareness data analysis, DT-enhanced scheduling & planning, and DT-enhanced rapid modification 
validation. The future work of this paper has three aspects. The first aspect is to apply the proposed design process to 
an actual smart assembly line design case. The second aspect is to develop a general design method for the smart 
assembly system. The third aspect is to continue working on some methodologies of services and applications 
demonstrated in the framework of smart assembly systems.

Abstract 
Blockchain technology, as a distributed digital ledger with the features of transparency, traceability, and security, has 
the potential to contribute considerably to sustainable supply-chain management (SSCM) activities within enterprises 
and may already be used to achieve this in some instances. To gain an understanding of the importance of blockchain 
technologies in the implementation of SSCM, this study conducted an extensive literature review before investigating 
the ScienceDirect database of articles on SSCM and blockchain. The study used bibliometric and content analysis to 
analyze the ScienceDirect SSCM and blockchain publications and reveal their intellectual structure and publishing 
patterns. Findings were that the field of blockchain and SSCM is still emerging and the number of articles published 
in the field is growing swiftly in both developed and developing countries. Decision science; computer science; 
business management and accounting; economics; econometrics and finance; energy; engineering; environmental 
science; social science; and multi-disciplinary fields were found to be the areas in which the SSCM and blockchain 
are discussed within the ScienceDirect journals. The articles reviewed were published from 2018 to 2023. It was found 
that even though blockchain technologies are still in their early stage and developing in the space of supply-chain 
management, these technologies can play a vital role in executing SSCM activities. 
Keywords 
Sustainable supply-chain management1, Blockchain 2, Bibliometric analysis 3, Transparency 4, and Traceability 5. 
1. Introduction
All stakeholders in a supply-chain system rely heavily on accurate data and strategic business procedures. However, 
a lack of mutual trust can be an obstacle to implementation (Al-Rakhami and Al-Mashari, 2021). Collaborative 
partnerships can be established through either trust-based interactions or electronically mediated exchanges (Myhr 
and Spekman, 2005). The implementation of a shared ledger as a security measure has the potential to eliminate the 
numerous audits that are currently necessary for supply-chain management systems and processes (Breese-Vitelli et 
al., 2019). A distributed ledger limits opportunistic behaviour and the influence of environmental and behavioural 
uncertainty (Schmidt and Wagner, 2019). The blocks within the network comprise transactions that are immutable, 
encrypted, and tamper-proof. A distributed network helps facilitate a decentralized consensus protocol that is 
responsible for validating these transactions. 
Blockchain technology has been cited as a tool that can assist in the implementation of successful sustainable supply-
chain management (SSCM) within industries (Munir et al., 2022). SSCM needs to consider all issues across the 
product lifecycle and the conduct of all suppliers in the supply-chain network (Fiksel, 2013). Ensuring that its business 
activities are conducted in an environmentally and socially sustainable operational manner is also a vehicle for

blockchain and were therefore included as part of the top 18 leading keywords. The words are found to be relevant 
and linked to the keywords presented in Figure 3. For example, the Internet of Things is linked to innovation and 
smart contracts, which are linked to the agricultural supply chain. There are many applications that researchers have 
invented using blockchain smart contracts in the agricultural sector. The agricultural sector is essential for every 
country, developed and developing, and these smart innovations are linking stakeholders all over the world, which is 
uplifting the economic and social factors of many countries. Through environmental management, waste is reduced, 
and focal companies are ensuring food safety through the food supply chain, which advocates the traceability and 
transparency of the supply-chain activities. 
 
In conclusion, the analysis of the leading subject areas, document types, and keywords related to SSCM and 
blockchain provides valuable insights into the current state of research in this field. The dominance of engineering 
and computer science as leading subject areas suggests that quantitative studies and applications are at the forefront 
of research in this area. The prevalence of journal articles as the most common type of document indicates that rigorous 
peer-review processes are being applied to research in this field. The top five keywords related to SSCM and 
blockchain highlight the key concepts and topics being discussed in the literature. Overall, this analysis provides a 
useful snapshot of the current state of research on the use of blockchain technology in SSCM. 
 
4.5 Proposed improvements 
The following improvements are proposed to increase the understanding and advancement in the implementation of 
blockchain technology in the SSCM domain: 
• 
Further study is needed to delve deeper into the potential advantages and obstacles associated with the 
implementation of blockchain technology in SSCM. The research should concentrate on practical use cases 
and real-world examples. 
• 
Increased cooperation among scholars in prominent fields such as Engineering; Computer Science; 
Environmental Science; Business Management, Economics and Accounting; and Social Science would be 
beneficial to devise interdisciplinary methodologies for the investigation of SSCM and blockchain 
technology. Different faculties or disciplines can work together on a combined project. 
• 
Further advancement of stringent peer-review mechanisms is necessary to guarantee the excellence and 
dependability of research in this domain. 
• 
There has been a notable shift towards emphasizing the social and economic dimensions of sustainability in 
the context of SSCM and blockchain research, in conjunction with the traditional focus on environmental 
considerations. This could be further encouraged by academic institutions and governmental institutions. 
 
4.6 Validation  
Google Scholar was used to verify some of the sources and also check whether the data analysed from the 
ScienceDirect databases corresponded with the data found on Google Scholar. In the search of “sustainable supply 
chain management”, the results of the first 25 articles from 2018-2023 were downloaded and Atlas.ti was used to 
check the leading words, and then compare the words with the keywords found in the data from the ScienceDirect 
journals. The comparison revealed that the leading words appeared on both sites. Word clouds were developed using 
the first 25 articles from ScienceDirect journals and 25 articles from Google Scholar and slight differences were found 
between the two clouds. The document types retrieved from Google Scholar were also checked against the 
ScienceDirect documents. Document types across the two sites were also found to be slightly different, as books and 
reviews such as of conferences were excluded through the selection of peer-reviewed journals only for the 25 
downloaded Google Scholar articles. A comparative analysis was conducted on the data obtained from ScienceDirect 
and Google Scholar for the subject of sustainable supply chain management. The findings indicated that there were 
common prominent terms present on both platforms, albeit with modest variations in the word clouds and document 
categories. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This research shows the potential of blockchain technology to tackle significant obstacles within supply-chain 
management and enhance SSCM. The extensive literature review and biometric analysis point to the utilization of 
blockchain technology as useful for promoting transparency and traceability within supply-chain operations. 
Blockchain technology provides a clear view of supply-chain activities, which in turn promotes sustainability and 
enables stakeholders to evaluate environmental impacts, social responsibility initiatives, and the financial aspects of a 
supply chain. Encouraging businesses to adopt blockchain technology and engage in collaborative efforts with

stakeholders has the potential to advance the adoption of sustainable practices. Furthermore, the implementation of 
blockchain technology guarantees security in financial transactions, lowers expenses, and increases operational 
efficacy through the automation of supply-chain activities and the establishment of trust among supply-chain 
members. It would benefit the field for future study to explore industry-specific implementations of blockchain 
technology in managing the supply chain, taking into account the needs of and obstacles faced by diverse sectors such 
as healthcare, manufacturing, or food supply chains.

Abstract 
The article proposes optimizing pallet control in mass-consumption companies through layout optimization. The study 
will be conducted in a Peruvian company that experiences an annual loss of $175,000 due to the absence of pallet 
traceability and management in its distribution centers. The methodology will be the SLP, precisely the quantity, 
distance, and effort matrix, to develop an appropriate layout design and implement a barcode system to manage and 
track pallets properly. The study aims to reduce pallet waste and save 32% on indirect materials supply at least 
annually. The implementation of an automated warehouse, which provides significant improvements to the processes 
of organizations and better traceability of pallet flows, will be proposed. The study also aims to identify the current 
management of pallets and their movement in the plant and implement the optimized flow within the plant, adapting 
it to the company's needs and specificities. The proposed design is expected to improve the company's gross profit 
and reduce the amount allocated to acquire pallets annually.

1. Introduction
The mass consumption industry projects an increase since 2020 in Peru of 4.7 million dollars in the 2022 to 5.1 million 
at the end of 2023 and 5.6 million by 2024. (Euromonitor, 2023). Increased productivity brings the greatest use of 
indirect manufacturing materials. These materials do not have correct management and traceability, which generates 
losses of up to 175 thousand dollars annually, which affects the gross profit of the company, according to what was 
discussed with the head of indirect materials. (McLean et al., 2014), assures that the redesign of the plant improves 
traceability and organization of indirect and direct materials. 
The general objective of the research is to propose an adequate design of a model of Layout in center D for tracking 
and managing pallets in mass consumption companies. Not without first knowing the current management so that the 
proposal adapts to the specific needs of the plant and in search of a reduction in the amount allocated to the acquisition 
of pallets by the company annually. 
The design of an automated warehouse is an industry 4.0 solution, since it provides significant improvements to the 
processes of organizations and is widely used in storage, which proposes better traceability of pallet flows, as well as 
space optimization (Edouard et al., 2022). One of the main tools to improve the flow of direct materials and indirect, 
is the design of facilities or PSL (Systematic Layout Planning), which allows reducing the distance traveled by the 
materials (Meyers et al., 2006). In addition, this methodology provides different distributions to evaluate the one that 
best suits the company.

1. Obtaining the supplier's barcodes 
2. Request for pallets from the supplier. 
3. Entry of pallets to the warehouse, in which the logistics operator places the codes. This store information such as 
pallet supplier, returns made, manufacturing batch, age of the pallet, etc. 
4. Use of scanning pallets at each point in charge of each logistics operator. 
5. Disposal of the pallets and sending to the collection area in which the barcode is also removed. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This work started from the perspective of a plant that had a poor distribution, which meant that the pallets did not have 
correct traceability. It is for this reason that the Layout design and the effort matrix were applied, which allowed us to 
identify which of The proposals generate less effort to be the one chosen. According to Súle (2001), efficient 
distribution can also contribute to the reduction in production cycles, material handling, etc. For the correct 
distribution, loads and the distance to the travel point were taken, to later make calculations of the effort and the 
number of pallets that are removed during the process. It is in this sense that the proposed distribution presents less 
effort than the current one. Furthermore, as Batista Martins & Tavares de Freitas (2011) mention, good distribution 
helps with flexibility and reduction of time by up to 20%. In the same way, the new proposed distribution presents a 
travel time of 15 minutes compared to 45 minutes in the current version, the result being 66% less than in the original 
plan. Furthermore, according to Mejia et al. (2011) the correct tracking of materials through a control system improves 
the lifetime of indirect materials by not rotating outside their established flow. The average lifetime of the pallets in 
the current distribution is 1 year; however, in the proposed design it is 2.5 years. 
 
Finally, the research allowed us to determine what would be the ideal flow through which the pallets should be 
managed, and this also allowed savings of 32% of the total annual supply costs of indirect materials. Finally, this 
could be achieved with the WMS tool connected to the company's ERP.

Abstract 
As energy companies look to diversify their portfolio in renewable energy, the demand for electrification will continue 
to increase. There will be increasing demands on the electrical grid infrastructure. Distributed energy resources (DER) 
such as solar photovoltaic (PV) on rooftops and electric vehicles will experience a host of operational issues such as 
hosting capacities, overloads, reverse flow, phase balance, frequency drift and voltage variation. Battery energy 
storage systems can help mitigate some of these problems. In this paper, the literature and public available information 
on operational battery storage systems in Australia are reviewed and discussed. It is found that both small batteries 
and large batteries both fundamentally address grid operational issues. As Australia moves towards high DER 
penetration and high renewable energy generation, there will be a need for more battery energy storage systems to 
offset operational issues. The lack of private funding especially for smaller batteries may possibly cause PV DER to 
lag the overall demand for electrification.

1. Introduction
Battery energy storage systems (BESS) are currently experiencing a rapid surge in interest in public and private firms 
looking to diversify their portfolio in renewable energy. As distributed energy resources (DER) such as solar 
photovoltaics (PV) on rooftops, electric vehicles (EV) and electrification increases, demand on grid infrastructure also 
increases and the need to mitigate grid operational issues. BESS’ can serve as a means to mitigate grid operational 
issues. These operational issues include DER hosting capacity limits, equipment overloading, reverse flow, phase 
balancing, frequency drift, voltage variation and system inertia all contributing to overall system stability and 
resilience. However, there is not much literature on how the grid operational issues are mitigated apart from  the 
objectives that firms declare and aim to achieve in their BESS projects.  
1.1 Objectives  
In this paper, BESS’ that are currently operational in Australia are reviewed for their grid operational issue 
mitigation objectives and their associated effectiveness.  
2. Literature Review of Operational Issues BESS Projects can Address
The objective of mitigating grid operational issues can be summed up as: In Australia, the Australian Energy Market 
Operator (AEMO) operates the National energy market (NEM), wholesale energy market (WEM) and ensures that 
Australian business, industry and household consumers have access to safe, reliable electricity exactly when required.

6. Conclusion 
As small batteries tend to justify their viability with DNSP deferred augmentation and large batteries aim for 
maximising revenue from FCAS markets, they are both fundamentally addressing grid operational issues. As 
Australia moves towards high DER penetration and high renewable energy generation, growth in BESS’ supply is 
required to continue to offset operational issues. The lack of private non DNSP firms funding smaller batteries is 
clear that revenues are not tied to the operational issues of time shifting peak solar and increasing host capacity. If 
BESS growth was to slow due to lack of investment, it is possible to see PV DER also lag (Gilmore, Nolan and 
Simshauser 2022).
