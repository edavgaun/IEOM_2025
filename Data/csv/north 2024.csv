Abstract 
The construction industry plays a crucial role in improving the socio-economic development of rural and urban 
communities. The sector is also responsible for providing employment and business opportunities for members of the 
society. Thus, reducing the level of poverty. The masonry brick construction SMEs contribute towards South Africa’s 
GDP and economic growth. However, there are organisational challenges that confront the masonry brick construction 
SMEs and adversely affecting their productivity growth. The study was exploratory in nature and reviewed literature 
covering research constructs involving investment in human capital, just-in-time and workplace layout. Furthermore, 
how these productivity systems can be incorporated within operational process in order to grow productivity. Thus, 
achieving market and financial feasibility.

5. Limitations and future research 
This paper reviewed literature on identified research constructs, which limited the research study’s overall 
generalizability, as it is part of a continuing research for my doctoral studies. In addition, the study does not take into 
account all productivity improvement systems. As a result, this opens up other research possibilities regarding 
productivity improvement systems. In the future, it is important to quantitatively, quantify the impact of productivity 
systems on the masonry brick construction SMEs' productivity growth.

Abstract 
We consider the problem of remanufacturing planning in the presence of statistical estimation errors. We model this 
problem as a robust Markov decision process, where the true system transition probability is assumed to be unknown 
but lie in an interval-based uncertainty set. We establish structural properties of optimal robust policies under this 
uncertainty set. A computational study on the NASA turbofan engine shows that our data-driven decision framework 
consistently yields better worst-case performances and higher reliability of the performance guarantee.

Abstract 
In this study, we develop a cost estimation model for healthcare service delivery and introduce the design concept of 
an integrated healthcare system for collaboration between remote facilities. Lifelong care for chronic diseases 
necessitates regular monitoring by physicians, extending beyond routine medical examinations. Focused on the 
healthcare service scenario tailored for chronic disease care, our paper not only proposes a cost estimation model but 
also outlines a service system design for the investigated healthcare management. The cost model is crafted by 
predicting utilization and attendant costs, employing a stochastic model—specifically, a Markov process. 
Furthermore, this paper presents a system design concept for healthcare services, showcasing a remote collaboration 
framework between home and hospital. The analysis of medical data occurs within the cloud-based healthcare 
environment, emphasizing the potential of integrated and collaborative approaches in healthcare delivery.

Abstract 
This study aims to identify the key factors that contribute to successful outcomes in agile projects. A survey was 
conducted with 121 experts in the field, and confirmatory factor analysis was used to establish a construct related to 
project success. Multiple linear regression analysis was then employed to determine the significant CSF that influences 
success. The results indicate that 59.7% of success in agile projects can be explained by the identified factors. These 
factors include aligning work processes with agile methodologies, providing training and education on agile practices, 
prioritizing interpersonal skills and communication over processes and tools, co-locating project teams, engaging 
customers in the development process, and ensuring staff expertise.

1. Introduction
Add Towards the end of the 1990s, software development teams began adopting new work methodologies aimed at 
enhancing programming processes and making them more continuous and incremental. These methodologies were 
centered on concepts such as autonomy, adaptability, modularity, and collaboration (Hidalgo, 2019). 
In the early 2000s, a group of seventeen software developers published the ""Agile Manifesto"" in which they sought to 
establish fundamental principles and values for enhancing software development projects. These principles formed 
the foundation of what is known as ""Agile Project Management"", a methodology that has since gained widespread

These findings support the work of Haritonova (2023), Ammar et al. (2022), and Lawton (2021) who also foundthat 
an Integrated Data Ecosystem is necessary for effectively integrating digital twins in the construction industry. Digital 
twins are a viable technique for encouraging sustainability and circular economy principles in the building sector of 
the United Kingdom. Successful implementation necessitates the creation of an Integrated Data Ecosystem that 
gathers, organises, and analyses data from diverse sources like Building Information Modelling (BIM), Geographic 
Information Systems (GIS), and virtual design and construction (VDC) tools. Utilising Advanced Data Analytics is 
essential for effectively implementing digital twins in the circular economy strategy of the UK construction industry. 
Real-time Data Analysis is a crucial component of Advanced Data Analytics that enables the immediate processing 
of data from digital twins, offering significant insights into the performance of constructed assets. This allows for 
well-informed decision-making on sustainable practices, as proposed by (Frąckiewicz, 2023). Predictive Analytics, a 
crucial element of Advanced Data Analytics, helps detect possible problems by examining past data and seeing 
patterns, ultimately enhancing resource allocation and supporting the circular economy, as proposed by (Gamota, 
2022).  
 
5. Conclusion and area for further research 
This research paper examined digital twin and circular economy by investigating the benefits and enablers of adopting 
DT for enhancing CE in the UK construction industry. The primary benefits and enablers of DT for enhancing CE 
were identified based on data collected in the United Kingdom. According to the study's findings, the potential benefits 
of digital twins in enhancing circular economy in UK are enormous. Digital twin can enhance circular economy in 
numerous ways, including reduction of construction waste, facilitating the identification of opportunities for material 
recycling in construction, improving the tracking and management for materials recycling in construction, enhancing 
optimization of design and planning processes to achieve circular economy, useful for monitoring of construction, 
enable better tracking of materials in real-time, potential for to lower construction costs in the long run, it can enhance 
optimization of design and planning processes to achieve circular economy, among other things. The findings of the 
enabling factors influencing Digital twins in enhancing circular economy practices in UK are an Integrated Data 
Ecosystem is necessary for effectively integrating digital twins in the construction industry. Digital twins are a viable 
technique for encouraging sustainability and circular economy principles in the building sector of the United Kingdom. 
Successful implementation necessitates the creation of an Integrated Data Ecosystem that gathers, organises, and 
analyses data from diverse sources. Utilising Advanced Data Analytics is essential for effectively implementing digital 
twins in the circular economy strategy of the UK construction industry. Real-time Data Analysis is a crucial 
component of Advanced Data Analytics that enables the immediate processing of data from digital twins, offering 
significant insights into the performance of constructed assets. Predictive Analytics, a crucial element of Advanced 
Data Analytics, helps detect possible problems by examining past data and seeing patterns, ultimately enhancing 
resource allocation and supporting the circular economy. 
 
The findings of the study suggest that the best way to promote digital twins in enhancing circular economy in the UK 
construction industry is the creation of an Integrated Data Ecosystem that gathers, organises, and analyses data from 
diverse sources. Utilising Advanced Data Analytics, Real-time Data Analysis, Predictive Analytics, and Virtual 
Design in Construction are essential for effectively implementing digital twins in the circular economy strategy of the 
UK construction industry.As a result, it is recommended that the role of government is important in driving this digital 
twin incorporation in circular economy.Sufficient government support, with clear call for more robust state-backed 
incentives, policies, and assistance is required and government should engage with industry leaders, experts, and 
stakeholders to understand their needs better and formulate supportive policies.These legislation and policies can 
include but are not limited to: For instance, government can give financial incentives such as subsidies and tax rebates 
to encourage digital twining and circular practices and development. Due to time and financial constraints, the study 
was limited to the Lincoln, United Kingdom; however, additional research can be conducted in the other areas of 
United Kingdom to provide a nationwide picture of enablers and benefits of DT in enhancing CE for the construction 
industry.

Abstract 
Scoliosis is a musculoskeletal condition characterized by an irregular sideways curvature of the spine, often leading 
to difficulties in sleeping due to associated symptoms such as back pain, neck instability, and difficulty breathing. In 
a recent study, a new ergonomic memory foam cervical curve pillow was developed specifically for scoliosis patients 
to alleviate discomfort and improve sleep quality. This pillow, made with alternative organic wool material, aimed to 
provide better support and comfort for individuals with scoliosis. The study found that the proposed pillow 
significantly reduced discomfort and pain compared to traditional pillows, leading to improved sleep quality for 
patients. Data collected through survey questionnaires and focus interviews supported these findings, with a paired t-
test analysis confirming the pillow's effectiveness. The study recommended the integration of this ergonomic pillow 
into scoliosis pain management practices, emphasizing the importance of consulting healthcare professionals before 
use. Patients with scoliosis are encouraged to incorporate this specialized pillow into their sleep routine under medical 
supervision to optimize comfort and support.

1. Introduction
Sleep comprises one-third of a person's life; using an optimal pillow for appropriate neck support to maintain the 
cervical curve may contribute to improving the quality of sleep. The design of an orthopedic pillow conforms to 
orthopedic guidelines and ensures the right support for the cervical curve. Scoliosis is a complex spinal condition that 
causes various symptoms, including pain and discomfort. While pillows can be helpful for some patients with 
scoliosis, they are not always effective for everyone. Here is some information and literature that suggests memory 
foams and new pillows may not be effective for scoliosis patients.

Abstract 
In response to challenges within the solid waste industry in Puerto Rico, this research focused on enhancing Material 
Recovery Facility (MRF) operations using Lean Six Sigma. Employing the DMAIC framework, the study tackled 
recurring downtime at one Puerto Rico MRF. Key findings include identifying root causes, such as conveyor jams 
and material entanglements, and proposing improvements like continuous professional development, preventive 
system upkeep, and specialized equipment additions like the Industrial Bag Opener and Motorized Brush. The study 
projected a 30% downtime reduction, yielding an annual saving of around $97,630. This ROI calculation factored in 
operational enhancements and equipment costs, highlighting the financial benefits of Lean Six Sigma integration. 
Emphasizing Lean Six Sigma's value in MRF operations, the study provides insights for the industry and underscores 
data-driven waste management enhancements. Moreover, its alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals 8, 
9, and 11 highlights contributions to decent work and economic growth (SDG 8), industry, innovation, and 
infrastructure (SDG 9), and sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). The research showcases the practical 
advantages of Lean Six Sigma in MRF operations, serving as a model for the broader waste management sector and 
affirming the value of data-driven enhancements.

1. Introduction
This research paper examines the challenges faced by the solid waste industry in Puerto Rico, particularly in material 
recovery facilities (MRFs), which are essential for sorting and processing recyclables. According to EPA & FEMA 
(2020), these facilities need more downtime, decreasing operational efficiency, increasing costs, and potential waste 
accumulation. The study explores the application of Lean Six Sigma, a methodology combining Lean's waste-
elimination and process-optimization principles with Six Sigma's focus on reducing process variation and defects, as 
a solution to these challenges. While Lean Six Sigma has been successful in other industries, its application in Puerto 
Rican solid waste management, particularly in MRFs, is under-researched (Closed Loop Partners, 2020). 
The research focuses on a case study of an MRF in Puerto Rico, implementing Lean Six Sigma and its DMAIC 
methodology. Considering its unique operational context, it aims to identify strategies and best practices for applying 
this methodology in this MRF. The study will discuss the results and advantages of Lean Six Sigma implementation 
in the MRF, address challenges and barriers, and provide recommendations for successful integration. This research 
contributes to understanding Lean Six Sigma's application in the solid waste industry and material recovery facilities, 
offering potential solutions to improve efficiency and reduce downtime.

4.5. Control 
In the Control phase of this research, the focus was on maintaining the success of the improvements implemented in 
the MRF through continuous monitoring and optimization. Key strategies adopted included: 
•
Predictive Maintenance Strategy: A data analytics strategy was implemented to anticipate equipment issues,
reduce unplanned downtime, and optimize operations.
•
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs): Clear SOPs were established, and regular training sessions were
conducted to equip operators with the skills to manage downtime situations effectively.
•
Regular Review and Follow-Up Meetings: Periodic meetings were held to evaluate the implemented
improvements, analyze Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and adjust strategies for continuous reduction in
downtime.
5. Results
As of the article's publication date, the Improvement stage proposed for the Puerto Rico MRF is in the process of 
implementation. Effective cleaning of conveyor belts in an MRF, especially when facing constant contamination, is 
expected to reduce downtime significantly. Drawing on industry benchmarks and operational analyses, such as those 
by Koussaimi et al. (2016), downtime reduction can vary from 20% to 50%. For the Guaynabo MRF, a conservative 
estimate of a 30% reduction in downtime was chosen for calculating the final Return on Investment (ROI), considering 
the current lack of robust conveyor belt cleaning procedures and the problem of contaminated incoming waste streams. 
The financial impact of this reduction is substantial, reducing downtime by 301.6 hours. Considering the hourly 
operating cost of $437.50, the annual savings are estimated to be $131,950. The ROI is achieved in 5.7 months, 
yielding a net savings of $62,630. Annually, after the first year, the savings amount to $97,630, accounting for annual 
operating costs of $34,320. This figure illustrates the financial benefits of investing in conveyor belt cleaning and 
optimization and emphasizes its potential to enhance operational efficiency and profitability at MRFs. 
6. Conclusion
This research applied Lean Six Sigma principles within the DMAIC framework to improve operations at one Materials 
Recovery Plant (MRF) in Puerto Rico, focusing on reducing downtime in the sorting process. Key findings identified 
conveyor belt jams, material entanglements, and cardboard sorting delays as primary causes of downtime. 
Recommendations include ongoing workforce training, proactive maintenance strategies, enhanced supplier 
collaboration, and the integration of specialized equipment like the Industrial Bag Opener and Motorized Industrial 
Brush. The study predicts a significant 30% reduction in downtime, leading to an estimated annual savings of around 
$97,630, considering both the costs of operational improvements and equipment acquisition. This highlights Lean Six 
Sigma methodologies' financial benefits and effectiveness in optimizing MRF operations. Moreover, the research 
aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 8 (decent work and economic 
growth), SDG 9 (industry, innovation, and infrastructure), and SDG 11 (sustainable cities and communities), 
demonstrating its broader positive impact on society and the environment. This study underscores the value of data-
driven improvements in waste management practices

Abstract 
In human resources operations, it is crucial to anticipate potential employee turnovers to implement effective planning 
strategies, like employee recruitment and training planning. In addition to exploring the feasibility of predicting 
employee turnover based on non-job-specific features, this study identifies the most important candidate 
characteristics for predicting potential turnover. These features encompass demographic and educational data and are 
applicable across various industries rather than being confined to a specific industry. The dataset used is characterized 
by its imbalanced nature where class proportions are skewed, necessitating the inclusion of every data point for 
comprehensive analysis. A comparative investigation was conducted, evaluating different sampling methodologies to 
handle imbalanced data including up-sampling and down-sampling, alongside various classification algorithms such 
as ensemble learning techniques and Support Vector Machines (SVM). As the result of this study, the significance of 
each feature was determined through the application of the most effective model, namely Random Forest, which 
achieved an accuracy rate of 87.3% and an area-under-curve score (AUC) of 87.3%, which exceeded previous studies 
using the same dataset. These metrics not only indicate the model's ability to correctly classify employees into potential 
turnover and non-turnover categories with high accuracy, but also highlight its capability to minimize false positives 
and false negatives, which is crucial for decision-making processes.

1. Introduction
In one of the primary operations of Human Resources Management Planning (HRMP), a sub-sect of Human Resources 
Management (HRM), the effective fulfillment of an organization’s requirements is accomplished by determining 
appropriate staffing levels and necessary skills for hired staff (Mouzala, 2022). Training newly hired employees is a 
proven way to both motivate employees (Ozkeser, 2019) and improve their job performance. However, the 
administration of training for new hires comes with a monetary and time cost; according to the Association of Talent 
Development’s (ATD) 2016 report (ATD Releases 2016 State of the Industry Report, 2015), the average cost of 
training is 84 dollars per hour as of 2015, and the average required training time is 33.5 hours per employee. According 
to the same report, organizations around the world spent an average of 1,252 dollars for the training and development 
of each new employee hired.

Abstract 
Recently, the application of spark plasma sintering (SPS) as a novel method in the fabrication of polymer and polymer-
based composites have drawn the attention of researchers and industries. Owing to its advantages over the 
conventional polymer and polymer-based composites processing method. SPS is a sintering technique for producing 
components with high density at relatively low sintering temperature and short sintering time. However, as SPS allows 
good control of the sintering operation parameters and material microstructure compared to the traditional sintering 
technique, for example hot pressing, the review study focused on the fabrication of polyimide (PI) and PI-based 
composites using SPS technique. The unique characteristics ascertained from the SPS sintered PI-based 
micro/nanocomposites were discussed. Hence, it was observed that the mechanical, electrical, thermal stability, ant-
wear, and corrosion resistance of PI-based composites could be improved using the SPS process favourable for 
industrial and advanced engineering applications. Furthermore, the authors ended the review with challenges and 
recommendations for future advancement of SPS applications practicable for commercial production. Thus, the review 
will pave the way for future research among polymer scientists, industrialist, and engineer.

1. Introduction
With the rapid development of automobiles, aerospace, microelectronics, and energy storage technology, polymers 
and their adventures are urgently needed. Polymer matrices, such as polyethylene, epoxy, polyamide, and polyimides 
have been used in the design and fabrication of micro and nanocomposites for most engineering and technological 
applications. Owing to their specific characteristics, such as strength-to-weight ratio, low dielectric constant, anti-
wear, chemical stability, and durability (Zang et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2021]. However, among these polymer matrices, 
polyimides (PIs) have gained much attention in recent years in the fabrication of polymer-based matrix composites 
because of their physiochemical characteristics, like mechanical strength, thermal stability, and chemical stability 
(Ogbonna et al., 2020). And polyimide (PI) as one of the most high-performance polymers reportedly maintains these 
characteristics even under harsh environment (Rajan et al., 2022). Thus, with the inherent properties of PI and its 
application as polymer matrix in fabricating both micro and nanocomposites, several studies have been conducted in 
obtaining through superior properties of PI-based material filled with inorganic fillers (e.g. Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2, BaTiO3, 
and MgO) using different fabrication methods (Ai et al., 2020; Li et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2023). Such as solution 
casting, in situ polymerization, hot pressing, sol-gel, and spark plasma sintering. However, of all the stated fabrication 
methods used in preparing PI and PI-based composite materials for engineering applications, spark plasma sintering 
(SPS) reportedly novel, cost effective, and easy to operate with low temperature sintering (Adesina et al., 2021; Tokita, 
2021; Ogbonna et al., 2022). Thus, the review study focuses on the fabrication and characterization of inorganic fillers

time using 3D turbula dispersion and other advanced dispersion methods should also be incorporated in the design 
and fabrication of PI-based composites employing SPS sintering. As to gain proper understanding and exploring of 
SPS technologies route in solving many material production challenges. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The processing of PI-based composites using the SPS sintering method was reviewed. The review demonstrated the 
practicability of involving the novel SPS method in fabricating PI and its micro/nanocomposites. From the review, 
SPS sintered PI-based composites remain a promising material in the composition and development of components 
for mechanical load bearing and mechanical friction, as well as insulation applications. Owing to the mechanical, 
wear, electrical, thermal stability, and corrosion behaviour of the PI-based composites reported in the study. Thus, 
SPS technique could be used in mitigating issues of PI and PI-based composites degradation arising from fabricating 
polyimide-based material at high-temperatures due to the practicability of SPS sintered polymers at low sintering 
temperature when compared to the conventional method such as melt processing method. However, as SPS PI-based 
materials are generally characterized with high mechanical hardness and elastic modulus, challenges associated with 
PI-based composites using SPS sintering were also presented. Thus, more suitable optimization of the SPS and 
dispersion parameters should be considered in achieving more superior properties of the spark plasma sintered PI and 
PI-based composites.

Abstract 
This research proposes the knowledge-based prerequisite framework (KPF) and presents a novel mathematical model 
that supports the KPF. Prerequisite knowledge of a course is defined as a set of knowledge that students should acquire 
in order to take the course, as opposed to a set of courses. The knowledge-based prerequisite framework is more 
flexible because it requires only essential prerequisite knowledge, while the course-based prerequisite framework is 
more rigid and students are usually required to take all prerequisite courses. Such flexibility can be obtained by 
verification of specific prerequisite knowledge terms for each course. However, flexibility can cause additional 
complexity in prerequisite verification. Furthermore, the knowledge-based prerequisite framework inevitably involves 
handling hierarchies of defined knowledge terms. This research presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) Planning 
mathematical model that enables the knowledge-based prerequisite framework by automatically verifying prerequisite 
knowledge and incorporating hierarchical knowledge relationships among knowledge terms into the model. The 
proposed model finds hidden or better solutions that could not be obtained by earlier approaches. The results of the 
comprehensive experiments show the optimality of the solutions obtained by the mathematical model and demonstrate 
the outperformance of the hierarchical relationship incorporation into the mathematical model in terms of the quality 
of solutions. Finally, the experimental results on scalability show the necessity of the development of efficient heuristic 
algorithms.

Abstract 
Many attempts and contributions were made to make the human body modeling an easy and accessible task. We need 
to model the human body for several reasons; First, the classification of human bodies based on shape analysis allows 
the comparison between individuals and enables the distribution of the population for many purposes such as clothing 
and virtual dressing in shopping purposes.  Second, the virtual visualization and animation of human models and 
avatars are also beneficial in movies, and advertisement industries. Furthermore, these techniques prove to be essential 
in medical applications as well. An example of a medical application is the creation of orthotics and prosthetics 
designs. Another example is monitoring the growth and the posture of the body to determine an adequate dose of 
prescribed medications. In this report, we present an overview of the literature on human body 3D modeling 
techniques, and we analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each modeling technique. We also discuss the techniques 
of data acquisition of the CAESAR models which is a large database 3D models of human body. In addition, we 
discuss the most important methods used in 3D data representation and surface reconstruction. This work will help 
scientists and programmers better understand the different technologies of the industries that use 3D modeling and 
scanning techniques of human bodies.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 has the potential to transform the service sector, enhancing efficiency and quality. While its impact on 
manufacturing is well-studied, its implications for services remain less explored. To address this gap, we conducted a 
scoping literature review with two main objectives: 1) to investigate the specific ways Industry 4.0 has influenced the 
service sector and 2) to compare and contrast the implementation of Industry 4.0 across manufacturing and service 
industries. Our paper aims to analyze the applications of technologies like AI, Cloud Computing and Big Data 
analytics in the service industry, providing insights to develop roadmaps for leveraging Industry 4.0 concepts 
effectively. We reviewed articles published within the last five years from Web of Science and ScienceDirect. From 
a pool of 71 eligible articles, data were extracted and analyzed using descriptive and quantitative methods. The 
findings lay a foundation for future research on Industry 4.0's impact on the service industry, known as Service 4.0.

1. Introduction
We are witnessing an unprecedented era of technological advancement spurred by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and 
data-driven technologies. This convergence has ushered in Industry 4.0 – the fourth industrial revolution transforming 
businesses, societies, and the way we interact with technology. This revolution builds upon the first (water and steam 
power), the second (mass production and electricity), and the third (computers, automation, and telecommunications). 
Industry 4.0 further accelerates technological innovation through developments in big data, artificial intelligence, 5G 
communication, and cloud/edge computing. 
Industry 4.0 was first announced as a German high-tech development initiative and later elaborated upon in academic 
literature by Schwab (2015, 2016). Schwab outlined the vast potential and interconnectedness of emerging 
technologies like AI, robotics, the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, nanotechnology, 
biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 integrates physical and data technologies such as Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and big data 
analytics, transforming both manufacturing and service industries. Central to Industry 4.0 is digital transformation, 
which infuses data technologies throughout businesses, enabling insights into manufacturing processes, identifying 
areas for improvement, and optimizing operations and services. A key challenge of digital transformation lies in 
determining who will lead the transformation and maintain digital assets. Organizations may opt to purchase SaaS 
(Service as a Service) digital products or develop their own. However, maintaining control over digital assets during 
transformation proves daunting. Digital products, akin to black boxes, are user-friendly yet challenging to control and 
comprehend. The opacity of production development and unfamiliarity with data technologies often cause 
organizations to hesitate in their digital transformation decisions. In this paper, we propose a solution that divides 
digital product development into pure engineering and business configuration components. Each aspect can be 
concurrently developed by engineers and business owners. This approach allows business owners possessing domain 
knowledge and requirements to actively engage in digital product development alongside development engineers, 
comprehensively understanding and controlling their digital assets. With this solution, business owners assume full 
control of business logic and requirements, while engineers focus solely on engineering products that can be easily 
extended, upgraded, or replaced. This framework reduces dependencies on data technology and engineering efforts, 
empowering business owners to drive and lead digital transformation. A data engineering project is presented to 
illustrate the design of a scalable, plug-and-play framework.

Abstract 
Supply chain managers rely on decision-making support to enhance resilience in the face of disruptions, emphasizing 
real-time monitoring and recovery actions. The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the necessity of digitalization for 
supply network mapping. Generative AI (Gen-AI) models offer transformative potential across various domains, 
facilitating proactive crisis management and resilience enhancement in supply chains. Specifically, ChatGPT's natural 
language capabilities streamline communication and aid in predicting disruptions. This study employs the Fuzzy AHP 
to investigate Gen-AI's impact on resilience drivers, integrating expert opinions and quantitative analysis. The research 
aims to identify key drivers influenced by Gen-AI, providing actionable insights for supply chain management 
strategies. Agility emerges as the most significant factor, followed by flexibility, visibility, information sharing, and 
collaboration. While collaboration ranks lowest, it remains vital for overall resilience. These findings support existing 
research, emphasizing the growing significance of agility in supply chains throughout market uncertainties. Gen-AI 
adoption improves agility by optimizing inventory management and response to disruptions. This research underscores 
the critical role of integrating Gen-AI to develop customized resilience strategies in supply chain management. By 
emphasizing agility, flexibility, and stakeholder cooperation, organizations can effectively leverage Gen-AI's 
predictive capabilities to enhance resilience and responsiveness in dynamic market environments.

1. Introduction
As significant global disruptions like the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain resilience 
(SCRes) has gained widespread attention. Companies are increasingly prioritizing investments to improve their 
resilience, focusing on managing unforeseen disruptions and maintaining uninterrupted critical supply flows. This 
entails enhancing predictive capabilities and proactively managing threats to supply chains (Queiroz et al., 2022). In 
our current dynamic landscape, characterized by political, economic, and social challenges, the urgency to embrace 
cutting-edge technologies is paramount. Ongoing disruptions have resulted in inefficiencies, diminished effectiveness, 
customer dissatisfaction, extended delivery times, and declining revenues for businesses. It is essential for firms to 
recognize that unresolved issues concerning end-to-end visibility and collaboration pose significant threats to the 
sustainability and resilience of their supply chains (Pandey et al., 2024). The transformative impact of novel 
technologies is fundamentally reshaping the landscape of SCM as a whole, with a notable impact on SCRes. Digital 
technology encompasses a fusion of Industry 4.0, the Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, Blockchain Technology, 
Big Data Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, and Additive Manufacturing 
(Ivanov et al., 2021). Implementation of emerging technologies within the downstream supply chain has been shown 
to influence consumer purchasing intentions and the rate of product returns (Sanaei, 2024). In the contemporary 
business and technological realm, supply chains require continuous access to information to navigate various threats

on resilience and emphasizes the need for further exploration into the practical implications of implementing this 
technology. 
 
This study offers a comprehensive framework for assessing the impact of implementing Gen-AI on SCRes, providing 
practical guidance for practitioners and managers seeking to enhance resilience within and across organizations. 
Prioritizing key criteria, it facilitates the development of customized resilience strategies to navigate competitive 
markets effectively. Additionally, it equips practitioners and managers with the tools necessary to evaluate and 
improve their resilience performance. Furthermore, the prioritization of drivers provides a structured approach for 
optimizing the utilization of Gen-AI, aiding organizations in selecting the most suitable strategies. The study's findings 
offer actionable insights for practitioners and decision-makers to design effective processes for enhancing Gen-AI 
adoption and bolstering SCRes. 
 
Identifying agility and flexibility as essential factors in implementing Gen-AI for resilience strategies highlights the 
importance of integrated systems. Such systems foster enhanced collaboration and information sharing among supply 
chain stakeholders, thereby enhancing preparedness for unforeseen events. Stakeholder cooperation is crucial for 
fortifying resilience across the entire chain. Moreover, leveraging Gen-AI's predictive capabilities enables supply 
chains to respond swiftly to changes in consumer behavior, market trends, and demand, ensuring resilience against 
disruptions. Minimizing operation times further enhances responsiveness, enabling efficient meeting of demands 
within limited timeframes. Moreover, managers need to prioritize investments in both AI literacy and infrastructure 
while fostering a culture of empathy and transparency to effectively integrate Gen-AI across diverse sectors and 
navigate the challenges of ethics, regulations, and data fragmentation. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The global disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly affected both supply and demand 
dynamics. In response, companies are increasingly adopting Generative AI (Gen-AI) implementation to strengthen 
resilience. This strategic approach aims to reinforce supply chains, ensuring they have the resilience needed to 
withstand and thrive during such disruptions. The paper utilized a literature review to identify key conceptual drivers. 
Our research provides valuable insights that contribute to ongoing discussions regarding supply chain resilience 
(SCRes) and Gen-AI, particularly from a conceptual drivers’ standpoint. By applying the conceptual driver’s 
framework, we aim to enrich theoretical understanding by bridging concepts from operations management and 
information systems. Our findings underscore five key domains where Gen-AI stands to bolster SCRes: agility, 
visibility, flexibility, collaboration, and information sharing. These areas represent pivotal opportunities for leveraging 
Gen-AI to fortify supply chain operations against disruptions. Subsequently, data collected through a questionnaire 
administered to experts underwent prioritization using the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP). This 
approach yielded relative weights for various factors influencing SCRes due to Gen-AI. Multicriteria decision-making 
techniques, such as Fuzzy AHP, were deemed optimal for addressing such complex issues. The study's findings 
underscore agility and flexibility as the most influential drivers impacted by Gen-AI. Additionally, the research 
suggests that all five drivers exert varying degrees of influence on achieving resilience.

Abstract 
With the current advancements in technology across various sectors and the increasing flow of data from different 
sources, the need for innovative methods in managing, analyzing, and forecasting business metrics has become crucial 
for companies seeking a competitive advantage to remain in the market while maximizing profits. This study explores 
the application of various machine learning and traditional statistical regression models to predict profit based on real-
world datasets encompassing market dynamics for over 200 office products. Different factors, including price, cost of 
goods sold, advertising spend, stock levels, and competitor prices, have been considered to predict the profit of each 
product. Additionally, the study demonstrates the comparative effectiveness of using machine learning against 
traditional statistical regression models. The models considered in this study include Ordinary Least Squares and 
Generalized Least Squares as traditional regression models, and different machine learning models including Linear 
Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Regression, K-Nearest 
Neighbors Regression, and Decision Tree Regression. These models are evaluated based on performance metrics such 
as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared. The evaluation results 
indicate that Random Forest performs the best, followed by Decision Tree Regression and then Gradient Boosting 
Regression. In the validation, the results of these measures show that Gradient Boosting Regression, followed by 
Random Forest, demonstrates the best prediction performance. Based on these findings, we can confirm that Gradient 
Boosting Regression and Random Forest models exhibit the best performance, offering superior prediction results. 
These results align with previous findings presented in the literature review, confirming that machine learning models 
have better prediction capability and accuracy than the traditional regression approaches.

1. Introduction
The increased volume of data across all sectors, particularly in business, underscores the importance of managing, 
analyzing, and leveraging our data to gain insights into the current situation and predict future performance has grown 
significantly. As the volume of data generated and transferred by different sources continues to grow, there emerges 
a need to apply effective and innovative techniques that support the process of making business decisions and keep 
organizations competitive in the market (Altarazi, Santos, and Tomchesson, 2023). 
One of the most important aspects that companies are interested in understanding better is the profit of their products. 
Profit depends on many factors, primarily the overall costs of the products and the selling price. Other factors could 
include market demand, production efficiency, and competitive pricing strategies (Nagle and Müller, 2017). Profit 
prediction can be done using various quantitative models and data-driven methodologies. These approaches involve 
analyzing historical data, market trends, and relevant economic indicators to more accurately forecast potential future

6. Conclusion  
Using the proposed methodology, several models that were capable of predicting profit have been developed. In 
general, machine learning models exhibit better performance compared to traditional statistical regression models. In 
the evaluation, the results of Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R-squared 
indicate that Random Forest performs the best, followed by Decision Tree Regression and then Gradient Boosting 
Regression. In the validation, the results of these measures show that Gradient Boosting Regression, followed by 
Random Forest, demonstrates the best prediction performance. Based on these findings, we can confirm that Gradient 
Boosting Regression and Random Forest models exhibit the best performance, offering superior prediction results. 
These results are in line with previous findings presented in the literature review, which confirmed that machine 
learning models have better prediction capability and accuracy.  
 
For future work, additional factors could be considered in profit prediction models, such as market trends or economic 
indicators. Additionally, investigating hybrid models that leverage the interpretability of traditional statistical 
regression while harnessing the predictive power of machine learning algorithms might offer a more balanced and 
versatile solution. For machine learning models that display behavior similar to statistical regression models, 
additional investigation is required to uncover the underlying reasons behind these model behaviors.

Abstract 
Organizations have shown increased interest in implementing Business Process Automation (BPA), particularly 
through the adoption of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technologies. While RPA has proven its successful 
applications in many sectors and cases with delivering many benefits to companies, including reducing process time 
and costs, some associated challenges have either caused the failure of its implementation or undermined its 
advantages. This study conducts a literature review to identify common challenges organizations face in implementing 
RPA initiatives. The results of the thematic analysis reveal ten key challenges, including concerns regarding job 
displacement, knowledge and experience gaps, process selection difficulties, communication barriers, security and 
privacy concerns, technical limitations, organizational barriers, supplier and regulatory challenges, resistance to 
cultural change, and maintenance and continuous improvement. The findings of this study provide valuable insights 
for practitioners and researchers alike, informing strategies to address challenges and optimize RPA implementation. 
Future research could extend this analysis longitudinally, explore industry-specific challenges, evaluate the 
effectiveness of mitigation strategies, and investigate the broader implications of RPA adoption on organizational

Abstract 
Banks are rapidly transitioning their traditional services to online platforms to meet the increasing demand for 
convenience. However, certain demographics, like the elderly, engage with technology differently. This study 
evaluates how senior citizens in the National Capital Region of the Philippines utilize electronic banking (e-banking) 
services. It examines unique technological, physiological, and societal factors influencing the elderly's use and 
satisfaction with these systems. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected through surveys administered to 
Filipino citizens aged 60 to 80 with e-banking experience in the past 3 years. Statistical analysis, specifically partial 
least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using WarpPLS 8.0, was conducted on the gathered data. 
Findings reveal that user-friendliness and perceived trust significantly impact senior citizens' satisfaction, with gender 
having a minor effect. The study suggests prioritizing user experience in e-banking services, emphasizing digital 
inclusiveness for the elderly, which can benefit all demographics. Additionally, enhancing perceived trust through 
cybersecurity measures is recommended. By focusing on these aspects, banks and financial institutions can better 
cater to the needs of elderly users while improving overall service quality and security for all customers.

Abstract 
Climate change is a critical issue for communities as natural disasters tend to be bigger and more intense. To respond 
effectively to these disruptions, optimal scheduling for restoration efforts is essential. Despite the growing importance 
of bolstering the security and resilience of CIs, current studies on CI lack a comprehensive framework to optimize 
restoration across multiple subsystems while considering organizational factors, resource constraints, and complex 
network interdependencies. This study presents a dynamic restoration scheduling model for restoration under resource 
constraints. A hybrid simulation model comprehensively represents CI, including organizational dynamics and 
network evolution. Crew agents learn to schedule through a reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for 
decentralized scheduling. Additionally, a novel memory-based reward shaping enables crews to learn from their past 
experience and motivates them to opt for better policies. Therefore, with this integration of reinforcement learning 
and intrinsic motivation through reward shaping, crews learn to perform restoration to achieve a long-term resilient 
network. The proposed model is applied to water and transportation networks in the City of Tampa, FL.

Abstract 
This work presents the feasibility of synthesizing titanium alloy matrix composites (TMCs) with improved mechanical 
properties intended for energy-saving high-temperature aerospace application. The study investigated the effects of 
distinct refractory nitride reinforcements, comprising 5 wt. % each of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), titanium nitride 
(TiN), and aluminium nitride (AlN), on the mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V matrix composites produced through 
spark plasma sintering (SPS), a novel sintering technique that facilitates rapid heating and cooling rates. The 
microstructural and phase constituents of the sintered TMCs were characterized using scanning electron 
microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. Afterward, density, nanoindentation and 
compressive tests were conducted to evaluate the densification, nanohardness, modulus of elasticity and compressive 
strength of the materials, respectively. The outcomes demonstrate that SPS made it possible to achieve well-refined 
grains, highly densified samples (95.14 - 99.77%) with strong matrix-reinforcement interfacial bond. Besides, it is 
found that the sintered TMCs exhibit significantly improved nanohardness (10.062±0.27 - 70.782±0.79GPa), superior 
modulus of elasticity (153.35±3.14 - 356.76±4.05GPa) and enhanced compressive strength (1.179 – 2.528GPa) 
compared to the unreinforced alloy.

1. Introduction
Within the aerospace industry, materials play a crucial and vital role at every stage of the lifecycle of an aircraft, from 
initial design to manufacturing, certification, flight operations, maintenance, and eventual end-of-life disposal (Jawaid 
and Thariq, 2018). Aerospace materials include the structural components of aircraft airframes that support the loads 
placed on them during flight operations and the structural components of jet engines that support the forces needed to 
generate thrust that propels the aircraft forward. The airframe's components—the wings, fuselage, empennage, and 
landing gear of an aircraft—as well as the turbine blades, the primary part of jet engines, are examples of aerospace

Abstract 
This research introduces an innovative approach to enhance modular system configurations, focusing on the critical 
aspect of backward compatibility. By employing human involvement in the component selection process, the study 
aims to efficiently solve the compatibility challenges between new and legacy components within modular systems, 
a prevalent issue in computational design. The core of this research is to optimize the configuration process, ensuring 
that systems can seamlessly integrate both current and legacy components without sacrificing performance or 
flexibility, and uncover concealed solutions that are not identifiable when backwards compatibility is not considered. 
An interactive user interface is developed and integrated into the approach, allowing users to customize system 
configurations to their specific needs and preferences by incorporating advanced web interfaces. A user-friendly web 
application is developed using TypeScript for a responsive and intuitive frontend, coupled with a robust Python-
powered backend. These web interfaces facilitate a highly interactive user experience, enabling users to not only 
specify initial and final configurations but also to select intermediary components or interfaces. This feature empowers 
users to explore a wide range of configuration pathways, including those that might not be immediately obvious, 
thereby discovering the most efficient and compatible system configurations. This user-centric design ensures that the 
proposed approach is not only theoretically sound but also practical and user-friendly.

Abstract 
Cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital assets based on blockchain technology and aim to be used for exchange. 
The integration of cryptocurrencies into e-commerce has gained substantial attention due to its potential to 
revolutionize traditional payment systems. This survey explores the components that impact the acceptance of 
cryptocurrencies to conduct transactions, receive services, and make purchases on e-commerce platforms. We aim to 
provide a comprehensive picture of factors, specifically perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and trust, that 
influence the acceptance of cryptocurrencies by utilizing the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 
(UTAUT) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) using Partial Least Squares- Structural Equation Modelling 
(PLS-SEM). The collected results reveal the significant influence of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness 
on behavioral intention and the correlation between them, as evidenced by this study on the acceptance of 
cryptocurrency in the e-commerce segment.

1. Introduction
In the contemporary landscape, advancements in work and commerce have captured the interest of diverse enterprises 
and communities. With the rapid evolution of technology and the pervasive influence of digitalization, staying current, 
elevating customer satisfaction, and addressing contemporary needs following the prevailing conditions are deemed 
crucial factors in the success of commercial industries worldwide.  
The e-commerce domain, presently constituting a significant portion of the business landscape, is advancing 
consistently. As online shopping is a voluntary decision using technology provided by an organization, required, so 
researchers and managers try to understand consumer behavior better because adopting e-commerce differs entirely 
from adopting a new technology in an organization (Fayad and Paper 2015). This increases people’s satisfaction with 
online shopping, increases the number of visitors, and ultimately causes the growth of e-commerce. Identifying the 
reasons that attract customers to choose a technology and buy from it is a critical and absorbent topic. We will hear 
more about this topic in the future than today (Fedorko et al. 2018). It requires the analysis of its social, cultural, and 
economic environment (Valencia et al. 2019; Lu and Jin 2009). The modified version of the Technology Acceptance

5. Conclusion and Future Research 
In this study, we gathered 270 valid responses from a representative sample of society, 270 individuals, in order to 
demonstrate the existence of business growth in the e-commerce sector, with a particular focus on Turkey. It is self-
evident that restrictions on electronic businesses are no longer appropriate, given the impending digitization of 
everything and the expanding and rising popularity of digital currency among people around the world. Using 
cryptocurrencies as an alternative payment method is expected to gain significant traction in the near future, as 
evidenced by its implementation by several renowned corporations across the globe. The main goal of our research is 
to investigate the variables that influence the assumption of digital currencies as an alternative to traditional payment 
techniques in the field of e-commerce; hence, we prepared a model based on the existing literature and the calculated 
items of the constructs that are already obtained. We try to find these constructs in the form of TAM and use smart 
PLS as a method of our analysis.

The outcomes of our research show that the perceived usefulness has strongly affected behavioral intention in a 
positive way, as we expected at first, according to its p-value and the path coefficient results. According to other 
research, we expected that perceived ease of use has positively affected behavioral intention, but the result shows that 
although this hypothesis is not supported according to the result of its p-value, as we see the path coefficient result, 
the obtained number is negligible; It is crystal clear that finding the cause of this answer makes it easy to change this 
result, which may be a misunderstanding of the respondents to the questions about this construct can be one of the 
reasons of this result, which can be solved in subsequent research. We predicted that trust, as one of the important 
components of our model and financial issues, has significant effects on PEOU and certainly the adoption of the latest 
technologies. The evidence indicates that the hypothesis on the impact of trust on PEOU has been rejected. This result 
contradicts our initial hypothesis regarding the significant impact of trust on PEOU. Finally, we would like to point 
out the impact of perceiving the ease of using technology on perceiving its usefulness, according to the obtained 
results, with the p-value less than 0.5 and the positive correlation between these constructs according to their path 
coefficient; this hypothesis is strongly supported. 
 
Regarding the r-square results, it is evident that a low value indicates insufficient constructs that influence BI. To 
solve this, incorporating additional constructs, including an increase in the number of items, is necessary to obtain 
more valid responses. That might be effective for further research. Effective questionnaire design and valuable 
responses from participants are crucial in research that relies on data obtained from people's answers, as various factors 
can influence how people respond. Different responses from participants may yield useful insights to validate results 
and facilitate the implementation of e-commerce technology. 
 
While this work has made multiple contributions, it is important to note that there are limits that can guide future 
research. Initially, our research was exclusively carried out in Turkey. Hence, the analysis may vary if the suggested 
model is examined in a different nation with distinct cultural norms and for diverse age groups. Furthermore, our 
model accounts for approximately 4.4% of the variance in behavioral intention to use. Hence, future research can 
explore supplementary frameworks pertaining to the utilization of cryptocurrency in electronic commerce. Ultimately, 
this study incorporated demographic variables as elements into the model. Hence, the forthcoming research can 
incorporate variables such as gender, age, and education level into the proposed model.

Abstract 
The paper emphasizes the benefits of employing magnetic fluids as lubricants in the development of hydrodynamic 
bearings in terms of carrying abilities. A brief discussion regarding the preparation of lubricants with unique 
magnetic properties is followed by analytical and numerical approaches for establishing the carrying ability of 
hydrodynamic bearings. The flow simulations, performed in identical geometrical and dynamic conditions, shows 
the increase in carrying ability and reduction of cavity in hydrodynamic bearing lubricated with magnetic fluids. In 
addition, the retention of the magnetic lubricant between the journal and bearing in the presence of a constant 
magnetic field permanently provides fluid friction for all flow regimes.

1. Introductory Notes
In hydrodynamically lubricated bearings the solid surfaces are in contact only when the shaft is rotating below its 
aquaplane rotational speed. In other words, adhesive wear occurs during the transient regimes of startup and 
shutdown. Regardless of a low cost compared with other bearings with comparable load and very low friction 
coefficients, many types of hydrodynamic bearings can catastrophically seize under shock or unexpected loss of 
pressure of the supplied lubricant. 
In hydrodynamic bearings lubricated with ferrofluids and placed in a permanent magnetic field, a constant pressure 
of magnetic nature develops in the lubricant. This magnetic pressure is independent of the relative movement of the 
shaft in the bearing, prevents a solid to solid contact between surfaces in transient regimes, and limits or eliminates 
the cavitation. In addition, the magnetic field retains the ferrofluidic lubricant in place during the steady-state regime 
and eliminates the need of constantly feeding lubricant in such hydrodynamic bearings.  
2. Review of Classical Hydrodynamic Bearing’s Differential Equations
Experiments performed by Tower (1883-1891) showed that loaded hydrodynamic journal bearings experience a 
pressure buildup within the lubricating film when the journal is in rotation. He also noticed that the supported 
bearing load is proportional to the average dynamic pressure developed in the steady-state regime and the projected 
bearing area.

and the cavitation is eliminated. The numerical simulation is confirmed by experiment in the presence of a powerful 
magnetic field generated with a neodymium magnet with the shape suggested in Figure 4. 
 
5. Concluding Remarks 
The paper is introducing the readers to the world of ferrofluids and their remarkable potential to the hydrodynamic 
lubrication. A brief review of the analytical challenges generated by Reynolds differential equation and its numerical 
solutions for journal bearing with finite length is followed by a simulation of pressure distribution in such journal 
bearings and the revelation of cavitation effects on classical hydrodynamic journal bearings. 
 
Important distinction between magnetorheological fluids and ferrofluids is followed by a discussion of experimental 
challenges encountered in the preparation of magnetic fluids and the characterization of the specific magnetic 
parameters of ferrofluids involved in hydrodynamic lubrication. 
 
Finally, analytical and numerical approaches on hydrodynamic lubrication of journal bearings with ferrofluids are 
revealing the remarkable abilities of such bearings in terms of increase carrying abilities, reduction or elimination of 
cavitation and elimination of systems of feeding the lubricant into journal bearings due to the lateral leakages 
because the magnetic fluids also act as sealants and prevent lateral leakages. In addition, the retention of the 
magnetic lubricant between the journal and bearing in the presence of a constant magnetic field permanently 
provides fluid friction for all flow regimes.

Abstract 
Lightweight and stable robotic arms are essential devices in flexible manufacturing. The paper introduces a scalable 
robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom controlled either by mouse or joystick and powered by serial bus servos and 
discusses its  stability, kinematic characteristics and hardware and software implementation. The authors emphasize 
the benefit of 3D computer design in the mechanical development of scalable robotic arms. Such approach allows a 
quick and precise evaluation of distances between the joints with direct consequences in kinematic evaluations, 
interchangeability of bus servos required in scalability and overall an optimized design.

Conclusions 
Robotic arms used in flexible manufacturing must be portable, stable and precise. The paper discusses a 5 degrees of 
freedom robotic arm with enhanced stability for the entire working space of the robot. 
 
The development of such robotic arms must include enhanced and reliable evaluations of the robot working space 
and the robot space, including frame definitions, frame placement for Denavit-Hartenberg convention and specific 
Matlab implementations and algorithms for both direct and inverse kinematics. Such evaluations are not trivial in 
nature. The authors discussed the forward kinematic analytical problem and detailed the frame definition of the 
robot using the Homogeneous Transformation Matrix in order to relate the end-effector pose with the base frame. A 
Matlab approach is suggested for a numerical solution. The Denavit-Hartenberg convention infers a distal 
methodology to write the kinematic equations of any robotic arm. Less intuitive than the Homogeneous 
Transformation Matrix approach, it requires more abilities regarding the definition of the frames. 
 
The repeatability requirements of any robotic arm involved in flexible manufacturing is guaranteed by the 
employment of powerful and intelligent bus servos controlled by a single-core microcontroller with ARM Cortex-
M3 core. Finally, the flexibility of the robotic arm discussed is supported by the implementation of multiple control 
methods: mouse, PC computer, joystick or smart phone. 
 
The 3D CAD model employs commercial parts and allows the export of geometric parameters for the kinematic 
evaluations. A scalable robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom developed on open source platforms and based on the 
design discussed in the paper shows remarkable repeatability on pick and place operations.  Further developments 
are discussed in the paper Sensor Control of Portable Robotic Arms, also introduced at the 9th North American 
Conference of IEOM in Washington DC, United States.

Abstract 
The supervision of nuclear energy utilization is carried out by the Regulatory Body through regulations, licensing, and 
inspections covering aspects of safety, security, and safeguards. To engage in Indonesia nuclear-related activities, 
permission must be obtained from the Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency, BAPETEN, through the submission of 
licenses via the BALIS Online, which is a database provided and utilized in the licensing application process for the 
field of nuclear energy in Indonesia. Digital maturity model can be defined as a digital transformation process which 
defined, managed, measured, and continuously improved. Utilizing specific maturity framework, organizations can 
assess their current digital maturity level. This study aims to define the digital maturity position of BALIS and how 
to improve that in the organization.  The Assessed digital maturity process categories include strategic governance, 
information and technology, digital process transformation, and workforce management. The assessment outcomes 
outline five maturity stages, from performed to innovating, each denoted by levels one through five. These levels serve 
to gauge the maturity of BALIS. By employing sound strategies, prioritization can be given to sub-criteria with low 
maturity levels but high overall importance, thereby enhancing BALIS digital maturity. Crafting this strategy involves 
literature study and determining strategic priorities through AHP-TOPSIS.

1. Introduction
The Indonesian government is seriously committed to achieving Net Zero Emission (NZE) by 2060. To achieve this, 
a transition from the current energy system to a clean energy system is necessary in order to balance human activities 
with natural equilibrium. The energy transition scenario towards NZE relies on renewable energy power generation. 
Nuclear energy, which has characteristics that are almost carbon-free and can continuously generate large amounts of 
power, is also part of this transition. The application of nuclear technology in Indonesia requires strict supervision to 
ensure that all forms of nuclear energy utilization are conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and are not 
misused. According to Law Number 10 of 1997 on Nuclear Energy, the supervision of nuclear energy utilization is 
carried out by the Regulatory Body through regulations, licensing, and inspections covering aspects of safety, security, 
and safeguards. The Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency (BAPETEN) is a non-ministerial government institution 
responsible for overseeing all nuclear energy utilization activities in Indonesia. The duties and functions of BAPETEN 
are carried out through three aspects of supervision: regulation, licensing, and inspection, which play a crucial role in 
ensuring the safety of workers, the public, and the environment. 
To carry out its duties and functions as a Regulatory Body, BAPETEN has introduced the BAPETEN Licensing and 
Inspection System Online (BALIS Online). BALIS is implemented based on the Head of the Nuclear Energy

6. Conclusion
Through literature review, the chosen model for assessing the digital maturity level of BALIS Online is DX-CMM 
(Digital Transformation-Capability Maturity Model), a framework developed by Goklap & Martinez in 2021 to gauge 
the extent of an organization's digital implementation. The results of the assessment of the organization's digital 
maturity in implementing BALIS Online yielded an IT maturity score of 3.17, indicating an ""established"" level. 
Regarding the assessment results of each evaluation criteria, Strategic Governance obtained a score of 3.47, 
Information and Technology obtained a score of 3.11, Digital Process Transformation obtained a score of 3.16, and 
Human Resource Management obtained a score of 3.00. This indicates that overall, the digital maturity level of BALIS 
Online is progressing well, but there are still some aspects that have room for improvement. In an effort to enhance 
the digital maturity of BALIS Online, a literature review was conducted to determine strategic recommendations, 
resulting in 7 recommendations for improving the digital maturity of BALIS Online. The generated strategies were 
then prioritized using the AHP-TOPSIS method, resulting in 7 prioritized strategies. The strategy with the highest 
priority order is prioritized for early implementation, which is SP6 - Developing a clear roadmap for digital maturity 
improvement activities with a priority score of 0.163.

Abstract 
Color sorting, control by touch or sound and ability to perform auto-sorting are characteristics of modern robotic 
arms and make them desirable in automatic lines. The paper discusses the implementation of sensor control in a 
robotic arm suitable for flexible manufacturing and emphasizes the benefits of such addition in terms of scalability.

Introductory Notes
The implementation of sensor control on robotic arms significantly increases their overall functionality on fully 
automatic assembly lines or flexible manufacturing cells and adds scalability to such systems and include various 
loading, unloading, transfer and sorting applications Mourtzis et al. (2020), Costea et al. (2023) and Wang (2023). 
Regardless of application, robotic arms must satisfy specific requirements for the duration of their service: 
•
Repeatability in reaching specific positions and orientations of the end-effectors’ coordinate frame
•
Smooth transience and minimal steady-state errors for all dynamic situations
•
Improvement of scalability by implementation of multiple control methods for the robotic arm via sensor
blocks

The paper emphasizes the importance of robot arm dynamics for repeatability, smooth transience and minimal 
steady-state errors as a pre-requirement for adding functionality via sensor implementation. The sensor assembly 
works with the robotic arm with 5 degrees of freedom discussed in Lightweight Robotic Arm for Flexible 
Manufacturing, also introduced at the 9th North American Conference of IEOM in Washington DC, United States.  
 
Description and comments on both hardware and software implementations of sensor blocks alongside 3D CAD 
representations of the sensor assembly are also emphasized by the paper. Finally, a sample of the sound control code 
developed in Arduino IDE is shown. 
 
All sensors employed in the development of this sensor assembly are compatible with Arduino Uno microcontrollers 
and are commercially available. Experiments performed by the authors with the discussed robotic arm and involving 
color, touch and sound control sensors show a remarkable repeatability, a smooth transient vibrational behavior and 
recommends this approach due to its software and hardware scalability on many flexible manufacturing systems for 
parts transfer and parts sorting.

Abstract 
The paper discusses various failure modes associated to the links of bucket chains used in gold and tin mining in 
marine and alluvial environments. Failure control and the simulation of static and dynamic stresses developed in the 
operation of bucket ladder dredges using the Finite Element Method are also examined in detail.

1. Introduction
Dredging is a method for recovering mineral deposits below the water table, mostly associated with gold, tin and 
precious gem mining. All dredging processes can disturb marine or alluvial sediments, leading to short and long 
term water pollution, destroy important seabed ecosystems, and can release human-sourced toxins captured in the 
sediment. However, such negative impacts are balanced by important economic benefits. One of the most versatile 
dredger is the bucket dredger. Such dredgers are equipped with a continuous chain of buckets, which are carried 
through a structural element known in alluvial mining as ladder. A typical bucket dredger is represented in Figure 1. 
The power requirements for the excavation must include such functional aspects as lifting the soil, the friction of the 
buckets over the guiding rollers and the tumblers and the friction in tumblers.  If the desired cutting production is

The theory of cumulative damage assumes that a stress cycle with an alternating stress above the endurance limit 
inflicts a measurable permanent damage. It also assumes that the total damage caused by a number of stress cycles is 
equal to the summation of damages caused by the individual stress cycles. 
 
The fatigue plots related to the dredge bucket discussed in this paper show that failure due to fatigue does not occur

The damage, life, load factor and biaxiality plots are included in Figure 11 for reference. The load factor is 1. The 
biaxiality indication is defined as the smaller principal stress divided by the larger principal stress with the principal 
stress nearest zero ignored. A biaxiality of 0 shows uniaxial stress. A value of -1 corresponds to pure shear and a 
value of 1 corresponds to a pure biaxial state.

5. Conclusion 
The Ladder Bucket Dredge is a versatile system on dredging processes. It must perform on dry, alluvial and marine 
environments and it is designed for a long service time with minimal and well defined maintenance costs. 
 
The progress in the development of engineering design software allows a new approach in the design of ladder 
bucket dredges, with full parametric 3D computer aided design, engineering support and simulation of the behavior 
of the assembly under various static and dynamic loading conditions. 
 
A brief discussion of potential failure modes of Bucket Ladder Dredges is followed by a discussion of simulation 
methodology implemented for the evaluation of failure due to fatigue on bucket chain links. Detailed examples 
supporting the methodology are included and discussed in the paper. It is shown that a proper simulation of fatigue

failure requires motion simulation as a reliable step in evaluating and transferring motion parameters - reaction 
forces and moments, accelerations, velocities – to the fatigue simulation. 
Finally, the fatigue simulation reveals that for the geometry, loads and material associated to the link – dredge 
bucket – failure does not occur for N = 106 cycles.

Abstract 
The Order Acceptance and Scheduling (OAS) problem poses a significant challenge in manufacturing due to its 
computational complexity. Therefore, it is common to use relaxation techniques and heuristic algorithms for solving 
this problem but these methods relax the precedence constraints or the capacity constraints to simplify the problem 
which can lead to infeasible solutions. Consequently, ensuring a feasible solution requires a feasibility restoration 
mechanism. However, such mechanisms, typically heuristic, cannot guarantee optimality. In this study, we introduce 
a mathematical model aimed at optimizing the feasibility restoration process. Moreover, using heuristics for feasibility 
restoration degrades solution quality and delays convergence. Thus, our proposed model ensures optimality from the 
infeasible schedule, eliminating unnecessary compromises in solution quality and convergence speed. We demonstrate 
this using the generalized agent-based approach by Abbaas and Ventura (2023), combining solutions into a likely 
infeasible schedule where Lagrangian relaxation is used to relax the capacity constraints.  Then we apply our proposed 
model to find the feasible schedule that maximizes the profit, addressing suboptimality of heuristics like job 
rejection/rescheduling. We discuss three commonly used heuristic feasibility restoration algorithms and compare their 
output with the proposed method. Our approach optimizes existing relaxation-based decentralized systems with wider 
applicability beyond scheduling.

1. Introduction
Scheduling problems are common in most industries, guiding the allocation of resources to optimize efficiency and 
meet various operational constraints. While their importance is unquestionable, the inherent complexity of these 
problems often necessitates the use of heuristic algorithms for practical implementation. Dispatch rules are simple 
heuristics often used in practice due to their simplicity and reasonable performance. They prioritize jobs based on 
certain attributes such as release date, due date, processing time, and setup time. (Panwalkar and Iskander 1977) and 
(Haupt 1989) provide lists of popular dispatch rules. More advanced heuristics and metaheuristics are used when the 
application requires a smaller optimality gap, and the added benefit outweighs the additional computational 
complexity. Relaxation techniques are often used to solve scheduling problems. These techniques relax a set of 
complicated constraints to simplify the original problem and potentially decompose it into a set of smaller and easier-
to-solve subproblems. The subproblems are solved using exact or heuristic methods and the solutions are combined 
to find an overall solution to the original problem. However, the combined solution can be infeasible to the original 
problem due to constraint relaxation, therefore, a feasibility restoration procedure is needed. This solution procedure 
is interesting because it resembles the distributed physical structure of modern organizations and their extended supply 
chains. Various units within the organization solve local problems and then share their required resources and resolve 
conflicts with other units that need the same resources at the same time. 
Scheduling tasks have been traditionally centralized where scheduling decisions are made by the central production 
control unit. Although this method allows the central unit to see across organizational boundaries and find globally

Abstract 
With the recent inflationary experience in the United States, and the rise in interest rates in the economy, the role of 
money demand, and the stability of money demand, have both come into sharp focus. This paper studies the factors 
that affect aggregate demand for money, using quarterly time series data for the United States.  We pay special 
attention to income, interest rate and inflation effects on money demand.  We also examine the impacts of government 
debt, demographic factors, and financial innovation on the money demand function.  For robustness purposes, the 
study utilizes different money measures, and also controls for the pandemic time period.  The modelling techniques 
address issues of unit roots and cointegration, and error-correction methods.  Our paper further derives long-term 
elasticity and semi-elasticity estimates.  We conclude with policy recommendations, and the implications for business

Abstract 
Industry 5.0 introduces a combination of technologies to improve sustainability, resiliency, and human-centered 
applications in the manufacturing environment. Similar to Industry 5.0, Healthcare 5.0 integrates emerging 
technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Big Data, Drones & Robotics, 
Digital Twin (DT), 6G, cloud/edge computing, and nanotechnology. These technologies offer significant benefits to 
society focusing on human wellbeing, wellness monitoring, personalized healthcare services, and sustainability. 
However, Healthcare 5.0 faces its own set of unique challenges. To respond to these challenges, Lean principles offer 
an excellent set of tools to increase the impact of Healthcare 5.0 technologies by improving efficiency and productivity 
while eliminating waste. Therefore, the objective of this study is to examine the role of Lean principles in maximizing 
the impact of Healthcare 5.0 technologies. Our analysis indicates that AI is the core technology utilizing Lean 
principles, with robotics and DT also playing key roles. In contrast, nanotechnology has the least connection with 
Lean principles among the Healthcare 5.0 technologies examined. Overall, this study offers one of the earliest efforts 
investigating the integration of Lean principles with Healthcare 5.0 technologies, shedding light on their potential to 
advance healthcare.

1. Introduction
The journey of industrial evolution began in the late 18th century with the invention of steam engines and mechanized 
production. This evolution progressed to Industry 2.0 with the introduction of assembly lines and mass production. 
Later, the introduction of computer systems and automation in Industry 3.0 accelerated efficiency and process speeds 
in every aspect of the industry. Industry 4.0, however, marked a paradigm shift, integrating cutting-edge technologies 
such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality (VR/AR), Internet of Things (IoT), 
Cloud Computing, Additive Manufacturing (AM), Autonomous Robots, Cybersecurity and Digital Twin (DT), setting 
a new benchmark for technological advancement. 
Building on the momentum of Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0 emerges as a fusion of sophisticated technologies and 
progressive organizational principles, emphasizing sustainability, resilience, and human-centric approaches in 
production systems. Mirroring this advancement, Healthcare 5.0 transforms patient care and smart healthcare systems, 
centering on human wellbeing and delivering advanced, personalized healthcare services. It aims at enhancing 
wellness monitoring, sustainability, affordability, and accessibility as seen in Fig 1. Despite its human-centric focus, 
Healthcare 5 faces distinct challenges that require a comprehensive and systematic approach to overcome.

5. Conclusions and Future Work 
In this work, we have investigated the potential impacts of Healthcare 5.0 technologies on Lean Thinking. Our study 
first identified the level of justification categories, including relevance to lean principle, technology capabilities, 
implementation impact, innovative approach, and cross-industry insights with Healthcare 5.0 technologies. Then, we 
evaluated each of the Healthcare 5.0 technologies with a series of Lean principles including VSM, Kaizen, SMED, 
5S, Heijunka, Jidohka, CI, JIT, Pull Flow, Waste Elimination, Kanban, Poka-Yoke, and Standardization. Our results 
show that AI will be the core Healthcare 5.0 technology for the integration of Lean principles in healthcare services. 
Robotics and DT technologies will be other integral parts of Lean implementations. IoMT, Blockchain, 6G, and 
Cloud/Edge Computing will serve as support systems for AI, Robotics, and DT in implementing Lean strategies. AM 
reduces the variability in production, which is an important factor for supporting Lean practices, this technology’s 
usage can be limited in the healthcare industry. Furthermore, nanotechnology offers an innovative platform for 
wearable devices, but the current state of the technology does not offer as much importance as other Healthcare 5.0 
technologies. 
 
In the future, we plan to implement a more sophisticated lean assessment including both quantitative and qualitative 
approaches to assess the feasibility of the integration of lean principles into Healthcare 5.0 technologies. Our research 
efforts will also include a survey-based approach where the healthcare experts will evaluate the level of applicability 
of each Healthcare 5.0 technology based on our sophisticated lean assessment tool. Additionally, quantum computing 
technology may be included in Healthcare 5.0 technologies in future research efforts. This study can also be extended 
to Industry 5.0 technologies targeting more manufacturing applications rather than the healthcare focus. In other 
words, we are going to add a quantitative evaluation perspective along with our qualitative approach to create a more 
comprehensive assessment tool to offer less bias and more efficient results.

1. Introduction
Digital twins have emerged as a transformative technology in the manufacturing industry, offering a virtual 
representation of physical machines, products, or processes. Digital twins in manufacturing are virtual replicas that 
simulate the entire production process, including machinery, equipment, raw materials, and product dynamics. They 
provide insights into how physical objects function in real-world scenarios (Singh, M et al., 2021). Manufacturers use 
digital twins to simulate different scenarios, test improvements, and optimize processes, leading to cost reduction, 
improved efficiency, and increased productivity (Psarommatis F. et al., 2023). By analyzing data from digital twins, 
manufacturers can make informed decisions about changes to physical objects or processes. For example, simulating 
different machining strategies using a digital twin of a machine tool helps identify the most efficient approach before 
implementing changes. Digital twins enable real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and adaptive control systems 
in CNC machining centers, enhancing overall efficiency and performance of machining operations. In smart 
manufacturing, digital twins provide predictive insights for anticipating maintenance issues, evaluating product 
upgrades, informing financial decisions, and ensuring consistency across large-scale production processes (Kukushkin 
K. et al., 2022). Digital twin technologies offer numerous advantages such as optimizing production processes,
improving product quality, reducing downtime, increasing efficiency, and supporting sustainability goals by reducing
energy and material consumption (Kamble, S et al., 2022). In conclusion, digital twins play a pivotal role in
revolutionizing the manufacturing industry by providing visibility into production processes, enabling predictive

Abstract 
Palletizing is an important job in logistic operations. It is considered an extremely labor-intensive process when 
performed manually, as it includes awkward and repetitive working postures, which result in serious back injuries. 
This paper introduces a new assistive device that helps reduce the exposure to physical loads among palletizing 
workers. The risk factors associated with manual palletizing in the food industry were analyzed using the Rapid Upper 
Limb Assessment (RULA) method. Different postures were observed during manual palletizing in a food factory that 
had a RULA score of 7. An assistive device was proposed to improve the palletizing operation. As a result, after 
implementing the proposed assistive device, the RULA final score was dropped to 4 based on lifting at the elbow 
height of the pallet, 3 when lifting at low and medium heights of the loaded pallet during wrapping, and 4 when lifting 
at the highest point of the full pallet. In conclusion, the proposed assistive device helped improve the palletizing job 
and reduce its negative consequences for workers.

1. Introduction
Palletizing is one of the major logistic processes that plays an important role in the transportation and storage of 
different types of products, as it simplifies handling and space utilization (Vargas-Osorio & Zúñiga, 2016). Pallets are 
the most fundamental unit of loading and transportation across the entire logistic activities around the world (Chen, et 
al., 2018). Manual palletizing is considered an extremely labor-intensive process, where stacking boxes on a pallet 
and wrapping each pallet are repetitive jobs and would cause serious injuries to the back and waist (Chen, et al., 2014). 
Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are defined as any injury in the head, arms, legs, back, or neck that affect muscles, 
tendons, joints, ligaments, cartilages, blood vessels, peripheral nerves, and bones (Yao, et al., 2019). The MSDs are 
one of the main occupational health threats in the industrial sector (Putz-Anderson, et al., 1997). They are the result 
of work-related tasks such as carrying, pulling, pushing, lifting, etc. Many of the workplace’s musculoskeletal injuries 
are the result of slip-related falls, large proportion of these falls occurred while load carrying (Yang, et al., 2022).

4. Conclusions 
The DHM and simulation using CATIA V5 software were considered in this study, to simulate the postures of a 
palletizing worker, who works at a food factory in Jordan. An assistive device was proposed to help provide more 
convenient and comfortable postures for workers, to reduce the physical workload during palletizing. The postures 
were then simulated. The RULA was applied to study the ergonomic risks. The proposed assistive device was designed 
and inserted into the CATIA V5 simulation to apply an ergonomic analysis, at the best and the worst case scenarios.  
The results obtained from this study were as follows: 
 
• 
Many awkward postures were observed in the factory and simulated while palletizing. The RULA showed 
that all of the observed postures had a final score of 7 (very high risk). This indicated that an additional 
investigation and changes are required, immediately.  
• 
A proposed design of an assistive device based on the idea of rotating a screw jack that moves vertically up 
and down, using either pedal or motor, based on the industry was designed to reduce the workload, 
considering the elbow height of the 95th percentile male. The design was integrated with a wrapping 
dispenser that moves up and down on a rod to avoid bending, twisting and many other awkward postures.  
• 
The RULA final score after using the proposed assistive device was reduced to 4 (low risk), based on the 
best-case scenario (lifting at the elbow height of the worker). However, in the worst-case scenario (lifting 
boxes to the highest point of a full-height pallet), the final score of an observed posture was 5 (medium risk), 
which was similar to that of the 95th percentile of the simulated manikin, while using the device, whereas 
the simulated RULA score of the manikin at the 50th percentile was 6 (medium risk), due to the differences 
in the anthropometric measurement.

Abstract 
In a Lean organization, problem-solving is a critical tool organizations use to sustain Lean Manufacturing initiatives. 
However, research shows that few studies have been conducted on the pedagogical approach and teaching evaluation 
utilized in training the problem-solving technique. The current research focuses on the 8-step problem-solving 
methodology. This study uses Revised Bloom’s taxonomy to teach and assess the effectiveness of learning the 8-step 
problem-solving technique. Assessing the effectiveness of the 8-step problem-solving teaching approach helps inform 
the program coaches of the difficulties and deficiencies in training, which improves program efficiency. This study 
employs a case-based action research method to examine the 8-step problem-solving technique for the TRUE LEAN 
participants at the University of Kentucky. Data from 2014-2019 for 1204 industry participants who attended the 
TRUE LEAN certification class was used to evaluate the model. These participants took the pre and post-tests and 
produced A3 reports for the laboratory problem-solving activity. The study results indicated that the Revised Bloom's 
Taxonomy could effectively be used in training the 8-step problem-solving technique since participants identified 
correct responses in the post-test compared with the pre-test. The study also highlighted the various pedagogical 
teaching methods employed to teach each step of the 8-step problem-solving technique.

1. Introduction
Successful implementation of Lean Manufacturing (LM) principles and practices depends on enabling and developing 
the skills of employees to identify and solve problems in their work environment. The problem-solving process helps 
employees identify and highlight possible causes of waste in their working environment. This technique increases 
operational performance (Marksberry et al., 2011), reduces defects, and improves productivity (Axelsdottir et al., 
2017). Various problem-solving approaches exist in the literature ranging from the NAX problem-solving approach 
(Axelsdottir et al., 2017), 10-step scientific method (Bassuk and Washington, 2013), Observe, Orient, Decide, Act 
(OODA) (Dunbar and Heilhecker, 2008), A3 thinking process (BURKA), 8-step problem solving (Marksber-ry et al., 
2011), and the defined 8D steps (George et al., 2021).

Abstract 
The digital twin concept is pivotal in Industrial 4.0, integrates physical and cyber spaces to address product design 
challenges. In the early design phase, digital twins offer valuable insights, while topology optimization, often 
integrated with digital twins, is prevalent during the optimization process. However, traditional topology optimization 
methods may fall short for soft robots due to their complex physical constraints and the high costs associated with 
physical simulations. Evolutionary algorithms, with their inherent adaptability, hold promise for autonomous 
optimization of soft robots based on available data. These algorithms are well-suited for generative design, potentially 
enabling data-driven generative approaches. This study introduces an intuitional evolutionary algorithm (iEA) to 
explore a generative optimization method for product design within the context of the digital twin. This paper presents 
a case study involving the design of soft robots for a speed competition in a simulated 3D environment, demonstrating 
the viability of combining the iEA with a data-driven generative design (dGD) model to develop a fast- walking soft 
robot. The results include learning curves and convergence diagrams, illustrating the efficacy of the design solution. 
The paper will also discuss information hierarchy, requirement analysis and functional modeling of the dGD model.

1. Introduction
Engineering design typically comprises four distinct phases including: task clarification, conceptual design, 
embodiment design and detail design (Paul et al., 1998). During the conceptual design phase, the product’s functions 
are defined and validated. The embodiment design phase involves technical and economic factors. Essential design 
information, such as conceptual design details, may not be readily available in the early design phase (Huang and 
Kuisak, 1998). The concept of digital twin, introduced to address challenges in smart manufacturing, comprises three 
integral components: the physical product, its virtual counterpart, and the interconnections between the two (Grieves, 
2003). By simulating the product in a cyber space, the design of its physical product can be more efficiently realized. 
Tao et al. (2018) proposes a framework for digital twin product design and demonstrated its utility in evaluating 
product quality. Consequently, digital twin offers a promising approach to generating and utilizing data in the early 
design phase. 
Topology optimization has been extensively explored in conjunction with digital twins to address design challenges. 
Unlike size and shape optimization, topology optimization primarily aims to determine the optimal structural layout 
within a specific design region (Bendsøe et al., 2004). The integration of a digital twin representing the structure in a 
cyber space facilitates the decision-making and analysis process for designers. Nonetheless, topology optimization 
has predominantly been applied to the optimization of solid material structures. There is a need for the development 
of innovation and generative methodologies to tackle the optimization of soft material structures, such as soft robots.

7. Conclusions 
In this paper, the dGD model, a new approach to production design for digital twins, is proposed and its feasibility is 
tested. The dGD model, embedded with the iEA algorithm for soft robot design, has been examined. Compared to 
traditional data-driven design, it provides more awareness information for designers as a reference for future evolution 
and offers more insight into data features for user monitoring, which represents the intuitional feature of the model. 
Furthermore, the selection and mutation processes are influenced by feature importance analysis and can 
autonomously detect the direction of evolution, making the entire process generative. The dGD model allows industrial 
knowledge to be intuitively applied as constraints in evolutionary algorithms. 
 
However, there are limitations. Human monitoring, being all about awareness information, can result in significant 
differences between individuals, even when performing the same function or building the same model. Industrial 
knowledge should be generalized and standardized to minimize these differences. Another issue not addressed in this 
paper is the physical design of the final optimized product, which will be extended to the area of material science 
research. Additionally, the environmental parameter settings in the cyber space are crucial to study, as they can 
dramatically affect the simulation process and potentially cause instability. Therefore, future work can be divided into 
two parts: extending the use of this model to other industrial applications and transforming the human decision-making 
aspect into a completely data-driven, intuitive learning process, for example, using Chat-GPT as a baseline for judging 
feature importance and making decisions, while placing more emphasis on the physical design after generating the 
optimized product in the cyber space.

Abstract 
During periods of sanctions and recession, access to financial transactions can be restricted, leading to reduced income 
for some banks. This study investigates the influence of bank capital on liquidity creation and income diversification 
in the Iranian banking sector, with the aim of providing insights into addressing economic challenges and identifying 
growth opportunities. To achieve this objective, the study employs two multiple regression models incorporating 
various financial variables, including the capital adequacy ratio. Utilizing multivariate regression analysis with 
EViews 10 software, descriptive and inferential statistical methods are applied to data spanning seven years from ten 
banks. The results indicate a significant positive correlation between increased bank capital and both liquidity creation 
and income diversification. In the first model, the adjusted coefficient of determination is 40%, suggesting that bank 
capital and control variables account for 40% of the variation in liquidity creation. In the second model, the adjusted 
coefficient of determination stands at 52%, indicating that bank capital and control variables account for 52% of the 
variability in income diversification. These findings underscore the crucial role of higher capital levels in enhancing 
liquidity management and diversification strategies, especially during economic adversities such as sanctions and 
recessions. Therefore, enhancing bank stability becomes critical by increasing bank capital through liquidity creation 
and income diversification. Despite limitations in sample size and timeframe, this research provides valuable insights 
for decision-makers aiming to enhance stability through effective bank policies, including adherence to capital 
adequacy requirements, robust risk management frameworks, and diversification strategies.

5.2 Validation  
To validate the proposed regression models, the study employs the Durbin-Watson statistic and the Wald test on the 
obtained results. The analysis indicates that while the liquidity model could benefit from the inclusion of 
macroeconomic factors to enhance its predictive accuracy, the income diversification model is adequately robust and 
does not require further refinement. This suggests that the income diversification model effectively captures the 
relationship between the variables under consideration without the need for additional adjustments.

6. Conclusion  
Considering the vital role banks play in financial markets and their substantial influence on a country’s economy, this 
study was undertaken to address the following query: What effect does bank capital have on liquidity creation and 
income diversification during a severe recession in a country? The research population encompasses all banks listed 
on the Tehran Stock Exchange between 2012 and 2018. After applying research restrictions, a subset of 10 banks was 
chosen for this research. After measuring the research variables, two multiple regression models were developed for 
analyzing liquidity and income diversification. These models were then tested on the collected data to evaluate the 
research hypotheses. In the results of the first hypothesis, it is observed that the variable of bank capital has a positive 
coefficient and a significance level of less than 5 percent. Therefore, the first hypothesis is accepted, indicating that 
bank capital has a direct and significant impact on liquidity creation. The adjusted coefficient of determination is 40 
percent, indicating that the independent and control variables in the model explain 40 percent of the dependent 
variable’s variations. To create a more comprehensive model for liquidity, it is recommended to incorporate 
macroeconomic variables alongside the existing variables of this model. This inclusion would provide a broader 
perspective and potentially enhance the predictive accuracy of the liquidity model. Furthermore, in the results of the 
second hypothesis, it is observed that the variable of bank capital has a positive coefficient and a significance level of 
less than 5 percent. Therefore, the second hypothesis is accepted, suggesting that bank capital has a direct and 
significant impact on income diversification. The adjusted coefficient of determination is 52 percent, indicating that 
325","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

the independent and control variables in the model explain 52 percent of the dependent variable’s variations. The 
Wald statistic is 13.46 with a significance level of less than 5 percent, indicating that the fitted model is sufficiently 
valid. Additionally, the Durbin-Watson statistic is 2.33, which falls between 1.5 and 2.5, indicating a desirable fit of 
the model. The results obtained indicate that the second model exhibits a greater capability to accurately capture 
variations in the dependent variable. Based on obtained results, increasing bank stability during recession periods can 
be achieved by implementing income diversification and liquidity creation strategies. As a managerial insight, 
increasing bank stability during a recession can be achieved by prioritizing income diversification and liquidity 
creation strategies. This involves actively exploring opportunities for product innovation, fee-based services, and 
cross-selling to diversify revenue streams. Simultaneously, optimizing asset-liability management, diversifying 
funding sources, and utilizing central bank facilities are critical for enhancing liquidity resilience. By integrating these 
strategies into bank policies and operations, managers can strengthen the institution's stability, mitigate the impact of 
economic downturns, and ensure continued viability during challenging periods. 
 
Despite limitations in sample size and timeframe, the research offers valuable insights for decision-makers aiming to 
enhance both theoretical and practical comprehension of financial institution management in turbulent economic 
conditions. However, the study acknowledges the necessity of considering macroeconomic factors, such as the 
inflation rate in countries like Iran, where international sanctions profoundly affect the banking sector, to develop a 
comprehensive model. Hence, it is recommended that future studies integrate macroeconomic variables like inflation 
with this model to increase the explanatory power of the liquidity model using a multiple regression equation.

Abstract 
Bubbles in lamination is a significant defect that has been extensively examined in various studies. Lamination 
involves applying High-Pressure Decorative Laminate (HPDL) to tabletops using Hot Met Adhesive (HMA). In this 
research, the tabletops are aluminum tabletops (AT), a unique subject due to the lack of data on the compatibility of 
HPDL with AT using HMA, particularly concerning the different rates of dimensional change for AT and HPDL 
and the required environment and curing time. To identify potential root causes, we applied the Lean Six Sigma 
(LSS) methodology and analyzed one year of process data using the Xbar-R chart in IBM SPSS. Our findings 
indicate that environmental conditions are a source of special variation, with the process going out of the specific 
control limits suggested by H.B. Fuller, the Hot Melt Adhesive supplier. Notably, the occurrence of bubbles 
increases during hot weather. We conducted a Design of Experiments (DoE) to validate or refute those potential root 
causes. This research aims to establish the specification limits for the environment and curing time for laminating 
HPDL to AT using HMA and provide a solution to the bubbling defect issue.

1. Introduction
Many organizations are committed to improving product quality and process performance in an attempt to achieve a 
set of bottom-line and strategic goals, including profitability, market share, and competitiveness, Ilesanmi Daniyan et 
al. (2022). Furniture manufacturing is a specific industrial sector with a high human labor demand, a wide range of 
materials processed, and short production runs caused by high customization of end products Skorupińska, E. et al. 
(2024a). This type of manufacturing is more labor-intensive than other manufacturing systems due to the complexity 
of furniture products, making it less automatable in the production process Turbański, W. et al. (2021). Several 
methodologies and tools of quality control are used in manufacturing Daniyan. et al., (2022a). and Six Sigma is one 
of the tools that is effectively used mainly for continual improvement. Six Sigma is about collecting data on a process

Abstract 
This research paper addresses the need for a data-driven framework that incorporates safety, reliability metrics, and 
technical competencies, alongside traditional performance indicators, to ensure comprehensive supplier validation and 
effectively address challenges and consumer complaints in supply chain management. The study explores how such a 
framework can enhance supply chain resilience, mitigate procurement risks, and optimize supplier management 
strategies to meet market demand. Focusing on the manufacturing supply chain industry, the research aims to identify 
key performance indicators, develop a standardized validation process, and evaluate their impact on supply chain 
performance metrics. Methodologies include systematic data collection, leveraging historical data from existing 
suppliers, industry benchmarking, stakeholder collaboration, and risk assessment models to identify reliable partners 
who consistently meet performance expectations. The proposed framework assesses supplier performance based on 
safety, pricing competitiveness, lead time reliability, on-time delivery, and technical skills within a unified supply 
chain framework. By formalizing standardized procedures and implementing a ""Supplier Verification Form"" and 
""Supplier Evaluation Scorecard,"" the research aims to strengthen supply chain resilience and optimize supplier 
management strategies. Expected outcomes include improved supplier selection, reduced procurement risks, enhanced 
cost management, streamlined operations, reinforced industry standards, and standardized practices, ultimately 
boosting organizational competitiveness in a changing market environment.

The research methodology aims to provide a structured and systematic approach to developing, implementing, and 
evaluating the Supplier Evaluation and Validation Framework, ultimately contributing to the enhancement of supply 
chain resilience within the manufacturing industry. This research has successfully achieved its primary objectives, 
resulting in a robust framework for supplier evaluation that addresses key dimensions such as safety, pricing 
competitiveness, lead time reliability, on-time delivery performance, and technical skills. The development of this 
comprehensive framework involved the careful integration of these critical factors to ensure a holistic and effective 
evaluation of suppliers. This timeframe for achieving the research goals encompasses the following stages: first 
involves reviewing existing literature on supplier evaluation and supply chain resilience, finalizing the specific 
evaluation criteria and weighting system for the Supplier Framework, and developing the data collection tools 
(surveys, forms)., second is Data Collection: This stage involves gathering data from existing suppliers through 
surveys and historical record analysis.  Data collection on potential new suppliers will also occur during this time. 
Audits of supplier facilities (if applicable) would be scheduled within this timeframe. Third, is Data Analysis and 
Framework Refinement where the collected data will be analyzed to identify trends, assess supplier performance 
consistency, and calculate supplier scores using the Supplier Evaluation Scorecard. The framework might be refined 
based on initial data analysis to ensure its effectiveness. Then, propose the solution based on the research findings, 
analyze the effectiveness of the Supplier Framework, and provide recommendations for its implementation within a 
manufacturing environment. 
 
In conclusion, the developed supplier evaluation framework serves as a practical and valuable tool for manufacturers. 
It enables them to select and manage suppliers more effectively, ensuring the long-term success and sustainability of 
their supply chains. By adopting this framework, manufacturers can achieve greater reliability and efficiency in their 
supply chain operations, ultimately contributing to their competitive advantage in the marketplace. Future research 
could focus on refining the framework further and exploring its applicability across different industries and geographic 
regions to broaden its utility and impact. Developing a robust and resilient supply chain is critical for long-term 
success. This research aims to contribute to that goal by providing manufacturers with a practical tool for evaluating 
and selecting reliable suppliers who can adapt to changing market conditions.  By fostering a more collaborative and 
transparent relationship between manufacturers and suppliers, this research has the potential to create a more efficient 
and sustainable supply chain ecosystem for the future. The study outcomes are expected to inform and reinforce 
industry standards, thereby boosting organizational competitiveness in rapidly changing market environments.

Abstract 
Retail stores that sell used products to secondary users have helped tremendously to improve environmental 
sustainability. The used products that are donated to these stores are cleaned and sold for reuse in another cycle, 
thereby preventing the products from going into landfills at the first post-consumer use phase. To enhance 
sustainability, multiple processes at the retail stores could be evaluated so that improvement strategies could be 
concentrated on the vital processes. This study shows that the Materiality Assessment could be applied to identify the 
processes that are most important to the stakeholders of the business. The results provide a guide to the management 
to direct its sustainability improvement efforts appropriately.

Abstract 
Advanced manufacturing is envisioned to be fulfilled by various cutting-edge technologies, making the production 
environment more complex and dynamic. To maintain production quality in manufacturing processes and increase 
system responsiveness towards faulty procedures, in-process inspection is an efficient strategy that manufacturers 
should consider adopting. This paper proposes a holistic framework for implementing in-process inspection in 
advanced manufacturing systems. It identifies four essential technical issues, including in-process inspection in 
advanced manufacturing, real-time process control through inspection feedback, human-technology interaction 
towards human-automation symbiosis, and responsive manufacturing system and operations management. These 
technical issues are analyzed from three levels of the manufacturing system hierarchy: the workstation level, the 
process level, and the system level. It further examines and elaborates on eight fundamental issues to address the four 
technical issues.

1. Introduction
Since the revolution of Industry 4.0, manufacturing industries have kept integrating innovative and cutting-edge 
technologies into different application scenarios of manufacturing systems to improve production performance. 
Radical changes take place not only in single workstations but also in operations at the system level, which are driven 
by multiple factors, such as increased data availability, real-time data analysis and decision-making, advances in 
robotics and automation, and so on (Arinez et al., 2020). In this context, the manufacturing environment becomes

be studied, which aims to make a recovery plan that can not only suit the changed environment brought by the 
disruption but also be close to the initial plan (Yang et al., 2015). 
 
5. Summary 
Automated visual inspection is envisioned as one of the cutting-edge technologies to facilitate advanced 
manufacturing. As one strategy of deploying inspection technologies, in-process inspection aims to conduct fast 
inspection right after the current operation finishes and before it enters the next stage, thus stopping defective parts 
from propagating and providing real-time feedback on product quality. To adopt this strategy, current manufacturing 
processes need to be reexamined and adjusted. In this regard, this paper proposes a holistic framework to implement 
in-process inspection in advanced manufacturing systems. Meanwhile, it identifies eight fundamental issues from 
three levels of the system hierarchy: integration of inspection into the manufacturing process, defect identification, 
and decision support for inspection systems, manufacturing-inspection-mitigation control loop with mitigation 
planning, task allocation considering team cognition, and manufacturing nudging for human-technology collaboration, 
fast and responsive manufacturing systems, and dynamic manufacturing operations management. These eight 
fundamental issues correspond to the four essential technical issues, including in-process inspection in advanced 
manufacturing, real-time process control through inspection feedback, human-technology interaction towards human-
automation symbiosis, and responsive manufacturing system and operations management. Therefore, the 
contributions of this paper lie in the identification and summary of the eight fundamental issues for achieving in-
process inspection in advanced manufacturing systems.

Abstract 
The brick production small and medium scale enterprises SMEs contribute significantly towards the socio and 
economic development of the Republic of South Africa (RSA). The brick production industry assists in the 
development of construction and is a source of income for SMEs, as well as creating employment opportunities for 
the uneducated, unskilled, and semi-skilled human capital. However, there are productivity improvement challenges 
that negate productivity growth. The methodology proposed for the study is based on reviewing literature whereby 
the main question is “How do productivity improvement systems influence productivity growth of the brick production 
SMEs?” The study explores productivity improvement systems that can be utilised to grow and sustain the productivity 
of brick production SMEs.

Abstract 
No one likes getting flat tires! Torque Tactician is introduced as an innovative automotive tool that will help expedite 
the time it takes to lift a vehicle and remove and reinstall the lug nuts. This product combines the universal lug nut 
remover that we all know and love with a ratchet designed to easily connect and lift the scissor jack. The objective of 
this product is to unify the tools required to change a tire while decreasing the number of motions which ultimately 
will decrease the amount of time needed to safely change a tire.

1. Introduction
The tire-changing process can be a time-consuming experience that is very labor-intensive. Traditional methods of 
tire changing involve multiple tools such as lug wrenches, lug sockets, and/or manual jacks. With the circulation of 
these tools, the process can extend longer than needed leading to time being wasted and even possible safety risks i.e. 
in the event of roadside emergencies. For an inexperienced user, improper use of the equipment involved in tire 
changing can lead to injuries or damage to vehicles. The TorqueTactician is a groundbreaking multi-tool aimed to 
redefine the tire-changing process with its seamless and efficient design. This innovative tool offers a solution for a 
quick and effortless tire replacement. Engineered using state-of-the-art technology and precise engineering methods, 
the Tech Tactician simplifies the process of changing tires, minimizing the challenges associated with traditional 
methods. When faced with roadside emergencies or routine tire maintenance, users can rely on the Tech Tactician to 
simplify the task of changing a tire with a guarantee of simplicity and safety. With the Tech Tactician available, tire 
changing becomes a hassle-free experience. Ensuring minimal downtime and maximum convenience for every user. 
Throughout the duration of this senior project, the team has been committed to identifying and addressing the issues 
involved with traditional tire changing, with an aim of providing a fully functional multi-tool (Les Schwab, 2024).  
1.1 Objectives 
The purpose of the project is to create a piece of equipment that will assist people and keep their minds at ease when 
traveling anywhere by car. The goal is to create a safe product that may be used by virtually anyone at an affordable 
price. The final product will be small and easy to store, fitting into any car trunk, and being lightweight. Aiming for a 
weight of less than 5 pounds and a size of 12 inches when put away. While compact, the product will be small enough 
to go anywhere and will not be a hindrance while traveling long distances. 
When the product Torque Tactician is opened and ready to use, the dimensions shift to 3 ft. The tool will have a simple 
setup guide that will take just 45 seconds to read on average, ensuring an easy setup with enough time to alert for aid

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
After a series of testing and recording the time it took two groups of users with different levels of experience, the 
Torque Tactician team was informed that implementing some sort of texturing or rubber grip to the replica would 
make the user more comfortable when using the product (Amazon 2024). A key component of the Torque Tactician 
that could be reconsidered in terms of design is the ratchet. It currently has a ratchet head where the angle can be 
adjusted to the user's preference. Instead of having this feature, a slight curvature can be implemented where the 
ratchet head can still be used from a convenient position without sacrificing the ergonomics and efficiency of the 
product. 
 
5.3 Theoretical Calculation 
5.3.1  Force Calculation 
Simple physics equations were used to calculate the necessary force required to tighten lug nuts on a wheel. The 
average maximum torque needed to tighten most lug nuts is 90 ft-lbs (Powertools, n.d.). The length of the tool is 
1.43 feet (17.25 inches) when measured from the point of contact with the lug nut to the point where force is applied 
by the user. The maximum force needed to be applied by the user to tighten most lug nuts is about 63 pounds. This 
can ensure that lug nuts are torqued to at least 90 ft-lbs.

6. Conclusion 
Torque Tactician symbolizes a pioneering approach to modernization, paving the way for a future defined by 
innovation. Our team is determined to exceed expectations by any means necessary and is committed to overcoming 
any challenges. Therefore, we remain focused on delivering a fully functional prototype showcasing a reduction of 
labor and time.

Abstract 
With the development of advanced manufacturing technologies, the manufacturing environment becomes complex, 
dynamic, and filled with human-machine collaboration. To improve manufacturing performance, the efficiency of 
collaboration is critical. Nudging, a concept in behavioral economics, is employed to indirectly encourage individuals 
to act or believe in a certain way through subtle interventions. In the manufacturing context, nudging aims to alter or 
influence operators’ behaviors to better work with technology during their interactions. Meanwhile, the research of 
manufacturing nudging design is to investigate the theoretical foundation of design for human behaviors. To solve 
this problem, this paper conducts system analysis for smart manufacturing nudging design and identifies four 
fundamental questions, including manufacturing nudge generation, nudging behavior modeling considering affective 
cognition, model parameter estimation, and nudging personalization optimization. The paper further proposes a 
conjoint prospect theory-based approach to nudging behavior modeling. Affective cognition modeling is also 
discussed for parameter shaping of the nudging behavior model. An example case of nudging for assembly inspection 
is presented to illustrate the proposed approach.

1. Introduction
The development of advanced manufacturing technologies has greatly improved manufacturing system performance 
and changed the relationship between humans and automation agents. The manufacturing environment also becomes 
more complex and dynamic, requiring close collaboration between humans and machines. To facilitate the efficiency 
of such collaboration, the industry calls for the consideration of human factors in manufacturing operations with the 
concept of human-cyber-physical systems (Zhou et al., 2019). Nudging, as one approach to human-computer

Abstract 
The objective of this research is to evaluate the impact that the implementation of the ISO 14001:2015 standard has 
had on the reduction of the carbon footprint at the Instituto Tecnológico Superior de Álamo Temapache (ITSAT) 
during the period 2018-2022. The Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology was used to quantify direct and indirect 
emissions of scopes 1 and 2 before and after ISO 1400:2015 certification in 2018. The results show a 36.4% decrease 
in the footprint. Of total carbon, they are going from 108,868 tons of CO2 equivalent in 2018 to 69,157 tons in 2022. 
Although the year-on-year comparison was affected by the atypical drop-in activities in 2020-2021 due to the COVID-
19 pandemic, the data reveal a better environmental performance in 2022 than in 2018, before certification. It is 
concluded that adopting the Environmental Management System based on ISO 14001:2015 has positively impacted 
the mitigation of Greenhouse Gas emissions in this institution. Some limitations were the lack of data to estimate

4. Analyze economic and social co-benefits: Estimate the potential economic savings derived from carbon 
footprint reduction initiatives and evaluate social co-benefits such as improved quality of life, environmental 
awareness, green jobs, and community engagement. 
5. Develop practical tools: Develop standardized methods, guides, software, and technical tools that make it 
easier for educational institutions to periodically calculate their GHG emissions, identify mitigation 
opportunities, and implement effective decarbonization actions. 
6. Propose policies and incentive schemes: Formulate recommendations on regulatory frameworks, public 
policies and economic incentives that promote an accelerated transition of the education sector towards 
carbon neutrality. 
 
The possible lines of future research are broad, and all of them allow capitalizing on the findings of this research to 
catalyze and multiply efforts towards environmental sustainability in the national and international educational sphere.

Abstract 
The Optimum Service Excellence Model (OSEM) provides a holistic methodology for organizational assessment, 
emphasizing a harmonious blend of financial performance, customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and continual 
learning. This integrative model facilitates strategic alignment of goals, propelling ongoing enhancements in service 
delivery while ensuring the organization's operations are financially sustainable and advantageous for its clientele. 
OSEM, by prioritizing fundamental principles, positions organizations for enduring success. This paper advocates a 
pioneering performance evaluation approach by combining the 4Cs+1E framework with the established Balanced 
Scorecard (BSC) methodology. The 4Cs+1E framework, encompassing Challenge, Consult, Compare, Compete, and 
Equality, seamlessly complements the BSC's perspectives of financial, customer, internal processes, and learning and 
growth. Integrating these frameworks presents a more thorough and strategic performance management strategy, 
particularly beneficial for the manufacturing and service industries.

1. Introduction
 Considering evolving contextual factors in firms and the escalating demand for enhanced performance, there arises a 
necessity for the evaluation of organizational performance. This paper explores the shift toward data-driven quality 
management, enabling real-time acquisition and analysis of quality data to enhance organizational efficiency and 
performance. Utilizing the balanced scorecard as a framework, the current study proposes the Optimum Service 
Excellence Model (OSEM = BSC + 4Cs+1E) in order words (4Cs+1E) strategy to address both overall performance 
and external pressures from clients and potential funding sources of firms.  
Various studies have explored the enhancement of organizational evaluation through various models. Al-Dhaafri 
(2023) and Dover-Harris (2017) both emphasize the importance of service design and information analysis in 
achieving organizational excellence and performance. Chen (2022) and Saeed (2021) focus on the evaluation of 
service quality and operational excellence, with Chen proposing an improved SERVQUAL model for airline service 
quality evaluation and Saeed developing a multi-item Operational Excellence scale. Wirtz (2018) and Li (2021) offer 
strategies for achieving cost-effective service excellence and a novel service efficiency evaluation and management 
model. Lastly, Ershadi (2019) and Sadeghee (2019) apply the SERVQUAL model to evaluate and improve service 
quality in the IT department of a detergent production company. These studies collectively highlight the significance

Abstract 
This study presents a heuristic approach designed to address the challenges encountered by non-profit hunger relief 
organizations in managing diverse donations, both monetary and in-kind. Focused on optimizing food procurement, 
the model strategically allocates limited donor funds, considering constraints such as donor restrictions, product 
perishability, and warehouse capacity. In contrast to the computationally intensive nature of mathematical 
optimization, the proposed heuristic prioritizes practical efficiency, acknowledging the complexities of real-world 
scenarios. Implemented through a multi-period, multi-product deterministic optimization model, the heuristic, known 
as Greedy Allocation, contributes to informed decision-making for non-profit organizations, enhancing the efficiency 
and impact of food distribution. A comparative analysis demonstrates the heuristic's efficacy in achieving near-optimal 
nutritional value allocation, offering valuable insights for practical implementation in dynamic scenarios. Ultimately, 
this research contributes to the vital cause of hunger relief by providing a strategic tool for fund allocation in non-
profit organizations.

Abstract 
Considering the necessity of electric school buses in replacement of conventional diesel school buses, this paper 
proposes an optimization model based on mixed integer programming to allocate electric school buses to existing and 
pre-determined routes where the travel paths and location sequences for each electric school bus are also be determined 
by this model. This model considers heterogeneous electric school buses and mixed loading of the students in the 
buses. Key factors including seating capacity, battery capacity, charge consumption cost, and bus price are considered 
in determining the best allocation of buses to different routes, to minimize overall costs. We present an illustrative 
example to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of this approach.

1. Introduction
The present transportation industry is mostly controlled by vehicles that run on internal combustion engines. Most of 
the internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) burn fossil fuels to run the vehicles, where ICEVs have a significant 
negative impact on the environment, especially concerning air pollution. The emissions from IC engines, including 
carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, contribute to the formation of smog and respiratory 
problems in humans. Another harmful effect is the release of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), 
which contributes to climate change and global warming. ICEVs are among the largest contributors to CO2 emissions, 
exacerbating the greenhouse effect and causing unpredictable weather patterns and rising sea levels. According to the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Report on Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and 
Sinks 1990-2022, Transportation activities were responsible for 38.1% of US CO2 emissions and 28.9% of total 
greenhouse gas emissions in 2022 from fossil fuel combustion. 
Moreover, the extraction, refining, and transportation of fossil fuels for ICEVs contribute to habitat destruction, water 
pollution, and ecosystem degradation. Additionally, the disposal of used motor oil and other automotive fluids poses 
risks to soil and water quality. Overall, the widespread use of ICEV has a profound and multifaceted negative impact 
on the environment, highlighting the urgent need for transitioning to cleaner and more sustainable transportation 
alternatives. 
Electric vehicles (EVs) can be a feasible and suitable alternative to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles 
(ICEVs). EVs are seen as a solution to greening our transportation needs, especially when electricity is generated from 
renewable sources such as wind, hydro, or geothermal power. Regardless of the electricity production process, EVs 
prevent tailpipe emissions, thereby improving the local air quality compared to ICEVs that burn fossil fuels. 
Additionally, converting the wasted heat generated during braking into electricity using regenerative braking 
technology is yet another feature that makes EVs a smart choice (Hulagu and Celikoglu, 2022). 
Electric vehicles (EVs) have a long and interesting history in the United States. In fact, the country's EV history can 
be traced back to the late 19th century when electric cars were among the first automobiles. However, due to primitive

Location l1 is bus terminal, l2 to l8 indicates bus stops and l9 and l10 are schools.  The bus/ buses selected for any route 
will cover all the locations in that route alone/combined and in which pathway they will travel these locations will be 
determined by this optimization model. In addition, the total number of students to pick from each location in each 
route is given in Table 5. In this example, we have also considered the cost of charge consumption c = 1.2 USD/ KWh 
and the battery capacity of a bus required to travel per mile, CR= .4 kwh.

These inputs have been used to optimize the model, which has been solved using GAMS software with CPLEX solver. 
The results of the model are displayed in Table 6. The solution reveals that a total of 6 buses have been assigned to 5 
routes. Let's take Route 1 as an example: Bus No. 8 is assigned to this route, beginning at Terminal l1, picking up 
students at locations l2, L4, and l6. The bus will then drop off the students at School l10 and School l9, respectively. 
After dropping off students, the bus will return to Terminal l1. The results in the table only display the one-way 
direction because the bus will follow the same path in the opposite direction when returning. This means that the bus 
will travel from Terminal l1 to School l9 and then to School l10, pick up the students, and drop them off at their 
respective bus stops at l6, l4, and l2 before returning to Terminal l1. Therefore, since the distance traveled in both 
directions is the same, we multiplied the total distance by 2 in the objective function. In addition, the main goal of this 
optimization model is to minimize the total cost and the minimum cost for this example is USD 1265255.360.

6. Conclusion 
This paper described the formulation of an optimization model for the allocation of electric school buses to pre-
determined routes as well as for determining the travel path and sequence of bus stops and schools in each path at 
minimum cost. These two factors, bus allocation, and travel path determination, are very crucial if school authorities 
plan to replace the current diesel school buses with ESBs and operate ESBs on the same existing and pre-determined 
routes considering students' health benefits and the government’s initiatives.

In this paper, we demonstrated the proposed optimization model using a few routes and buses hence heuristic and 
metaheuristic methods may also be considered for larger applications. For future research, we may consider allocating 
buses in more than one route then scheduling of the buses will be necessary where school bell times will come into 
play. Furthermore, intermediate charging options and charging schedules may also be determined by taking into 
account existing charging infrastructures or proposing new charging infrastructures as well.

Abstract 
Waste landfill and incineration as well as liquid fossil fuels in transport sector are major sources of greenhouse gases 
emission. Waste-to-hydrogen production via biogas steam reforming can simultaneously achieve the goals of waste 
management and hydrogen for green transportation. In this study, the techno-economic and environmental 
assessments of food-waste-to-hydrogen refueling station in three selected cities in Gauteng province of South Africa 
were performed. The aim was to determine the hydrogen production capacity for the refueling station, determine their 
economic viability and ecological efficiency. The refueling stations’ capacity was determined based on assumption 
that a 5 kg fuel cell vehicle is refueled per day. The results indicate that the City of Tshwane and City of Johannesburg 
have a refueling station capacity of over 395 and 356 thousand kg/day H2, respectively. The economic analysis shows 
investment in hydrogen refueling station in these cities is viable with positive net present value ranging from 4.9033 
to 8.0563 Billon USD, levelized cost of hydrogen between 3.99 USD/kg to 4.34 USD/kg, payback period of 9.03 to 
13.74 years and internal rate of return from 18.16 % to 39.88 %. An ecological efficiency of 95.84 % was obtained 
indicating an environmentally friendly system.

1. Introduction
Fossil fuels such as coal, crude oil and natural gas are known to be environmentally unfriendly due to emission of 
harmful gases into the atmosphere when combusted for energy generation or as transportation fuels. Apart from the 
electricity sector, transport sector happens to be the second largest user of fossil fuels with road transportation 
accounting for about half of the liquid fossil fuels (such as gasoline or diesel). To minimise the menace of global 
carbon emissions and achieve a net-zero emission, decarbonisation of transport sectors is a way to go. Therefore, the 
use of safe, sustainable and environmentally friendly fuels in transport sector could proffer the needed solution in this 
regard. Hydrogen gas is acclaimed to be an environmentally benign energy carrier when used for energy generation 
(heat and power) or as a transport fuel due to zero emissions of hazardous pollutants during its operational life cycle 
(Siddiqui and Dincer 2019). However, sources of hydrogen production are very key to ascertain its environmental 
sustainability. Hydrogen can be produced from fossil fuels (coal and natural gas) as well as renewable energy sources 
(wind, solar, geothermal, biomass etc.). Coal gasification (CG) and natural gas steam methane reforming (SMR) are 
two commercially available thermochemical technologies for hydrogen production. CG accounts for 19 % of global 
hydrogen production while 62 % is contributed by SMR process (Halder et al. 2024) and the rest is produced via other 
methods. Although, CG and SMR processes are mature and are largely responsible for global hydrogen production, 
their sustainability and environmental benignity are limited due to emission of GHGs during production. Green 
hydrogen can be produced using renewable energy sources. The most common methods of green hydrogen production 
are water electrolysis (El-Shafie 2023), biomass gasification (Kazmi et al. 2023) and biogas steam reforming (Vidal-
Barrero et al. 2022). Solar/wind powered water electrolysis is pollution free but economically expensive

municipalities. The ecological efficiency of 95.84 % indicates an environmentally friendly system. The specific 
location for physical construction of the refuelling station in the cities was not captured in the current study. Therefore, 
as a future research exercise, the optimal location of the refuelling stations in the cities using geographic information 
system (GIS) coupled with multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method would be explored. Further environmental 
analysis would be conducted using life cycle assessment (LCA) and social cost analysis for the waste-to-hydrogen 
refuelling stations in South African cities. Also, further work incorporating sensitivity analysis considering some 
variable and assumed data on the technical and economic potentials will be conducted. Similar assessments will be 
extended to cities in other South African provinces in our future work.

Abstract 
Different hospitals use different definitions for hospitalists’ workloads, some define it as the number of encounters 
per shift, and others define it as the daily census or relative value units (RVUs) generated. This research paper 
investigates the impact of different assignment policies on the variation of hospitalists’ workloads and ED boarding 
time when patient acuity is considered. This paper also proposes a new policy that minimizes variation in hospitalists’ 
workloads, with consideration of the trade-offs between hospitalists’ workloads and ED boarding time. Assigning 
patients to hospitalists based only on the number of patients results in a workload variation (𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊) that is equivalent 
to about 5.5 patients. Assigning patients to hospitalists based on patient acuity helps to reduce the variation in acuity 
workload among the hospitalists. Since policy 2 allows anywhere patient assignment, the 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 in policy 2 is lower 
than the 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 in policy 3 as result of having flexibility in the number of patients that can be assigned to each hospitalist. 
Policy 2 has the best hospitalist workload balance among all three policies with 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 of 7.03, 7.04, and 6.98 for bed 
capacities of 95%, 97.5%, and 100%, respectively.

1. Introduction
A hospitalist is a physician whose primary task is to provide medical care to hospitalized patients. The number of 
hospitalists has continuously increased since 2003 (Wachter and Goldman 2016), as result of the more efficient 
medical care that hospitalists can provide in comparison to the more traditional way of caring for hospitalized patients, 
where a primary care physician rounds on his/her admitted patients (Elliott et al. 2014). However, hospitalists struggle 
with measuring and managing their workloads (Colwell 2019). One reason that this is important is that hospitalists 
are an expensive resource in the inpatient setting and the cost of a hospitalist is continuously increasing, from about 
$216,000 in 2008 to more than $290,000 in 2018 (Today’s Hospitalist 2018). 
The high cost of hospitalists and the high demand for the hospitalist specialty (Merritt Hawkins 2019), encourage 
hospitals to improve their hospitalists’ workloads. Also, hospitals need to focus on improving physician satisfaction 
to reduce physician turnover (Zhang and Feng 2011). Hospitals struggle to find a good measurement of hospitalists’ 
workloads (Nelson 2019). Different hospitals use different definitions for hospitalists’ workloads, some define it as 
the number of encounters per shift (Michtalik et al. 2013), and others define it as the daily census or relative value 
units (RVUs) generated (Nelson 2019) and (Elliott et al. 2014). In order for a hospital to better manage and balance 
its hospitalists’ workloads, a definition of workload that comprehensively captures all or most hospitalist activities 
needs to be considered.

It’s important to mention some of the limitations that this research has. First, the models developed in this research do 
not explicitly capture the impact on hospitalist productivity resulting from caring for patients in different unit which 
requires working with different unit teams and going back and forth between the units. Second, the models assume all 
the units are the same size. Having different sized units may result in a need for hospitalist to have patients in multiple 
units in order to balance workloads effectively.  
 
7. Conclusion  
Most hospitals are currently assigning patients to hospitalists based on the number of patients each hospitalist has. 
This policy of assignment does not take into consideration the variation in the patients’ health conditions. Patients 
with unstable health conditions and more complicated cases require more time and effort from hospitalists in order to 
care for these patients. Thus, hospitalists may have the same number of patients, but one hospitalist may have more 
difficult and unstable patients than the other hospitalist and subsequently a much greater workload.  
 
Using patient acuity in the patient assignment process helps hospitals to balance hospitalist workloads either for 
anywhere patient allocation (policy 2) or unit-based allocation (policy 3). However, policy 2 results in better hospitalist 
workload balance than policy 3. Although, policy 3 has the advantage of having all of a hospitalist’s patients assigned 
to only one unit. The decision to utilize policy 2 or policy 3 depends on how much hospital management is willing to 
accept having greater WLV in exchange for having a hospitalist’s patients dispersed over multiple inpatient units. 
 
Look ahead approaches help to improve hospitalist workload balancing. If a hospital is able to determine the acuity 
rate of admitted patients over a certain period of time before they are actually ready for bed assignment, then the 
hospital can make the assignment of those patients in advance without having them waiting in the ED in order to 
achieve better hospitalist workload balance. This results in better workload balance for both policy 2 and policy 3 
rather than just considering the acuity rate of just the one patient that is ready for bed assignment. Note that the benefit 
of using a look head rule is greater for policy 3 and helps bring the workload balance using policy 3 much closer to 
that found using policy 2.  
 
In case the hospital is not capable of accurately estimating patients’ acuity before they are ready for bed assignment, 
then the hospital may need to hold patients in the ED to gather their acuity information in order to have better 
hospitalist workload balance. However, this results in an increase in ED boarding time and this ED boarding time 
increases as the look ahead time increases. In both cases, look ahead with and without waiting in the ED, hospitalist 
workload balance improves as the look ahead time increases. However, 85% of the reduction in WLV that occurs due 
to look ahead occurs for a 0.5 hour look ahead time. Thus, a hospital may only want to consider using a 0.5 hour look 
ahead rule in order to avoid increasing ED boarding time and expending the effort needed to predict patient acuity

over a longer time interval. Since look ahead approaches help to reduce the difference between WLV for policy 2 and 
policy 3, and most of the look ahead benefits occurs at 0.5 hours, then a good recommendation for hospitals is to 
assign patients to hospitalists using policy 3 with a 0.5 hour look ahead which helps to reduce WLV and attains the 
advantages of unit-based assignment.

Introduction
The Integrative Human-Techno Framework Methodology, IHTFM is a cutting-edge approach that combines 
technological advancements and human intuition to develop the Quality 5.0 Management Framework. The paper 
explores the design principles of the IHTFM and demonstrates how the Techno-Human-Centric Quality 5.0 
Framework can serve as a model for organizations operating in Industry 5.0's digitalized manufacturing environment. 
Quality management has significantly advanced over the past century, shifting from basic inspections in Quality 1.0 
to sophisticated, data-driven methods in Quality 5.0. Quality 1.0 and 2.0 focused on meeting manufacturing standards 
through inspection requirements, while Quality 3.0 and 4.0 introduced statistical quality control and digital tools to 
enhance efficiency and predictability. However, Quality 5.0 integrates cutting-edge technologies like AI, IoT, and big 
data, prioritizing human-centric factors to optimize the balance between human ingenuity and technological precision 
(Nguyen et al., 2023). 
1.1 Objectives 
Industry 5.0 is characterized by automation and intelligent systems, it is crucial to merge human aspects with advanced 
technologies (Lachvajderova et al., 2023). This integration is vital for leveraging technological advancements while 
ensuring that they align with sustainable, ethical, and human-centered values and requirements (Aleksandrova et al.,

Abstract 
Subtractive manufacturing, especially traditional material removal processes, is considered one of the heavily power 
consumption operations. Integrating sustainability principles into the process engineering and technology in response 
to environmental challenges is highly demanded and the key to improve the manufacturing for energy consumption 
optimization. A wide array of research directions to address manufacturing sustainability; from environmentally 
friendly designs the operational conditions to optimizing the outcomes. This research emphasizes the need to integrate 
sustainability in manufacturing technology aspects. The approach of this research work focuses on experimentally test 
the impact of main operational conditions on power consumption in turning manufacturing processes. Four critical 
operational factors—rotational speed, feed rate, tool angle, and lubrication—are examined for their influence on 
process power consumption. The work used a lathe machine and a wireless three-phase clamp meter placed into the 
machine’s motor to measure the voltage output along with tools and steel workpiece samples. Full factorial design of 
experimentation is applied to test and analyze the relationships between the factors and response function of power 
consumption. The results reveal significant effects for the main factors and the interactions as follows: rotational 
speed, and feed rate, lubrication, and rake tool angle. Increasing the rotational speed and applying oil to lubricate the 
cut zone during the process decrease operational power consumption supporting the hypothesis for the lubrication. 
Surprisingly, increasing the rotational speed decreases operational power consumption and increasing the rake tool 
angle increases the operational power consumption - not as expected. Interaction effects emphasize the additive and 
subtractive influences of the factors on operational power consumption. While the full factorial design of 
experimentation application allows for comprehensive factor effects analysis, it acknowledges limitations in the 
specific selected levels for machine rotational speed, tool feed rate, and the tool cutting angles. This research provides 
valuable insights into the impact of various operational conditions on electrical power consumption in material

The research project contributes to the existing literature by emphasizing the importance of exploring factor 
interactions in empirical research projects. It uniquely navigates the intersection of sustainability and manufacturing

empirical methodologies into an experimental research project. This research work contributes to provide the next 
generation of engineers with essential analytical and experimental skills and knowledge of the 21st century

5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the results of full factorial DOE experimental research provide valuable insights into the impact of 
various operational conditions of a material subtractive manufacturing processes on the OPC as a response variable 
of the empirical analysis. It is presented experimental exploration focusing on four critical factors – rotational speed 
(X1), feed rate (X2), lubrication (X3), and rake tool angle (X4) – to empirically investigate their impact on OPC during 
the turning manufacturing process. The identified main and interaction effects contribute to the growing body of 
knowledge in sustainability manufacturing and technology and, pave the way for further investigations into optimal 
experimental conditions in analysis strategies. As the results of examining the lubrication; from (NO) to (YES), and 
rake tool angle; from (0o) to (30o), showed almost equal opposite influence on the OPC, both can be recommended to 
work together in designing the work plan of turning manufacturing operation. This is very helpful finding for quality 
cutting surfaces If product quality is required in the resulting surfaces of the subtractive manufacturing process, which 
requires soft cutting forces 𝐹𝐹𝑥𝑥°, applying cutting oil will help to cancel any increase in the power consumption to 
finish the cut. In other words, the same OPC level can be applied for smoother cutting surface by changing the cutting 
line angle and lubrication. 
 
This research work emphasizes the need to incorporate sustainability principles in engineering and technology, 
particularly in the field of manufacturing systems and processes. Manufacturing engineering and technology have a 
role in driving transformative changes toward sustainable future. It emphasizes the importance of researchers in 
steering this transformation and molding aspiring manufacturing engineering and technology researchers with a 
sustainability mindset. It experimental approaches used equip the next generation of researchers with a robust 
understanding of sustainability practices, methodologies, and ethical considerations. Acknowledging the limitations 
of specific levels of selected factors, this paper suggests future research to explore additional levels and factors for a 
more refined understanding. Further recommendations include investigating mechanisms underlying observed effects 
and exploring optimal combinations of factors for power consumption and environmental contaminations.

Abstract 
The Increase Reliability: Improve OTC Boilers Cycle Capstone Project is designed to enhance operational efficiency 
in Haleon’s Utilities Department by mitigating major deviations, particularly within the Utilities Area. The initiative 
primarily addresses challenges in the boiler room, which is responsible for 69% of the deviations. The existing boiler 
cycle falls below the required level, affecting chemical consumption, maintenance costs, and environmental 
sustainability. The project's aim is to identify factors impacting boiler house reliability and introduce improvements 
to optimize performance, boost boiler efficiency, reduce unplanned shutdowns, and ensure stable OTC production. 
Using industrial engineering knowledge, the project employs statistical tools, data analysis, and continuous 
improvement methodologies such as Six Sigma and the DMAIC approach. The Root Cause Analysis identified eleven 
(11) potential causes, grouped into four (4) categories:  Water Treatment, Boiler Cycle, Materials Availability, and
Manpower. Three (3) implementation alternatives were identified for each category. The total cost of these alternatives 
is projected at $98,530.96, with anticipated annual savings of $74,404.96 and a cost avoidance per investigation of
$6,490.00. With the alternatives implemented, the cycles increased from 3 to 15 by 214%. Now (YTD), no
investigations related to the Utilities area have been reported, achieving 100% of the established objectives for the
reduction of deviations.

1. Introduction
The Increase Reliability: Increase OTC Boilers Cycle Capstone Project is born with a vision that addresses multiple 
challenges. The main objective is to reduce the Utilities Department's deviations and thus establish a solid foundation 
for improving operational efficiency. In addition, a comprehensive investigation was conducted to identify those 
factors that affect the reliability of the Boiler House. By better understanding these factors, relevant improvements 
can be implemented to optimize performance and ensure efficient operation of the boilers. Increasing the reliability of 
the boilers not only preserves the consistency of OTC production but also improves the reliability of the systems, 
making operations more stable. Ultimately, this project not only seeks to increase boiler efficiency but also proactively 
addresses deviations in Haleon's Engineering Department and ensures OTC's production stability by minimizing 
unplanned boilers shutdowns. By applying innovative solutions and advanced technologies, we aim to optimize 
existing processes, reduce operating costs, and improve environmental sustainability. This project will boost our 
plant's competitiveness and help shape a more efficient and sustainable future in utility management. 
1.1 Objectives  
To address the challenges for this project the following objectives have been established. To reduce the incidences of 
investigations that have been attributed to the utilities area (specifically to the Boiler House), the following outcome

The IMR showed an increase of 214% (3 to 15 cycles average). Samples are still being taken to have a representative 
quantity to make a reliable conclusion (Refer to Figure 15).  
 
Since the P-value < 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected, and the alternative hypothesis accepted. That means there is 
a difference between the cycle means (Refer to Figure 16).

6. Conclusion 
In wrapping up, the Increase Reliability: Improve OTC Boilers Cycle Capstone Project is more than just a project; it 
is a vision for a better, more efficient future. We are not just looking at numbers and statistics; we are addressing real-
world challenges that affect our team in the Utilities Department. We have rolled up our sleeves and dug deep into the 
heart of our Boiler House, identifying the factors that can make or break our operations. With this knowledge, we are 
not just fixing problems, we are making improvements that will optimize our performance and make our boilers work 
better and smarter. This isn’t just about keeping the production line running smoothly, it is about creating a more 
reliable, stable environment for everyone involved. We are not just reacting to issues as they arise, but proactively 
tackling them head-on, ensuring that our Engineering Department can work without constant interruptions and that 
our OTC production remains steady. By embracing innovation and advanced technologies, we are not just cutting 
costs, but also doing our part for the environment by reducing the CO2 emissions. This project is not merely about 
boosting our plant's competitiveness, it is about shaping a future where utility management is efficient, sustainable, 
and above all, human-centered, fulfilling our company's slogan: ""For Health. With Humanity."" (Who We Are, n.d.)

Machining Variables Optimization for Sustainability 
Manufacturing 
Abstract 
With EPA saying 30% of greenhouse gas emissions come from typical industry, manufacturing is considered one of 
the contributors to climate change. The increasing demand to integrate sustainability principles into engineering and 
technology research is a response to environmental challenges and future jobs skillset. This research emphasizes the 
central role of engineers in shaping the future of industries, highlighting the need to integrate sustainability into 
research and business, particularly in manufacturing engineering and technology. From environmentally friendly 
designs to optimizing production processes and leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies, sustainability principles 
integration is seen as key to reshaping the future of manufacturing. The approach of this work focuses on a research-
based approach to experimentally test the impact of main operational conditions on Carbon Dioxide (CO2) production 
in turning manufacturing processes. Three critical factors—rotational speed, feed rate, and lubrication—are examined 
for their influence on CO2. The work used a lathe machine and a set of three sensors strategically placed around the 
machine along with tools and workpiece samples. Full factorial design of experimentation is used to rigorously test 
and analyze the relationships between the factors and response function of CO2 production. The results reveal 
significant main effects for the factors as follows: lubrication, rotational speed, and feed rate, along with interaction 
effects. Lowering rotational speed and high feed rate decrease CO2 production supporting the hypothesis. Surprisingly, 
within-oil lubrication decreases CO2 production, not as expected. Interaction effects emphasize the additive and 
subtractive influences of the factors on CO2 production. While the full factorial design of experimentation applied 
allows for comprehensive factor effects analysis, it acknowledges limitations in the specific selected levels for 
machine rotational speed and tool feed rate. The research provides valuable insights into the impact of various 
operational conditions on CO2 production in material removal manufacturing processes. Main and interaction effects 
contribute to the knowledge in sustainability manufacturing. The study paves the way for further investigations on 
optimal experimental conditions.

short time, for dislocation movements and other deformation mechanisms at higher strain rates, resulting in higher 
resistance to deformation and high temperatures. This behavior is observed in ferrous materials like steel and less in 
aluminum and brass. Power-Law Relationship illustrated in equation (2) below describes the flow stress as a power 
function of strain rate, where σ is the flow stress, ε˙ is the strain rate, K is a material constant, and m is the strain rate 
sensitivity exponent.

Main effects analysis showed differences in the effect directions of X2 of brass and aluminum compared to the steel. 
This can be resulted due to increasing the contact area between the cutting tool and removed material which will 
require more power to manufacture. Brass and aluminum as none ferrous material have less work hardening during 
the high strain rates that is required to cut the material as sensitive strain rate material. Brass and aluminum also have 
high ductility and malleability allowing to absorb applied power through plastic deformation which makes both 
observed less stresses under high strain rates, and maintaining ductility and toughness. This will lower the power 
required which will reduce the amount of CO2 generation during the machining. 
The research project contributes to the existing literature by emphasizing the importance of exploring factor 
interactions in empirical research projects and it uniquely navigates the intersection of sustainability and 
manufacturing engineering research. By exploring the significance of incorporating sustainable principles, practices, 
and empirical methodologies into research, more sustainable engineering concepts and solutions can be created.

Abstract 
Various retail items are transported from manufacturers to stores in prepacks, containing multiples of the same Stock 
Keeping Unit (SKU) or combinations of related SKUs. While prepacks cut down on supply chain costs, they can lead 
to supply-demand imbalances. This study introduces a novel method to determine optimal replenishment strategies 
for different prepack combinations. Using optimization, the model offers solutions via linear programming for steady-
state scenarios. It addresses two-SKU prepack cases, revealing insights into prepack design's cost-effectiveness. We 
focus on two policies; namely simultaneous policy and sequential policy. For the former, we allow the two prepacks 
to be ordered simultaneously or sequentially. In the simultaneous policy, we determine the best order quantities. 
Conversely, in the sequential policy, we first identify which prepack should be ordered initially—recognizing that the 
sequence impacts the overall cost. Subsequently, we ascertain the optimal order quantities. Notably, our analysis 
reveals that in the optimal scenario, at least one prepack should be ordered only once.

1. Introduction
During the transportation of retail goods from manufacturers to stores within the supply chain, it is customary to 
employ ""prepacks."" These prepacks bundle individual items for easier shipping and handling. Each prepack may 
contain multiples of a single Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) or a mix of different SKUs enclosed in a single prepack. 
Manufacturers usually assemble these prepacks, which remain sealed until they reach retail retailers, where they are 
unpacked and readied for sale. 
Prepack implementation not only reduces shipping and handling costs but also serves several critical functions. Certain 
items, due to their small size, unique shape, or weight, are consistently transported in prepacks throughout the supply 
chain. This includes a wide array of products, such as electronics (like multiple Apple products shipped together in 
one package), apparel like shirts and shoes (with various sizes packaged together), and various cosmetics and 
housewares. However, this practice presents challenges for retailers in managing inventory for different SKUs, as the 
demand ratio may not align with the inventory ratio within prepacks. 
This challenge becomes more pronounced when there are limited prepack options available. For instance, consider a 
scenario where only one prepack, containing two SKUs (SKU1 and SKU2), is accessible to the retailer over time. If 
the average demand ratio of SKU1 to SKU2 does not align with the inventory ratio in the prepack, it can lead to one 
SKU running out of stock first—assume it is SKU1. With shortages not permitted, when ordering more prepacks, 
there is leftover for the inventory of SKU2. Since there is only one prepack available, SKU1’s inventory again depletes 
first, causing SKU2 leftovers to accumulate over time. This has presented retailers with a significant challenge, as

Table 4 and Figure 1, together, shed light on the optimal total cost and the optimal inventory policy. That is, when ℎ2 
is small, then Joint Replenishment policy is optimal. As ℎ2 increases, then Sequential Replenishment policy is optimal 
only if (𝑙𝑙, 𝑙𝑙−) = (2,1). Next, as ℎ2 further increases, then Sequential Replenishment policy is optimal only if (𝑙𝑙, 𝑙𝑙−) =
(1,2). Therefore, the optimality of the policies discussed in this paper is contingent upon the specific costs and prepack 
configurations encountered. For instance, consider a scenario where ℎ2 = 4. According to the findings presented in 
Table 4, the optimal policy for the retailer would involve employing the Sequential Replenishment Policy with 
(𝑙𝑙, 𝑙𝑙−) = (2,1). However, if the retailer were unaware of the results detailed in our paper and consequently opted for 
(𝑙𝑙, 𝑙𝑙−) = (1,2) instead, our analysis suggests a potential cost reduction for the retailer by 8.7%.

6. Conclusion 
In recent years, suppliers have adopted the practice of packaging multiple SKUs together to mitigate packaging and 
shipping costs, thereby consolidating them into a single shipment to retailers. However, this approach has introduced 
a new challenge for retailers. The mismatch between the demand ratio and the inventory ratio of the SKUs within a 
single prepack often leads to the accumulation of excessive inventory for certain SKUs over time. This paper focuses 
on investigating this predicament faced by retailers. 
 
Specifically, we examine the case of a retailer grappling with this challenge. The retailer routinely orders two prepacks 
and receives two distinct SKUs within each prepack. The demand for these SKUs is deterministic, providing a 
structured framework for our analysis. 
 
To optimize the total cost for this retailer, we introduce two policies: 1) Joint Replenishment Policy and 2) Sequential 
Replenishment Policy. With the Joint Replenishment Policy, the retailer places orders for both prepacks 
simultaneously, aiming to equalize the inventory levels of the two SKUs. Conversely, the Sequential Replenishment 
Policy involves ordering the two prepacks sequentially. In this scenario, the sequence in which the prepacks are 
ordered becomes pivotal, resulting in two distinct policies within the Sequential Replenishment approach. 
 
We formulate the total cost expression for the aforementioned policies and determine the optimal frequency of 
ordering each prepack. Moreover, in a market offering numerous prepack options, selecting the most suitable pair of 
prepacks becomes a critical consideration. We delve into exploring strategies for the retailer to effectively navigate 
this challenge.

Abstract 
This paper proposes a novel data-driven optimization framework that integrates building design decisions with 
simulation results to optimize sustainability across environmental, social, and economic dimensions. The building 
industry faces increasing pressure to reduce emissions and environmental impacts, but existing design tools do not 
fully account for how buildings will be operated by occupants. The proposed optimization framework utilizes 
statistical learning via metamodels and decision optimization to explore the complex tradeoffs involved in building 
decisions. The focus of this paper is on developing an optimization approach performed on common machine learning 
models such as classification and regression trees (CART), gradient boosted trees and random forest to investigate the 
causal relationship between building decisions and performance metrics. We integrate both descriptive and 
prescriptive analytics to inform an optimization model that provides decisions for both the design and operations of a 
given building. A case study is presented demonstrating the potential benefits of the optimization model in the design 
phase of a building. The integrative, data-driven optimization approach incorporates both categorical and continuous 
variables to create higher-performing, more sustainable building designs that better balance Planet, People, and 
Prosperity goals.

Abstract 
 
Inkjet additive manufacturing is the next step toward ubiquitous manufacturing by enabling multi- material printing 
that can exhibit various mechanical, electronic, and thermal properties. These characteristics are realized in the careful 
formulation of the inks and their functional materials, but there are many constraints that need to be satisfied to allow 
optimal jetting performance and build quality when used in an inkjet 3-D printer. Previous research has addressed the 
desirable rheology characteristics to enable stable drop formation and how the metallic nanoparticles affect the 
viscosity of inks. The contending goals of increasing nanoparticle-loading to improve material deposition rates while 
trying to maintain optimal flow dynamics is the closely held trade secret in formulating these inkjet compositions. We 
use data from previous experiments and the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics to train machine learning 
regression models to predict the relevant factors of inkjet printability at a standardized temperature of 25oC: viscosity, 
surface tension, and density. These models were used to predict the rheological factors of the main components of a 
UV-curable inkjet ink formulation: UV-curable monomers and oligomers, photoinitiators, dispersants, and 
humectants. This paper compares the relative performance of five machine learning algorithms to assess the 
effectiveness of each approach for chemoinformatics regression tasks.

Abstract 
This paper aims to address distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem (DFJSP) with sequence dependent setup 
times by minimizing the total energy consumption. This research proposed and formulated a mixed integer linear 
programming (MILP) model with an early optimization termination criterion to solve the DFJSP. Furthermore, this 
model is extended to consider electricity consumption by introducing the objective function of energy usage in the 
form of processing energy, setup energy, and idle energy consumption, with strategy to shutdown machines when the 
machines are in idle state. A constraint programming model and a meta-heuristic algorithm in the form of a 
combination of Genetic and NEH algorithm (NEH-GA) is proposed and compared with the MILP model. The results 
show that the MILP model achieves optimality within reasonable time and performs better than constraint 
programming model when problem complexity is small, whereas constraint programming tends to do better when the 
problem complexity is large. The proposed meta-heuristic algorithm performs the best in terms of computation time 
when the problem complexity is large albeit not guaranteeing an optimal solution.

1. Introduction
The significance of distributed manufacturing in today’s continuously increasing globalization has been recognized 
by scholars and researchers, and efforts have been taken to improve it over the years (Chan et al. 2006), (Ziaee 2014). 
Multi-factory production setting has been slowly replacing the existing single-factory production (Chan et al. 2006), 
(Ziaee 2014). The multi-factory setting allows factories to be located near their end-customers, to take advantage of 
cheaper labor and raw material resources, to respond to market changes more quickly, and to apply to local laws and 
regulations (Chan et al. 2006). Distributed factory scheduling problems are more complex than single factory 
scheduling problems and involve (i) allocation of jobs to factories and (ii) scheduling of the jobs assigned to each 
factory (Chan et al. 2006). Therefore, a Distributed and Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (DFJSP) is a 
distributed scheduling problem where each factory represents a single Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem and a 
particular job cannot be assigned to more than one factory. Each factory in the DFJS problem setting can manufacture 
different product types, so the machines in each factory can have different capabilities and efficiencies.

Abstract 
The internal audits of a company are a fundamental process for quality assurance and proper compliance with different 
processes within a company. For this reason, it is also important that companies are able to adequately plan their 
implementation; But it often happens that companies do not have the necessary tools to make these adequate plans. 
Within the topic of planning, in this context, the factors of effort of internal auditors in work hours and capacity 
(number of audits) are taken into account. These aspects are vital for the organization of times and audits over a period 
of time, since, if an adequate calculation is not made, it can significantly affect planning and trigger different 
consequences for the company and its processes. Given the above, it was proposed to develop and implement 
predictive and prescriptive analytics models to facilitate the planning and optimization of internal audits in terms of 
hours and number of audits (2 models); improving an (existing) digital planning tool. Historical audit information was 
obtained, worked and processed within an IT company. Different Machine Learning Python libraries were applied to 
carry out the modeling process, which include: PyCaret, H20, FLAML, TPOT, LazyRegressor, among others.Various 
evaluation metrics such as coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error 
(MSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to evaluate the models. The best results were obtained 
by Random Forest models, where R2 metrics of 94.40% and a MAPE of 6.26% were obtained for the hours of effort 
model; An R2 of 90.49% and MAPE of 6.77% were obtained for the capacity model.

1. Introduction
The aspect of quality has been a highly relevant topic for companies in recent years. It has been found that adequate 
quality management in companies leads to better success indicators, such as: product or service quality, customer 
satisfaction, operational and economic performance (Sila, et al., 2020). Internal audits are one of the greatest tools that 
help ensure quality in the processes of a company. 
An audit is defined as “the process of reviewing and verifying the operation of a company, either comprehensively or 
in a specific aspect; which is carried out with a precise and detailed methodology to identify incidents, eventualities, 
diagnoses, panoramas and points of opportunity” (Auren México, 2021). Internal audits help ensure that a company's 
processes are done correctly and appropriately, therefore, ensuring better quality in them and in the results that come 
from them. 
From the above lies the importance of a company's internal audit process being effective and efficient. One of the key 
aspects for a successful execution of internal audits is their planning. According to Selvarajah (2019), proper internal 
audit planning ensures the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of internal audit processes. Otherwise, audits do not 
adequately fulfill their purpose and end up slowing down a company's improvement processes.

Overall, the web application serves as a comprehensive tool for audit planning and analysis, enabling users to import 
data, select and train models, and visualize outcomes through a highly interactive and user-friendly platform. This 
deployment highlights the application's role in facilitating efficient audit management and decision-making processes. 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendations 
Through the use of different automatic modeling libraries in the Python programming language, hundreds of models 
were generated and trained in order to be able to predict the number of hours of effort (Actual Effort) needed to 
perform a certain number of audits in a Sprint and the number of projects (Total Projects) that can be performed in a 
Sprint based on certain input data. The best results or models were obtained with the Lazy Regressor and Pycaret 
libraries. For the Actual Effort model, a Random Forest Regressor was obtained as the best model, with optimized 
parameters, obtaining an R² Test of 94.40%, a MAPE of 6.26% and RMSE of 16.05 hours. For the capacity model, a 
Random Forest Regressor model was also obtained, with optimized parameters, obtaining an R² Test of 90.49%, a 
MAPE of 6.77% and RMSE of 4.57 projects. 
 
Different optimization methods were explored to optimize the number of projects that can be audited in a period of 
time. The heuristic optimization method based on iterative search turned out to be the best method in computational, 
practical and effective terms. 
 
Finally, visualization and Machine Learning libraries were applied to complement and/or improve the digital 
management tool. These libraries allow you to monitor KPIs and statistical information with historical and updated 
data from the audits carried out by the auditors. Additionally, there are now more complete and precise methods and 
processes for forecasting Actual Effort and Total Projects. Very positive feedback was received from auditors about 
the digital tool in general. 
 
These methods and solutions to the objectives of this project are recommended for other projects or solutions that 
have a similar nature or theme to that of this project. Additionally, it is recommended that this study be carried out 
from time to time because, over time, the optimal models found at the time this project was carried out may not 
adequately represent how the nature of the data behaves in future times.

Abstract 
In recent years, biogas has gained significant attention due to its ability to reduce environmental impact and increase 
energy diversity. Despite its promise, biogas projects depend on carefully selecting plant locations, a process that can 
be challenging. To address these challenges, this study thoroughly investigates the critical factors in selecting a biogas 
plant site. Based on an exhaustive literature review, 80 sub-factors were identified and categorized into four main 
factors: economic, social, environmental, and technical. Subsequently, a distilled list of 27 sub-factors was derived 
and ranked according to their frequency of use in existing research, culminating in a robust framework for site 
selection. These findings provide valuable insights and practical guidance for researchers and energy industry 
stakeholders, supporting informed decision-making and advancing sustainable biogas development.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the economic growth of several Asian countries has been remarkable, which has led to a significant 
upswing in demand for energy and other resources to support their development. However, this growth has also 
contributed to the nations' rising contribution to climate change, with their heavy reliance on fossil fuels for energy. 
The adoption of biomass energy presents a potential solution to this problem. In addition to mitigating the need for 
fossil fuel combustion, biomass energy can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, biomass energy deployment 
can aid in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, as no new carbon is released into the atmosphere (Vassilev, Vassileva 
et al. 2015). Efficient energy utilization is essential for achieving economic growth and catering to the increasing 
population. Unfortunately, in many developing countries, the energy demand has surged in recent years, putting

A Sustainable Product Design Approach to Improving 
Self-administered Medication  
Reenu Singh PhD 
Independent Researcher, Fairfax, Virginia

Abstract 
Remembering to take medicine on time is a common challenge encountered by many individuals. In today's fast-
paced lifestyle, compounded by the effects of stress, short-term memory loss is becoming more prevalent even 
among younger demographics. As a result, individuals often find themselves struggling to recall and adhere to 
their prescribed oral medication schedules, leading to doubts and concerns about their timely intake. The 
implication of this problem extends beyond the surface as inconsistent medication perpetuates the status quo of 
the patient’s illness or can worsen the health condition. This often results in increased consultations and additional 
prescriptions. Additionally, the insurance companies also incur increased expenses per patient. To address wastage 
of the various resources and treatment costs, lean manufacturing coupled with machine learning and improved 
design can be useful in lowering manufacturing and research costs along with downstream process expenses. 
From a product design perspective, there is a need to address the design of the medicine containers to provide a 
user-friendly experience of oral medicine administration. The paper explores the role of machine learning in 
reducing the time in the research process. It is followed by possible options for suitable medicine containers for 
oral medication involving a set of ideations. To conclude, considering the different storage needs of different 
medicines, a more collaborative approach is recommended, involving doctors, industrial designers and upstream 
executives in the design of improved medicine administration. This collaborative effort will be potentially fruitful 
in ensuring patients’ adherence to their medication schedules.

1. Introduction
The fast-paced lifestyle has significantly impacted a large population, with performance pressure at work, juggling 
daily responsibilities, and striving to balance home and office life. This urban phenomenon has acute adverse 
effects on individuals' mental and physical health. Leading a stressful life results in both tangible and intangible 
setbacks, followed by health issues and mental illnesses. One major challenge is when people suffer from short-
term memory loss regarding their self-administered oral medication. Despite setting up reminders on their devices, 
many individuals still doubt whether they have taken their medication, leading to significant adverse health 
effects. The repercussions of non-adherence to medication are multifaceted. They include medication wastage, 
disease progression, diminished functional capabilities, a decline in quality of life, and increased utilization of 
medical resources, such as nursing home placements, frequent hospital visits, and higher hospital admission rates. 
The following figure (Figure 1) demonstrates cause-effect of the factors affecting the deterioration of the health 
of an individual. It also shows the impact of feedback about timely medication over wellbeing. With the addition 
of ‘feedback at the time of medication’ the causal loop diagram shows the addition of balancing loops that provide 
an increase in ‘timely intake’ of the medicine.

doubt about administration, and the user's ability to use both hands effectively. The results will help determine 
whether a single-hand or double-hand use product is more appropriate. 
 
The findings will categorize users based on the duration of doubt initiation and identify the age groups of users, 
particularly focusing on older individuals. For users aged 60 and above or those with impaired hand and finger 
control, applying a pinch force (required to tear medicine from a strip) can be challenging. Different design 
options will be explored to address the needs of these users. 
 
The ethnographic study will reveal additional factors that may influence design parameters. Prototypes will be 
developed and tested to evaluate their functionality and effectiveness in addressing the needs of individuals with 
short-term memory loss, who often struggle to adhere to their medication regimens. 
 
12. Conclusion 
Medicines are prescribed for varying periods; the duration ranges from 5 to 30 days, 90 days or more. While there 
are medicines that are required to be protected from exposure to light/sun, there are others that demand zero 
exposure to air. This is however tedious to achieve as that would mean that each tablet or capsule be then packed 
individually which will require more packing material. With biodegradable material, the medicine packaging will 
solve the accumulation of nondegradable dump. The study attempts to address and initiate the redesign of the 
medicine containers. Thus becomes imperative to include the insights of the healthcare personnel - for the material 
and packaging requirements for different medicines, and manufacturers - to provide the length and breadth of the 
scope of material choices, engineers - to assist in developing the low-cost product and industrial designers - to 
develop the user-centred products that fit into the lives of the users.

Abstract 
The timber supply chain encompasses the processes involved in the sustainable extraction, processing, and distribution 
of timber products. This complex network involves coordination among forest owners, loggers, sawmills, wholesalers, 
and retailers to ensure efficient flow from forest to end consumers. Understanding the gaps and barriers in the timber 
supply chain is essential for promoting economic growth, environmental sustainability, and social responsibility 
within the forestry industry. In this paper, we employ a game theory approach to explore the interactions among forest 
landowners (suppliers), wood-using mills (demand for timber), and a carbon offset aggregator (demand for carbon) 
as market agents to provide insights about the trade-offs faced by forest landowners. We develop a timber supply 
chain model based on common landowner decision criteria, such as maximizing forest value,  in the US South. In this 
model, landowners harvest timberland to maximize their profit while taking carbon sequestration into account. Our 
study examines the trade-off between timber harvesting and harvest deferral for carbon sequestration based on 
landowners' environmental awareness. A Bertrand game has been designed to determine the Nash equilibrium pricing 
strategy for timber price and carbon price- based on forest structure and landowners' environmental awareness. Our 
findings indicate a positive association between carbon sequestration and landowners' willingness to participate in 
carbon programs. Our findings help to analyze the future trends in the timber market, including supply levels, demand 
growth, and price movements. This line of inquiry can provide valuable insights for aggregators and forest products 
mills on strategically planning which wood basins are more suitable for their needs. Additionally, it allows landowners 
to better comprehend an additional income source (carbon offsets) and complement it with more established sources 
of income.

Abstract 
The management of complexity and scheduling in mega construction projects is a persistent challenge due to their 
vast scope and inherent intricacies. This study specifically addresses the research problem of managing these 
complexities and scheduling issues by exploring the application of the Functional Resonance Analysis Method 
(FRAM) in construction project management. Through an extensive literature review, we identified a notable gap in 
the application of FRAM throughout the entire lifecycle of mega projects. To address this gap, the study proposes an 
innovative model that integrates FRAM with the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) process groups, 
enhanced by the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) across all knowledge areas. This model is exemplified through a 
case study of the Channel Tunnel project, demonstrating FRAM’s ability to manage complexities, highlight critical 
factors, and sequence activities effectively. Our findings illuminate the nuanced interdependencies within the Channel 
Tunnel project and showcase the efficacy of the FRAM model in enhancing project visibility, decision-making, and 
overall management. By promoting the integration of FRAM, this study contributes a novel perspective to the field of 
project management, advocating for a more resilient and adaptive approach to managing the challenges of mega 
construction projects.

1. Introduction
Mega construction projects are characterized by their vast scales and complexities, posing significant challenges in 
terms of complexity management and scheduling, often leading to delays and budget overruns. This research 
specifically identifies the management of complexity and scheduling in mega construction projects as the primary 
problem. Studies by Flyvbjerg (2014) highlight the trends and implications of mismanagement in large-scale 
infrastructure projects, including historical cases like the Channel Tunnel project. Traditional project management 
methodologies, such as those encapsulated in the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), provide a 
structured approach to project management. However, their efficacy in dealing with the non-linear complexities and

application to PMBOK process groups can alter risk assessment and mitigation strategies are needed to provide a 
deeper understanding of its operational impacts. 
 
Lessons Learned 
While this research proposes a novel integration of methodologies, it stops short of providing a comprehensive analysis 
of lessons learned from its application. Future studies should focus on documenting specific lessons learned from the 
deployment of this integrated approach in various construction projects, helping refine the model based on practical 
experiences and challenges. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study has embarked on an exploratory journey to integrate the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) 
with the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) process groups, specifically tailored for the complexities 
inherent in mega construction projects. The synthesis of these methodologies was demonstrated through a case study 
of the Channel Tunnel project, showcasing potential enhancements in project visibility, decision-making, and overall 
management effectiveness. The findings from this study reveal that the integrated FRAM-PMBOK model provides a 
comprehensive framework for managing the complexities and variabilities in mega construction projects. The 
application of FRAM within the PMBOK structure allowed for a detailed analysis of project interdependencies, which 
facilitated better risk management, resource allocation, and scheduling. These improvements were evidenced by the 
enhanced project visibility and more informed decision-making processes observed in the case study. Unique insights 
from this study include the practical demonstration of how FRAM can be utilized to dissect complex project 
interactions and how its integration with PMBOK can lead to more adaptive and resilient project management 
practices. Additionally, coupling FRAM with System Dynamics can further enhance predictive capabilities and 
management strategies, leading to better overall project performance in mega construction projects. Future work 
should develop and test integrated models in simulations to refine these methods before practical application. 
 
The potential impact of this study on the field of project management is significant. By providing a robust framework 
that integrates FRAM with PMBOK, this research offers a novel method for managing large-scale construction 
projects more effectively. It emphasizes the importance of adaptive management strategies and highlights the benefits 
of incorporating systems thinking into traditional project management practices. 
Despite the advances made, further research is needed to validate the integrated approach across diverse construction 
environments. Future studies should focus on empirical validation, quantitative analysis, and comparative 
effectiveness research to substantiate the benefits observed in this study. Gathering comprehensive expert feedback 
and conducting in-depth risk management case studies will also be crucial for refining the framework and ensuring its 
practical applicability. 
In conclusion, this study contributes a significant advancement in project management strategies, advocating for a 
more resilient and adaptive approach to managing mega construction projects. By addressing the inherent complexities 
and variabilities in these projects, the integrated FRAM-PMBOK model has the potential to improve project outcomes 
and advance the practice and research of project management.

Abstract 
This paper presents the design of a new system for dynamically adjusting safety stock levels based on real-time data. 
The proposed system addresses the challenge of balancing service level targets and financial constraints in inventory 
management. Service level targets, directly influencing safety stock levels, aim to ensure a high probability of meeting 
customer demand. However, financial constraints, such as budget limitations and cash flow considerations, impose 
restrictions on the amount of capital that can be allocated to inventory. To tackle this problem, in this research, the 
proposed system utilizes ABC classification to identify high-volatile items and prioritize them in the adjustment 
process. The goal is to minimize inventory costs while maintaining desired service levels, thus optimizing the 
allocation of capital and enhancing overall inventory management efficiency. The efficacy of the proposed model is 
demonstrated through a sample numerical data analysis, providing empirical validation of its effectiveness in real-
world scenarios. We were able to create a model which can a) re-distribute the cycle service level value based on the 
required budget using linear programming and prioritizing high-volatile items, b) analyze various scenarios in regards 
to demand lead-time variations.

1. Introduction
In the ever-changing environment of global marketplaces, competition intensifies daily, compelling firms to enhance 
operational efficiency with available resources. In today's data-driven world, the ability to gather and understand vast 
amounts of information is essential for gaining a strategic advantage. Data is more than just a resource; it is a powerful 
tool for making well-informed decisions that set a firm apart from its competitors (Elahi and Franchetti, 2014). 
Leveraging this capacity for informed decision-making is critical across industries, fostering a fast-paced and 
proactive business climate. However, these decisions must be not only accurate but also timely, as delays can diminish 
a company's competitive edge (Haksever and Moussourakis, 2005; Mangotra et al., 2009; Elahi and Wooten, 2019). 
Thus, the ability to make dynamic decisions is increasingly important. To address this need, this research paper focuses 
on offering an innovative inventory management approach via dynamic safety stock computation. Inventory 
management is a crucial component of supply chain management, encompassing the processes for ordering, storing, 
using, and selling a company’s inventory (Franchetti et al., 2017). Effective inventory management is vital for 
maintaining cash flow, ensuring customer satisfaction, and enhancing operational efficiency. The four main 
components of inventory management include: a) Order Management: Determines how much and when to order; b) 
Stock Control: Determines how much of each item should be in stock and when to replenish; c) Demand Forecasting: 
Predicts the quantity of each item expected from customer orders; and d) Warehouse Management: Manages the 
physical inventory, including storage and retrieval procedures. A major challenge associated with inventory

6. Conclusion  
In this paper, three different scenarios were proposed to deal with the safety stock adjustment problem while 
considering a dynamic adjustment system with focus on balancing the service level targets and financial constraints 
while there are multiple items. Among all three proposed scenarios, scenario#3 was considered as the most beneficial 
approach. Scenario #3, utilizing ABC classification and linear programming, redistributes cycle service level values 
based on budget limitations while prioritizing SKUs according to their classification. By integrating ABC 
classification with linear programming, businesses are empowered to optimize inventory levels, prioritize high-value 
items, and adapt to budget fluctuations in real time. This approach ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, 
focusing on high-value items that contribute most to the company. The linear programming approach, known for its 
speed and computational efficiency, further enhances the practicality and adaptability of systems to real-world 
scenarios. A user-friendly interface has been developed to enable managers to experiment with different budget 
scenarios and observe their impact on inventory levels and service levels. This interactive capability fosters a 
collaborative environment where data-driven insights and human expertise converge to make informed decisions. This 
study has provided a practical tool that can be readily implemented by businesses without the need for specialized 
expert knowledge. The dynamic safety stock adjustment system, integrating ABC classification and linear 
programming, represents a significant step forward in balancing service level targets with financial constraints, 
ultimately leading to improved inventory performance and enhanced profitability.

Abstract 
The Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Center in Sumengko Village, Nganjuk, has emerged as a well-known 
shuttlecock production center, responding to local market demand with quality comparable to factory-made brands. 
Haris Jatmiko, Head of the local Department of Industry and Trade, highlighted the center's role in the strategic 
framework for SMES development under the Industrial Law of 2014. Despite its success, the center faces significant 
quality control challenges. The Head of the SME Center revealed that 50% of products failed the initial quality test 
due to reliance on a visual-based manual inspection process that did not comply with standard testing methods, such 
as the SNI 0036:2014 standard. Previous research shows that only one in ten local brands meet SNI requirements, thus 
underscoring the need for improved quality control to increase competitiveness against regions such as Tegal, which 
produces shuttlecocks that meet national standards. Production at Sumengko mostly uses outsourced labor, causing 
inconsistencies in product quality. This study uses value chain analysis to identify gaps and quality control problems 
in the Shuttlecock SMEs value chain and suggests improvements based on in-depth interviews and critical point 
analysis, by SNI 0036:2014. Recommendations are provided to address gaps in quality control practices, supported 
by proposals for further research to test these improvements and conduct a cost-benefit analysis.

6. Conclusion 
The conclusion drawn from the value chain analysis of the SME Center Shuttlecock in Sumengko Village, based on 
in-depth interviews, reveals that almost the entire value chain at the SME Center adheres to standards and methods of 
equipment by SNI 0036:2014 criteria. However, there are quality control issues within the value chain, encompassing 
four processes classified as critical points in SNI 0036:2014, namely feather sorting, feather trimming, feather 
straightening, and shuttlecock feathering, as well as one process not categorized as a critical point in SNI 0036:2014, 
which is feather stitching. These issues include concerns regarding quality control standards, lack of supportive 
technology in quality control, and human error. 
 
A proposal for improving quality control in the SME shuttlecock value chain involves implementing improvement 
designs based on value chain analysis, in-depth interviews, and root cause analysis with industry stakeholders. Further 
research is needed to assess improvement designs through testing before and after improvements in the SME 
shuttlecock value chain, as well as conducting a cost-benefit analysis to determine the feasibility of improvement 
designs.

Abstract 
This paper investigates the effect of ventilator geometry on wind patterns within a model building. 
Computer based simulations were conducted with fixed parameters such as temperature, pressure, and 
room size. The ventilator position was varied, and the resulting wind speeds and wind patterns were 
measured for two inlet scenarios: inlet from window and inlet from the ventilator. These findings suggest 
that the optimal ventilator position depends on the desired airflow direction and the inlet location. When 
maximizing wind speed is the primary goal and air enters through the window, positioning the ventilator 
directly in line with the window is recommended. However, when the inlet is the ventilator itself, the 
position has less impact on wind speed, and other factors such as noise reduction or aesthetics may 
become more important considerations. Key findings from the simulations have been reported in this 
paper. Future research could explore the influence of additional factors such as building layout, and 
external wind conditions on airflow patterns within buildings.

6. Conclusion 
Table 1 summarize the findings. We can note that when the air inlet is from the ventilator, and the exit is from the 
window, with a pressure difference of 1KPa between the two ends, we get a maximum speed of 38.82 m/sec. The 
ventilator is positioned at the extreme left side of the left wall of the room, opposite to the window.

Abstract 
Nowadays, sugarcane bagasse is obtained as waste from the sugar industry where it is commonly discarded or burned. 
Nevertheless, this byproduct contains properties that can be used in the packaging industry. The purpose of this 
scientific article is to analyze the attributes of small films based on sugarcane bagasse to determine their suitability so 
that with this data they can produce biodegradable packaging. The most notable results of the tests carried out were 
the Shore hardness level of 85% of dose 1 and a resistance to elongation of 31.58% of dose 2. With this, added value 
will be achieved to the sugarcane bagasse since use as raw material in the manufacture of products that provide good 
to the community. The work carried out has a quantitative approach, descriptive method, and techniques such as 
observation, documentary analysis and analysis of processes and activities were used.

1. Introduction
Currently, millions of tons of plastics are manufactured each year worldwide and both production and consumption 
are increasing massively (Gupta et al. 2020). Although packaging is essential to preserve the quality and freshness of 
food, as well as to extend its shelf life, the increase in the production and consumption of conventional food packaging 
has contributed to an increase in the generation of non-organic packaging waste (Andrade et al. 2022). The rapidly 
increasing production of plastic, resulting in escalating plastic waste, is surpassing the capabilities of environmental 
waste management and the capacity of available landfills, thereby exacerbating climate change, which has had 
negative impacts on the environment and the organisms that inhabit it (Khoaele et al. 2023). It should be noted that 
there is a considerable demand for food packaging in various industrial areas(El-Sakhawy et al. 2023), but at the same 
time these conventional plastic containers have certain limitations, the main disadvantage being their long shelf life. 
Although a small fraction of these materials is recycled (21%), a large proportion (79%) ends up being discarded, 
causing damage to the environment (Panou and Karabagias 2023). Microplastics have been detected in food 
worldwide, making human exposure to these contaminants through food unavoidable and potentially posing health 
risks(Affrald 2024). According to a report, it is estimated that approximately 5 billion pieces of plastic are drifting in 
the oceans of various nations, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Given the environmental devastation generated by 
these plastic materials, sustainable solutions are required as possible alternatives (Yaradoddi et al. 2021). 
Expanded polystyrene is one of the most harmful but useful plastics for the manufacture of single-use containers. It is 
known that it is not a biodegradable material and according to the World Health Organization it has elements that are 
toxic to human health, such as Bisphenol A, styrene and phthalates, which when in contact with beverages or food at 
high temperatures have the possibility of being released, causing serious consequences such as reduced fertility, cancer 
and changes in the central nervous system (Morales et al. 2020). The International Agency for Cancer Research 
(IARC) determines based on evaluations that styrene monomer is probably carcinogenic (Group 2A). In addition, for 
this evidence, we worked with high doses in occupational exposure of people and animals by inhalation; the

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
 
To achieve a film with more promising attributes, it is recommended to make improvements in the Shore hardness, 
water absorption and tensile strength and elongation tests. With these improvement proposals, the objective of being 
a functional material to produce biodegradable packaging will be achieved. Firstly, obtaining a lower water absorption 
percentage is vital for the films; to obtain it, a chemical modification process would have to be carried out on the raw 
material (sugarcane bagasse). We can opt for hydrophilization through a fatty acid treatment, which would help a lot 
since this process will seek to bind the hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains to the cellulose fiber, creating a barrier that 
repels water. Likewise, although it is true to improve hardness and tensile strength there are quite a few alternatives, 
but what we need to obtain is something that can be economical and that does not affect the biodegradability of the 
product, so rigid and cross-linking additives are ruled out. Instead, we can opt for the addition of more rigid organic 
compounds in the composition such as polyhydroxyalkanoates. For example, PHB AND PHBO in the appropriate 
proportions will provide the necessary help to improve this function. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The use of sugarcane bagasse, as an agro-industrial waste, is a viable option for the manufacture of food containers 
having the same or similar properties as expanded polystyrene containers; in addition, being an agricultural waste, it 
does not require complex technology for its production at an industrial level. Also, thanks to the use of sugarcane

bagasse in the manufacture of the container, we can speak of an eco-friendly product that will be accepted by the 
public because it helps to care for the environment. 
 
The tests of physical mechanical properties in bioplastics of the 3 doses helped to verify the strengths and weaknesses 
of each one compared to a conventional food packaging. However, there are characteristics that can be improved to 
obtain a quality product that can compete in the market. With respect to the tensile strength and elongation test, good 
results were obtained, but we believe that the tensile strength can be improved with the help of additives and the use 
of reinforcing agents of natural origin. A high % of water absorption was also observed in the 3 doses, which can be 
detrimental depending on the type of food to be stored. To avoid this drawback, the use of additives or agents that 
help to reduce the high absorption that was obtained is suggested. 
 
It was demonstrated that our films in all their doses successfully fulfilled the biodegradability test, since the data 
obtained are within the theoretical ranges of each test. With this, a future elaboration of containers using bagasse fiber 
and chemical additives would encourage the use of biodegradable containers since they will not generate a negative 
impact on the planet and at the same time fulfill the same function as a conventional polystyrene-based food container.

Abstract 
This simulation study aims to analyze the average time spent by employees at Jaya's Kitchen, a South Indian restaurant 
in Wallingford, CT, when handling dine-in, to-go, and online orders during peak operational hours. The project does 
not involve process optimization but focuses on gathering data to understand the current efficiency of order processing 
across the three order modes. The simulation will be conducted using Arena software to model the restaurant's 
operations realistically. Key performance metrics such as average order handling times, resource utilization rates, and 
queue lengths will be tracked. The simulation inputs will be based on real-world data collected from the restaurant, 
including order arrival rates, service time distributions, and resource capacities. By simulating weekly scenarios and 
analyzing the outputs, the study aims to identify potential metrics, and resource utilizations in order handling times 
during peak periods. The findings can provide valuable insights to the restaurant management, enabling data-driven 
decisions for improving operational efficiency and enhancing customer experience.

Abstract 
According to León & Torre (2016), in recent years the growth of the market and competitors in the industrial sector 
requires faster, more reliable dispatch at a lower price. As a result of this analysis, the design of an improvement 
proposal for the management of the supply warehouse of a metalworking company based on the DDMRP methodology 
was considered relevant. This improvement seeks to standardize the warehouse's operational processes and reduce the 
average inventory level. Likewise, the proposal was validated by simulating the normal warehouse flow in Python. At 
the conclusion of the study, it was demonstrated that the implementation of the tools described above allows a 
reduction in the inventory level of 6.23% and it was proven that the DDMRP methodology allows the implementation 
of an inventory management system that guarantees better control and visualization of the inventory of the warehouse.

1. Introduction
The manufacturing industry is one of the most important economic sectors for the Peruvian economy (INEI 2018), 
since it is a supplier of capital goods such as machinery, articles and supplies for sectors such as fishing, mining, 
construction, among others (SNI, 2020). Within this industry, one of the main activities is metalworking, because it is 
one of the industrial sectors that generates the highest aggregate level to the national industry (Mariategui, 2022). In 
2017 alone, it reached 16% of GDP (Di Natale and Picón 2017) and in 2021, according to the Institute of Economic 
and Social Studies (2021), there was an increment of 39.6% in the production of metalworking products compared to 
the previous period. However, León and Torre (2016) considered that the growth of the market and competitors in the 
industrial sector requires greater efficiency in the custody and optimization of stock levels. 
After analyzing the literature, the importance of inventory management was identified because it represents up to 50% 
of a company's assets and poor management can significantly increase costs due to overstock and even directly affect 
the client in case there is no projection in the planning regarding demand. (Camacho et al. 2021). Likewise, Orjuela 
et al. (2016) highlighted that inventory management is a problematic area within the supply chain, given that in the 
current situation, it is necessary to maintain a good level of inventories in order to satisfy customer demand, but these 
also generate a maintenance cost, which should be controlled. 
The following study took as reference a metalworking company located in Lurín, Peru. Figure 1 shows a root cause 
analysis where it was determined that the lack of planning and monitoring of an inventory management system incurs 
an average inventory level higher than required. Added to this is the lack of order and organization, which increases

Because the expected lead time is one month, the purchase order is received in the following period. This concept is 
considered inventory in transit. 
 
Data base recollection 
The simulation was repeated twelve times to simulate the normal flow of the warehouse for one year, subsequently 
the information collected was exported to Excel for the analysis of results. 
 
Finally, in Figure 7 there is a fragment of the Python code with the aim of visualizing the processes defined above.

6. Conclusion  
 
After the analysis carried out on the inventories of the supply warehouse through the use of the ABC tool, it was 
possible to identify those items that represent an extra cost for the warehouse under study. Subsequently, the DDMRP 
methodology was applied to define an inventory management system, which allowed reducing the average inventory

level for the items belonging to the group A sample, by S/. 7,763.97 soles, which represents a reduction in the inventory 
level of 6.23%. Likewise, it was possible to verify that this described methodology allows the implementation of an 
inventory management system that guarantees better control and visualization of the stocks of the warehouse under 
study, because the service level obtained after the simulation was 96.55%.

Abstract 
Both production systems and servant systems today face increasingly dynamic and changing scenarios as a result of 
the greater number of competitors entering the markets, the wide variety of goods and/or services offered, the marked 
scarcity of resources (raw materials), the increasingly high associated costs, etc.  Industry 4.0, 5.0 and the same 
dynamism of customer needs, generating great telluric movements in the way of doing business, and that companies 
belonging to these contexts eagerly seek schemes that allow them to operate as open systems, that is, to be in contact 
with customers to the greatest extent possible, to listen to their voice and encourage them to feel served as they deserve 
and more. Based on the proposed precepts, schemes that allow this objective are described and it is thus that 
Servitization is seen as a competitive opportunity, which is the main focus of attention of this work, with which it is 
intended to establish through a systematic review supported by the Gavilan model the way in which it is being used 
worldwide to mark competitive advantages in the aforementioned productive contexts in a related time window with 
the last 10 years (2014 – 2023) and thus be able to generate a roadmap that allows the strengthening of the companies 
that make up these contexts in the city of Cartagena de Indias, Colombia.

Action 
Productivity 
This topic represents that, based on continuous and 
permanent 
communication 
with 
customers, 
the 
availability, quantity, and conditions of the resources 
required to manufacture a good or service are defined in 
a more optimal way. 
Quality 
It represents the need to use permanent and continuous 
communication as feedback, which will translate into 
the 
development 
of 
a 
culture 
of 
continuous 
improvement or advanced optimization, guaranteeing 
zero failures. 
Profitability 
It represents the need to adjust the costing mechanisms 
or systems of organizations, define more detailed and 
accurate 
operating 
budgets, 
since 
permanent 
communication with customers will help to make better 
decisions 
 
6. Conclusion  
From the development of this work, it can be inferred that: 
• 
There is a marked trend worldwide and especially in highly developed countries, for the issue of Servitization, 
since there is an awareness and the imperative need for companies not only to sell products, but also to 
survive, sustain and remain current in a highly competitive market such as the current one. 
• 
Servitization becomes a significant opportunity from an operations strategy approach not only for production 
systems, but also for servuction systems since the business mission goes beyond selling a product, the 
fundamental business mission is to serve its customers as they expect it. 
• 
The success of Servitization as a business strategy to survive, be sustainable, and significantly improve 
productivity, quality and profitability of the organization lies largely in the methods and measures to 
communicate with its customers, as well as the ability to learn from that communication and permanent 
interrelationship both with customers and with the context where they develop. 
• 
Based on this work, the possibility of new research is opened to establish the measurement of the service 
culture in both production and service systems, since this becomes an essential requirement to implement 
Servitization both with a focus on survival and sustainability and with a focus on operations strategy.

Abstract 
This study addresses the high delinquency rates and inefficient accounts receivable management in consulting firms. 
Using diagnostic tools such as Value Stream Mapping (VSM), problem tree analysis, and the Ishikawa diagram, 
critical factors affecting collections management were identified. An agile collections management model is proposed, 
involving process standardization and the implementation of a Kanban board, designed to be seamlessly integrated 
into daily company operations. The fundamental contribution of this work is the establishment of a clear and efficient 
workflow that significantly improves the collections process from the sale of the service to the effective collection of 
payments. This model was initially tested in a digital transformation consulting services company, where remarkable 
results were achieved. The outcomes demonstrated a 28% reduction in the delinquency rate due to the implementation 
of the proposed model. Other key performance indicators include a decrease in the average collection period, an 
increase in the proportion of clients making timely payments, and a reduction in the frequency of documentation 
errors. These results underscore the effectiveness of the proposed collections management model, providing a 
replicable framework for other firms in the sector.

1. Introduction
The backbone of all companies is the financial area. It plays a fundamental role; therefore, the proper management of 
financial resources is crucial to ensure economic viability and proper business development. Within it, there are 
fundamental elements such as accounts receivable, which are part of the working capital. The effective management 
of accounts receivable increases working capital, which ultimately contributes to the organization's current assets (Rao 
& Gaglani, 2014).

6. Conclusion 
In this study, a significant improvement in accounts receivable management was demonstrated through the 
implementation of an agile management model using the Kanban tool. The standardization of processes, coupled with 
clear policies and the incorporation of tracking technologies, resulted in a 28% reduction in the delinquency rate 
compared to the initial diagnosis. This change highlights the effectiveness of the proposed model in the context of 
consulting service companies, emphasizing the relevance of agile methodologies in financial management. 
 
The research underscores the importance of interactions between sales and collections departments. Traditionally 
siloed, the integration of these areas has proven to be crucial for improving operational and financial efficiency. 
Adopting a systematic and coordinated approach not only optimizes accounts receivable management but also 
significantly contributes to the company's cash flow, which is vital for its sustainability and economic growth in 
competitive markets. 
 
The contribution of this study to the field of industrial engineering is considerable, mainly due to its focus on 
integrating visual management tools like Kanban into financial management, an area traditionally less associated with 
these methodologies. Moreover, the use of standardized policies and procedures ensures greater consistency and 
predictability in operations, facilitating continuous and adaptive improvement in response to market changes. 
 
In conclusion, the research demonstrates that implementing an accounts receivable management model based on agile 
principles and process standardization can have a profound and positive impact on a company's financial health. For 
future studies, it would be beneficial to explore the adaptability and effectiveness of this model across different 
industrial sectors, as well as its integration with other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine 
learning for credit risk prediction and management. This direction would not only broaden the applicability of the 
model but also contribute to its refinement and effectiveness in various business environments.

Abstract 
An increase in overall economic activity and income can lead to an increase in per capita spending. This is related to 
increasing people's purchasing power. One industry that is experiencing growth and can expand its market share is 
retail companies. Where children's toy retail companies are one sector that has a big opportunity to reach a large 
market. Specific inventory controls are required by businesses to continue operating. Stores have difficulty tracking 
inventory accurately when their inventory systems are deficient. Specific inventory control is required by the business. 
Therefore, it is vital for businesses to manage their inventory efficiently if they want to avoid excess stock and reduce 
its negative impact on the operations of the entire organization. The aim of this research is to create an adequate 
inventory policy for one of the retail toy stores based on its characteristics. Inventory policy is determined by 
categorizing commodities using integrated ABC and FSN classification methods. By combining these approaches, 
you can make better decisions in inventory management, focus on products that provide the greatest financial impact 
and meet customer demand more effectively in order to develop better and more efficient inventory management 
strategies.

ABC-FSN Analysis, Inventory Management, Inventory Policy, Retail Industry 
1. Introduction
An increase in economic activity and overall income can lead to an increase in per capita spending. When the economy 
grows, people's average income also tends to increase. If average per capita spending increases, it indicates that in 
general, society has more money available to spend. An increase in average per capita spending can be a good indicator 
of economic health and people's spending tendencies. Jakarta is a dynamic metropolitan city with a growing range of 
shopping, entertainment and lifestyle options, which can drive consumption and increase per capita spending.The 
increase in per capita expenditure in DKI Jakarta could be caused by several factors, one of which is an increase in 
people's purchasing power.  
Increasing people's purchasing power can expand market share, one of which is retail companies. The retail marketing 
mix includes all the goods and services that the store can offer to consumers as well as all the store manager's 
programmatic efforts for the market environment. Retail mix is a marketing strategy used by retailers with the aim of 
getting consumers to make purchasing decisions in their stores (Barca et al., 2021). One of the industries in the retail 
sector that is experiencing quite rapid growth is companies in the children's toys sector. Changes in consumption 
trends and consumer preferences can also influence demand for children's toys. If there are many children in the 
population, it can create significant opportunities for the retail industry in the children's toys sector. Children's toy 
retail companies have a great opportunity to reach this growing market and gain significant market share.

Based on the table above, it can be seen that each type of goods is included in the categories AF, AS, AN, BF, BS, 
CF, and CS. BN and CN groups which do not have products in their group. The AS group has the most types of items 
in its category, namely nine items, which represent inventory items that have high value (category A) and slow 
turnover (category S). 
 
The characteristics of each type of goods are obtained from the table above based on their relative value and 
consumption patterns. Once this is determined, the company can decide on the best inventory policy based on the 
characteristics of each type of item. These features were divided into nine groups with three main categories after 
combining these two analyses. According to Hlaing et.al (2017) and Kumar and Shukla (2022), based on the matrix 
element priority matrix, ABC-FSN with the classifications AF, AS, AN, BF and CF which have the most important 
inventory groups are grouped into category 1. For BS, BN, and CS which have moderate importance grouped into 
category 2. Meanwhile, only the least important CN or not important at all are grouped into category 3. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Integration of ABC-FSN analysis is carried out to make it easier to manage types of goods based on selected criteria. 
ABC is a classification system that divides inventory items into three categories based on their relative value in the 
total inventory value. FSN is a classification system that divides inventory items into three categories based on 
consumption patterns. Activities carried out by combining ABC-FSN analysis enable the identification of types of 
goods so that companies can have a more holistic understanding of their inventory items and determine priorities in 
stock management. Companies can use appropriate and optimal strategies to predict inventory problems such as over- 
and under-stocks, out-of-stocks, or missed sales. 
 
There are twenty different types of items in all. From the research results, it is known that there is a classification that 
is obtained based on identifying the importance of goods and demand patterns based on their relative value as well as 
the speed of rotation and frequency of demand. The results showed that in category 1, namely the most important 
items and requiring attention regarding stock control (AF, AS, AN, BF, CF), there were 18 types of items (TNFD; 
EMDF; FPIB; WHTT; CRCW; TDFB; EMSA; WWMP; MBCM; EMFD; RLSP; EMGE; WHPL; MBBF; PPMI; 
SGWP; MCGR; EMCW). Category 2 which has moderate importance (BS, BN, CS) has 2 types of goods (WHID; 
CRAC), and category 3 which has less importance (CN) has no type of goods. ABC-FSN provides a more 
comprehensive understanding of items that have a high financial impact (ABC) and different consumption patterns 
(FSN), so that companies can manage their inventory more effectively according to the priorities and characteristics 
of each item.

Abstract 
Shoe manufacturing industry in the Philippines provides a variety of footwear worldwide. Despite numerous clients, 
this industry still experiences challenges in production. Hence, this study addresses the challenges faced by the shoe 
manufacturing industry in Marikina City, Philippines, particularly in optimizing production and efficiency. The 
company is experiencing productivity challenges that are affecting manufacturing as well as product quality. Poor 
performance, inefficient work methods, and an unhealthy workplace all contribute to lower productivity. This study 
aims to minimize inefficiency and enhance productivity in production processes through time and motion study, 
Promodel simulation, value analysis/value engineering, and quality tools. The study suggests establishing a standard 
time to reduce defects, and delays while increasing productivity. The study findings highlighted significant 
improvements in efficiency through specific operational guidelines, inspections, and storage procedures, targeting a 
total process increase of 21.80%. By implementing a function cost matrix, the manufacturing saved 24.76%. Utilizing 
ProModel, the study proposed operational adjustments and layout reorganization to eliminate bottlenecks and enhance 
employee well-being facilities. These changes reduced typical time without compromising company efficiency, 
productivity, or product quality. The strategic measures outlined in this study hold promise for ushering in a new era 
of enhanced productivity and operational efficiency within the shoe manufacturing sector in Marikina City. Through 
concerted efforts to optimize processes and create a conducive workplace environment, manufacturing can pave the

various factors contributing to its operational inefficiencies. Shoemaking involves intricate processes that demand 
creativity and skill to ensure the final product meets high standards of quality and aesthetics. However, the company 
is grappling with significant productivity obstacles, including employee inefficiency, unproductive work processes, 
and a subpar workplace environment. These issues culminate in delays, disruptions, and resource wastage, impacting 
both production output and product quality. Addressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that 
involves identifying root causes and implementing strategies to enhance employee performance, streamline processes, 
and improve the workplace environment. To overcome these obstacles, it is imperative for the company to address the 
underlying issues affecting its operational efficiency. By exploring the root causes, such as employee inefficiency and

without compromising quality standards. Through VA/VE methodologies, which can help in identifying product value 
and help in decision making of the company through optimization of production process and to improve quality and 
reduce waste (Team, 2023) businesses can identify opportunities for cost reduction while simultaneously preserving 
or even enhancing product quality (Kimmel, 2022). This strategic approach not only optimizes operational costs but 
also fosters a culture of continuous improvement within the company.

Abstract 
In today's highly competitive global world, the study explores the production challenges of the footwear industry. A 
company's most common problem is the bottlenecks and production inefficiencies. In addressing this pressing 
problem, the study sought to apply engineering tools such as ProModel Simulation and Time and Motion Study; the 
paper enables the proposed new design facility layout as a solution to boost the number of outputs in a company. This 
paper presents two strategic solutions: The Lean Six Sigma Approach emphasizes the need to reduce waste, improve 
processes, and increase product and process quality through running in the ProModel Simulation. The number of 
outputs increases from 136 to 172. At the same time, the U-shaped line Production Methodology arranges the process 
in a closer environment, aiming to have less transportation and allocate tasks more cohesively. The outputs from this 
method also increased from 136 to 151 exits. These solutions focus on streamlining production to enhance productivity 
and efficiency within the company.  Overall, the study provides valuable insights and practical strategies for improving 
production efficiency in the footwear industry. For future research, others may include the company’s monetary value 
to give a better approach and strengthen the results that would benefit the company’s growth and development.

1. Introduction
The Philippine footwear industry is a continuously developing marketplace that can be critical to the country's 
economic growth. As global trends influence customers' ideal style or preference, local footwear makers (Sapateros) 
and retailers continuously adjust to meet customer demands. As stated in the article by Owens (2023), one of the 
strategies businesses venture into is the availability of customization services. Through this, patrons can freely add 
their unique fashion style or personality to spice up the owned pairs. Owens's article (2023) also noted that an expected 
growth of 5.9% will be anticipated for the next four years based on the data gathered by expert market research in 
2023. 
Bizmanualz (2024) coined Time and Motion Study to analyze a company's process, environment, and overall 
efficiency through observation. This technique enables this study to dissect the process components to examine each 
part and identify the areas for improvement. Further, the time and motion study will benefit the company as it measures 
the time taken for each task and assesses movement and inefficiencies.

enhances the capability of the process to fully improve and resolve problems (Widiwati, 2024). For the first layout, 
the study opted for a single-line arrangement for the first phase to flexibly promote a conductively efficient 
environment with reduced idle time. Comparatively to the entity baseline of the present layout, the 1st proposed 
process provided a 2.92% transportation value, implying an improved difference of 3.86% already.  
Furthermore, the second Facility Design shown in Figure 8 would also increase the number of outputs and maximize 
the spaces within the company. Compared to the present layout, the streamline improved the decreasing percentage 
of idle times, resulting in an exit output of 151 clogs in 96.94 minutes (see Figure 10).

Abstract 
For the success of manufacturing activity, an effective facility layout is essential. It ensures smooth workflow 
processes, reduces unnecessary usage, and improves the effectiveness of resource utilization. As a way to implement 
another possibility of optimizing a facility layout, this study aims to enhance productivity and efficiency by optimizing 
the production area layout through a ProModel simulation approach. The study identified inefficiencies in the 
production workflow, particularly related to long travel times and improper arrangements. Using time and motion 
studies, this paper analyzed task completion times and motions to address bottlenecks and improve workflow. The 
conceptual framework integrated data collection, analysis, simulation, and process optimization to enhance the facility 
layout and operational processes. The study's findings emphasize the importance of a well-designed factory layout in 
boosting worker productivity and machinery efficiency. A new facility layout was recommended, which has the ability 
to produce 14 batches of handbooks compared to the existing production process of 10 batches only. This shows a 
significant improvement of 40% in the company's production output, aligning with the project's objectives for 
meaningful improvements in the production area.

1. Introduction
Facility layout planning is an important design decision that business owners should have something to do with as an 
aspect of the operational strategy of the business. The right layout can help the business run smoothly and efficiently 
(Gosende et al., 2021). The production flow process will identify the necessary adjustments and boost the 
manufacturing industry's productivity. Hence, a well-designed facility layout is essential for improving the 
productivity of workers and machinery. Walden (2020) claims that the processes determine the company's layout and 
not the facility layout that dictates the processes.  
The book manufacturing industry adapts to high volume runs on demand. Printing and publication businesses have 
developed unique ways of making trustworthy and high-quality products, which helped to build a good reputation 
over time (Jones, 2022). Bookmaking is a multi-stage production process. It consists of content editing, typesetting, 
plate making, printing, gathering of pages, binding or stitching, cutting or trimming, and packaging. This means 
operations in manufacturing have a huge number of workers and multiple machines. Therefore, the materials, 
equipment, tools, and machines used in each process must be arranged and managed properly to guarantee efficiency

improving or proposing a new facility layout for the company. This boost in productivity signifies a marked increase 
in output and highlights a more streamlined and optimized workflow that could achieve higher profitability, improved 
productivity and efficiency, and heightened customer satisfaction. Embracing this proposal could position book 
manufacturing companies as a standard in the industry, showcasing their dedication to process efficiency and 
excellence in meeting

Abstract 
Efficiency, Productivity, and Production layout are crucial metrics to the company’s operations. However, several 
complexities are found in hat manufacturing, leading to unavoidable dilemmas. Observations at a hat company 
revealed several critical issues such as insufficient manpower causing productivity problems, workers juggling 
multiple roles leading to delays, lengthy travel times between stations, delays due to defects and machine malfunctions, 
and inefficient production methods. To address these issues, engineering methods shall be utilized. This study 
employed industrial engineering tools such as the fishbone diagram for cause and effect analysis in 5Ms and Pareto 
chart to identify significant potential problems in the company that can impact operations. The study aims to improve 
manpower, layout, hat production, eliminate delays, and ensure sufficient supply and storage for fixtures and 
equipment in the manufacturing company utilizing ProModel Software. The techniques used in process optimization, 
product quality, and cost reduction are Time and Motion Study and function cost matrix. This study proposes methods 
for product, process, and cost management in the hat manufacturing company. The results show a total cost savings of 
39.2% in the function cost matrix. In the time and motion study and ProModel simulation, the current yield results in 
67 cycles and the proposed 81 cycles. The VA/VE approach helps in reaching optimum results for the company’s 
efficiency with a comparison of cost and process improvement. Utilizing tools like Value Analysis and Value 
Engineering (VA/VE) has played a major role in achieving the necessary improvements that the company will benefit 
from in the long term. Directions for future study include producing new research that will explore further alternative 
methodologies for existing industry problems.

Introduction
A hat serves multiple purposes, from shielding against weather elements to making a fashion statement. Hats typically 
exhibit a distinctive crown and brim. In several nations, employees are obliged to wear hats as part of their official 
dress code (Drake, 2022). Hats have cultural and religious significance, symbolizing social status and traditions 
throughout history. In Ancient Greece, wide-brimmed hats were protected from the sun. The Middle Ages featured 
hennins and berets, the sixteenth century had tall crowns, the seventeenth century saw wide-brimmed hats, and the 
eighteenth century introduced silk top hats and tricorns. The nineteenth century brought innovations like bowler hats, 
Stetsons, fedoras, and bonnets.Most people in the 20th century wore one of the many stylish hats available. Round

5.5 Validation 
The study concentrated on managing costs and addressing productivity inefficiencies to effectively tackle the 
company's challenges. The proposed layout significantly improved productivity and efficiency, reducing production 
time from 108.75 to 85.93 minutes per hat and increasing daily output from 67 to 81 hats. Material costs were cut 
from Php 8,466 to Php 3,326 without compromising quality. Standard time for processes was reduced from 424.85 to 
353 minutes, saving 71.49 minutes overall. With 81.12% of time spent on production and 18.88% on inspection, the 
process was optimized, benefiting the hat manufacturing company and its customers. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The study has successfully addressed the inefficiencies in hat manufacturing company and provided valuable 
recommendations to improve the manufacturing process. Through the use of Industrial Engineering methods, Time 
and Motion Study, and According to (Kumar, 2022). VA/VE analysis, the study is able to identify areas that hindered 
the company's progress and suggest ways to improve them. The study aimed to enhance the deployment of manpower, 
improve work methods, redesign the company layout, and eliminate delays in making hats, which are all critical factors 
in achieving productivity and efficiency. Implementing the recommendations can streamline work across six 
operations - coloring, cutting, blocking, stiffening, sewing, and packing - boosting productivity and meeting customer 
needs. Yet, changes may demand substantial time, resources, and investment. Thus, careful evaluation aligning with 
company goals is essential (Tulip Interfaces, 2023). Overall, this observation provides a valuable roadmap for hat 
manufacturing company to improve its operations and achieve long-term success in the industry. By incorporating the 
recommended strategies, the company can establish a competitive advantage and become a leader in producing high-
quality hats while meeting customer demands and maximizing profits.

Abstract 
The textile industry significantly contributes to the global economy, producing vast apparel and providing items to 
clients worldwide. Despite having a large client base, the industry needed help promptly meeting deadlines. This study 
aims to ascertain the elements that diminish the productivity of the textile sector. The study presents a thorough 
investigation into the factors influencing productivity within the textile industry, aiming to improve efficiency and 
meet deadlines more effectively. By conducting a time and motion study, the research establishes a standardized 
production time, revealing a potential output enhancement of 3,120 pieces in eight hours. Utilizing diverse priority 
rules, including Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Shortest Processing Time (SPT), the study projects a significant increase 
in production, estimating 90,480 outputs over 39 days. Furthermore, employing the Pro model, the study evaluates 
current and proposed process enhancements, demonstrating a notable reduction in production time by 13.2%. The 
proposed layout adjustment not only streamlines operations but also mitigates transport delays, showcasing practical 
improvements in industry practices. In conclusion, the study provides valuable insights into optimizing textile 
manufacturing processes. Its findings not only suggest immediate productivity enhancements but also pave the way 
for future research into alternative scheduling methods, promising greater flexibility and efficiency in resource and 
task management.

1. Introduction
Meeting the client's demands on time is crucial for operational efficiency and customer satisfaction, especially in 
industries like textile manufacturing. In an expanding industry with numerous clients and increasing demands, 
efficiently and punctually managing many demands is essential for enhancing employee efficiency and satisfaction. 
(Thomack, 2022) The textile manufacturing industry in Angono, Rizal, Philippines, continues to experience rapid 
growth. Since its inception in 2016, this organization has acquired a substantial client base and has established 
partnerships with several branches in Rizal, Cainta, and Pasig, Philippines, over eight years. The commodities 
produced were subsequently imported into shopping centers. With eight years of experience, textile manufacturing is 
committed to excellence in the business market. This company sews a wide range of clothing, including t-shirts, polos, 
and long sleeves. Emerson Garments' most popular designs are two-way colored t-shirts. The company delivers its 
finished product to its main contractors, who supply it to numerous local malls and establishments in the Philippines 
and internationally.

across four stations. The first graph, the Estates Entity-Baseline, displays the distribution of work or logic movement 
in blue, with a percentage of 67%. The remaining 33% represents the operational aspect. The second scoreboard 
displays the total number of exits, with a count of 5. The average time spent in the system is 132.12 minutes, while 
the average duration for each operation is 45.00 minutes. The resource state baseline indicates that colored idle has a 
higher proportion than others in terms of utilization, travel usage, and journey-to-park percentages. The third type is 
the baseline single capacity location states, where the idle proportion is higher than other types. All the percentages 
exhibit a higher level of idle time than those for the 13 workstations.   
 
6. Conclusion  
Meeting deadlines on time is crucial to various industries such as the textile industry. In identifying the causes of why 
the industry can’t achieve the target quota and deadline on time, many aspects, such as workers, production process, 
working time, and other factors, need to be considered. This study found that no time standardization, poor scheduling 
of jobs, no machine maintenance budget, and poor facility layout contribute to why the industry can’t achieve and 
exceed the target quota and deadline in time. By providing time standardization, this study shows the expected working 
time per piece of the t-shirts, specifically, the two-way colored t-shirt. Upon computation, the data shows that through 
time standardization the manufacturing can increase its output to 52 pieces, which can be produced every 8 minutes, 
and 3,120 outputs in eight working hours. This study also applies priority rules such as the Earliest Due Date (EDD) 
and the Shortest Processing Time (SPT) when scheduling jobs. The data shows that the industry can use SPT to 
sequence jobs if there are specific scenarios where the demands have the same deadlines. The ""Shortest Processing 
Time"" (SPT) scheduling strategy is advantageous in minimizing mean response times when jobs share the same 
deadlines.  (Angel, 2016) This study also shows that using standard time along with the Earliest Due Date (EDD) and 
Shortest Processing Time (SPT) priority guidelines, there will be 90,480 outputs that can be produced in 39 days.  
 
Lastly, this study employed the Pro model to present the proposed process and layout enhancement by applying a 
group technology layout. Various approaches using Pro Model have been explored in the literature. Studies by Marcelo 
et al. (2016), Duque et al., 2016 Cabusas et al (2023), Abad et al.(2023) are among them.  The implementation of 
Group Technology (GT) layout design has proven advantageous in the sewing sector, as evidenced by multiple 
research studies. Genetic programming facilitates categorizing components with comparable attributes into clusters 
and allocates specialized machinery groups (cells) to handle these clusters, thereby reducing the movement of 
materials between cells. (Fahturrohman, et. al, 2023). This study shows that the present layout average time on the 
system is 152.22 while the proposed average is 132.12. In addition, this arrangement reduces the duration of transport 
delays by 2 minutes. The data indicates that the proposed layout effectively reduces the industry's production time by 
13.2%. In future research, alternative scheduling sequencing methods, such as Earliest Start Time (EST), Smallest Job 
Next (SJN), Largest Job Next (LJN), and Least Slack Time (LST), will be explored. Additionally, Other scheduling 
techniques will be considered to enhance resource and task management by providing greater flexibility and 
efficiency.

Abstract 
In today's world electric system, where decentralization, democratization, and decarbonization are gaining importance, 
renewable energy sources play a significant role in electricity production. Wind energy, which has a competitive 
levelized cost of energy among renewables is considered as one of the major elements of the future energy mix. 
However, the intermittent nature of wind energy can cause stability issues in the grid and decrease financial efficiency. 
Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) have become popular as wind farm energy storage units due to the significant 
advantages they provide in solving these issues. Lithium-ion batteries are frequently integrated into wind farms as 
relatively mature technology owing to their superior features such as large power density. Still, deciding the optimal 
size and operation scheduling of the BESS is essential to enhance the economic benefits of the BESS integration 
project. In this study, a techno-economic nonlinear optimization model (NLP) is proposed to maximize the profit of 
an onshore wind farm in Turkey that participates in the day-ahead electricity market (DAM) within the Turkish 
Renewable Energy Resources Support Mechanism (YEKDEM). This model includes battery degradation cost and it 
can be used to analyze the profitability of the different market participation scenarios with BESS.

1. Introduction
Energy systems have begun to evolve towards renewable energy sources in line with the targets of  the Paris 
Agreement in 2015 to decrease greenhouse gas emissions for sustainability concerns (Hjalmarsson et al. 2023). The 
abundant and competitive nature of wind energy has led to the proliferation of wind power plants and increased the 
role of wind power in electricity generation (Barra et al. 2021).  However, the intermittent behavior of wind energy 
can reduce the reliability and economic benefits of wind power plants. These challenges are the main obstacles to the 
wider spread of wind energy (Galli et al. 2024).  Energy storage systems (ESS) such as chemical, mechanical, 
electrical, and thermal ESS can be used in solving these technical and economic problems of wind power plants to 
ensure energy security and independence (Hjalmarsson et al. 2023).  Lithium-ion batteries are rapidly developing and

Variables, indices, and parameters of the proposed model are given by Table 1. The objective function in equation 3.6 is 
established to maximize the li-ion BESS integrated wind farm profit consists of day-ahead market participation, 
YEKDEM tariff and battery degradation cost components. BESS project cost is calculated with equation 3.7. In this 
model, 1 hour is selected as time resolution. When the generated energy is supplied to the grid without using the battery, 
a loss still occurs. For a settlement hour t, with generation forecast available, the committed energy amount is determined 
by considering this loss. Constraint 3.8 restricts the ratio of the committed energy amount to the forecasted wind 
generation (after loss) with maximum and minimum allowed levels. The energy supplied to the grid at hour t is obtained 
by equation 3.9 and the unsatisfied committed energy amount or energy surplus exceeding the committed energy  at 
hour t is determined with constraint 3.10. The amount of energy that a power plant with integrated electrical storage unit 
can supply to the grid during the settlement period t cannot exceed the production amount that can be achieved with the 
installed power capacity recorded in the facility's license.  Constraint 3.11 ensures this condition.  Constraint 3.12 
indicates that the charged power into the BESS (before the losses) should be less than or equal to wind power generation. 
The relationship between the rated energy capacity and the rated power of battery is set by constraint 3.13. Constraints 
3.14 and 3.15 restrict the charged and discharged power by considering battery rated power. The change in the battery 
energy level is achieved with equation 3.16. The battery energy level is limited to a certain range by constraint 3.17 to 
prevent the battery from rapidly ageing. Equation 3.18 determines the initial battery energy level. Battery lifetime 
throughput for specified DOD is calculated with constraint 3.19. Total discharged and charged power are limited by 
constraints 3.20 and 3.21, respectively. Constraint 3.22 restricts the committed energy amount of the farm for a settlement 
period t to be less than or equal to WFP.  
 
In the structure where the BESS is not integrated into this farm, the efficiency for energy delivered to the grid is still 
𝜂𝜂𝑔𝑔 . The committed energy  amount of the farm for a settlement period t in the DAM is equal to the sales volume that the 
farm bid previous day for this period. Installed power capacity recorded in the facility's license represents the maximum 
power generation that the farm can carry out so the forecasted wind generation is less than or equal to this capacity.  𝑚𝑚𝑙𝑙 
is determined as an appropriate value to not violate the constraint 3.22. DAM payments are made 2 days after the date 
the energy is supplied to the grid, while payments related to imbalance and YEKDEM occur in the 3rd week of the 
following month. The time value of money is not considered for these cash flows in the analysis as it makes the model 
overly complex. While examining Case 1, all 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡
𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 values are zero along the analysis period. When switched to Case 2 
analysis,  𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡
𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 values change and they are determined according to the equation 3.4. In reality,  𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡
𝑢𝑢 and 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡
𝑠𝑠 cannot be 
positive values simultaneously for any settlement period t. However, there is no need to assign a binary variable to model 
this situation. Within the framework of the current market dynamics, two different situations may occur: either 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡
𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝  is a 
non-negative value while 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡
𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛  is greater than it, or 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡
𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝  and 𝐶𝐶𝑡𝑡
𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛  are both zero for the time t . Since the goal is to 
maximize Equation 3.6, in the first situation, the model solution tends not to assign positive values to both 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡
𝑢𝑢 and 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡
𝑠𝑠  
simultaneously at time t thus only one of them can be positive. For the second situation, it is not important if the solution 
assigns positive values to both 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡
𝑢𝑢 and 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡
𝑠𝑠  simultaneously at time t, as this does not affect the profit amount and does not 
cause a deviation from reality. It is not desired for the battery to be charged and discharged at the same time  in a settlement 
period t, thanks to the nature of the presented system, using a binary variable is not necessary to achieve this. When the 
generated energy goes to the battery and then supplied to the grid by it, this energy suffers more losses compared to being 
directly supplied to the grid without using the battery. Additionally, battery usage also incurs a cost. Due to the 
maximization of profit as the objective and the nature of the imbalance costs, the model solution tends not to give positive 
values to  𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡
𝑐𝑐 and 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡
𝑑𝑑 simultaneously at time t.   
 
While finding the battery cycle life and DOD relationship for the li-ion batteries, for each cycle battery SOC level is 
reduced to (1-DOD) from the fully charged state and then battery is fully charged for the experiment, but in our model, 
for specified DOD limit and 𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 battery SOC level  can change in the interval between 𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 and (𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚+DOD) and dept 
of  discharged or charged energy in a cycle can be less than or equal to DOD limit, but these differences with the 
experimental conditions are not considered since with the model assumptions, the battery SOC level can be kept at 
healthier ranges for the battery compared to SOC level between 1 and  (1-DOD) in the experiment and the charge and 
discharge depth is allowed to remain below DOD, that may affect battery lifetime throughput better compared to cycles 
with DOD. 
 
4. Conclusion  
Market price fluctuations and imbalance costs make energy storage systems a preferable option for the power 
generation facilities. These storage systems can be more meaningful, especially for the intermittent RESs. Within the

scope of this study, an onshore wind farm in Turkey that participates DAM under the YEKDEM is examined. A 
nonlinear optimization model (NLP)  that includes degradation cost terms of the battery is proposed to maximize the 
profit of the wind farm by determining optimal BESS capacity and operational management for the different market 
participation scenarios. The model results can show the extent to which the committed energy amount can deviate 
from the forecasted wind generation (after loss) and real wind generation (after loss) in the presence of a BESS to 
increase the profit. This model can determine which market participation scenario is more advantageous, as well as 
analyze how the profit will change for the different DOD limits specified.

Abstract 
Predictive maintenance shows significant impact in maintaining and monitoring the utility systems at commercial 
buildings. Here in this research paper, the predictive maintenance that is in line with Industry 4.0 is applied. The 
chilled water system is highlighted in this research and the main goal is to reach out the most occurred faults in one 
of the chilled water system components, which is the chiller. An engineering management framework was used 
through three parts, set up, machine learning, and quality control. One of the most accurate machine learning 
algorithms, which is the decision tree algorithm, is applied in this research and prediction model showed high 
prediction accuracy. During an empirical period, the most occurred faults were refrigeration leak, low condenser flow, 
and high condenser temperature. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
In commercial buildings or huge facilities, business work fills most personnel’s time and occupies staff or manpower, 
who spend most of their business day inside these buildings, so we can say that these buildings or facilities make up 
a sizable portion of the built environment for the people. Common-sense drives the stakeholders or owners to take 
care of these buildings; in order to avoid any negative impact on the surrounding or the internal environment of these 
buildings. Commercial buildings are not same from city to city, and they could be massive or regular ones such as 
universities, offices buildings, shopping malls, hotels, factories, compounds, hypermarkets, etc., and they are covering 
most of the land areas in the cities. The University of Michigan (2020) mentioned that commercial buildings’ floor 
spaces are foreseen to encompass 124.7 billion square feet by 2050, which is a thirty-four percent increase from 2019. 
Globally, the number of commercial buildings has rapidly increased and require significant attention from a 
maintenance management point of view (Hauashdh et al, 2022). In the author view, the commercial buildings are 
obviously playing a significant role in the communities, as they can enhance people’s social life and can generate 
more jobs. However, they are approximately consuming up to forty percent of the total global energy demand (Kumar 
et al, 2016). Moreover, one of the biggest challenges that commercial buildings are facing is the climate change. 
Monge-Barrio and Gutierrez (2018) indicated that climate change has a significant impact on such buildings. 
Furthermore, climate change should be predicted to have a strong effect on the energy requirements of commercial 
buildings, as their heating and cooling needs are highly related to temperature conditions and weather variations (Yau 
and Hasbi, 2013). In addition, activities in such buildings contribute to a major share of global environmental concerns 
(Urge-Vorsatz et al, 2013). These challenges should motivate any facility manager or engineer to take valid actions 
toward building performance improvement and maintenance, as well as looking after the associated operation and 
maintenance costs. This should be performed as commercial buildings are increasingly equipped with sophisticated 
engineering facilities, as well, such as Heat, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment or machines (Lai

6. Conclusion 
This paper utilised a managerial framework of predictive maintenance 4.0 for chilled water systems in commercial 
buildings. A particular chilled water system was chosen for an empirical study. The component is the chiller, and the 
goal of the study is to identify the most occurred faults during the associated period. The framework contains three 
parts, which are set up, machine learning, and quality control. The main objective of the set-up part is the data 
collection, and the main objective of the machine learning part is the training the prediction model and testing it, while 
the main objective of the quality control part is to evaluate the prediction model and to make sure the performance is 
acceptable.  
Having said machine learning, decision tree algorithm has been used in this paper and one the universities in 
Riyadh city, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has been chosen to implement the empirical study. The prediction accuracy 
for the prediction model is high, which is 98.50 percent, and the prediction model showed an outstanding performance 
in predicting the faults and accordingly in finding the most occurred faults, which are obviously having a negative

impact on the cooling tower performance. The most occurred faults during the said empirical period were refrigeration 
leak, low condenser flow, and high condenser temperature. By looking at the literature, it can be seen that few research 
has focused on these faults and the future research agenda can be in this part, so the researchers are advised to do 
further research on these three faults.

Abstract 
Globally, many industries are using lean manufacturing concept in their production system to identify and eliminate 
the waste and to support customers value. Especially, automotive, manufacturing, healthcare, service sectors and many 
others have embraced lean principles. This study aims to interpret application of Lean techniques in various industries 
especially in energy sectors. In order to evaluate the application of lean, this paper aims to explain importance of lean 
manufacturing in the context of energy sectors transformation into lean process and giving example of implementation 
of lean manufacturing in one of the energy sectors. A case study example from an energy sector company is also 
presented as a part of the study. This research was conducted by reviewing published peer review literatures and 
articles through using resource from university library. Based on the findings of this research, industries leaning 
towards Lean manufacturing are producing goods efficiently and cost-effectively, achieving financial goals and 
customer satisfaction.

1. Introduction
According to American Society for Quality (ASQ), Lean is defined as a set of management practice to improve 
efficiency and effectiveness by eliminating waste. Its core principle is to reduce and eliminate nonvalue added waste 
as well as activities (ASQ, 2024). As described in the book The Machine That change the world (Womack, J et al., 
1990), Lean manufacturing (production), is the concept that was introduced by the Japanese at Toyota production 
system in 1930. 
The concept of lean production differs for different organization but underlying same principal with removing or 
minimizing all non-value-added activities and waste from business. Industries has seen lot of revolution over the past 
decade and the concept of lean process has been through a dramatic evolution. Lean techniques help industrial 
manufacturers to reduce eight different types of waste also known as “DOWNTIME” such defects are overproduction, 
waiting, unused talent, transportation, inventory, motion, and extra processing. Any organization which targets to 
introduce lean helps in all directions, quality of product, service, reducing production cost and overall employee 
satisfaction with working conditions. The basic principles of lean are determining value of product, VSM (value 
stream Mapping) of a product, Continuous flow, pulling the value from customers, and continuous improvement

As explained in Figure 3, VCC process main objectives and principles outline are as follows: 
• 
For workplace design, suitable analysis to be performed for establishment of current or proposed operating 
process.  
• 
For work measurement, eliminates wasteful activities wherever is possible.  
• 
For standard working practices, maximize ability to restructure practices.  
• 
For correct working method, make work environment safe, comfortable, and systematically efficient.  
• 
For minimizing waste, uses of error prevention methods to remove possible cause of defects.  
• 
For actual capacity declared, implement of visual management to instant expose of non-conformance. 
  
4. Conclusion and Discussion 
Lean manufacturing process has a lot of benefits and can applied in every industry. The method cannot only be in 
manufacturing or energy sectors, it can be applied in any business-like banking, educational, constructions, software’s 
development, retail, healthcare, logistics and distribution and so on (Lopes, 2023). Lean industries sectors can have 
benefits from various important ways, there is no right or wrong method to improve your organization or operations. 
It all depends on what and how you want to focus on your business. Does customer values important to your business? 
Where you want to take your business? At the end, it all depends on your business goals and plans. Absolutely, there 
are many applications of lean methodology, as all the different studies performed earlier, the use of lean application 
has an advantage and has helped many industries. The main goal of lean method is to reduce waste to an absolute 
minimum.    
 
 In essence, application of lean manufacturing in energy sectors has been widely used. Its benefits lead various energy 
industries into cost reduction techniques in manufacturing process. To implement lean into business, that authority 
always belongs to stake holders or decision makers. Many big corporations are using lean methodology in their 
manufacturing process and doing lot of trainings programs to support other industry to achieve same results as they 
did. Lean implementation is a long process and results takes time, only applying lean techniques will not give you 
success right away. The progress takes time and adjustment will require within your company so, to get full benefit 
from it, change mindset and proper planning for these effects is needed. One question is, are you ready to implement 
lean principles if you have not done yet, one thing to keep in mind is, implementing lean and its principle to your 
business is the commitment.

Abstract 
The transportation of hazardous materials and valuables, exemplified by cash-in-transit, poses significant risks. 
Valuables transportation is prone to robbery, while hazmat transport faces accidents and potential material release, 
endangering the populace and the environment. This paper emphasizes the importance of researching risk mitigation 
in this domain, highlighting recent scholarly insights. It identifies research gaps, including the need for enhanced risk 
assessment models and the consideration of multimodal transportation. The manuscript advocates for interdisciplinary 
collaboration and innovative methodologies to fortify route security and minimize risks in CIT and hazmat 
transportation.

1. Introduction
The transportation of hazardous materials (hazmat) and valuables involves inherent risks, compelling stakeholders 
and researchers to devise methods to mitigate these risks and enhance route security. Hazardous materials, as defined 
by the US Department of Transportation (2022), encompass substances such as combustible, explosive, oxidizing, 
toxic, biohazard, radioactive, and corrosive materials that threaten people, properties, and the environment. Valuables 
include banknotes, coins, gold, jewelry, and special pharmaceutical items, collectively called cash-in-transit (CIT). 
CIT and the transportation of hazmat involve several types of risk: valuables are extremely susceptible to robbery, and 
hazmat transportation is vulnerable to accidents and the release of the material transported, potentially exposing the 
population and the environment to such materials. In addition, the incidents described can occur at any phase of the 
transportation process (loading, transit, and unloading), and the consequences of such incidents are catastrophic. 
Annually, tens of thousands of accidents in the transportation of hazardous materials in the US are reported, accounting 
for 0.38% of the total number of transportation accidents on highways and 5% of the accidents on railroads yearly 
(Table 1). The total damage caused by such incidents amounts to tens of millions of dollars and hundreds of injuries 
per year (Table 2), and in significant cases, accidents in hazmat transportation can cause tens of millions of dollars 
per case in damage (Table 3). Therefore, such accidents are categorized as low-probability-high-consequence events. 
Most high-consequence accidents in transporting hazardous materials are related to combustible liquids, specifically 
petroleum, gasoline, and fuel oil (U.S. Department of Transportation, 2024). It is also observed that railroad accidents

Abstract 
In the dynamic and competitive sector of carbonated beverages, manufacturers in Peru face significant challenges 
related to machine maintenance, process standardization, and defect management. These issues not only impair 
production efficiency but also impact public health and consumer satisfaction. This study introduces an integrated 
approach utilizing Lean Manufacturing methodologies—specifically 5S, Standardized Work, and Total Productive 
Maintenance (TPM)—to address these challenges. The proposed model systematically enhances the production 
processes by reducing waste, improving machine reliability, and standardizing operations to ensure consistent product 
quality. The implementation of this model in a Peruvian beverage manufacturing facility led to notable improvements: 
a reduction in the defect rate by 32%, an increase in Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) from 61% to 81%, a 
decrease in downtime by 48%, and a significant reduction in waste. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of 
Lean Manufacturing tools in transforming production environments by enhancing operational efficiency and reducing 
losses, thereby fostering a sustainable and consumer-oriented production landscape.

1. Introduction
The carbonated beverages sector plays a significant role worldwide, in Latin America and specifically in Peru. 
Carbonated beverages are widely consumed and represent an important part of the food and beverage industry. 
According to (Mialon et al., 2015), the corporate political activity of the food industry, including gasified beverages, 
can influence public health and the prevention of non-communicable diseases. In Latin America, the production and 
consumption of soft drinks have been subject to analysis, as noted by Mialon and Gomes (2019), who highlight the 
political activity of large transnational corporations in the region. In the Peruvian context, carbonated beverages are

Abstract 
This study investigates the operational delays in dumper cycle time within open pit mines, focusing on the Thar 
coalfield in Pakistan. Efficient material handling processes are crucial for optimizing productivity and cost-
effectiveness in mining operations. The dumper cycle time, encompassing loading, hauling, and dumping phases, 
directly impacts mine output and operational efficiency. This study aims to analyse these delays, identify root causes, 
and propose mitigation strategies to enhance material handling efficiency. Operational delays, including waiting times 
at loading and unloading stations, maintenance activities, and traffic congestion, are identified and analysed. Haul 
route interchange delays emerge as a major contributor to overall operational delays, emphasizing the importance of 
efficient traffic control and haul route design. The study underscores the implications of addressing operational delays 
for enhancing operational efficiency, reducing costs, and maximizing resource utilization in open pit mines. Overall, 
this research contributes to the understanding of material handling efficiency in open pit mining operations and 
provides valuable insights for improving operational performance and sustainability in the Thar coalfield, Pakistan.

1. Introduction
Open pit mining operations are complex and dynamic environments characterized by large-scale excavation activities 
to extract valuable minerals or resources from the earth's surface (Pathan et al. 2022). In such operations, the efficiency 
of material handling processes, particularly the loading, hauling, and dumping of ore or waste material, plays a critical 
role in overall productivity and cost-effectiveness (Shaikh et al. 2022). Among the key components of these processes, 
the dumper cycle time - the time taken for a dumper truck to complete a full cycle from loading to dumping - is a vital 
performance metric that directly impacts mine output and operational efficiency (Arputharaj 2015; Bölükbaşsi et al. 
1991). Figure 1 illustrates the dumper cycle in open pit mines. 
The optimization of dumper cycle time is essential for maximizing the utilization of mining equipment and resources 
while minimizing operational costs. However, achieving optimal cycle times can be challenging due to various factors 
that contribute to operational delays and inefficiencies (Afrapoli et al. 2019; Anani and Awuah-Offei 2017).

haul routes. Therefore, proper traffic control and haul route design strategies must be used to overcome this delay. 
Additionally, the waiting time of dumpers in queue at the loading point is a major operational delay associated with 
dumper operations directly. Accurate deployment of dumpers is important to reduce the delays associated with the 
queuing of dumpers at loading stations. 
 
5. Conclusion 
A This study is focused on the operational delays in dumper cycle time in open pit mines in Thar coalfield, Pakistan. 
Through a comprehensive examination of cycle time components and operational delays, several key findings emerge: 
 
i) 
The study identifies various operational delays affecting dumper cycle time, including waiting times at 
loading and unloading stations, shift change times, maintenance activities, and traffic congestion at haul 
route intersections. Among these, haul route interchange delays emerge as the most significant 
contributor to overall operational delays. 
 
ii) The results underscore the importance of haul route design and layout in minimizing operational delays. 
Efficient traffic control measures and optimization of haul road infrastructure are essential for reducing 
congestion and improving material flow throughout the mining operation. 
 
iii) The study highlights the importance of accurate deployment strategies for dumpers to mitigate delays 
associated with queuing at loading stations. Effective coordination and scheduling of equipment 
movements are crucial for optimizing material handling processes and minimizing idle times. 
 
iv) Addressing operational delays in dumper cycle time has significant implications for enhancing 
operational efficiency, reducing production costs, and maximizing resource utilization in open pit 
mines. By implementing targeted strategies to mitigate delays and improve cycle time performance, 
mining companies can enhance their competitive edge and sustainability. 
 
The findings of this study contribute to the body of knowledge on material handling efficiency in open pit mining 
operations. By addressing operational delays and implementing targeted strategies for optimizing dumper cycle time, 
mining companies can improve their overall operational performance and sustainability in the dynamic and 
challenging environment of open pit mining. 
 
Future research endeavours should focus on further exploring the root causes of operational delays and evaluating the 
effectiveness of specific mitigation strategies in different mining contexts. Additionally, advancements in technology, 
such as the integration of automation and real-time monitoring systems, offer promising avenues for enhancing 
material handling efficiency and productivity in open pit mines in Thar, Pakistan.

Abstract 
There are three elements to route decisions: availability of route network data include real-time updates, scalable 
approaches to solving capacity-constrained routing, and real-time solutions. A fourth-dimension that runs through 
these three elements is the visualization of the routes that sufficient fidelity to help the first respondents under the 
adequacy of the model. This paper proposes tools to validate routing modeling and support emergency evacuation 
decisions through visualization. We propose a simple route visualization VBA code in ArcGIS, and provide both 
individual and collective path visualizations.

1. Introduction
Geographic information systems (GIS) have proven to be an integral tool in addressing the needs of transportation 
managers. GIS has provided an efficient means for organizing basic transportation related data in order to facilitate 
the input, analysis, and display of transport networks. While these basic objects are necessary for virtually all 
transportation applications, they are not sufficient for any comprehensive management or planning process. It has 
become increasingly obvious that a much wider range of transportation related objects are essential for advanced 
transportation planning and management tasks.  
In the geographic information system (GIS), the basic building blocks of geometric networks are edges (geometric 
lines) and junctions (geometric points). Edges are constrained to always begin and end at junctions. Edges are 
undirected but in a directed transportation network, an edge is called an arc. A junction can have many edges 
attached to it. A path in a graph in a network flow models is composed of nodes and edges or arcs (arcs if it is a 
directed network), where an arc connects two adjacent nodes. The interrelation between nodes and arcs can, for 
instance, be described by the node-arc incidence matrix. In the representation of a building and road networks 
outside the buildings, nodes may represent rooms, or intersection points (on corridors or roads), while arcs can be 
used to model corridors, stairways, roads or a connection between two intermediate nodes. Hence, this evacuation 
problem can be modeled as a multi-source multi-destination network flow problem. For pedestrian evacuation, 
travel time on any edge or arc of the network must consider walking speed. 
Data preparation begins with the use of a GIS-software such as ArcGIS to read the building and road network files 
in their native format, to convert them to shape file format. Shape files are based on geometry type: point, line, 
multipatch, and polygon. These files contain data in 2D for each floor on a separate file. We only use the point data 
which represent nodes such as rooms, and line data which represent edges/pathways such as corridors, and stairways 
in buildings. Another shapefile is extracted for the campus; this file contains data, also in 2D, for the road network 
outside the building. Data from shape files must be converted to three text files format that the evacuation route 
planning approaches can use to convert to node-arc-incidence matrix, node files, and edge files. A GIS database is

6. Conclusion 
The objective of this research is to define and visualize optimal individual evacuation routes for the evacuation and 
determine an approximate minimum time required for the evacuation according to capacity constraints. For 
illustration, the research addressed the problem of finding and visualizing evacuation paths from a small evacuation 
network on food. The working code developed in ArcGIS using VBA and ArcObjects is limited to 2-dimensional 
routes visualization that can be implemented only for individual floors. Multiple floors building require 3-

Abstract 
The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to achieve supply chain integration (SCI) has been considered 
a hot topic in recent years. Through a systematic literature review in the context of supply chain management, this 
article aims to review IoT and its role in achieving SCI, as well as to provide new directions for future research. The 
principal objective of this article is to categorize scholarly articles that examine the utilization of IoT in the supply 
chain to achieve SCI in different sectors. The selection and refinement process identified a total of 133 articles. After 
removing duplicates and after the screening stage, the number reached 35 studies. These 35 studies were analyzed by 
introduction, primary results, and conclusions in the assessment stage. Finally, of those 35 studies, 26 were selected 
to be thoroughly examined for this review of the literature. The literature underscores the pivotal role of Internet 
technology in achieving SCI and finds solutions based on different industry sectors with appropriate research 
questions.

1. Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) has been recognized as a breakthrough advancement in information technology (S. M. 
Ali et al., 2023) enabling the digital connection of embedded information and communication technology systems and 
facilitating the networking of objects and devices through the Internet, providing the possibility of data collection and 
transmission (Ande et al., 2020; T. de Vass et al., 2018; Tavana, 2023). Therefore, such networks and systems become 
more intelligent as they can be monitored, controlled, and executed remotely (Alabdulatif et al., 2023). IoT, the link 
of the interconnection of all things, represents an extension of Internet capabilities, fostering innovation and integration 
within supply chain systems and networks (Ardito et al., 2019). By facilitating the exchange and sharing of information 
among supply chain participants, IoT is a contributing factor in the modernization of supply chain operations, 
underscoring its theoretical and practical significance (Colicchia et al., 2019; Yang and Wang, 2021). 
Supply chains serve as interconnected networks comprising multiple entities spanning upstream, midstream, and 
downstream sectors, with manufacturing enterprises at their core (Xia et al., 2023). In today's globalized economy, 
continuous supply chain integration (SCI) is crucial for businesses to stay competitive, meet customer demands, and 
improve operational performance (Tiwari, 2021). As a result, integration is bound to become an inevitable and 
unavoidable requirement for supply chain development (Munir et al., 2020). In addition, SCI aims to link all supply 
chain participants by optimizing visibility, traceability, interoperability, and collaboration, thereby maximizing supply 
chain and firm performance (I. Ali et al., 2023; de Vass et al., 2021). 
Applying IoT technology in SCI entails leveraging existing infrastructure and application systems to enhance 
integration, visualization, and intelligence within supply chain systems (de Vass et al., 2021). IoT facilitates increased

Abstract 
Several extensions of conventional fuzzy sets have been introduced, including neutrosophic, intuitionistic, and 
Pythagorean fuzzy sets. These extensions aim to enhance the explicit and informative definition of decision-makers' 
judgments by incorporating membership functions with three distinct dimensions. A recent addition to the realm of 
ordinary fuzzy sets is the development of SFSs (Spherical Fuzzy Sets), which are characterized by generalized three-
dimensional structures. SFSs represent one of the latest advancements in extensions such as neutrosophic, intuitionistic 
fuzzy, and Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Given that decision-making is a daily activity, often involving the selection of the 
best candidate from multiple options, MCDM (Multi-Criteria Decision Making) methods have been designed to 
address the challenges. This study focuses on utilizing the SF-COPRAS (Spherical Fuzzy Complex Proportional 
Assessment) MCDM method to evaluate hazardous waste management problems within a GDM (Group Decision 
Making) framework. The hazardous waste disposal problem is assessed with five alternatives and six criteria to 
showcase the applicability and validity of the developed SF-COPRAS approach.

1. Introduction
For a considerable time, understanding the full extent of the harmful impacts stemming from industrial emissions, 
chemical discharges into water bodies, and pollution from solid waste has been elusive. However, by the late 1990s, 
safeguarding natural resources and the environment emerged as prominent concerns both domestically and globally. 
Hence, in today's environmentally conscious world, there is an expectation for corporations to prioritize environmental 
protection alongside their industrial development endeavors. (Büyüközkan et al. 2019). Nevertheless, the disposal of 
hazardous wastes poses significant challenges. These wastes can be explosive, flammable, self-combustible wastes 
emitting flammable gases in contact with water, oxidizing, organic peroxide containing, toxic, corrosive, toxic gas in 
contact with air and water, toxic and eco-toxic waste. Hazardous Waste Management encompasses short and long-
term programs and policies designed to ensure the environmentally responsible management of such wastes. 
The COPRAS method is also an MCDM method that can evaluate quantitative and qualitative criteria. The COPRAS 
method consists of evaluating and sorting alternatives in terms of importance and utility. The criterion values are used

5. Conclusion 
The primary goal of this study is to identify the most suitable candidate for addressing a hazardous waste disposal 
problem through the consideration of a set of evaluation criteria. Evaluating candidates involves the scrutiny of various 
qualitative and quantitative criteria. MCDM techniques serve as scientific methodologies capable of assessing both 
qualitative and quantitative criteria simultaneously. Consequently, COPRAS, a distance-based MCDM method, has 
been employed to evaluate alternative hazardous waste disposal sites. The process of selecting the optimal hazardous 
waste disposal site requires a careful consideration of decision criteria, a task accomplished through a literature review 
and input from three DMs. 
 
The SFS COPRAS MCDM method is then applied to assess and rank all candidate sites based on the identified 
attributes. The selection of the SFS environment serves as an objective framework for evaluation and ranking, chosen 
for its ability to handle imprecise and vague data effectively. This method is particularly useful in addressing 
uncertainty in complex decision problems. To validate the developed approach, a practical case study is presented. 
Looking ahead, future research aims to extend the application of this method to diverse sectors. Additionally, 
upcoming studies may involve comparing the results of these alternatives with other fuzzy logic-based MCDM 
approaches.

Abstract 
There have been major changes in air transport. A new era called Aviation 4.0 has begun with the rise of contemporary 
digital technologies such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things. This has resulted in efficiency, security, 
lower costs, digitization, operational efficiency and customer experience. Aviation 4.0, dominated by digitization and 
digital transformation, has become a time of radical change. One of these changes can be seen in customers, who are 
the backbone of the industry. Digital technologies have completely changed customer expectations, behavior and 
perceptions of service quality. Classic service quality has given way to digital service quality (DSQ). Therefore, the 
purpose of this research is to strategically analyze DSQ from the perspective of Aviation 4.0. Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy 
Process (FAHP) is used to prioritize DSQ criteria. A case study has been conducted in Turkish aviation industry to 
validate the study.

1. Introduction
The industry 4.0 revolution, which was initially seen as a technology experiment with the developments in technology, 
later became a necessity (Büyüközkan et al., 2020a). Industry 4.0 has become one of the most essential concepts in 
both the global industry and the world economy and it encircles developing and integrating innovative information 
and communication technologies in the industry (Drljača et al., 2020). Industry 4.0 has gone beyond being a trend and 
started to take place in the strategic plans of companies (PWC, 2016). Encouragement of intelligent networking of 
processes and products along the entire supply chain is the primary goal of Industry 4.0 (Drljača et al., 2020). This 
way, organizational processes can be used efficiently to create goods and services, and offering new products and 
services provides enhancement of customer benefit (Drljača et al., 2020). 
This industrial revolution and the technological developments that triggered this revolution brought along digital 
transformation. The industry 4.0 revolution and digital transformation have caused radical changes all over the world.

5. Conclusion and Perspective 
The aviation industry is critical for the national economy as well as for the global economy. The aviation industry, 
which has made significant developments in recent years, is witnessing a new revolution called aviation 4.0 with the 
effect of digital transformation. The main purpose of this digital technology-based transformation is to provide more 
benefits to customers. At this point, the service quality perception of digitalized customers with today's digital world 
has radically changed. This is also true for the aviation industry. Companies that are the players of the aviation industry 
need a roadmap in such a transformation journey. It has become more important than ever to determine the critical 
points that companies should consider for their digital service quality performance. A high digital service quality 
performance means customer satisfaction and being able to compete in the market is only possible by meeting the 
demands and expectations of the customers in the best way and gaining their loyalty. For this reason, strategic analysis 
of digital service quality is aimed in this study. To make industrial comments and check the validity, the study was 
applied to a real case in the Turkish aviation industry. To prioritize digital service quality elements and calculate their 
weights, the AHP method, which is used extensively in the aviation industry, was preferred. Due to the complexity of 
real-life problems, the uncertainty involved in the decision-making processes carried out by DMs, and human 
perception, the classical AHP method has been extended to the fuzzy environment and applied as FAHP methodology.

The validation of the results obtained by industrial experts (DMs) revealed that the MCDM approach and FAHP 
methodology used were advantageous. 
In future studies, a new model can be proposed. The existing digital service quality model can be rearranged and 
improved. The number of DMs can be increased. More complex fuzzy set extensions and different integrated MCDM 
methods can be used. Sensitivity and scenario analysis can be performed. The obtained result can be compared.

Abstract 
The present work aims to present possibilities for the innovation process of activities developed by the graphic 
industry in Brazil, using augmented reality technology (AR). A literature review was carried out and two methods 
were used to collect data: a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The first method was the 
elaboration and application of a survey questionnaire among representatives of companies in the Brazilian printing 
industry. The other method used was the development of semi-structured interviews between representatives of 
technology companies in Brazil specializing in AR technology. The results of the work present the data obtained 
with the methods used for data collection. The results obtained from the survey questionnaire indicated that the 
application of augmented reality in printed products is a resource little explored by the printing industry in Brazil. 
The technology companies participating in the study had a consensus about the possible offering of all technical 
support necessary for the functionality of AR technology. The researchers believe that the results obtained in this 
work consolidate relevant information about possibilities for innovation in the activities carried out by the 
Brazilian printing industry.

1. Introduction
The printing industry began with the advent of letterpress printing led by Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th 
century. From then on, there was a systematic development in the process of transmitting information, which 
enabled the democratization of knowledge on an unprecedented scale. Currently, the process of transmitting 
information using resources such as computers and other devices connected to the internet is almost instantaneous. 
The contemporary challenge for the printing industry has become to justify the importance and need for printed 
products in a global context with high use of digital resources. After the spread of the internet and its application 
in corporate and domestic environments, relationships between people began to migrate from analog to digital 
contexts. Over the last decade, it has been possible to observe the widespread use of smartphones in several 
nations, a process that is still constantly growing. This process is causing drastic changes in people's relationships 
with the media and is related to the knowledge of how to perform specific tasks. Considering current business, 
companies should not remain isolated when negotiating goods and services but rather interact among participants 
throughout the production process in the search for better results (Webb and Romano 2017). 
The development of digital technologies, which occurred with greater emphasis from the last decades of the 20th 
century, has enabled the creation of new business models to produce goods and services. In this context, even 
traditional companies specializing in analog technologies could innovate their production processes by increasing 
digital resources. Digitalization is one of the main factors that will direct a large part of production processes

The class (7-magenta) was titled: Attractive Factors for Public Engagement with AR Technology in Brazil. The 
analysis of the textual content belonging to this class of words made it possible to verify the greater emphasis on 
the following statements by the interviewees: the need for understanding, on the part of those responsible for 
creating content, about the user's perception in the process of applying AR technology; need for creativity to 
generate added value to the content linked to AR applications, considering the offer of products and services; need 
for general public perception of the potential of AR technology as a factor for innovation in production processes; 
need for user maturity regarding the use of AR technology; creation of marketing strategies to encourage user 
behavior to disseminate the use of AR technology. Figure 7 shows the title given to the class (7-magenta) with the 
main words belonging to the class.

The results of data collection from semi-structured interviews indicated that the Brazilian market has companies 
with the necessary knowledge to develop projects involving AR technology. All companies participating in this 
stage of the research have experience in offering the creation and maintenance of the resources necessary to apply 
AR technology with printed products. The treatment of data obtained in the interviews using the IRAMUTEQ 
software indicated that there is a correlation between the activities carried out by the four participating companies. 
There was consensus among participating companies regarding the consideration of AR technology as an 
innovation resource that is still little explored by the Brazilian printing industry. Furthermore, all companies 
participating in this stage considered the prospect of growth in the use of AR in the Brazilian market, especially 
with the spread of smartphones and other mobile devices (wearables), as well as the expansion and improvement 
of broadband internet connectivity. 
 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research work aimed to present possibilities for the innovation process of activities developed by the printing 
industry in Brazil, using AR technology. The digital transformation ongoing presents technological segmentation 
called enabling technologies, among which AR is present. In this context, AR technology presents itself as an 
important resource for the innovation of various production processes currently. 
 
The bibliographical research also allowed us to verify consensus among different authors on the need to improve 
integration and communication between stakeholders involved in the printing industry's production chain. In this 
context, integration between clients (brand owners), designers, printing companies, and possibly other members 
is an essential factor for the consolidation of projects with the prospect of providing added value to printed 
products. 
 
Currently, there is increasing democratization in access to AR technology, driven by the increase in the sale of 
mobile computing devices. It was possible to identify, through the research data collection instruments, that the 
application of AR technology has the prospect of growth in the Brazilian market. 
 
The results obtained through the survey questionnaire indicated that the application of AR in printed products is 
a resource that is still little explored by the printing industry in Brazil. Participants, in general, stated that there is 
a considerable demand for the use of AR technology as an alternative for innovation in projects for the creation 
and production of printed products. 
 
The technology companies participating in the study had a consensus about the possible offering of all technical 
support necessary for the functionality of AR technology. However, in general, there was a consensus among the 
participating companies that the applications of AR technology in printed products should preferably be associated

with the possibility of adding value to the services linked to these products. The results allow consider that 
technology companies, specializing in the development of AR resources, can configure a new stakeholder in the 
production chain involving printing production in Brazil. 
 
The triangulation of the results obtained in this study allows the consolidation of relevant information about 
possibilities for innovation in activities developed by the Brazilian printing industry through the integration 
between traditional printed products (promotional prints, publishing, packaging) and digital resources (augmented 
reality).  
 
It is important to highlight that the development of this research took place between 2020 and 2022, a period in 
which restrictive measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic made research activities considerably difficult. 
 
Possible research to complement this study could use the case study method, to verify the application of AR 
resources in printed products already consolidated in the market. This verification would be useful for identifying 
possible changes in the results of the commercialization of printed products, after the application of AR resources 
as an alternative for incremental innovation for these products.

Abstract 
The unsustainable practices in Ebenato Town, Nnewi South Local Government Area, have created a devastating 
environmental challenge. The study was aimed at investigating the major reasons for the escalation of the gully site 
using approaches such as geographic information system (GIS), field mapping, and laboratory analysis. Field studies 
showed that the area is underlain by a porous sandstone ridge, making it susceptible to gully erosion processes. Two 
factors such as natural and anthropogenic factors played major role in the widening of the gully. The natural factors 
includes climate, vegetation, topography, and geology. However, key anthropogenic factor can be attributed to the 
dumping of municipal solid wastes (MSW). These wastes impact the various water resources negatively especially 
the river which contain some heavy metals following the water quality analysis. The other sources such as spring and 
borehole requires proper treatment due to the presence of coliform bacteria and E.coli. Indiscriminate disposal of 
wastes in the gully should be discouraged to ensure that the water body is free from contaminants and fit for 
consumption. Furthermore, we recommend that ridges for cultivation can be made across slope, establishment of 
legislation and fines to checkmate the rate of compliance will increase sustainable practices.

1. Introduction
The nations of sub-Saharan Africa are facing challenging environmental degradation resulting in desert encroachment, 
drought, and soil deterioration due to either wind impact or very high-intensity rainfall resulting in heavy runoff and 
soil loss. The problems have adversely impacted agricultural productivity and thus heaved mistrust in food protection 
in the zone. The ecological and anthropogenic systems are disturbed, leading to losses in human and material capital. 
Igwe (2012), opined that the most significant hazard to the environment of south-eastern Nigeria is the incremental 
but steady degradation of the landmass by water. Although the nascent stages of soil erosion through rain drop or 
splash, sheet, rill, and are efficiently controlled by individuals through suggested soil conservation techniques, the 
gully forms have assumed a different dimension such that concessions and scarce arable land are in danger. However, 
it is essential to know that gully erosion concerns have become a hot potato among soil scientists, ecologists,

The hardness, pH, magnesium, nitrate, chloride, iron, hardness, and total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations are 
within the WHO permissible range. However, the biological analysis showed that the three samples have coliform 
bacteria and E-coli present. Their presence all samples not potable and unfit for consumption. However, if they have 
to be consumed by the locals, it is also necessary to filter out the bacterial concentration by cleaning the water outlets 
from the springs regularly, identifying and fixing borehole problems by flushing, and adding chlorine for a short 
period. This is a sustainable practice to ensure that the SDG-6 is met and fulfilled. Further analysis as observed in 
Table 3 above, showed that concentration of heavy metals in the spring and borehole meets the WHO standards while 
it was observed that most of the heavy metals showed higher concentration than the WHO permissible range for the 
river sample. This also indicates that dumping of materials rich in heavy metals near these water sources especially 
the river should be discouraged and restricted. There should also be full enactment of laws by the environment 
protection agency in Anambra State to ensure compliance. Organization of sensitization campaigns should be 
encouraged, and fines should be paid for non-compliant practices.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The integration of GIS in identifying the position of the study area, helped us to understand and better visualize the 
natural situations prevalent in the study area. From the studies carried out, Ebenato town is situated on a porous 
sandstone ridge, this makes it susceptible to gullying due to the weak nature of the substratum. Natural and 
anthropogenic factors played major role in the widening of the gully, however, the unsustainable practices by the 
locals such as making ridges along slope gave a leeway to the devastation experienced in the town today. Other 
unsustainable practices like dumping of municipal solid wastes (MSW) in the gully has an impact in the water 
resources, especially the Ofala River which showed presence of heavy metals. It is recommended that the locals should 
quit indiscriminate disposal of wastes in the gully and make their ridges for cultivation across slope. These two 
practices will promote sustainability once there is strict compliance. Establishing legislation and enacting fines will 
checkmate the rate of compliance.

Abstract 
This study focused on analyzing the prospective diffusion of ISO standards in the context of Bangladesh. The popular 
ISO standards in Bangladesh are ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 45001 and ISO 22000. Grey Forecasting model was 
employed to analyze the future diffusion. Relative growth rates and major industrial sectors for these standards were 
also identified as of the year 2021. The ISO survey published on its official website was used as the main source of 
data. The findings illuminate the possibility of increased diffusion, albeit at a gradual pace. Textiles and textile 
products have been a major industrial sector for ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certification. Notably, ISO 9001 
and ISO 14001 exhibit significant growth compared to other standards. As of 2030, Bangladesh is expected to have 
obtained 1261, 834, 7156, and 66 certifications for ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO 45001, and ISO 22000, respectively. 
Organizations might be beneficial from this study in case of policy development and business decisions. This study 
will offer valuable insights to open new avenues for further study in the context of Bangladesh. Furthermore, 
methodological insights gained through employing Grey Forecasting Model may be applicable to other developing 
economies.

1. Introduction
Businesses in today's globalized world constantly battle to keep a competitive edge. To thrive in this environment, 
many companies are actively seeking effective business solutions (Casadesús and Karapetrovic 2005). These 
organizations are concerned with satisfying both their customers and stakeholders by delivering top-quality products 
and services, considering the environmental impact and health hazards of their employees.  In this intricate context of 
priorities, ISO standards have emerged as a cornerstone for minimizing trade barriers on a global scale. By adhering 
to ISO standards, businesses can streamline their operations, reduce costs, and minimize risks, making them more 
competitive in the global market. Moreover, these standards facilitate international trade by harmonizing regulations 
and fostering trust between trading partners, ultimately promoting economic growth and innovation on a global scale. 
In an increasingly interconnected world, ISO standards are indispensable in driving businesses towards excellence 
and bolstering their ability to thrive in a highly competitive global marketplace. In addition to economic benefits, these 
standards have a significant impact on society. They enhance consumer protection, encourage eco-friendly practices, 
facilitate international cooperation, and foster innovation, ultimately creating a safer, more interconnected, and 
sustainable global society. So, adoption of ISO standards has garnered widespread acceptance across public and 
private sector organizations, in both developed and developing countries, to be competitive in national and 
international markets (Mabrouk and Ibrahim 2021) (Ikram et al. 2021) (Castka and Corbett 2015) (Šolc et al. 2022) 
(Fikru 2014) (Hashem and Tann 2007) (Turk 2009) (Murmura et al. 2018) (Sambasivan and Fei 2008). ISO 9001 
certification stands as a vital tool for ensuring quality assurance within organizations and facilitating their participation 
in the expanding international trade arena, thereby satisfying stakeholders (Fonseca and Lima 2015) (Samad et al.

Abstract 
Population outburst has led to rapid urbanization and industrialization at an unprecedented scale; however, this 
has a domino effect on the menace of municipal solid waste (MSW) in the Onitsha metropolis, Anambra State. 
The methods adopted for this study were field studies and laboratory analysis. We identified households, markets, 
industries, and institutions, as the four (4) sources of MSW. Wastes includes; organic wastes (51.56%), plastic 
contents (20.67%), clothing and textile wastes (10.79%), metal scraps (9.29%), bottles (4.50%), and other wastes 
constitute (3.64%). It also showed that households contribute the highest to MSW (60.57%), while institutions 
have the lowest contribution (7.53%). Hardness, pH, magnesium, nitrate, chloride, iron, hardness, and total 
dissolved solids (TDS) are within the World Health Organization (WHO) permissible range. We noticed some 
traces of coliform and E. coli bacteria. We identified the major obstacles to proper waste management in Onitsha 
to include; readily available dump sites, poor road conditions, lack of advanced technology, non-cooperation from 
locals, low wages resulting in lack of motivation, and insufficient storage facilities. Nonetheless implementing 
optimization tactics such as conducting awareness campaigns for the community, providing job training for 
workers, enhancing access to streets and introducing automated vehicles can help surmount these challenges.

1. Introduction
The advent of civilization has seen a massive population outburst and industrialization these events have led to an 
increase in waste generation. The principal focus of this work is on municipal solid waste (MSW). MSW are 
wastes generated from municipal transactions and activities such as product packaging, grass clippings, furniture, 
clothing, bottles, food scraps, newspapers, appliances, paint, and batteries. Kalu et al., (2017) defined solid waste 
as any material from the household, business enterprises, and industrial sources arising from anthropogenic

5.5 Impediments to MSW management in Onitsha  
The impediments identified during the course of our studies includes; lack of waste storage facilities at appropriate 
sites, non-compliance of the local population, deplorable storage facilities, the absence of proper technology, and 
readily available illegal dump sites. Inefficient collection strategies, absence of waste bins in some homes, absence 
of waste bins at strategic sites, financial constraints/lack of funds, and non-payment of due sanitary levies are also 
part of the situation. Also, deplorable roads, insufficient evacuation trucks, lack of motivation from waste workers 
(due to low wages/salaries), the poor conditions of evacuation trucks, and the distance to state landfills are part of 
the current problems of MSW in the study area, leading to environmental degradation by these wastes, and the 
spread of diseases. 
 
5.6 Optimization strategies 
Waste Segregation and Reduction: The first step in optimizing wastes in the study area is to promote waste 
reduction and encourage segregation at the source (home, markets, institutions, and industries). It has to do with 
creating awareness on the importance of segregating the wastes into different classes based on their morphology. 
This goes a long way towards increasing the volume of recyclable wastes (plastics and bottles), and reducing the 
volumes of waste going to the state landfills. 
 
Waste Collection and Transportation: This involves improving the various methods of collecting and 
transporting wastes. This can be done by strategically increasing the collection points, and making available 
evacuation vehicles for timely disposal to landfills. More so, installation of GPS, and other cutting-edge 
technologies in evacuation trucks can also aid in reducing evacuation time, and optimize travel routes. 
 
Waste Recycling: This is a very important aspect of MSW management that promotes environmental 
sustainability. In the study area (Onitsha), to ensure proper optimization, it is important establish new facilities 
for solid waste management and recycling. Here the separated materials can be processed, and sold to 
manufacturers in need of these materials. This process reduces waste and creates job opportunities for the locals. 
 
Composting: This process is a very effective and optimizes organic wastes because it converts these wastes into 
fertilizers highly rich in essential nutrients, which can be used by farmers for growing their crops. Composting is 
a sustainable practice and highly recommended because organic wastes makes up a significant part of the wastes 
generated in Onitsha. 
 
Landfill Management: This one of the most important optimization strategies. In the study area (Onitsha), it is 
essential to create landfill facilities built with state-of-the-art models that comply with environmental regulations. 
A well-built and developed landfill reduces leachate from infiltrating and contaminating groundwater resources, 
and preventing air pollution. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study identified households, markets (street markets), industries, institutions, as the four (4) sources of MSW. 
The results of the analyzed samples showed that hardness, pH, magnesium, nitrate, chloride, iron, hardness, and 
TDS are within the WHO permissible range. Others constituents in calcium and bicarbonates have concentrations 
outside the permissible limit of WHO and would require appropriate treatment before consumption. Before 
drinking water with coliform bacteria, filtering is vital and can help to catch potentially harmful contaminants. 
Furthermore, Doulton Water Filters are recommended as they use specialist ceramic technology to remove 99% 
of pathogenic bacteria such as E. coli. Impediments to waste management includes; dump sites, poor road

conditions, lack of advanced technology, non-cooperation from locals, low wages resulting in lack of motivation, 
and insufficient storage facilities. Nonetheless implementing optimization tactics such as conducting awareness 
campaigns for the community providing job training for workers ensuring waste removal with covered trucks 
enhancing access to streets and residential areas and introducing automated vehicles can help surmount these 
challenges. Ultimately addressing waste management is a matter that demands attention. The identified hurdles 
must be addressed using the suggested optimization approaches to ensure waste handling. Collaboration among 
all parties is crucial, for achieving a future.

Abstract 
The Venturi Effect is a well-known phenomenon in fluid dynamics. This paper outlines a detailed study 
of various existing structures where the Venturi Effect has been used for the increase in wind speed, 
either naturally, or by design. A simple structure is proposed where the wind speed amplification can be 
achieved. The structure is modeled using SOLIDWORKS, and wind patterns are simulated using 
FloXpress. Computer simulations have been used to study the effect on wind speed because of changing 
selected parameters of the structure under study. Guidelines are proposed for selecting design parameters 
for energy efficient buildings to be used in countries where other forms of energy are either not available 
or are very expensive.

Abstract 
The development goals of the government of Pakistan underscore the implementation of renewable energy resources 
to ensure environmental improvement for the future. Affordable energy, clean energy, and innovation in infrastructure 
are the pertinent development goals applied to the energy sector. Currently, digital technologies have significant 
potential to achieve the target of the effective use of renewable energy resources in the energy sector. With this 
motivation, this research aims to highlight the significance of different digital technologies used for energy system 
controllers in the industry, playing a pivotal role in the effective and efficient use of resources. Among renewable 
energy resources, solar energy stands out as an ideal choice for a country like Pakistan. In Pakistan, the cost of energy 
is escalating day by day, posing challenges for industries to remain competitive in the international market. 
Considering the primary export-based industries in Pakistan, such as textile and leather, which require a substantial 
amount of energy to meet their continuous demand for hot water and steam, there is a need to transition their systems 
to renewable energy sources like solar energy. To optimize the efficiency of a solar thermal system, a high-speed, 
efficient, and precise controller is essential. For this purpose, an FPGA control system is a robust candidate compared 
to other controllers or microcontrollers. During this research, an FPGA-controlled system was previously designed 
for a domestic heating system, revealing that an FPGA-controlled thermal system is more economical, efficient, 
flexible, and reliable to operate than other existing systems controlled by different digital technologies. Secondly, a 
solar energy framework is designed in line with the requirements of the textile and leather industry in Pakistan, where 
water heating and steam generation systems are extensively utilized. This is achieved by designing an efficient FPGA-
based controller. The system is simulated using TRNSYS for thermal aspects, while Xilinx and Quartus are employed 
for the controller. It is specifically tailored for use in the textile and leather processing industry, particularly for water 
heating at 75℃ and steam generation at 150℃ and 220℃. A comprehensive design methodology for the water heating 
system and steam generation system is discussed, and simulation-based results are presented in this research. 
Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the water heating system and steam generation system, 
exhibiting smaller deviations for disturbances and minimum overshoot.

Abstract 
The final filtration and bottling of wine represents the last and most important stage within the entire process of its 
production and commercialization. In this context, wine is filtered to retain particles and ensure its microbiological 
and organoleptic properties. The measurement of the Laurenty index during this process helps to prevent problems in 
flow and pressure, which can increase production costs and times. However, this index can only be measured when 
the wine is ready to be bottled, and in some cases, only a few hours before bottling, which limits its usefulness for 
proper production planning. To overcome these limitations, the use of Machine Learning is proposed to estimate the 
Laurenty index from 27 physicochemical parameters through an analysis of data over 30 weeks. For this purpose, 
missing data are imputed, dimensionality is reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis 
(FA), and models are trained and evaluated using the factors during the first 24 weeks. Finally, the model with the 
highest predictive power is selected and used to evaluate the subsequent 6 weeks. This is done by comparing the direct 
application of the model on a weekly basis to its retraining, considering the data generated in the immediately 
preceding week. Finally, it is concluded that retraining the model with the new data generated in the week prior to 
prediction ensures a high level of confidence, allowing its practical use at the industrial level to plan production.

Abstract 
This paper explores the transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in optimizing the collection, integration, 
and analysis of equipment data for asset monitoring and maintenance. We delve into the technical aspects of how AI 
algorithms and architectures can streamline data acquisition from diverse sources, enable real-time data processing, 
and derive actionable insights for predictive maintenance. Case studies from manufacturing and aviation illustrate the 
tangible benefits of AI-driven data management in terms of improved equipment reliability, reduced downtime, and 
optimized maintenance costs. The paper also discusses key considerations for implementing AI solutions, including 
data quality, cybersecurity, and organizational change management. We present a comparative analysis of AI 
techniques, discuss the economic impact of AI-driven asset maintenance, and highlight the importance of human 
expertise in the loop. Finally, we outline future research directions at the intersection of AI, IoT, and blockchain for 
next-generation asset maintenance systems.

Introduction
The exponential growth of data generated by industrial equipment, coupled with the advent of AI technologies, has 
unlocked new opportunities for asset maintenance (Ucar et al., 2024). Traditional maintenance approaches rely on 
manual data collection and reactive interventions, leading to suboptimal equipment performance and increased costs 
(Diez-Olivan et al., 2019). The big data generated by the sensors, IoT devices associated with equipment exhibit high 
velocity, high variety, and high volume, making it challenging for traditional systems to evaluate quickly and to 
provide real-time insights. The high velocity of data refers to the rapid rate at which data flows from sensors and IoT 
devices, necessitating immediate processing to derive actionable insights. The high variety encompasses diverse data 
types and formats from different sensor sources, complicating integration and analysis and the high volume indicates

5. Conclusions and Future Research Directions 
The integration of AI with emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain holds immense 
potential for the future of asset maintenance. IoT devices enable the collection of vast amounts of real-time data from 
equipment, providing a rich source of information for AI models to learn from. By leveraging IoT data, AI algorithms 
can continuously improve their predictive capabilities, enabling more accurate and timely maintenance interventions. 
Additionally, blockchain technology can provide a secure and transparent platform for data sharing and enable the 
creation of decentralized, autonomous maintenance systems. These systems can automatically trigger maintenance 
actions based on predefined conditions, streamlining maintenance workflows, and reducing the need for manual 
intervention. 
 
Explainable AI is another area that holds promise for asset maintenance. Developing AI models that can provide clear 
explanations for their predictions and recommendations can increase trust and adoption among maintenance personnel. 
By understanding the reasoning behind AI-driven decisions, maintenance teams can more effectively collaborate with 
AI systems and make informed judgments. Explainable AI can also help identify potential biases or errors in the 
models, ensuring that maintenance decisions are fair and unbiased. Moreover, explainable AI can facilitate compliance 
with regulatory requirements, as organizations can provide transparent and auditable explanations for their 
maintenance actions. 
 
The integration of AI in asset monitoring and maintenance represents a significant shift in how organizations approach 
equipment data collection, analysis, and decision-making. By harnessing the power of AI, companies can transition 
from reactive to proactive maintenance strategies, optimizing resource allocation, reducing downtime, and improving 
overall equipment reliability. As organizations continue to adopt and mature their AI capabilities, approaching 
implementation with a strategic and long-term perspective is crucial, considering the technical, economic, and 
organizational factors that influence success. By embracing the transformative potential of AI and fostering a culture 
of innovation and collaboration, organizations can unlock new levels of efficiency, reliability, and performance in 
their asset maintenance operations, ultimately driving competitive advantage and business growth in the era of 
Industry 4.0.

Abstract 
Over the years, competition in the baking sector has experienced a notable increase, which has led companies to seek 
a better administrative strategy in order to achieve continuous improvements in processes, quality and productivity, 
and thus increase your competitiveness in the market. However, micro and small businesses (MSEs) face difficulties 
in achieving these objectives due to a lack of attention to continuous improvement processes. For this reason, this 
article aims to support a small baking company located in Ica, Peru. Gabo’s bakery needs to improve its productivity 
and, through a case study, methodologies such as 5S and SLP are applied. These tools are effective, adaptable and 
low-cost, and will contribute to reducing operational times, eliminating waste and improving the workspace, 
promoting habits that increase the productivity and well-being of employees. Finally, the positive influence of these 
methodologies will be evident both for ""Don Gabo "" and for other companies within the sector.

1. Introduction
In Latin America, companies seek to incorporate a better administrative planning strategy every day, with the aim of 
achieving continuous improvement in processes, quality, productivity and greater competitiveness in the market 
(Piñero, 2018). As a result of this need, a variety of programs, methods and methodologies designed to promote 
continuous improvement and optimize processes have emerged. Currently, the company selected for this study has 
inadequate storage spaces, disused materials and equipment, and operates in a messy and poorly distributed 
environment. All of this entails several drawbacks that hinder the optimization of the process and make it difficult to 
know the real level of productivity. Based on the above, an improvement proposal will be carried out, through 5S lean 
tools and systematic design planning (SLP), with the objective of demonstrating an alternative to advance the 
development of optimizing each necessary activity within production, seek a better organization of the work area and 
a correct distribution of the machines, materials and supplies to be used, avoid delays and improve the work 
environment, achieving greater satisfaction and thus being able to increase productivity in your work. 
1.1 Objectives 
To respond to the previous point, the following general objective has been established: Apply the 5S and SLP 
methodology in order to increase productivity in an MYPE located in the Province of Palpa. From this, three specific 
objectives are derived, detailed below. Firstly, an analysis of the current situation of the company will be carried out, 
in order to evaluate and identify the processes that present deficiencies. Secondly, engineering tools will be used , 
such as 5S and SLP, to find the most appropriate alternatives in continuous improvement, based on previous analyses. 
Finally, improvements will be proposed according to the methodologies with the aim of optimizing the distribution of 
the work space, order and reducing times, making the production process more fluid, efficient and circular.

Table 3. Arena Simulation Results Summary 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results of the Arena simulation (Figure 13) are detailed in Table 3. Where the reduction in time in minutes and 
hours of the process simulation is observed. Likewise, as productivity, there is a 13% increase in the quantity of bread. 
 
6. Conclusion and Discussion 
Considering the general objective of evaluating how the implementation of the 5S and SLP Methodology influences 
the productivity of the baking company, it was possible to verify, through the use of the Arena software, a notable 
reduction in production time, which is equivalent to approximately 0.58 hours, in addition, in terms of productivity, 
an increase of 13% is observed. On the other hand, thanks to the application of 5S, additional benefits were observed 
in terms of optimal reorganization. Finally, these two approaches not only improved process efficiency, but also led 
to a circular production system layout, which implies a more fluid and efficient layout, thus contributing to greater 
operational effectiveness. The viability of engineering tools in the application of small businesses in the bread 
production industry is confirmed. 
 
Given the results, we can say that like the study by Mendoza (2024) ""Proposal for the implementation of the 5s 
Improvement Methodology in a Molded Bread Production Line, the implementation of the 5s methodology in the 
present case study , resulted in an increase in productivity and resulting in a process with more order and classification.

Abstract 
In recent years, sudden developments have occurred in technology. The widespread use of digital technologies and 
digital transformation have created an environment that allows advanced technologies to be developed and accepted 
by both the public and the business world. One of today's shocking developments is the rise of artificial intelligence 
(AI) technology. AI brings with it many opportunities both socially and economically and it has an impact on almost 
many sectors. One of these sectors is the aviation industry. It is extremely important for the world economy and 
countries. Furthermore, it has a complex structure where large data sets and changing customer demands are abundant. 
The use of AI technologies in the aviation industry can provide many competitive advantages. For this reason, focusing 
on AI requirements is extremely critical. For this reason, this study aims to determine and analyze AI requirements. 
The identified requirements are analyzed in a case study in Turkey aviation industry. For this purpose, cognitive map 
(CM) approach is adopted in the study to analyze the requirements. Modeling and solving real-life problems are
complex and involve human perception that creates uncertainty. To overcome this complexity and uncertainty, the
classical CM method is applied in fuzzy environment.

1. Introduction
Recently, the transformative power and potential of artificial intelligence (AI) have attracted the attention of business 
experts in various sectors. These experts are looking for ways to stay ahead of the curve by integrating AI into business 
operations (Broderick, 2021). While AI is used to improve decision-making processes and increase customer 
experience in many industrial fields, it also provides benefits in automating routine tasks (Broderick, 2021). 
The aviation system has maintained its reputation as one of the most reliable forms of travel for decades. The autonomy 
that comes with the rise of AI technology and its integration into the aviation system in recent years requires the ability 
to be trusted by customers, employees, consumers and the public as a business or regulatory tool in the aviation

study. Results of the study shows that the AI concept in the aviation industry has a complex structure that consists of 
multiple causal relationships and the FCM method for this problem is a useful method. In addition, due to its very new 
place in aviation industry, AI concept creates uncertainty. It is seen that the used fuzzy sets can deal with this problem.  
In future studies, the number of the criteria in the system can be increased. A model concerning the AI requirements 
can be proposed. Fuzzy extensions can be employed. Scenario and sensitivity analyses can be conducted. A further 
comparative analyses can be performed. The problem can be modeled and solved by adopting the multi-criteria 
decision-making approach.

Abstract 
Existing research on university holding companies has focused on specific areas of operational and strategic 
management. However, holistic performance management remains underexplored, despite UHCs' expanding 
influence within entrepreneurial ecosystems and their critical contributions to institutional sustainability. Therefore, 
this paper aims to propose a comprehensive performance management framework tailored to ensure the operational 
effectiveness and long-term viability of university holding companies. A systematic literature review was conducted 
on 1,216 academic papers published between 1991 and 2024. This review involved a detailed search for terms related 
to the concept of university venture capital. The analysis identifies three critical components for effective management 
of university holding companies: governance structure, acceleration, and policy and support. The corporate 
governance includes a shareholder structure, a board structure, and strategy. The acceleration component comprises 
service support, training programs, and networks. Lastly, policy and support consist of investment policy, regulation, 
and performance management.

1. Introduction
The commercialization of university research has become an increasingly important issue. Beyond licensing 
intellectual property (IP) to the market (Bray and Lee 2000; Wright et al. 2004), institutions are now creating 
environments where faculty and students can transform their research into robust businesses, such as university 
spinoffs and startups (Chaipongpati et al. 2022; Neves and Brito 2020). These enterprises are potentially significant 
and increasingly founded for generating income from research commercialization (Vohora et al. 2004; Siegel et al. 
2003; Shane 2001). Additionally, they play a significant role in spurring national progression, bolstering economic 
growth (Wright et al. 2004; Yun 2020), and generating employment opportunities (Yun 2020). However, one of the 
main challenges faced by university research-based innovations is securing appropriate funding to effectively launch 
and grow new ventures (Cassar 2004). This issue is particularly critical for deep-tech university spinoffs (USOs) and 
startups, which often lack marketability as their outputs require further testing, production, and promotion. 
Consequently, many USOs never reach the stage where they are ready for external investors (Bonini and Capizzi 
2019; Thawesaengskulthai et al. 2024). This results in a funding gap at the early stages of development (Munari et al. 
2017).  
To address this issue, universities have increasingly created venture capital mechanisms to invest in university-
incubated businesses by establishing university holding companies (UHCs) (Bengtsson 2017; Ekholm and Landberg 
2022; Hussin et al. 2017; Yang and Xu 2004), or university enterprises (Cao et al. 2009; Ma 2004; Xue 2004; Zhang 
2003), or university venture capital funds (Fuster et al. 2019; Graham 2014; Lerner 2009; Wright et al. 2006). Serving 
as a bridge between the private sector and academia, UHCs catalyze co-investment partnerships essential for fostering

Abstract 
The literature review states that there is no conclusive evidence that the MBSE approach performs better compared to the 
“Document Centric” approach. Only a few references have claimed superior performance of the MBSE approach. The 
focus of our research is to analyze this issue based on a real-world example that many can relate to easily. This paper 
shows the work-in-progress of the stated research. This paper focuses on the use of the MBSE approach to estimate the 
throughput of a scaled-down serial flow line with unreliable machines and moderate buffers. The paper shows how a 
MBSE approach is used and how the stakeholders can access a “single source of truth” to make future changes that arise 
during the execution of the project. We have identified a set of KPIs in this paper that will be used for comparison when 
we compare the MBSE approach with the ”Document Centric”  approach. Our next paper will focus on the use of a 
“Document-centric” approach to solve the same problem and report performance based on the same set of KPIs reported 
in the current paper.

1. Introduction
The Methodology of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is a methodical, reliable technique to effectively 
manage and create complex systems. To serve as the ""Single Source of Truth"" for system engineering, the current study 
developed a systematic approach and methods to manage system complexity, traceability, and consistency across dif-
ferent phases in the product life cycle or different processes in the system. It also experimentally investigated the benefits 
of 
MBSE 
and 
examined 
the 
process 
complexity 
for 
a 
variety 
of 
industrial 
use 
cases. 
The approach offered by the MBSE framework allow for the design and modeling of complex systems, as well as the 
process and simulation of real-world systems to analyze gaps, challenges, process capability metrics, and Key Perfor-
mance Indicators (KPIs) to increase overall system efficiency. 
Given its significance and advantages, additional study is required to fully comprehend the benefits offered by the MBSE 
method. 
In this paper, we captured the empirical evidence of MBSE benefits by analyzing a serial production line’s performance 
KPIs. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows.

5. Conclusions and Future Research 
This paper has claimed the method for measuring the benefits added by the use of the MBSE approach and has applied 
this method to the current case study. It has shown compelling benefits so far, with the promise of more benefits in the 
next paper. 
 
Our next paper will focus on the use of a “Document-centric” approach to solve the same problem and report performance 
based on the same set of KPIs reported in the current paper. Use MBSE approach when designing complex systems with 
high traceability, consistency, and simulation requirements. 
  
5.1 Potential Benefits 
In the Current research study, we have identified the following potential benefits of MBSE modeling adoption in 
System Engineering. 
       Collaborative platform, improved communication that can automate business processes using Unified Rep-
resentation of SysML Modeling Tool 
       One-step document validation, consistency checks, and reconciliation 
       A process-focused MBSE approach and proven implementation methodology, Enhanced Traceability, Sim-
ulation & Analysis of end-to-end process & System , MBSE tools will integrate with CAD/CAE/PLM environments 
(INCOSE A  2014). 
 
Now the company is thinking about implementing & adopting of Model-based system engineering methodology & 
approach to integrating with the existing process to improve the overall process efficiency and maintain the traceability of 
the changes & identify the impact in the early phase of the product lifecycle to avoid rework, delay & additional cost 
towards overall delivery . 
 
This case study based on an explicatory example of the use of  MBSE for design synthesis is presented to demonstrate an 
important MBSE capability in the System engineering context which comprises system specification  & business re-
quirements, design, manufacturing, verification & validation & service (Friedenthal, Griego, Sampson  2007). 
 
Also, extends this paper in future to discuss further Comparative analysis with Document Centric approach & the current 
challenges of adopting the MBSE approach in the current Industry

Abstract 
The increasing worldwide adoption of solar energy motivates the need for innovative solutions to optimize the 
operations and maintenance (O&M) of solar energy systems. Soiling, i.e., the accumulation of material such as dust 
on solar photovoltaic (PV) arrays, poses a key challenge for solar operators as it can compromise the performance 
and reliability of solar energy systems. To address this challenge, we develop a machine-learning-(ML)-based in-situ 
monitoring solution in order to timely detect the occurrence of soiling events, thereby alerting operators to take 
necessary mitigation measures for the cost-effective management of their assets. First, an experimental testbed has 
been set up at the Energy Lab at Rutgers University–New Brunswick, wherein a new optical sensing technology is 
installed on an operational PV system in order to collect sensor measurements about the soiling ratio under normal 
and abnormal conditions. Then, a cluster of ML classifiers are trained on those sensor data in order to effectively dis-
entangle the random variations in soiling ratio versus systematic drops due to ongoing soiling, and finally output a 
probabilistic decision on the soling status of the PV system. Our experiments on three artificially generated soiling 
events in 2023 suggest that kernel-based models such as support vector machines–when supplemented with a newly 
introduced feature that describes the rate of change in soiling ratio—can produce up to 99% accuracy in predicting 
soling events, while maintaining a sensible balance between false and missed alarms (up to 85.4% in F1-scores).

1. Introduction
In recent years, the penetration of solar photovoltaic (PV) power into modern-day electricity grids has significantly 
risen, as motivated by the global aspiration for cleaner and more sustainable energy sources. The global PV 
cumulative capacity grew to 1.6 TW as of the end of 2023, and as much as 446 GW of new PV system capacity has 
been commissioned, representing a 46% increase compared to 2022 (International Energy Agency, 2024). This rapid 
growth in solar PV system adoption motivates the need for technological innovations that can aid solar farm operators 
to ensure the cost-effective operations and maintenance (O&M) of their solar energy assets. O&M is a major 
contributor to the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of renewable energy resources (including but not limited to solar 
PV systems), and as such, reductions in O&M expenditures can directly translate into significant enhancement in the 
economic outlook of solar energy systems. 
Along those lines, this work is particularly focused on the challenges and impacts of soiling in PV systems. Soiling, 
or the process by which dust, dirt, and organic/inorganic matter accumulate on the surface of PV cells, is a major and 
often under-estimated factor that can negatively impact PV cell performance and reliability. In 2018, soiling reduced 
global solar power production by 3-4% leading to estimated annual losses of 3-5 billion euros that are only expected 
to increase as solar power becomes more prevalent (IIse et. al. 2019). Hence, finding innovative solutions to monitor 
the soiling of PV arrays in real time can prove to be economically viable especially in environments where visual

worse precision scores. The improved recall indicates that the newly introduced SS feature helped classify true 
positive values that were previously classified as false negative values. With that said, we can conclude that the newly 
proposed feature had an overall positive effect on the classifiers’ performance.  
 
Figure 4. Confusion matrices of the three highest performing models before (a-c) and after (d-f) feature addition 
 
These results are further highlighted in the confusion matrices shown in Figure 4, which are created by summing the 
results from all ten trials in both experiment types and can provide further insight into model performance. The 
matrices make it obvious that the models disproportionately struggle with false negatives compared to false positives 
both before and after the SS feature was introduced. They also confirm what the numerical evaluation metrics 
suggested in that the feature reduced the instances of false negatives but slightly increased the instances of false 
positives all while increasing the total number of true positive predictions. We believe that those false negatives could 
be further reduced by introducing additional features that could capture historical data beyond one previous time step. 
Furthermore, collecting more soiling data could potentially improve the models’ performance. With that said, F1 
scores approaching 85% on our highest performing models demonstrate the potential of ML to effectively detect the 
occurrence of soiling events in solar PV systems.  
 
5. Conclusion and Future Research 
The rapid expansion of solar PV systems worldwide has created an emerging need for cost-effective ways to reduce 
the O&M expenses of solar farms. In this work, we present a ML-powered soiling detection system that uses data 
from a state-of-the-art optical soiling sensor, DustIQ, that has been mounted on a PV solar array at the Energy Lab 
at Rutgers University in New Jersey, USA. Data from three different soiling experiments were analyzed and used to 
train ML classifiers that have been shown to effectively detect the occurrence of soiling, especially when 
supplemented with a newly introduced feature that captures the rate of change in soiling ratios. This work 
demonstrates an example of how new sensor technology can be successfully combined with ML to help optimize the 
O&M operations of a solar farm, thus contributing towards enhancing the economic outlook of solar energy.  
 
This work paves the way for exploring a number of research avenues for further development. Firstly, our models 
were trained on a relatively small dataset that utilized one data source: soiling ratio. Future works could incorporate 
additional soiling experiments, as well as exogenous variables such as temperature or humidity to finetune the soiling 
detection system. Likewise, new features, that are defined in a similar manner to the square soiling slope (SS), can 
be created and introduced to further bolster the training data, perhaps through a semi-automated feature engineering 
and selection approach. Finally, although real time detection of soiling is indeed valuable, anticipating future soiling 
events is of equal importance, but is understandably a more challenging problem to address.

Abstract 
This research shows the study of a small company dedicated to the roasting and packaging of coffee, being its main 
bottleneck the capacity to deliver the product to its customers, originating a service level of 79% and with an economic 
impact of approximately USD 56,329 per year. Through the diagnosis, it was found that the main reasons were the 
unlimited flexibility for order fulfillment caused by the lack of inventory, since the demand is variable; the second 
reason was the loss of time in the delivery of orders, due to disorganized routes, large number of trips and lack of 
order tracking. To address these problems, an improvement model was developed based on the implementation of the 
Centroid Method and Kanban to organize orders and propose delivery routes, reducing time and transportation costs. 
In addition, the ABC Analysis will be implemented to determine the most demanded products. For validation, a two-
week pilot was carried out, which showed an improvement in the level of service to 93%, making consumers more 
satisfied with the company's response. This demonstrated that the application of engineering tools has a positive 
impact on the company's efficiency. Finally, the project was evaluated with @RISK to demonstrate different scenario.

1. Introduction
Coffee is one of the most consumed products worldwide. This is made up of two large groups: arabica coffee and 
robusta coffee. Peru is one of the main producers of arabica coffee (Gestión 2023), being one of the most demanded 
qualities, followed by mild arabica, which is reflected in the exports of green coffee, which have shown a value of 
USD 1,236 million in 2022(Gestión 2023).  
The coffee company has the objective of offering the national and international public a sample of the best Peruvian 
coffee beans, which are rigorously selected, evaluated and roasted daily by our team of tasters, roasters and 
professional baristas. They have certified raw material suppliers that produce specialty coffees between 1,200 and 
2,000 meters above sea level in the high jungle of Peru. This company offers roasted coffee, roasted and ground coffee, 
coffee concentrate and testing services. On the other hand, it has a special line of Blends for its Horeca customer 
(hotels, restaurants and café).  
After a data collect, was found that the company had a service level of 79% which is below the ideal scenario of 100%, 
this is caused by three main reasons. First, the company has a pull system, which means that they do not manufacture 
prior to customer demand, which is sometimes counterproductive because the demand is very variable, and the stock 
of roasted coffee is not sufficient when clients place orders after the due date. Secondly, not having a correct route 
plan causes many trips and loss of time. Finally, not tracking the order causes problems to deliver it, because the

the limitations when solving the order tracking was that they did not have registered customer data, so it is 
recommended to use a CRM software (Customer Relationship Management) to have knowledge about the customer. 
6. Conclusions 
The use of three engineering tools has achieved a significant improvement in the company studied, especially by 
reducing delivery time, allowing for a better customer experience. The design of routes accompanied with Kanban 
has resulted in the reduction of time; firstly, it was achieved that the delivery driver can make all deliveries in a single 
day, achieving a utilization of 100% of his time, on the other hand, keeping track of the order and coordinating with 
the customer prior to delivery, allowed the waiting time to contact the customer to reduce from 12 to 5 minutes 
maximum, allowing the delivery driver to make the next delivery more promptly. In addition, the Centroid Method 
set routes for the delivery driver to follow, thus achieving a 39% reduction in the initial time. On the other hand, the 
use of ABC Analysis helped to review the products that were most popular with customers, reducing lost sales from 
1.3% to 0.9% in just two weeks. All these improvements managed to increase the service level to 93.8%, which is 
15% higher than the initial scenario, significantly improving the company's efficiency. In addition, Kanban has been 
used in another area to promote the organization of tasks, with equally positive results.

Abstract 
The Niger Delta Basin is one of the most explored geologic basins in Africa. It is located in the Southern part of 
Nigeria, Gulf of Guinea, West Africa. This study employed the use of 3-D seismic data (SGY format) and well log 
suites (LAS format), and check shot data for the technical interpretation. Well facies correlation, sequence 
stratigraphic analysis, structural identification on seismic section were methods used to assess the petroleum system 
of the Odigba field. The two mains well facies were identified and they were the sandy facies and the shaly facies. In 
all four reservoirs were identified (Res1, Res2, Res3, and Res4) with Res 3 having appreciable thickness and lateral 
continuity than other reservoirs. From sequence stratigraphic analysis, the four reservoirs are associated with LST’s 
and sands of HST’s, sealing units are associated with the shales of the HST’s, while the TST’s are also associated with 
the intra-reservoir seals.  The identified trapping style mechanism include the growth faults, antithetic faults, horsts 
and grabens, shale diapir, rollover anticlines and the stratigraphic pinch outs. The migration pathways (through 
regional faults, porous and permeable carrier beds). The presence of hydrocarbon indicators (bright spot) on the 
seismic section, suggests the presence of hydrocarbon in the reservoirs. However, the presence of gas flags in the 
seismic section helped us to understand why all the wells were drilled away from the shale diapir. In all, the Odigba 
field can be said to have good hydrocarbon prospects since all the key petroleum system elements are in place 
.

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
1.) We recommend that more wells should be drilled in the study area for more hydrocarbon exploitation 
2.) Biostratigraphical data should be provided for the classification of the environment of deposition 
3.) Pressure data should be provided within the study area to determine the risk factor of the exploration activities 
4.) 4th seal analysis should be carried out to ascertain the sealing integrity of the cap rocks 
 
5.4 Validation  
Having done the literature review, well log analysis and the structural analysis, then we validate that there is an 
indication of hydrocarbon within the study area. We also observed growth fault and listric fault as a result of the 
rifting potential of the basin. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In conclusion the Niger Delta Basin is one of the most explored geologic basins in the world characterized by complex 
structural styles. Furthermore, these structures control stratigraphic features like the rollover anticlines and the 
stratigraphic pinch outs. The petroleum system of the basin comprises the source rocks (TST’s), the reservoirs (LST’s 
and sands of HST’s), sealing units (shales of the HST’s), traps such as the growth faults, antithetic faults, horsts and 
grabens, and shale diapir, migration pathways (through regional faults, porous and permeable carrier beds). In all four 
reservoirs were identified, with reservoir three having appreciable thickness and lateral continuity than other 
reservoirs. The presence of hydrocarbon indicators (bright spot) on the seismic section, suggests the presence of 
hydrocarbon in the reservoirs. However, the presence of gas flags in the seismic section helped us to understand why 
all the wells were drilled away from the shale diapir.

Abstract 
The capacity of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in formulating optimization problems is an interesting 
area of exploration in this rapidly evolving field. This study explores the capability of AI to interpret and formulate 
mathematical modeling problems from English descriptions. Five Large Language Models (LLMs) were selected, 
including OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, Google's Gemini, Microsoft's Copilot, Anthropic’s Claude, and an open-sourced 
model by Meta Llama-2. The research is conducted through a systematic comparison between human-expert generated 
formulations and those produced by the LLMs to better understand the strengths and shortcomings of the five LLMs. 
A diverse set of 26 linear programming problems was used for this evaluation. The effectiveness of these AI tools is 
measured based on the correctness of the formulations. ChatGPT-4 outperformed its competitors with a mean score 
of 88.55, followed by Copilot at 84.93, Gemini at 83.57, Claude at 81.21, and Llama-2 at 46.26. The test problems 
were example in Linear programming from typical junior level course in industrial engineering and were graded using 
a rubric. Overall, ChatGPT-4 was the best earning a ""B+"" grade compared to others Copilot (""B""), Gemini (""B-""), 
Claude (""B-""), and Llama-2 (""F""). These findings indicate considerable variation in current Generative AI 
technologies in their ability to automatically formulate mathematical optimization problems. There are interesting 
opportunities to harness these technologies as they continue to rapidly evolve in research, education, and practice.

1. Introduction
Generative AI models, leveraging neural networks, have shown remarkable capabilities in creating content across 
various domains by learning patterns and structures within datasets (Ray, 2023). These models, encompassing GANs, 
LLMs, VAEs, and transformers, draw inspiration from human neuronal processes and refine their outputs through 
repeated training, aiming to generate high-quality and contextually appropriate content (ZDNet, 2020). The evolution 
of Generative AI models has significantly impacted various sectors, including education (Bandi et al., 2023). 
Interestingly, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be effective tools for figuring out the intricacies 
of solving mathematical puzzles (Romera-Paredes et al., 2023; Imani, Du & Shrivastava, 2023). Generative models 
like ChatGPT-4 (Brown et al., 2020), Bard (now Gemini), and Bing's AI (now Copilot) have shown remarkable 
abilities in interpreting and generating natural language, which extends to complex tasks such as mathematical 
problem formulation (Vaswani et al., 2017; Language Understanding, 2019). Generative AI has opened new avenues 
for applications such as computer vision, natural language processing, and creative arts (Language Understanding, 
2019).

The analysis reveals distinct formulation challenges among the LLMs. In Claude's instance of incorrect decision 
variables definition yet managed to formulate an accurate objective function, scoring a full mark in the latter category. 
A recurring issue, most notably with Llama-2, is the tendency to describe constraints verbally without proper 
mathematical expression, leading to lower scores due to our emphasis on precise mathematical representation. 
Furthermore, Copilot and Gemini often produced concise formulations, indicating efficiency in model optimization 
policy, though potentially increasing interpretative effort. Notably, across all models, the direction of optimization 
was consistently identified correctly. These insights into the models' performance highlight the strengths and areas for 
improvement in automated mathematical formulation. 
6. Conclusions   
The study investigates the LLMs’ efficacy and seeks to understand how these models perform in formulating LP 
problems. GPT, Gemini, Copilot and Claude are skilled at formulating LP problems. They demonstrate a notable 
ability to define decision variables, formulate objective functions and constraints. This indicates that LLMs prove to 
be a useful aid for formulating LP problems. However, it is crucial to highlight that one should not solely depend on 
the Generative AI tool, as our findings point out their tendency to make errors.  
In our study we found that ChatGPT stands out as the best performing model but exhibited high score variation. On 
the other hand, Copilot and Gemini show low variations among all models and thus being reliable options for 
applications that demand accurate linear programming problem formulation. particularly in defining decision 
variables. Llama exhibits markedly lower performance, suggesting that it may need significant enhancements or might 
be less appropriate for tasks necessitating exact mathematical modeling. 
In conclusion, the extent to which generative AI tools effectively automate the development of LP models typically 
handled by students/professionals is limited. Our results recommend using these tools with caution, acknowledging 
their value but also their limitations due to their variable dependability and tendency of occasional mistakes.  
There are interesting future opportunities in research, education, and practice that could build off of this exploratory 
work. In terms of research more tests should be conducted with varying levels of difficulty non-linear problems 
including quadratic objectives and integer variables. As this area of research matures, it can be expected to find 
applications in education such as serving as a real-time tutor for students learning mathematical modeling. A longer 
terms objective for this line of research is to develop technologies that can be scaled to address industrial scale 
problems and also in developing interfaces appropriate for operational managers to readily solve their problems. The 
scope can also be broadened by incorporating more AI models and newer versions. The number of test problems can 
be increased in terms of size and complexity to provide more insights on improving and applying them in practice. A 
set of benchmark problems could be made publicly available as the interest in this area grows. The study considers 
only the accuracy of the solution, not other factors such as the computational time and other performance metrics of 
the generative AI, which is a limitation that can be addressed in the future.

Abstract 
The objective of this article was to present the implementation of a secure print management system based on the ISO 
14298:2013 standard (International Organization for Standardization 2013) in the company's operational processes in 
the graphic sector for printing valuable documents in Lima, Peru. The research method is deductive, and the type of 
study is action research. The result was to form the documentary system according to the ISO 14298:2013 standard, 
integrate the existing management systems ISO 9001, ISO 14001, and OHSAS 18001, obtaining the implementation 
and certification of the Management System under the criteria of the ISO 14298:2013 standard. One limitation is the 
incipient bibliographic information on the ISO 14298:2013 standard because the field is very specialized. This study 
can be useful for companies interested in implementing a Secure Print Management System.

The proposal for improvements derived from the results of the internal audit and certification implemented in the 
graphics sector to achieve certification of the secure printing management system are: a). Purchase of hard drives for 
backup from security camera recordings; b). Installation of security mechanisms in critical areas of the company; c). 
Preparation of confidentiality contracts for clients and suppliers; d). Application for licenses to use specialized 
software; e). Create restricted areas to safeguard the client's specifications in information technology; F). They were 
modifying operational procedures such as risk assessment, job profiles, and procedures for safeguarding critical areas. 
These improvements were substantially reflected in the certification audit since zero non-conformities were found in 
the secure printing management system, achieving the research objective. 
 
5. Conclusions 
This research allowed us to review information concerning the printing industry, specifically in the printing of valuable 
documents and the different management systems based on an international standard, to select one of them that 
contributes to the companies in this sector in the security of the products provided. It is concluded that implementing 
a secure printing management system based on the ISO 14298:2013 standard in the operational processes in the 
company in the graphic sector for printing valuable documents in Lima, Peru, to obtain the ISO 14298 certification: 
2013 of the implemented system will give more value to its commercial management, and to achieve greater 
recognition in business lines by clients. The management system certification shows that the company has achieved a 
homogeneous scheme of providing products and services that meet the security requirements offered or requested by 
customers. On the other hand, it offers clients a service guarantee that the work is controllable and always in search 
of client satisfaction and continuous improvement. 
 
5.1 Research Limitations 
The limitations are as follows: the system has been designed based on its current processes and conditions due to the 
peculiarity of the process: printing of valuable documents; bibliographic information is scarce, which makes it a 
limitation for developing this work. Having sufficient resources to implement this type of management system 
becomes another limitation since it implies having physical controls to ensure the processes comply and deliver safe 
products. However, the results of this research can help other researchers to follow the methodology used. 
 
5.2 Recommendations for Future Research  
Carry out studies on production control methods; improve productivity through the use of machinery and equipment 
used in printing valuable documents; Research raw material specifications; implement security methods used to 
preserve the integrity of documents throughout the entire production chain and study other production processes used 
in graphic printing: offset, intaglio, digital, are the recommendations.

Abstract 
While significant efforts have been attempted in the design, control, and optimization of complex networks, most 
existing works assume the network structure is known or readily available. However, the network topology can be 
radically recast after an adversarial attack and may remain unknown for subsequent analysis. In this work, we propose 
a novel Bayesian sequential learning approach to reconstruct network connectivity adaptively: A sparse Spike and 
Slab prior is placed on connectivity for all edges, and the connectivity learned from reconstructed nodes will be used 
to select the next node and update the prior knowledge. Central to our approach is that most realistic networks are 
sparse, in that the connectivity degree of each node is much smaller compared to the number of nodes in the network. 
Sequential selection of the most informative nodes is realized via the between-node expected improvement. We 
corroborate this sequential Bayesian approach in connectivity recovery for the IEEE-118 power grid system. Results 
indicate that only a fraction (~50%) of the nodes need to be interrogated to reveal the network topology.

observed in RandomSS. This minor variability is attributed to the EI algorithm in SeqSS that consistently selects the 
most informative nodes. 
 
 
 
In Figure 2, the 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚ෝ of the IEEE-118 network structure is exhibited. Here, with only a fraction of the recovered 
nodes, the weight discrepancy of SeqSS approaches the same level of RandomSS. Unlike the unweighted network or 
connectivity matrix, estimate of the weight matrix in the grid network entails more nodes to converge, and the accuracy 
is sensitive to the noise level. The lower the noise level, the lower the level of 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑚𝑚ෝ.  
 
5. Conclusion and Discussion 
This study has the potential to significantly scale up the reconstruction algorithms to accommodate massive networks, 
radically transform the monitoring and operation for various realistic networked systems, including the power grid, 
transportation and communication, and provide a new robust and efficient foundation for military operational decision 
making. Particularly, this proposed research can find critical applications in a host of military operation scenarios, 
such as the monitoring and maintenance of the transportation/communication network or power grid system.  
 
In this present study, we develop a sparse Bayesian approach based on the Spike and Slab modeling for sequential 
reconstruction of network connectivity. We corroborate this approach on a power grid system under the weighted 
IEEE-118 network. The simulation results imply that our proposed SeqSS algorithm identifies the network 
connectivity in an efficient fashion (only ~50% nodes are interrogated) compared to RandomSS. Owing to the EI 
algorithm to select the most informative node, the SeqSS algorithm notches smaller discrepancy variance than that of 
RandomSS

Abstract 
In cold climate countries like the Russian Federation, heating systems are essential during the cold winter, autumn 
and spring seasons. This creates big opportunities for conventional heating, leading to a significant increase in 
greenhouse gas emissions. Our studies showed that natural gas is the main source of heating in Russia with a little 
over 75% of the citizens’ dependent on it. Burning of natural gas, produces CO2, contributing markedly to 
greenhouse gas emissions from the housing sector. Furthermore, 40% of electricity generation comes from coal-
fired power plants emitting methane (CH4), and Nitrous Oxide (N2O). The categories of buildings: are single-
family, multi-family, and commercial and public buildings. Existing building consumes the highest amount of 
energy (220kwh/m2/year), new buildings consume less energy (70kwh/m2/year), and advanced new and advanced 
retrofitted buildings consume very little energy (20kwh/m2/year). The common heating system in Russia includes; 
centralized heating systems (CHS), district heating systems (DHS), and individual heating systems (HIS). Thermal 
power plants are used in large cities, boilers, in countryside homes, and furnace heating in the villages. The 
housing sector is looking towards modernizing buildings with green and sustainable materials that will not only 
conserve energy but also reduce carbon footprints and greenhouse gas emissions.

1. Introduction
The review of Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse pollutants (indirect GHGs) emitted to and eliminated from 
the atmosphere ranks high on scientific and legislative priorities, which are guided globally by the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the one hand, and the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change on the other Jonas, et al. (2022). Climate goals outlined in international policies, 
such as the 2015 Paris Agreement primarily focus on global warming targets. The Paris Agreement, particularly, 
strives to keep ""the increase in the global mean temperature considerably below 2°C above pre-industrial levels"" 
and seek efforts ""to minimize the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels” (Jeffery et al., 
2017; Robiou du Pont, 2016; Tollefson 2018a, b;). Global warming levels are chosen in international policies as

Energy Consumption Efficiency: It is impossible to overstate how important this metric is. The rationale is that 
it considers how well the heating system converts energy into a more significant and useful output. Our research 
has shown us that this measure is essential to comprehending the direct relationship between reduced energy 
dissipation and operating costs and higher energy efficiency.  
 
Specific Heat Capacity (SHC): With the help of this metric, we were able to comprehend the necessity of heat 
generation in order to maintain a housing complex's heating system. Having a good knowledge of the SHC is 
crucial for maximum functioning of the systems. 
 
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): It has to do with identifying key factors like GHG emission (Car-
bon), pollution (air), and environmental sustainability.  It is of great importance to note that lower emissions and 
eco-friendly (sustainable) practices, are rapidly becoming very essential.  
 
Innovative Technology:  This has to do with State-of-the-art facilities and the cutting edge technologies utilized 
while building these heating systems. Modernized heating facilities provide gives clue on the energy efficiency, 
smartness, cleaners, and adaptability. 
 
Ease of installation and maintenance: We noticed that heating systems which have less installation and mainte-
nance costs reduces the downtime carrying various maintenance activities.  
 
The study of Lopatin (2019), suggested that when designing heat supply systems, it is necessary to consider 
temperature of the coldest 5-day security period of 92% and temperature which should be maintained indoors. 
Table 1 below also steam-compression heat pump unit (STP) is installed for heating a production facility with a 
total area of 96 m2. He also compared the heating system in the European Union to what is obtainable in some 
parts of the Russian Federation. HIs results are in line with our observations with regards to operational costs and 
energy efficiency of the heating systems. The gas heating systems in the specified regions in the Russian 
Federation are more expensive to maintain due to their old and nearly outdated components, consuming a lot of 
energy and emitting greenhouse gases in the process.

6. Conclusion 
Our studies revealed a complex landscape to the roles of heating systems to greenhouse gas emissions in the 
housing sector.  It also reveals that the reliance on the old central heating systems and gas heating systems used 
cottage homes, Meta stove predominantly in the villages (dacha) contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. 
However, the transition towards a more eco-friendly, sustainable, and energy-efficient heating system are 
important factors that will reduce the environmental impact of heating in the residential sector.  Furthermore, other 
factors like technological development (using state-of-the-art techniques), creating public awareness, and better 
policy making by the government would revolutionize cleaner heating solutions.  The Russian Federation can also 
cub its greenhouse gas emissions from the housing sector by introducing robust energy efficiency standards, 
promoting renewable energy sources, and transitioning towards a sustainable future.

Abstract 
With the rise of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Electric Vehicle Batteries (EVBs), effective management of these 
components has become crucial. This study focuses on forecasting sales of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and 
predicting the volume and return dates of their EVBs using advanced statistical methods. By analyzing BEV sales 
data for trends, seasonality, and stationarity, the research employs a combination of AutoRegressive Integrated 
Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), and linear regression models. The SARIMA model 
emerged as the most effective, exhibiting a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 6.769%, thus providing a 
reliable forecasting framework. The models were also benchmarked against traditional forecasting methods such as 
naive and seasonal naive approaches. Furthermore, the study utilizes Monte Carlo simulations to predict EVB return 
dates, incorporating factors like battery lifespan and delay distributions. The effect of technological advancements 
was also considered in the battery lifespan. The simulations predict a substantial surge in battery returns around the 
mid-2030s, highlighting a crucial phase for resource allocation in battery recovery initiatives, including recycling and 
refurbishment. These forecasts provide valuable insights to support stakeholders in the EVs industry by enhancing 
strategic planning and promoting sustainable practices in the production and end-of-life management of EVBs.

1. Introduction
Over recent decades, a significant rise in global vehicle usage has been driven by increasing population growth. This 
surge has led to heightened consumption of fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas, coupled with substantial emissions 
of greenhouse gases, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and microparticles. These emissions contribute to global 
warming and the formation of atmospheric haze. Since 2013, vehicular sources have been responsible for 15.9% of 
global CO2 emissions, and by 2020, the transport sector accounted for 26% of these emissions globally, underscoring 
the critical need for transformative approaches in transportation to mitigate these environmental impacts (Wu and 
Chen 2022). 
Electric Vehicles (EVs) have increasingly captured the attention of governments and the public due to their potential 
to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Research by Ellingsen et al. demonstrates that while the production 
phase of EVs is environmentally costlier than that of internal combustion engines (ICEs), the operational benefits 
significantly outweigh these initial impacts. Onat et al. (2015) confirm that the use phase of EVs substantially lessens 
environmental detriments, offering considerable ecological advantages over ICEs. Teixeira and Sodre (2018) have 
quantified these advantages, revealing that CO2 emissions from EV fleets could be 10 to 26 times lower than those 
from ICE fleets, even with a projected 5% annual increase in CO2 emissions and potential advancements in ICE

As discussed in the literature review, differentiating between EV types in predictions is crucial, particularly for 
batteries. For instance, the size and structure of BEV batteries differ from those in FCEVs. Such differentiation reduces 
the uncertainties that supply chain entities face regarding the quality and quantity of different EVBs, thereby enhancing 
planning and operational efficiency. 
 
7. Conclusion  
This study presented a EV sales prediction method, specifically for BEVs, utilizing an effective approach that is less 
complex and computationally demanding than machine learning methods. The approach successfully predicted 
monthly BEV sales in the United States by analyzing underlying patterns, involving data transformation and 
decomposition, and forecasting trend components using OLS, with SARIMA applied to the remainders. This 
methodology yielded a MAPE of 6.769%. The high accuracy in capturing cyclical sales trends establishes a solid basis 
for stakeholders to anticipate market fluctuations and adjust inventory and production strategies accordingly. 
 
Furthermore, this approach utilized EV sales data and Monte Carlo simulation to provide a quantitative and realistic 
understanding of the volumes of spent EVBs from these electric vehicle types. These simulations revealed a significant 
peak in battery returns projected for the mid-2030s, emphasizing the necessity for timely improvements in recovery 
processes, such as recycling and refurbishment infrastructures. By anticipating this peak, the research advocates for 
proactive planning and the adoption of sustainable practices, ensuring that the EV industry can effectively manage the 
anticipated surge in battery returns. 
 
Despite these advances, the study faces limitations that future research could address. The data scope did not 
encompass all EV models and excluded variables such as battery second-use or failure rates due to manufacturing 
flaws, potentially impacting lifecycle predictions. Future research should consider incorporating a broader dataset and 
exploring the impacts of macroeconomic factors on EV and EVB markets. 
 
Further differentiation among battery types and expanded regional analysis would refine the accuracy of the models. 
Recommendations for industry stakeholders include adopting these forecasting models to enhance strategic planning 
and investing in technologies that extend battery life, thus reducing environmental impact and fostering sustainable 
growth in the EV market. These enhancements will continue to support the industry's expansion, aligning consumer 
demand with environmental responsibility.

6. Discussion 
Previous research has sought to predict the future of EVs and EVBs using various data sets and modeling approaches, 
achieving a MAPE ranging from 2 to 12% for their predominantly annual prediction models. Our chosen model, while 
not too complex, yields a 6.769% MAPE on monthly predictions, which is a respectable error rate. By avoiding 
excessive complexity, yet effective, we mitigate the risk of overfitting and reduce reliance on current data. 
 
Some studies have employed simpler methods, such as linear regression. However, very simple methods can underfit 
the data. In contrast, some utilized highly complex models incorporating multiple machine learning and statistical 
methods. While overly complex models may show low error metrics, e.g., MAPE, in the short term, they may overfit 
and thus be less effective for long-term predictions. This issue is particularly relevant for EVs, which are still in the 
early growth stage of their lifecycle. Numerous factors, including policy initiatives (e.g., tax incentives), national 
commitments to net-zero emissions, technological advancements, inflation, political events, and consumer 
preferences, can all influence predictions. 
 
Disruptions such as the semiconductor shortage in September 2021, which significantly reduced U.S. new-vehicle 
supply, illustrate the volatility in the market. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused massive disruptions in 
sales worldwide. Total vehicle sales dropped by 48.12% from February 2020 to April 2020, the onset of the pandemic, 
whereas the decline for BEVs was only 29.06%.  Additionally, by the time the Russia-Ukraine conflict started in late 
February 2022, gas prices rose, which potentially could affect people's choices in buying EVs. As the U.S. strives to 
keep up with EV leaders like China and Europe, new policies and incentives, such as tax credits of up to $7,500 for 
new vehicles purchased in or after 2023, are expected to drive the upward trend in EV adoption. Thus, relying solely 
on quantitative data, despite its informative and helpful insights, may not suffice given the immaturity of the EV 
market. In future research, qualitative factors, including political and policy incentives, must also be considered. 
 
Moreover, EV sales directly impact the volume of returned EVBs. As illustrated in Figure 8, we anticipate a significant 
volume of battery returns by mid-2035. Consequently, governments, recovery companies, and other entities in this 
reverse supply chain must prepare by adjusting regulations and capacity. Technological advancements, as outlined in 
Table 2, also influence the lifespan of batteries and their return rates. By using dynamic lifespan estimates, we have 
attempted to account for part of this effect. Factors such as raw material availability, regulatory changes, EV owner 
behavior, and charging infrastructure all play a role in determining these rates.

Abstract 
Construction 4.0, the application of Industry 4.0 technologies in construction activities, promises to revolutionize the 
construction industry by increasing productivity, enhancing safety, improving sustainability, and achieving the highest 
standard of quality. Industry 4.0 technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), robotics, and the Internet of Things 
(IoT), offer an unprecedented potential for the transformation of the construction activities in the 21st century. 
Construction activities constitute approximately 4.3% of the US GDP and employ 7.5 million workers. Although 
productivity has significantly increased in other industries, progress has been slow in the construction sector. One 
contributing factor is the relatively low investment in IT compared to other industries. The diversity and novelty of 
Industry 4.0 technologies, along with their wide range of applications in the construction sector, presents a 
considerable challenge in selecting the most appropriate technologies for various construction applications. This paper 
is based on our research which examines and clusters 33 Industry 4.0 technologies and assesses their potential for 
different construction applications. In this study, text mining techniques combined with clustering analysis are used 
to gain insights into various construction 4.0 technologies and their potential in improving construction activities.

Abstract 
The present study addresses the pervasive issue of delays in machinery repair services within the mining and 
construction sectors, which are critical to maintaining operational efficiency. The motivation for this research stems 
from the significant negative impacts of these delays, including missed deadlines, customer dissatisfaction, and 
financial losses. The study aims to mitigate these challenges by implementing Lean Service methodologies, including 
5S, Kaizen, and Value Stream Mapping (VSM), to optimize repair shop processes. The proposed improvement model 
consists of six stages: Lean Solution, Lean Education, Lean Application, Monitoring and Control, Feedback, and 
Continuous Improvement. Each stage focuses on specific aspects of process enhancement, from establishing a quality 
policy and training staff in Lean principles to implementing practical tools such as 5S for workspace organization and 
Poka Yoke for error prevention. The model also incorporates continuous monitoring, feedback systems, and the 
Kaizen philosophy to sustain long-term improvements. The implementation of this model yielded notable results. The 
repair time was reduced by 46%, showcasing a substantial decrease in turnaround time. The 5S audit score improved 
by 46.27%, indicating enhanced organization and cleanliness in the work environment. Productivity increased by 
26.31%, reflecting a higher capacity for repair activities. Additionally, the number of units in process was reduced by 
55.55%, demonstrating improved workflow and efficiency. These indicators confirm the effectiveness of the Lean 
Service approach in addressing delays and enhancing overall operational efficiency in machinery repair services.

Abstract 
In the context of the Peruvian distribution sector, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face significant 
challenges in warehouse and inventory management, impacting their operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. 
This study addresses these issues by implementing a logistic model that integrates Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) 
and Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) to optimize operations in a Peruvian plastic distributor. The proposed model 
aims to enhance warehouse organization, streamline inventory management, and improve delivery performance. 
The research contribution involves a detailed application of the SLP methodology, combined with ABC analysis for 
product categorization and matrix tables for layout optimization. Additionally, the study incorporates EOQ for optimal 
order quantity determination and demand forecasting techniques to reduce stockouts. Key results demonstrate 
substantial improvements in operational metrics. Notably, on-time delivery rates increased by 18%, from 76% to 90%. 
Inventory stockouts decreased dramatically by 85%, reducing from 14% to 2%. The overall cycle time for order 
processing was shortened by 50%, from 60 minutes to 30 minutes. Furthermore, the effort required for picking and 
packaging activities was reduced by 33%, from 20,620 kg-mt to 13,820 kg-mt. These results indicate that the 
integration of SLP and EOQ models significantly mitigates the inefficiencies in warehouse management and inventory 
control, leading to enhanced operational performance and customer satisfaction in the distribution sector.

challenges. Additionally, the research highlights the relevance of ergonomics and process standardization in 
improving efficiency and workplace safety, which is a significant contribution to the existing literature on operations 
and logistics management. 
 
Finally, some final observations and suggestions for further study are offered. It is essential to continue investigating 
the implementation of these methodologies in different contexts and industrial sectors to validate and refine the 
obtained results. Additionally, it is suggested to explore the integration of advanced technologies, such as automation 
and artificial intelligence, to further enhance efficiency in inventory management and goods distribution. Continuous 
staff training in continuous improvement practices and process management is also essential to maintain and increase 
the benefits achieved through these interventions. This study establishes a solid foundation for future research aiming 
to innovate and optimize logistics operations in SMEs and other business environments.

Abstract 
In the context of the hydrocarbon sector, which is crucial for the global and regional economies of Latin America, 
significant issues were identified in the operational efficiency of fuel supply terminals. These challenges included 
deficiencies in machine maintenance, lack of process standardization, and congestion in dispatch areas, negatively 
impacting productivity and increasing operational costs. This situation highlighted the need to apply method 
engineering techniques to optimize processes and improve operational efficiency. The contribution of this research 
consisted of developing and implementing a process improvement model based on method engineering to increase 
productivity in the dispatch area of a fuel supply terminal. The proposed model included stages of process selection, 
detailed diagramming, analysis and development of a new method, implementation, and control. These stages allowed 
for the identification and elimination of redundant activities, optimization of loading times, and improved resource 
utilization. The most outstanding results of implementing the new method included: a reduction in total process time 
from 77 to 62 minutes, representing a 19.48% improvement; an increase in the man-machine utilization percentage 
from 85% to 91%; a significant decrease in the waiting times for tanker trucks; and an improvement in operational 
efficiency, reaching a maximum efficiency of 98% on high productivity days. These indicators demonstrated that the 
application of method engineering effectively resolved the identified problems, increasing the productivity and 
efficiency of the fuel dispatch area.

1. Introduction
The hydrocarbon industry is a key sector for the global economy, especially in regions with high levels of energy 
consumption. Globally, this industry is characterized by its crucial role in power generation, transport and 
manufacturing, being a primary source of fuel for various productive sectors (Tamayo et al., 2015). In Latin America, 
the hydrocarbon sector has had a significant influence on economic and social development, providing employment 
and generating significant income for producing countries (Palma, 2022). Peru is no exception, as its economy is 
heavily dependent on the production and marketing of hydrocarbons. The country has seen a growth in demand for

Table 6 shows the results obtained in this improvement project. Regarding the study of methods, the initial average 
time was 45 minutes in the pre control and 41.9 minutes in the post control, resulting in an increase in the percentage 
of attention within the average time from 53% to 57%. In addition, work measurement indicated that the Man-Machine 
utilization percentage increased from 85% to 91%, reflecting a 6% improvement in operational efficiency. 
 
6. Conclusions 
The main findings of the study indicate that the application of engineering methods in the fuel dispatch area of a 
supply terminal significantly increased productivity. The implementation of operations diagrams, route diagrams, and 
multiple activity diagrams allowed for the identification and elimination of bottlenecks, reduction of waiting times, 
and improvement of the efficiency of the tanker loading process. Specifically, a 45% reduction in total dispatch times 
and a 19.48% improvement in operational efficiency were observed. Additionally, the redistribution of tasks and the 
elimination of redundant activities contributed to better utilization of human and material resources. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its contribution to improving operational efficiency in a critical sector of the 
economy, such as hydrocarbons. In a context of growing fuel demand and the need to optimize resources, the findings 
of this study offer practical and effective solutions to increase productivity and reduce operational costs. Furthermore, 
by improving efficiency in fuel dispatch, the study promotes a more sustainable and safer operation, which is crucial 
for the long-term competitiveness and sustainability of the sector. 
 
The contributions to the field of study are significant, as this work demonstrates the applicability and effectiveness of 
methods engineering techniques in a complex industrial environment. Implementing these methods not only improves 
specific processes of fuel dispatch but also establishes a reference framework that can be adapted and applied in other 
industrial sectors facing similar challenges. This methodological approach, supported by quantitative and qualitative 
data, reinforces the importance of efficient management of operational processes and the continuous pursuit of 
improvements. 
Finally, some final observations and suggestions for future studies are offered. The research highlights the need for 
constant monitoring and periodic re-evaluation of the implemented methods to ensure their continuous effectiveness. 
It is recommended to apply emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and real-time data analysis, to 
identify new improvement opportunities and further optimize processes. Additionally, future studies could explore the 
integration of environmental sustainability practices in the fuel dispatch process and evaluate the long-term impacts 
of the implemented improvements in terms of safety and operational efficiency.

Abstract 
 
The present paper aims to provide a multifaceted exploration of trends and challenges for ethical and trustworthy 
Multimodal Language Models. Firstly, by offering a perspective on the most prominent developments around these 
models, including Neural Networks, Transformers, Generative AI, and Foundation Models. Secondly, 
we explore Multimodal Language Models and their paradigms, including multimedia datatypes for both input and 
output, domain and industry-specific datasets, emerging tools, concepts and techniques, personalized AI systems, and 
energy-efficient computing paradigms. Then we reflect on emerging challenges for responsible AI, including 
alignment, inductive inference, ethical use, job replacement, jailbreaks, computability, open-sourcing, privacy, 
intellectual property, fair-use, or international regulation. Moreover, we explore their application from an Industry 5.0 
perspective across various fields, exemplified by critical areas like Health and Diagnostic Decision Support Systems, 
Job-matching, Cybersecurity, and AI-Human Collaboration. Finally, we draw conclusions and suggest technical 
mitigation strategies from a designer’s standpoint.

1. Introduction 
In the context of Industry 5.0's human-centricity and AI-enabling technologies, we conduct a comprehensive 
exploration of the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLM) and Multimodal Language Models (MLM), 
identifying emerging paradigms and application fields, while proposing solution and mitigation strategies for their 
uncertainties and challenges with an emphasis on multimodality and reliability in a rapidly evolving landscape. For 
this purpose, we have curated a database of more than three hundred peer-reviewed papers and similar number of 
online sources and other materials, like Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems documentation, GitHub repositories, and 
legislative developments worldwide. Historically, the field of AI has had numerous contributors for over  a century, 
from Santiago Ramón y Cajal’s studies on the neuron in the late 19th century to Leonardo Torres Quevedo's Chess-
Player automata in 1912, through Alan Turing’s results on computability, Shannon’s mathematic theory of 
communication, and various other studies before the so-called “AI winters” by the likes of Gödel, Chaitin, Wiener, 
Schützenberger, Solomonoff, Kolmogorov, Rosenblatt, McCullough, Pitts, Chomsky, or Minsky, on cybernetics, 
generative grammars, inductive inference, neural networks, formal language, or the theory of mind. Their results 
underpin many modern statistical models, including autoregressive language models like Generative Pre-Trained 
Transformers (GPT) that predict subsequent elements of a sequence given prior elements (Liu et al., 2024), and other","Proceedings of International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

their operation of potential fallibility is essential, as is enabling users to identify, tag, and mitigate (Yin et al., 2024) 
potential hallucinations, misinformation, and inaccuracies, advancing collectively towards a trustworthy knowledge 
economy.  Completely eliminating all obnoxious effects remains an elusive goal, although some techniques (Yin et 
al., 2024) are being developed behind and in front of their APIs, like using a second M/LLM to classify and filter 
outputs from the first or advancing in the sophistication of training and deployment procedures via RAG, fine-tuning, 
dataset curation, personalization, continuous learning, model benchmarking, and other methods. Addressing 
superalignment (Wu et al., 2023; Yin et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024) is crucial for improving the social perception and 
acceptance towards AI, but, most importantly, for preventing unintended consequences and ensuring that MLM 
contribute positively to society, e.g., the “RegNLP” initiative (Goanta et al., 2023). Virtuous feedback loops and 
continuous evaluation are key (see tools like FiddlerAI, Deepchecks LLM, EvidentlyAI, or Giskard). 
In the AI-human collaboration process, while AI systems don’t yet possess emotions or consciousness like humans, 
and, therefore, the idea of AI developing feelings of wariness or distrust towards humans is not in line with our current 
understanding of AI capabilities and functioning, effective collaboration is built on certain key contributions that 
include provisioning MLM with a proper computational substrate to function, and high-quality, diverse datasets for 
accurate learning and decision-making. Humans also define clear objectives, ethical boundaries, and constraints for 
AI, ensuring their actions align with desired outcomes and ethical standards, although these must evolve as MMM 
become increasingly virtuous, capable of planning and self-improving (directly and because of human mediation), and 
progressively acquire both agency and autonomy. Continuous learning and feedback from humans help AI to refine 
their understanding and improve over time through reprogramming, in the classical, no-code, regulatory sense (Dolata 
et al., 2021), and across any other future or present multimedia modalities like physical training of embodied MLM, 
artificial vision (e.g., live/video feeds for lip reading, sign language, and wider body-language understanding), 
OpenAI’s text-to-video model Sora and subsequent related products (e.g., Google Veo), and generative 
video/3D/Web/source-code, especially when self-improving capabilities are to be present.  
5. Conclusion    
Industry 5.0 marks the era of flexible and adaptable technologies, prioritizing sustainability. Digitalization transforms 
industries, redefining production processes, leveraging human expertise, and altering the role of workers. To enhance 
trust in the reliability and ethical standards (""moral integrity"") of M/LLM we should ensure that these systems meet 
the highest standards of rationality, explainability, security, stability, open-mindedness, and adaptability to culturally 
diverse perspectives (including but not limited to multilingualism), addressing the concerns of responsible security, 
privacy (for users and with regards to training data), and quality of service (inclusive of accuracy, availability, and 
responsiveness). In this manner we can bolster their ethical standing and public acceptance. Although different in 
their approach, complexity, and practical implementation, current MLM inference processes share the general 
principle of learning from data and making predictions with Solomonoff induction. In this context, Kolmogorov 
complexity plays a key role as a measure of the computational resources needed to specify an object, with the 
challenges that loss of information poses in cognitive processes such as memory compression. 
 
On the balancing of copyright protection, the key seems to be the concept of authorship and the degree and quality 
of human-made intellectual contributions, not very dissimilar from Shapley's value in economic theory for fair payoff 
allocation (Ali et al., 2023). Another pivotal factor in determining the legal status of such works globally is the 
determination of what is considered a “de minimis” amount of content, or even if defining a sharp cutoff criteria is 
appropriate within the context of AI-assisted creation e.g., in the intellectual and artistic spheres, or in the workplace. 
Some of the problems derived from the intrinsic lack of explainability and other issues with AI can be somewhat 
ameliorated to reduce errors and enhance safety, especially in the context of balancing automation and human expertise 
in sensitive areas like healthcare, through human-centered approaches, mistake-proofing poka-yoke methods for 
control of single points of failure, adaptive continuous learning, and stress-tested distributed redundancy with human 
supervision, drawing methods from fields like control & resilience engineering, fault-tolerant computing, systematic 
error reduction, and safety-critical systems. 
 
On safety and security, particularly in cybersecurity, privacy-related, and military applications, extraordinary global 
efforts are advisable, specifically targeted towards enhancing defensive capabilities, severely limiting autonomous 
offensive capabilities, guaranteeing civil rights, leveraging AI-enhanced diplomacy, e.g., trustworthy real time 
translation services, and de-risking in a Richardson's arms race model-aware manner. It is essential to incorporate 
advanced adversarial defense strategies during the model development and distillation process stages, as well as in 
and around their various interfaces (not only APIs). This includes practically auditable and properly monitored","Proceedings of International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

curation of datasets and training method implementation, as well as rigorous testing against potential adversarial 
attacks, plus continuous refinement of models to guard against newly emerging threats, adapting to evolving ethical 
landscapes. In models where continuous learning is allowed, either directly or indirectly (e.g., via RLHF), robust trust 
management schemes and reliable data evaluation protocols should be implemented, especially if autonomous (with 
RLAI). We must consider the practical impossibility of preventing “bad actors” from (accidentally or intentionally) 
misusing MLM, but we can effectively impose some guardrails (considering the “Waluigi effect”) and curb online 
dissemination. The necessity of retaining and fostering a sufficiently dynamic research and innovation landscape 
recommends aiming for a balanced approach, potentially based on Open-Source Software (F/LOSS). Ethical and 
responsible use of M/LLM, transparency in AI processes, and conveniently audited adherence to legal and regulatory 
standards are essential. The key is establishing a balanced and mutually beneficial ""win-win"" interaction in the game-
theoretical sense by avoiding and preventing arms-race dynamics of distrust via robust oversight, enforcement of 
ethical standards, regulatory compliance, transparency in development, user/public education, and awareness of the 
data privacy, security risks, and societal impact -including that which is beneficial- of MLM. 
 
Technical mitigation strategies in MLM design: Some have been proposed for RNN-based models from the design 
and training stages, such as pre-programming, ""teacher forcing"", post-training quantization, quantization-aware 
training, batch normalization, regularizing nonlinearities, gradient scaling, using other architectures such as ResNets 
and activation functions like ReLU, or predictive coding and hyperdimensional computing, called to facilitate their 
use in IoT edge devices (Amrouch et al., 2022). Other potential research avenues include Caputo–Katugampola 
fractional-order methods (Cheng et al., 2023), Fractional Integral Neural Models, Quantum Convolutional NN, and 
some long-neglected analog computing paradigms, such as Spiking Neural Networks, e.g., Loihi-2 (Shrestha et al., 
2023) that can process signals and data in their native continuous form, reducing energy consumption and simplifying 
the network's architecture while improving its capacities. Note that optimizing resource use and energy efficiency not 
only involves the MLM’s own energy consumption (during training and inference, with metrics like cost-per-query 
and productivity/compute-per-watt) but also externalities like those of the broader impact of human societies. New 
platforms for speeding up inference are emerging, such as Groq’s Language Processing Units (LPU), and contextual 
windows are expanding rapidly (>1M tokens) to address issues like performance, forgetfulness, and personalization. 
 
Some other challenges remain for social capital growth, including the possibilities effectively affect and drive the 
development of MLM, the lack of simplified, empowered bottom-up process appeal procedures to a human in charge 
(e.g., in the workplace on automation-derived conflicts), addressing Moravec’s paradox, and imposing safeguards 
against sped-up automation of job replacement, and of knowledge, power, and wealth concentration dynamics 
resulting in inequality, inequity, unfairness, increased unrest of conflict, loneliness, distrust, and other social problems. 
Future implementation challenges for Industry 5.0 (Maddikunta et al., 2022; Khan et al., 2023) encompass security, 
data privacy, scalability, regulatory compliance, workforce re-skilling, and human-robot collaboration in the context 
of smart factories. Leveraging MLM-as-a-Service as tools to communicate and understand is certainly called to 
revolutionize countless spheres of everyday life, especially when applying any-to-any multimodality to translate 
(actually: ‘transform’) attentively and seamlessly from one domain into another and back. It is already clear that we 
are about to witness a new AI-powered scientific revolution, and, undoubtedly, MLM are at the forefront of this change. 
It is also quite clear that the responsible development and use of AI, done right, can be a driving force to significantly 
advance Sustainable Development Goals and the UN’s 2030 Agenda. 
 
Some of the limitations of the paper include the challenges of exploding research interest in the area during the last 
few years, which hints at the need for picking a specific methodology for an exhaustive and systematic literature 
review on the topic. Due to the limitations of time and length we were only able to point out some perspectives on 
Multimodal Language Models. Thus, in future research works we recommend presenting a deeper, more 
methodological explorative analysis of the most recent literature published since at least the onset of GPT-3, to spur 
more thorough insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of Industry 5.0 and AI.

Abstract 
The textile sector is highly competitive, so quality and efficiency are essential to improve the level of service of 
companies. For this reason, the implementation of a production model based on Lean Manufacturing, Total Productive 
Maintenance (TPM) and Simplified Logistics Planning (SLP) becomes a proposal for improvement for the 
optimization of companies' production processes. This paper will examine in detail the application of this improvement 
proposal through a case study and the impact that these models have on the efficiency, quality, and ability of the 
company to know customer demand.

1. Introduction
In today's dynamic business landscape, companies in the textile sector face increasing pressure to deliver high-quality 
products with shorter lead times while maintaining competitive pricing. To meet these evolving demands and stay 
ahead in the market, textile manufacturers must continuously seek innovative approaches to enhance their production 
processes and improve overall operational efficiency. 
In response to these challenges, the integration of Lean Manufacturing, Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), and 
Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) has emerged as a promising strategy to optimize production systems and increase 
the level of service in textile companies. Lean Manufacturing focuses on eliminating waste, TPM aims to maximize 
equipment effectiveness, and SLP enhances facility layout to facilitate smooth workflow and resource utilization. 
This paper presents a comprehensive production model that leverages the principles of Lean Manufacturing, TPM, 
and SLP to enhance the level of service in a textile manufacturing company. By combining these methodologies into 
an integrated approach, the aim is to create a synergistic framework that addresses key inefficiencies, reduces lead 
times, and improves overall productivity. 
1.1 Objectives 
The objectives of this paper revolve around the development of an integrative project aimed at enhancing the 
production process within the textile sector through the implementation of Lean Manufacturing, Total Productive 
Maintenance (TPM), and Simplified Logistics Planning (SLP). Specifically, the paper aims to achieve several key 
objectives. Firstly, it seeks to establish a comprehensive understanding of the project's background and the current

6. Conclusion  
With a cause-effect analysis of the identified problem, it was possible to determine three main causes that affect the 
Service Level, these being the low quality of the product, the non-compliance with the delivery time and the non-
compliance with the delivery quantity. Likewise, a Pareto diagram identified that the first two were the ones with the 
highest weight on the analyzed indicator with a total weight of 83%.  
  
Through the elaboration of the state of the art related to the case study, the main tools to be applied to each of the 
causes of the problem encountered were identified and determined. These tools are SLP to reduce process travel 
distances, SMED to eliminate times external to the use of the machine and thus optimize the key process that is the 
manufacture of garments, standardization to equalize the work done by all operators and thus reduce time and quality 
problems; and, finally, TPM, to reduce machine failures, thus improving product quality and reactive maintenance 
downtime.   
  
With the implementation of the proposed tools and through a simulation of the production process, it was possible to 
identify significant improvements in the different stages. In total, it was possible to increase the level of service from 
72% to 91%. This is due to the reduction of the travel of 25.7m in SLP, of times with SMED of 4.9 minutes of set up 
and with the standardization a reduction of 1.9 minutes per garment. 
  
As part of the stakeholder analysis, it was necessary to focus on the impacts of the activities on them. One of the most 
important is the environmental and health impacts, in which it was possible to identify that the most aggravating 
activity for both factors is that of printing due to the emission of polluting odors.   
  
Based on the financial analysis carried out for the investment of the improvement, this proposal is quite profitable 
since it has a positive NPV of S/ 114,050.18 and an IRR value higher than the percentage of COK obtained. Likewise, 
the risk analysis was carried out with the @Risk tool, identifying that even within the pessimistic scenario, this project 
continues to be profitable.

Abstract 
The growth of the fast-food sector in Lima, driven by the demand for efficient and high-quality services, has created 
the need to optimize service times in these establishments. This study arises with the objective of addressing 
inefficiencies in service processes in a fast-food restaurant, using continuous improvement tools such as queuing 
theory, aggregate planning, and simulations with Arena software. 
The research focused on improving order handling times through the standardization of methods and times, aggregate 
production planning, and the application of queuing theory. A continuous improvement model was developed in seven 
stages, which included detailed time and method studies, flow determination and time standards, and validation 
through simulations. 
The most notable results included a significant reduction in average order handling times from 23.14 minutes to 19.18 
minutes, which nearly doubled the total number of orders attended from 679 to 1,397. Additionally, the queue size 
and the number of customers leaving the line drastically decreased from 785 to 75 customers. Furthermore, revenues 
increased from 17,128 soles to 35,522 soles, demonstrating a remarkable improvement in operational efficiency and 
customer satisfaction. These indicators highlight the effectiveness of the proposed model in optimizing service times 
and increasing competitiveness in Lima's fast-food sector.

Table 5 shows a comparison of production costs before and after implementing improvements with three strategies: 
mixed method, leveling, and chase-zero inventory. The results indicate that costs for the mixed method increased from 
15,636 to 18,744 PEN and for the leveling method also rose to 8,744 from 9,668 PEN. In contrast, the chase-zero

improvements increase costs, optimization through chase-zero inventory significantly reduces total costs, proving to 
be the most efficient strategy.

6. Conclusions 
The main findings of the study indicate that the application of continuous improvement tools in a fast-food restaurant 
in Lima significantly optimizes service times and operational efficiency. The implementation of a systematic process 
improvement model, including time and methods studies, queuing theory, and aggregate production planning, reduced 
the average order processing times from 23.14 minutes to 19.18 minutes. Additionally, the number of customers 
leaving the queue drastically decreased from 785 to 75, resulting in a notable increase in revenue from 17,128 to 
35,522 PEN. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the applied methodologies in enhancing service capacity 
and customer satisfaction. 
 
The research conducted is of great importance as it addresses one of the main challenges in the fast-food sector: 
efficiency in customer service. In a context where speed and service quality are critical for competitiveness, optimizing 
internal processes not only improves the customer experience but also increases business profitability. Furthermore, 
the application of continuous improvement techniques and efficient supply chain management contributes to 
operational sustainability, especially in such a dynamic and demanding market as fast food. 
 
The contributions to the field of study are significant. This work not only provides a methodology applicable to other 
fast-food restaurants but also demonstrates the effectiveness of combining various industrial engineering techniques, 
such as queuing theory, aggregate planning, and continuous improvement tools, to solve complex operational 
problems. The integration of these techniques allows for more effective resource management, a reduction in non-
value-added activities, and greater consistency in service quality, which are crucial aspects for any service operation. 
Finally, final observations and suggestions for future studies are offered. It is recommended to conduct further research 
exploring the impact of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and automation, on process optimization 
in fast-food restaurants. Additionally, it is suggested to evaluate the applicability of this model in different cultural

Abstract 
Industry 5.0 is the latest revolution announced by the European Commission that focuses on human-centricity, 
resilience, and sustainability. Its goal is to encourage the usage of the assets human beings have in conducting certain 
jobs and tasks and combining that with technology.  This research focuses on Industry 5.0 and assessing if corporations 
are ready to accommodate the ideology, values and technologies that are associated. Utilizing a systemic literature 
review to deep dive into the literature related to Industry 5.0 and its predecessor Industry 4.0, we are able to identify 
factors that would be needed for companies to accommodate Industry 5.0. Identifying skills, tools, and additional 
resources relevant to Industry 5.0 are a necessity in the success of transitioning between revolutions. This information 
will be gathered through academic/scholarly journals that are currently accessible, there will be further research 
conducted via surveys to obtain input from industry professionals and subject matter experts. We hypothesize that 
despite the overlap in Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 corporations are not 100% ready to accommodate Industry 5.0. 
We hope that our findings will contribute to an increase in corporations taking steps to utilize the ideas related to 
Industry 5.0. We also hope that this research will provide clarity to the differentiation between Industry 4.0 and 
Industry 5.0 and bridge the gap, resulting in a successful implementation of Industry 5.0.

1. Introduction
Industries are an integral part of the country’s economy because they produce material goods that are highly 
automatized and meet the customer’s demands. However, due to the rapid increase in customer demand in the 21st 
century, companies need to enhance themselves by integrating modern technology. 
In 2011, Germany along with the federal government and universities was the first to come up with the concept of 
Industry 4.0 (Reis and Gins 2017). It was a revolutionary concept that aimed to improve products by rapidly increasing 
the production and efficiency of industries that manufacture the product. 
Starting from Industry 1.0, which took place in the 18th century, we can see the evolution of the industry going from 
stream power and mechanical production to Industry 2.0 in the 19th century, which was characterized, by electricity 
and mass production assembly line. Industry 3.0, which took place in the mid 20th century, consisted of industries 
that were equipped with semi-automation. Industry 4.0 is a transition from 3.0 which integrates the Internet of Things 
in existing industries to a cyber-physical system that increases the overall performance of the industry. The evolution 
of the industry from 1.0 to 4.0 is depicted in a diagram in Figure 1 (Dilmé and de Huet 2021).

hands-on learning experience that integrates interdisciplinary knowledge, fosters technical proficiency, and 
encourages innovation. By working on mechatronics projects, students gain practical exposure to advanced 
manufacturing technologies, automation, IoT, cyber-physical systems, and data analytics—key components of 
Industry 4.0. 
Educational institutions should continue to evolve their mechatronics programs to align with the latest Industry 4.0 
trends and technologies. By doing so, they will produce graduates who are well-equipped to lead and succeed in the 
rapidly changing industrial landscape, contributing to the advancement of smart manufacturing and beyond. 
In summary, mechatronics projects are an indispensable part of engineering education, bridging the gap between 
theoretical knowledge and practical application, and ultimately preparing students for the challenges and opportunities 
presented by Industry 4.0.

Abstract 
For patients suffering with back pain, getting a consultation appointment with a spine surgeon is sometimes a time-
consuming procedure that involves patients having to wait up to 12 weeks between MRI tests and interactions with 
orthopedic doctors to determine if they are candidates for surgery. Notable problems include incorrect referrals, which 
result in many patients being referred to surgeons for unneeded spine surgeries. One of the largest Hospital Systems 
in Florida asked us for a machine learning tool to assess spine MRI scans, identify regions of spinal stenosis, and 
produce a probability score suggesting the possibility of surgery being required to resolve these issues.  Three major 
problems that require quick attention confront the existing approach for ranking individuals with lumbar spine pain in 
the lower back. Initially, orthopedic spine surgeons take a long time to evaluate patients who might not require surgery. 
Second, the success rates of roughly 60% for spine surgery in treating this kind of pain are less than ideal. Finally, the 
procedure is challenged by prolonged patient wait periods, which strain orthopedic spine doctors' schedules and 
postpone treatment.  Developing a proof-of-concept model and formulating a comprehensive long-term project 
management approach are the two primary goals of the project. Reducing patient wait times, maximizing surgeon 
schedules, and protecting the system's intellectual property are among the objectives. Our project leverages 
advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize decision-making processes in the medical field, particularly in 
determining the necessity of spine surgery from MRI images. Our aim extends beyond mere image classification; we 
strive to enhance the entire patient care system, from initial consultation to potential surgery, by integrating AI to 
improve efficiency, reduce costs, and optimize resource allocation. Our machine learning model is built on the 
principles of deep learning, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to process and analyze MRI images. 
By leveraging the layered architecture of CNNs, we enable the model to automatically learn and extract hierarchical 
features from the images. This deep learning approach allows our model to identify complex patterns and nuances in 
the medical images, improving the accuracy of our predictions and supporting more informed decision-making in 
spine surgery assessments. This model holds the potential to transform healthcare by providing quicker, more accurate 
diagnoses and ensuring timely interventions. As AI technology continues to evolve, our approach will adapt to 
incorporate new research and advancements, ensuring its continued relevance and effectiveness.  Implementing our 
machine learning spine MRI triage tool at Orlando Health is projected to significantly enhance their economic 
performance over the next five years. By improving efficiency and resource allocation, the weekly revenue is expected 
to grow from $2.6 million to $3.28 million. The ML model will save approximately $1 million annually in surgical 
wages by reducing unnecessary assessments and surgeries. Additionally, the tool will generate an estimated $192 
million in new surgical growth by accurately identifying and prioritizing candidates for surgery. Enhanced patient 
satisfaction and loyalty, driven by quicker and more accurate diagnoses, will contribute an additional $2 million 
annually. Furthermore, by minimizing human errors in documentation, the tool is projected to save $1 million annually 
in reimbursement loss prevention. In total, these improvements amount to an estimated value of $196 million over 
five years in cost savings and revenue growth. This demonstrates a substantial return on investment, underscoring the 
financial viability and transformative potential of our AI-driven approach in the medical field.
