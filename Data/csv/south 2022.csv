Abstract 
The advance in the production and dissemination of scientific knowledge around the world has been causing an 
increase in public actions to contribute to decision makers at specific levels of competence. Within this context, this 
study aims to analyze the impact of investments in public policies at the beginning of the academic research chain in 
Brazil, that is, scientific initiation and regional disparities about it. This research has a qualitative nature and is based 
on information obtained from the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development. As a result of this 
analysis, it was found that, despite the existence of a legal basis that protects the North, Northeast and Midwest 
regions, regional disparities are still critical. Additionally, the participation of private Higher Education Institutions 
in the Scientific Initiation scholarship system is still low, which is mainly due to the low quality of the projects 
presented by these institutions. Thus, more effective actions to reduce disparities and increase the quality of research 
in private Higher Education Institutions, such as, for example, the use of clear criteria and scripts in the notices for 
the evaluation of research projects, must be adopted by the governmental sphere of public policies to foster research 
in Brazil. 
Keywords: Scientific initiation, Promotion of research, public policy, Academic research. 
1. Introduction
The increase in the distribution of knowledge in the world can be expected to return in the proportion of one to three, 
that is, each 1% invested in research, which results in the production of knowledge and changes the size of the 
market through an assessment of competitiveness, can correspond to 3% of cutting edge technology that is exported 
(Braunerhjelm and Thulin, 2008; Ryzhkova and Prosvirkin, 2015; Dzhukha et al., 2017). This growth has provoked 
an increase in the movement of public actions to contribute to decision makers at specific levels of competence, 
being verified not only within the municipalities where the universities are located. The involvement in this set of 
interests of institutions and interactive, private and public organizations, is necessary to facilitate, for those 
responsible for the knowledge produced, the dissemination and exploration of possible solutions (Rauniar et al., 
2019).

5.  Conclusion 
When analyzing the information on investments in public policies for scientific initiation in Brazil, in the existing 
model, we find that, despite the legal basis that protects the North, Northeast and Midwest regions, regional 
disparities are still critical. In addition, the participation of private HEIs in the scientific initiation scholarship system 
is still low, which is mainly due to the low quality of the projects presented by these institutions, especially due to the 
low focus of these HEIs in the research field. Thus, more effective actions to reduce disparities and increase the 
quality of research in HEIs must be adopted by the governmental sphere of public policies to promote research in 
Brazil. In this sense, the objective of the research was met by making a critical analysis of the impact of investments 
in public policies at the beginning of the academic research chain in Brazil, that is, scientific initiation and regional 
disparities about this process. The research found difficulties in compiling the total of scientific initiation proposals 
submitted by all HEIs in the country, due to their scope and diversity. Thus, the analysis points to the need for a more 
in-depth study of the mechanisms that guide the distribution of resources for scientific initiation in Brazil.

Abstract 
The market of oil and gas encompasses long-term, high-risk projects, which leads companies to search for solutions 
that can bring more reliability and efficiency to their processes. Blockchain technology has emerged in the financial 
market but has expanded to other fields where one of the most promising markets for its use is in the supply chains of 
materials and services. By means of bibliographical research, it has been possible to identify the main applications of 
this technology, as well as to evaluate its current stage of deployment and its main aspects. It was possible to investigate 
replacement automation, modelling of logistics and supply operations, digitalization, costing, payment systems and 
smart contracts, which from a pool of several hundred publications, demonstrated to be the most important ones about 
the usage of blockchain in the supply chain.

1. Introduction
The expression ""supply chain"" was created in the 1990s in China along with the already then flourishing 
industrialization of the country. This early, the branch of logistics was stimulated by the so-called Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP), which focused on the integration of processes and data from corporations (GOMES, 2018). 
A supply chain can be defined as the processes that are related to the activities of transportation of resources and inputs, 
from the supplier to the final consumer, thus linking the companies from the initial source to their destination. Hence, 
such a network links both sides of a series of processes and activities which produce value in the form of products and 
services, ultimately placed in the hands of the end consumer. The supply chain management is based on a model that 
has the function of meeting the synergies through the integration of business processes, whose main purpose is to serve

Abstract 
Mouse dynamic-based behavioral biometrics can provide an extra layer of security for web applications while ensuring 
the usability of the application. It also minimizes the password-sharing issue faced by web-based service providers. 
Researchers have achieved this with two different models, namely Continuous Authentication (CA) and Periodic 
Authentication (PA). PA model authenticates the user regularly after a set of actions or a certain time duration whereas 
CA model authenticates the user after every single action. These models are evaluated based on accuracy metrics such 
as False Acceptance Rate (FAR), False Rejection Rate (FRR), and Area Under the Curve (AUC). However, the 
imposter detection time is also an important factor for evaluating CA and PA models. The main two metrics that have 
been introduced related to imposter detection time are the Average Number of Genuine Actions (ANGA) and the 
Average Number of Imposter Actions (ANIA). According to the literature, most of the CA models have been 
developed to authenticate the user while using the computer for general purposes. However, only a few models are 
have been proposed to authenticate users when they are using web applications. Further, the data sets that are used to 
develop the above CA models are also classified into two categories as web application-based activities and general 
application-based activities considering the way of data collection. Patterns and variations that occur naturally when 
users are interacting with their web applications using mouse are called web-based mouse dynamics which are mainly 
captured during navigating, and reading. Among the few research conducted on web application-based mouse dynamic 
continues authentication models, the imposter detection time-based matrices such as ANGA and ANIA have not been 
considered. This paper we therefore present an approach to increase the confidentiality of web applications using a 
continuous authentication model optimized to reduce imposter detection time based on the user’s mouse dynamics. 
The proposed approach first identifies the best mouse movement features to reduce the number of mouse movements 
and based on those identified features, then a CA model is developed to reduce the imposter detection time. Bogazici 
mouse dynamic dataset is used for the training and development of the CA model since this data set contains the 
details such as timestamp, pointer position, and interacted application. The input data set is trained using the best 
models that are identified from the literature, particularly the ones with high performance for accuracy and minimal 
block size. Finally, an evaluation is conducted related to the accuracy and response time, and those models are 
compared with existing models to identify the most optimal model for web applications which reduces the imposter 
detection time based on mouse behavior.

Abstract 
This study aims to explore the antecedents of supply chain collaboration (SCC) and then the relationship of the 
multidimensional construct of SCC with supply chain performance. The paper also delves into the mediating and 
moderating impact of commitment and transactional cost economics at the nexus of SCC and supply chain 
performance. A theoretical model and associated hypotheses were established, drawing upon the systematic review of 
the extant literature, transactional cost economic and resource-based theories. The model was empirically validated 
using Structural Equation Modelling on survey data from 635 managers of the agri-food supply chain in Tanzania. 
Results revealed that the most influencing SCC antecedents in the agri-food supply chain include incentive alignment, 
goal congruence, joint knowledge creation, and decision synchronisation. We also find that SCC as a higher-order 
construct significantly positively impacts supply chain performance (SCP). Further, the mediation-moderation test 
shows that the impact of SCC on supply chain performance is partially mediated by partners commitment while 
significantly moderated by transactional costs management. Supply chain partners who manage transactional costs 
recognise potential problems, monitor deviations, and halt the possibility of partners taking advantage of the 
relationship, enhancing better performance.  
Our study synthesised social exchange, resource based-view, transaction cost economies and resources dependency 
theories to explain how supply chain collaboration affects supply chain performance. As a result, supply chain 
collaboration construct and transaction cost economies have also been improved. This study is one of the first to 
uncover the role of transactional cost management in moderating the relationship between collaboration and supply 
chain performance. The findings show that chain partners who manage transactional costs recognise potential 
problems, monitor deviations, and the possibility of partners taking advantage of the relationship, resulting in better 
performance. Furthermore, this study addresses the literature's recurrent demand for broadening the analytical unit 
beyond dyadic relationships. As a result, this study broadens the scope of collaboration research beyond specific 
business and buyer-supplier relationships to a three-stage supply chain. 
The results inform managers that full benefits of collaboration can be reaped when firms share accurate, complete and 
relevant crops/products information, share ownership of expensive resources, especially agricultural equipment, 
storage and transport facilities; and set goals on issues such as transport and storage efficiency, production/sales 
efficiency and projected level of returns. Regarding collaborative communication, this study verifies that open and 
frequent adjusted and standardised two-way, multilevel correspondence is, for the most part, a better way of enhancing 
joint decisions and inter-connections. The causal influence of supply chain collaboration on supply chain performance 
is partially conveyed through partners commitment. Therefore, supply chain managers are advised to institute a 
commitment ethos in their respective organisations to enhance performance.

Abstract 
This work focused on the evaluation of the potential to produce a bio fertilizer from the blending of vermicompost and 
leached coal fly ash. A blended bio fertilizer with nitrogen (3.8-4.8%), phosphorous (3.3-4.5%) and potassium (3.7-
6.2%) was produced. The use of vermicompost fertilizer for blending will stabilize fly ash and give it novel properties 
that make it comparable to the generic chemical fertilizers.

1. Introduction
The vast amount of waste generated is still far from being fully utilized in its maximum as a product or by-product, 
making technological alternatives needed in order to reduce its environmental impact (Ahmaruzzaman, 2010). There 
are many reasons to increase the amount of waste being utilized. Firstly, disposal costs are minimized and secondly 
less area is reserved for disposal, thus enabling other uses of the land and decreasing disposal permitting requirements 
thirdly, there are financial returns from the sale of the by-product, lastly the by-products can replace some scarce or 
expensive natural resources (Santi et al., 2021). 
One major by-product is fly ash from combustion of coal, which is unsatisfactory disposed into ash dams or landfills 
(Das et al., 2013). This method of disposing ash is not the best solution both from the ecological and economic point 
of view. Therefore, there is continuing interest in establishing suitable processes in which fly ash can be efficiently 
reused. Fly ash is one of the residues created during the combustion process and comprises the fine particles that rise 
with flue gases (Seidel et al., 2001). Fly ash is a waste by-product material that must be disposed of or recycled 
(Bhattacharya et al., 2021). In the past fly ash produced from combustion was simply entrained in flue gases and 
released into the atmosphere which created environmental concerns that prompted EMA to regulate emissions down 
to less than 1% of total fly ash produced by ZPC.

Abstract 
Entrepreneurship is vital in economic advancement and global competitiveness. Entrepreneurship education has 
shown a rapid growth worldwide as education provides an environment that will stimulate the growth of the learner; 
and facilitates innovation and competition. Transformative changes in entrepreneurship education provide students 
with an environment to grow and sharpen their entrepreneurial skills and exploit innovation opportunities. Academic 
entrepreneurship education delivers sustainability within the education system by improving knowledge and 
competencies of entrepreneurship and provides avenues for more advantageous learning. In this paper recent 
entrepreneurship education studies were reviewed to understand the trends and development in entrepreneurship 
education studies. The research mainly focused on the status of innovative methods in entrepreneurship education 
and outlined current innovative methods that are being implemented to inspire a dynamic and self-regulating attitude 
and a mindset in learners for new opportunities. Among innovative methods, technology-enhanced learning and 
using various technology platforms are found very helpful in bringing about social awareness and innovation from 
students. Digital technologies and e-skill are outlined very helpful in increasing knowledge retention and 
engagement in a particular topic in entrepreneurship settings to better prepare students for the challenges that are 
most certainly ahead in the future.  Also, it is important to adjust different techniques used in teaching to correspond 
to the needs of the students with multidisciplinary backgrounds. The paper summarizes future research suggestions 
on research directions in technology enhanced learning and includes implications of interdependence between 
learning and economic growth.

Abstract 
The use of scheduling techniques in ready mixed concrete (RMC) firms in Bolivia is a complex problem. The authors 
developed a linear model for a Bolivian RMC firm taking into account the research context. This model integrated 
RMC truck dispatch data to decide the optimal RMC supply schedule. The authors used historical dispatching data, 
interviews, and field measurements to build a database and characterize the firm's demand to build an optimized 
model. A solution algorithm using Solver from Excel was developed to efficiently solve the optimal RMC supply 
scheduling problem. Afterward, the solution was compared using actual operational data. The results show that the 
solution algorithm increases RMC supply efficiency and saves costs.

1. Introduction
RMC is a material composed of cement, water, sand, and gravel and is mostly used in the construction industry (Afzal 
& Khan 2018). This material has some physical and chemical characteristics that generate certain limitations in its 
production and distribution. Specifically, different to other industries, in the RMC industry, due to the fast-solidifying 
nature of concrete, it cannot be produced in advance and subsequently stored in a finished product warehouse (Feng 
et al. 2004). On the other hand, it follows specific formulations depending on the requirements of each customer (Afzal 
& Khan 2018). Moreover, time is a significant factor in this type of industry. According to (Biruk 2015), the time 
elapsed between mixing and placement of RMC on-site should not exceed its solidification time. Thus, according to 
Afzal & Khan (2018), RMC is only productive if distributed promptly to customers. Moreover, Biruk (2015) states 
that time is the crucial factor because delays can lead to wastage of the whole batch, making it mathematically complex 
to model and optimize. Therefore, due to material characteristics and time constraints, RMC supply scheduling is 
critical for construction firms. 
Bolivia is experiencing rapid infrastructure growth and, thus, RMC demand (INE 2021). Inside RMC Bolivian firms' 
day-to-day operations, the dispatch process is not based on technical knowledge but instead on the experience of its 
personnel. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study of supply cycle times in Bolivia to determine the 
process times and the factors that affect them. Also, a firm's data are not adequately processed, which generates a large 
amount of wasted information. Hence, Bolivian RMC firms do not efficiently process and distribute their products. 
We studied an RMC firm in Cochabamba-Bolivia to analyze and optimize their supply cycle time. In particular, we 
performed interviews with the firm's personnel and collected raw data from the supply process. Next, through linear 
programming, we developed a solution using Excel to help the firm schedule the RMC delivery in Cochabamba-
Bolivia. The following section will present relevant literature to our study, followed by the methodology, data 
collection, and analyses. Finally, we will present the results, discussion, and conclusion.

Next, we used random demand values to compare the historical and optimized supply cycle times from the model 
included in the Excel worksheet. Compared to historical data, we found that the optimized model reduces the supply 
cycle times by 28% (see Table 11). Moreover, using ANOVA, we found that the reduction in supply cycle times was 
statistically significant (F = 15.48; p < 0.05). Hence, the optimized supply model significantly increases RMC  supply 
efficiency.

6. Conclusion 
Our study makes two contributions to Latin American and Bolivian literature. First, to the best of our knowledge, this 
is the first study to develop an optimized RMC supply model. Second, based on Feng et al. (2004) and Albayrak and 
Albayrak (2016), we propose an optimized supply model for RMC firms. Hence, our findings suggest the usability of 
optimized models in developing countries, such as Bolivia. Specifically, we developed a flow chart to develop the 
optimized supply model, performed semi-structured interviews with the firm's mixer truck operators, and collected 
historical information on truck supply cycle times. Next, using the collected information, we determined the average 
supply cycle times, and thus we created an optimized linear transportation model based on Feng et al. (2004) and 
Albayrak and Albayrak. Afterward, we used Solver from Microsoft Excel to solve the model. Then, we performed 
simulations of both current and optimized supply models using different demand values, districts, and jobs. Later, we 
implemented the solution in a Microsoft Excel Worksheet to automatically and optimally assign clients to trucks, 
RMC plants, truck departure and arrival times to construction districts, RMC loading and unloading times, and truck 
departure and arrival times to RMC plants. Next, we validated the model using random demand values to compare the 
historical and optimized supply cycle times. The optimized supply model decreases average supply cycle times by 
28%. Moreover, our optimized model reduces the RMC supply costs from 10 to 7 USD/m3.  
 
All studies have limitations, and ours is no exception. First, future studies can increase the accuracy of our results 
using RMC geospatial data to develop better scheduling models. Second, our study context was in Cochabamba, a 
small city with a concentration of construction sites in specific districts. Future studies can determine if our model 
shows similar performance in bigger cities where construction sites are evenly distributed. We expect that our model 
will inspire future researchers in Bolivia and Latin America to develop optimized RMC supply models according to 
the context where they live.

Abstract 
Sustainable business performance needs company’s achievement to any set goals. This achievement needed in 
every kind of business, including The Heritage Hotel. Therefore, Heritage Hotel must be able to show some 
innovative method to attract consumer to buy the product offered. One of the innovative ways is to make Virtual 
Reality. This Study aim to examine the effect of Virtual Reality based by user experience queries to Heritage 
hotel, and their impact to sustainable business performance. Data collection gained by survey with purposive 
sampling approach. Data was analysed using path analysis – PLS. The results showed that Virtual Reality based 
on attractiveness and stimulation have no significant effect to Heritage Hotel, but perspicuity, efficiency, 
dependability, and novelty have significant effect to Heritage Hotel. Heritage Hotel has no significant effect to 
social performance and economic performance, but it has significant effect to environmental performance.

1. Introduction
Business performance can be interpreted as the result of the implementation of a series of activities carried out by 
all elements within the company as a process of achieving goals by fulfilling several indicators (Sebestova et al. 
2020). Good business performance will be seen from the level of productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency as 
well. A good level of productivity can be demonstrated through the company's ability to produce products or 
services that can meet and be in demand by consumers in the market. The level of effectiveness relates to the 
company's achievement of any previously set goals. Meanwhile, the company's ability to manage and utilize the 
resources it has to carry out business activities will affect the company's efficiency level. These three elements, 
namely productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency, are the main elements that reflect the performance of a 
company (Cornerstone 2020). 
Several studies have successfully proven the relationship between certain variables and business performance. 
Fairoz, et al (2010) discover the influence of entrepreneurial orientation with business performance. Calantone, et 
al (2001) find a positive and significant influence of innovation on business performance. The dimensions for 
measuring business performance also vary. Some researchers use the financial dimension. Other researchers use 
the non-financial dimension. There are also those who combine financial and non-financial performance. Business 
performance must be able to defend itself from various dynamic economic, environmental, and social situations. 
If the company succeeds in maintaining this state, then the company is considered to meet the requirements of the 
sustaining company.  
Business sustainability is reflected in the adoption of such strategies and activities that can address the 
requirements of economic entities and its current beneficiaries, while at the same time protects, supporting and 
improving human and natural resources for the future (Labuschagne et al. 2005). The triple Bottom Line, proposed 
by Elkington (1998), facilitates the application of sustainability in the investigations, as well as in the decision-
making process (Asadi et al. 2020). According to this concept, the maintenance of the balance between the 
environmental, social, and economic parameters of the organizations is essential to move to sustainable 
development (Nilashi 2019).

5.1.  Structural model assessment 
The model was validated through the bootstrap method, simulating 500 subsamples to determine, in the first 
measure, the significance of the correlations between the dimensions (for a t > 1.96 product of a two-tailed test 
and confidence level of 95 %). The model proposes nine significant relationships between Virtual Reality practices 
(Attractiveness, Perspicuity, Efficiency, Dependability, Stimulation, Novelty) to Heritage Hotel, and between 
Heritage Hotel to Sustainable Business Performance (Social Performance, Environmental Performance, 
Economic Performance). From Table 5, the result showed confirms the correlations between Perspicuity to 
Heritage Hotel (8.655>1,96), Efficiency to Heritage Hotel (2.792 >1,96), Dependability to Heritage Hotel (2.020 
> 1,96), Novelty to Heritage Hotel (27.130 > 1,96), and Heritage Hotel to Environmental Performance (2.984 
>1,96). There is no correlations on attractiveness to Heritage Hotel (1.813 < 1,96), Stimulation to Heritage Hotel 
(1.088 < 1,96) and Heritage Hotel to Economic performance (1.275 < 1,96).

6.  Conclusion 
The adoption of technology in operational activities in the hospitality industry has begun, especially the adoption 
of technology aimed at promoting hotels. Forms of technology such as room booking services through websites, 
standalone applications, and third-party service applications are carried out to adjust to the latest technological 
trends including adjusting to the wishes of guests. Heritage-type hotels also perform this service, namely by 
creating a Virtual Reality that describes the state of the hotel, showing all the facilities offered by the hotel and 
the services that will be provided to guests. The study aims to examine the effects that Virtual Reality may have

53","with attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty that can affect Heritage Hotels, 
as well as the effect Heritage Hotels have on sustainable business performance. Virtual reality in this study as a 
whole was able to explain the effect of 74% on Heritage Hotel, and Heritage hotel can explain its effect on 
sustainable business performance with a social performance influence value of 64.4%, Environmental 
performance by 0.9% and economic performance by 4.7%. In addition, as the results show, visitors' assessment 
of virtual reality in terms of perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, and novelty has a significant effect on heritage 
hotels. This shows that virtual reality is quite capable of displaying Heritage Hotel with all the products offered 
and making visitors feel comfortable, easy to operate virtual reality independently, and love the programs offered. 
However, visitors find this program less attractive, because it does not feel friendly or has not displayed the 
hospitality of Heritage Hotel services that are usually received if they come directly to the hotel. Virtual reality 
programs are also considered insignificant in terms of stimulation because most visitors do not feel stimulated to 
access the program back. The visitor's assessment of the influence of Heritage Hotel on Sustainable business 
performance with social performance factors is not significant, because visitor satisfaction is not met. Visitors still 
prefer to come directly to the Heritage Hotel location as opposed to accessing virtual reality programs. The 
influence of heritage hotels on economic performance is also not significant. This is because visitors feel that they 
do not use the facilities offered by Heritage Hotel directly, nor do they feel it costs anything to improve the 
economic side of the Heritage hotel, by accessing heritage hotel through virtual reality. As far as the authors know, 
this study is one of the first experimental studies conducted to examine the impact of Virtual Reality on Heritage 
Hotels in Indonesia, and their relationship to sustainable business performance. The findings obtained here play 
an important role in understanding how virtual reality can be done in the hotel industry. Advice for further 
research, so that the research is carried out again in non-heritage hotels, so that it can be compared to the results 
so that the hotel industry has new insights when developing virtual reality programs in hotels.

Abstract 
A recurring and expensive operation in company’s warehouses is the picking. Operators who execute this activity 
perform repetitive physical movements and carry objects constantly, which can trigger musculoskeletal disorders. 
Adittionally, there is a great consumption of energy by the operators, which could have negative consequences in the 
long term. Health damages could reduce the quality of the company’s service and productivity due to the increase in 
absenteeism of the personnel because of the recovery. The objective of the investigation is the application of an 
optimization model to reduce energy consumption during picking through the redistribution of product lines within a 
warehouse. The warehouse under study belongs to a Peruvian distributor with several lines of products for mass 
consumption. The applied model will be the one proposed by Diefenbach & Glock. The data of the current situation 
taken were: demand, average weights per line, efforts, distances and locations, which were coded in “A Mathematical 
Programming Language” (AMPL) and solved using the CPLEX solver. The results show 4.4% reduction in energy 
expenditure compared to the current distribution and 6.0% compared to randomly generated distributions. Finally, the 
optimal distribution by product lines is presented as a result of the modelling that reduces effort.

1. Introduction
The commerce and services sectors within Peru drive an important part of the economy since they together account 
for approximately 50% of the GDP (National Institute of Statistics and Informatics [INEI] 2021) and comprise 87% 
of the national active companies (INEI 2021). 
In the management of commercial companies, as well as services, warehouses play an important role: first, they 
safeguard the quality of the products during the entire time of stay (from the moment they enter until they are retrieved

56","After analyzing the layout proposed by the model, the following question comes into mind: which variable in the 
optimization model influences the most to determine product location? For this point, we present Figures 5 and 6 that 
show the relation between each variable (frequency and weight) and the product location.  
 
 
 
Figure 5. Weigth per location 
 
 
 
Figure 6. Frequency per location 
 
As evidenced by the foregoing figures, the variable that influences product location the most in the three levels k is 
picking frequency, since the locations closest to the order preparation area show higher frequency, which decreases 
as products are placed further away.  
 
Furthermore, the weight variable was found to have an important relation to the levels where products are placed, 
since a higher concentration of “heavy” product lines is observed in the lower levels, whereas lighter products are 
found in upper levels.  
 
6. Conclusion 
As picking involves repetitive motion and loading products, it may lead to the development of musculoskeletal 
disorders and to considerable energy expenditure, which may ultimately bring about negative effects on human health. 
The issue arises when we try to order the product lines in such a way as to mitigate the abovementioned problems.

65","Therefore, this research aimed at analyzing how warehouses manage to reduce the efforts of operators in the picking 
process by means of an optimization model.  
 
In this sense, the model was applied in the warehouse of Tusan Distribuidores, a Peruvian distributor with different 
product lines distributed on shelves of up to three levels. We obtained the following main results of the research:  
 
• 
An optimal layout manages to reduce 6% of energy expenditure compared to random layouts and 4.4% compared 
to the current layout of the warehouse.   
• 
The proposed layout manages to mitigate the development of musculoskeletal disorders by reducing the effort of 
the operators. Likewise, this is beneficial for the operator’s health for requiring less than 300 kcal/h as 
recommended by Mital (2017) and generates energy savings compared to the original layout.   
• 
It is suggested to place high-demand products in the areas next to the order preparation area and balance their 
distribution with low rotation products. 
• 
A direct relationship exists between the distance, weight and frequency variables and the reduction of efforts after 
the application of the optimization model.  
• 
When the three variables that influence the objective function of effort show a wider range, i.e., a larger warehouse 
(distance), a higher variability in the demand per product line (frequency), and a higher variability in the weight 
per product line, there is a stronger chance that the model reduces the effort to a greater extent.

Abstract 
In the last decades, private debt collection has become an important industry in Ecuador. Debt collection Agencies are 
organizations that manage the process of collecting money from delinquent debts and their performance is often 
measured by the collection success rate. However, determining which clients will repay their liabilities is a complex 
process and many times subjectively judged. Machine learning (ML) models have been successfully implemented on 
the financing sector for various applications, however a limited amount of work has been published in the prediction 
of a client´s debt payment probability.  In this study, ML models are trained to predict a client´s payment probability 
to an Ecuadorian Debt Collection Agency the first three months after signing a payment agreement. Specifically, a 
feedforward neural network, logistic regression, and gradient boosting ensemble models are implemented using the 
SEMMA data mining methodology, which comprises the steps of sample, explore, modify, model, and assess. 
Furthermore, by analyzing the results of the models, relevant features that determine whether a costumer will pay or 
not its debt are identified. The results show that neural networks perform better than the competing models in terms 
of classification accuracy.

1. Introduction
Financial institutions lend credit to costumers, when their current cash availability is not enough to meet their 
requirements. A debt then is generated, and it becomes delinquent when there is no payment made in the established 
agreement or billing notice (U.S. Treasury 2015). Delinquent debts can be a problem for both costumers and creditors, 
as the collection process involved is time consuming and resources should be focused to commit to the original 
agreement.  
Creditors often have a well-defined procedure for collection, where they try to contact the debtors through written 
communications, telephone, or personal contact. Successful debt collection is very important to the profitability of the 
business (Rial 2008), so when the creditors are not able to collect the money, the debts are sent to third-party debt 
collection agencies (DCAs). DCAs are organizations that manage the process of collecting money from delinquent 
debts and their performance is often measured by the collection success rate. These companies have the option of 
managing the collection or making the debt theirs by buying it from financial institutions at a lower value (Beck et al. 
2017).

68","6. Conclusion  
In this work, a study was conducted in an Ecuadorian Debt Collection Agency to develop a ML model that predicts 
the clients that will pay their debt after signing a payment agreement. The problem was formulated as a supervised 
classification problem, following the SEMMA methodology for data mining projects. In the exploratory data analysis, 
the distribution of the variables was analyzed as well as the relationship between them. On the modify step, the null 
values were treated, and a forward stepwise selection method was used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and 
select the most important variables. On the model phase, the SMOTE oversampling technique was applied to the 
unbalanced data set to reduce the disproportionality of the minority class during training. A logistic regression, 
gradient boosting ensemble, and neural network model were implemented due to their interpretability and capability 
to model the response variable. The models were evaluated in the assess phase using the metrics of sensitivity, 
precision, specificity, ROC curve, and AUC. The results show that the neural network model outperformed the 
competing models in the prediction of the first- and second-month payment, while the gradient boosting performed 
best during the third month prediction in terms of sensitivity. Hence, it is recommended to use a neural network to 
classify customers based on the overall performance on the three months. Furthermore, it was found that the variables 
that affects if a client will pay the next months after an agreement are transferor, qualification in the risk center, 
education level, and purchase value. The DCA should put emphasizes in analyzing these variables before buying a 
debt and determining with which clients to sign first the payment agreement.

Abstract  
 
Chile is one of the most ageing countries in South America. By 2050, the population over 60 will be 31.2% 
reaching 6.9 million older adults. Another significant increase in the past five years has been the use of social 
media. According to data from 2020, the use of social networks has grown between 180-200% since the pandemic. 
This study explores which topics are related to older adults and what is said about them on massive media Twitter 
accounts and from influential broadcasters. Our analysis platform is Twitter, and the method of analysis is a Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). With this method, we search for topics related to older adults in the past four years 
in Chile using keywords. This exam was possible thanks to LDAtweetsES, a graphical interface for topics that 
analyses tweets in Spanish. The results indicate a total of nine different topics included in 10.139 tweets. These 
topics were classified into different categories associated with older adults: violence, opinion, economics, and 
COVID-19. The interpretation of the topics led to an emotional analysis including eight emotions: anger, 
anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust. Results exposed a strong presence of trust and fear in 
all the topics, with 18% of the existence of fear in pandemic-related topics and 32% of the company of trust in 
pension-related topics. This was made possible through searching for terms linked to each emotion in the study 
of tweets.

1. Introduction 
Ageing countries have been a phenomenon affecting developing countries in the past decades. This demographic 
change results from lower fertility rates and high life expectancy.  According to population gets older, 
technological changes have been increasing. The technologies and developments are something that we see daily. 
In particular, Chile is a country with a population of 19,23 million, with 17,7 million Internet users. 
(DataReportal,2022). This implies that the Internet penetration in the country is 92%. The same website, a year 
ago, showed that the population was 19,16 million, and the Internet users reached 15,78 million. Users boost 
12,2% in 2021.  Currently, people older than 65 belong to 13,2% of the population, and it’s been estimated that 
in the year 2050, this age group will reach 31,2% of the population. Also, it’s estimated that by 2031, the number 
of older adults will exceed the population of people younger than 15 years (INE 2018). 
 
In line with technological changes, more people are born, people that can be considered “Digital Natives” because 
practically they have been raised using technology. On the other hand, elderly people are considered “Digital 
Immigrants” because they must learn how to use digital technology since they use much more analogical 
technology.  In this context. ¿How do we refer to elderly people? This generational gap can be measured by 
checking how we communicate because the use of language can leave emotional traces. This hard work of sorting 
out information according to human emotions was delegated to software. Specifically, for the effect of this study, 
we search about what is said about older adults in massive communication media. We choose to work with Twitter 
because the information you find corresponds to a live reflection of what is trending, and the tweets can’t be 
modified. 
 
On the other hand, Twitter has investigation tools that allow analysing of large volumes of data. We searched 
tweets from the past four years in Chile (2018 to 2021); that way, we can notify changes due to the COVID-19

Abstract 
 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has wreaked havoc on various sectors worldwide affecting people with 
compromised immunity. A healthy diet plan should include adequate levels of select micronutrients and 
macronutrients to enhance immunity. Although dietary habits can be modified, the cost of nutritious food has been a 
significant challenge to Filipino adults due to its cost. Through Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), a low-
cost healthy meal plan is developed following the recommended nutritional intake of a healthy adult. 120 survey 
respondents aged 19-50 years old from National Capital Region (NCR) initially participated in this study. After 
exclusion criteria for defined healthy adults, eligible participants proceeded in the second phase. Data collection on 
socio-demographic, anthropometry, and the participants’ food intake was accomplished. Long-term dietary habits 
were acquired through 24-hour Food Recall Record and Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). A majority of female 
respondents did not reach the recommended daily intake of Vitamin A(465±519.44mcg), Vitamin 
D(24±61.12IU/mcg), 
Vitamin 
C(72±156.96mg), 
Vitamin 
E(18±32.90mg), 
Zinc(14±8.02mg), 
Selenium(110±108.77mcg), and daily Protein intake. The same with majority of male respondents in Vitamins 
A(462±417.40mcg), D(19±31.20IU/mcg), C(50±48.18mg), E(22±38.94mg), and Protein. The remained 391 food 
items were the variables in the model with 31 constraints and four models were optimized for both males and females 
which resulted in a 7-day meal plan. The model optimization identified food items in a minimum cost of ₱68.75 and 
₱69.08 for Males aged 19-29 and 30-50 years old, respectively. For females, a cost of ₱71.13 (for aged 19-29) and 
₱82.57 (for aged 30-50 years old) were obtained.

1. Introduction  
Epidemic outbreaks are distinct from other cataclysms because of two different characteristics: long-term disturbance 
and exponential increase. Failure to manage such disasters creates significant disruptions in supply chains and 
populations, resulting in irreversible losses. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of these disasters that has 
wreaked havoc on supply chains worldwide, especially in the healthcare industry (Govindan, Mina, & Alavi, 2020). 
COVID-19 is an acute illness, but it can be fatal in extreme cases. It was identified last December 2019 in Wuhan, 
China, which has infected 26 countries worldwide (Xu et al., 2020). The World Health Organization (WHO) 
announced COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international significance. In 215 countries, over 3 million 
injuries were reported, and over 200,000 deaths were confirmed by May 2, 2020. Despite the closing of critical 
transport borders, reported cases and deaths are emerging, possibly because of population transmission and expanded 
ability for research (Nzediegwu & Chang, 2020). COVID-19 symptoms can range from asymptomatic to severe cases, 
including coughing, fever, and shortness of breath (Rothan & Byrareddy, 2020). Acute respiratory failure syndrome, 
acute coronary problems, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, septic shock, and death are possible symptoms in 
more severe cases. The outbreak of this new infectious disease has been moving rapidly (Bansal, 2020; Singhal, 2020; 
Zhou et al., 2020; Kochi, Tagliari, Forleo, Fassini, & Tondo, 2020). To combat the epidemic, strict nationwide policies 
have been adopted, including social distancing policies and urging or even requiring people to stay at home. 
Individuals are often at a loss about appropriate dietary habits and sufficient nutrient status to remain healthy, 
particularly during this self-containment, which is often viewed as exhausting. A stable, functioning immune system

Abstract. 
From the 1990s, the public administration introduced in its activities the intensive use of technologies to make its processes 
more efficient. The goal is to provide better services to citizens. Since then, and derived from the new information and 
communication technologies, governments have evolved towards their digitalization. In this context, this article shows the 
evolution of digital government at a global level based on the comparison between countries with the highest degree of 
development in this area. Likewise, the most advanced cases in the application of new technologies in public administration 
are shown.

1. Introduction 
Generally, the use of information and communication technologies in governments worldwide can be included in a process 
that has developed in four major moments (Andersen and Dawes, 1991). The first is found in the late 1950s and the entire 
1960s, which was characterized by the introduction of the computer. Years later, as a second moment, the governments of 
industrialized countries had mainframe computers to meet their own processing needs, such as information contained in 
population censuses (Gil-García and Luna Reyes, 2008). During the 1980s and early 90s, computer technology had a great 
increase. The birth of personal computers entailed a great deal of processing power. This caused the reduction of space and 
the cheapening of the equipment. Therefore, governments were able to acquire more computers, and thus began with the 
training of public officials for their use. By the beginning of the new century, the development of the internet and computer 
networks had created new opportunities for the development of applications and governance systems. This gave rise to a new 
moment in which the so-called information and communication technologies enter fully. Thus, the so-called ""Electronic 
Government"" was born, or for some other authors, also called: ""digital government"" (Gronlund and Horan, 2005). 
 
In this sense, it is necessary to clarify the difference between e-government and digital government. The first refers to the use 
of information and communication technologies by governments towards citizens (the latter are passive). The relationship is 
unidirectional and is as it had been in the first decade of this century. For its part, the second, also takes as a reference to these 
technologies. But also, it extends them to the use by citizens to influence the government (citizenship is participatory). In this 
concept the link is bidirectional and current to our times (OECD, 2016). E-government was born in the United States of 
America. Especially, in 1998 in which it was used for the elimination of bureaucratic paperwork. President Bill Clinton issued 
a memorandum asking his administration agencies to build the necessary Internet e-government infrastructure by December 
2000.  With the entry of the new century, developed countries began to expand the use of e-government, mainly those 
belonging to the G7 (Group of Seven), such as: United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and 
Japan. All of them with an advanced infrastructure in terms of information and communication technologies. It was not until 
2001, when the United Nations tried to carry out the first studies on this subject at a global level.

blockchain system associated with the government itself (http://migri.fi/vastaanottoraha). 
 
Helsinki's ""Infoshare"" service aims to make the city's information accessible quickly and easily to its inhabitants. This is a 
website where statistical data are offered on urban phenomena, living conditions, economy, employment and even urban 
traffic of this metropolis and its conurbation. This information can be used for scientific research, decision-making, 
journalistic activities, etc. Likewise, they can be consulted by the citizens themselves, companies, universities or the local 
administration itself. The data is free and can be processed in different home storage programs such as computers, cell phones 
or tablets(http://www.hri.fi/en/). 
 
3.5 Sydney, Australia. Local citizen participation. 
This city provides a variety of opportunities for its citizens. Through digital chats they can participate in workshops and 
community meetings, round tables, online consultations, reference groups, advisory panels, walk-in sessions, school 
workshops, etc. The results of consultations and participation are collected, analyzed and considered as inputs to the decision-
making process of the local city council. This participation is governed by the principles of integrity, inclusivity, dialogue and 
influence to make effective the collaboration of citizens(http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au). 
 
3.6 Texas, USA. Maternal care through text messages. 
The ""Text4Baby"" program is a Texas government initiative that provides information to pregnant women and new moms on 
how to care for themselves, their baby during pregnancy, and in the infant's first year of life. This program is aimed at women 
who live in a disadvantaged environment and who do not have access to the internet. Despite these problems, it is very likely 
that they have a cell phone, so this initiative sends them text messages in English or Spanish once a week. The evaluation of 
this initiative has had a high acceptance rate. In addition, it contributes to the increase of the knowledge of the users about 
maternal care. Also, better engagement with health care providers and greater acceptance of vaccines. ""Tex4Baby"" is a 
partnership between the Texas government and non-profit civil society organizations of more than 700 partners. Despite using 
a simple technology, it has shown its effectiveness by being very focused on a priority group such as disadvantaged pregnant 
women(https://www.text4baby.org/). 
 
As has been seen, the countries with the highest rates of digital government have tangible strategies for technological 
application. These range from basic technologies such as the use of text messages to the blockchain. All of them serve to be 
more efficient in their public management, and of course, for citizen participation. Both, pillars of digital government. 
 
4. Conclusions. 
Throughout this paper, what is meant by electronic government and its evolution in digital government has been analyzed. It 
was observed that this began with greater force in the United States and in traditional economic powers such as Canada, 
France, Germany or the United Kingdom. However, in recent years there has been a trend where Asian countries (South 
Korea, Singapore), oceanic (Australia, New Zealand), Nordic (Denmark, Sweden, Finland) and even ex-Soviet republics such 
as Estonia have taken the lead in this matter. This is because they have been able to channel the use of new information and 
communication technologies (blockchain, social networks, electronic votes or artificial intelligence) in their public 
administrations. The tangible application examples are a sample of the way in which the governments of these countries have 
not stagnated in the use of personal computers, cell phones or the internet. What is exposed in this article is focused on the 
countries that are spearheading digital government. More questions remain to be answered: what happens in other less 
developed regions such as Africa or Latin America? Of course, their progress is much less. But, without a doubt, they will 
also deserve a specific study.

Abstract  
 
In the present work, the CRISP-DM methodology was proposed to develop a set of machine learning models applied 
to evaluate cervical cancer risk suffer. For this research, a sample of 858 patients was taken, who were asked a series 
of questions regarding this pathology. The database has an unbalanced dependent variable, since this is a health study, 
the balancing technique will not be used to identify the variables that will enter the model, the Boruta library was used 
for variable selection. For the development, five algorithms will be used: Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision 
trees using the CHAID and CART algorithms, logistic regression and ""asymmetric link"" models. The models proposed 
in this work were refined by means of the Auc, Gini, Log loss and KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) indicators, as a result 
using the proposed models, AUC values of 98% were obtained.

1. Introduction  
Cervical cancer occurs in the lower part of the uterus, this type of pathology is one of the most common and with high 
mortality rate if not detected in time. Various strains of human papillomavirus (HPV), or a sexually transmitted 
infection, play an important role in causing most types of cervical cancer. Most used test to detect are Hinselmann, 
Schiller, citology and biopsy (Moldovan, 2020), which are very methods to detect this oncology pathology. Because 
sexually transmitted infections play an important role in the risk of having cervical cancer, variables with information 
on sexually transmitted infections were included in the study (Islami et al. 2017; Sindiani et al. 2020). In this sense, 
our work presents a predictive model using machine learning techniques to classify patients which might be more 
likely to have cervical cancer and thus be able to detect them and prevent future deaths.  
 
This paper has been structured as follows: Sections 2 and 3 describe the literature reviewed and our research 
methodology. Section 4 discusses data treatment and modeling. Section 5 provides results and the improvements 
proposed. Finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions and recommendations for future lines of research on the subject 
matter. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
For these purposes of this work, the following objectives were defined 
• 
Design a predictive classification model to determine who is more likely to be at risk of cervical cancer. 
• 
Compare models using unbalanced data  
 
2. Literature Review  
Machine learning applied to solve health problems is a big trend on different phases of medical research. On the 
diagnostic phase different ensemble models can obtain good results as reported in Hsu, et al. (2021). The main aspect

It will be interesting to try other variable selection techniques to determine the best variables before creating the 
models, for example: Stepwise, Forward, and penalized models such as Lasso regularization. In addition, algorithms 
such as Random Forest, neural networks, etc. could be applied to evaluate performance 
 
6. Conclusion 
In our study Cloglog algorithm is slightly superior to Scobit, both algorithms perform better analyzing different 
performance metrics in comparison to other traditional methods. These algorithms have better predictive application 
on obtaining cervical cancer risk due to the fact dataset is unbalanced.

Abstract 
Distance learning has been advancing in today’s time given the continuous enhancement of technology in the world. 
Moreover, with the COVID-19 Pandemic that hit nationwide, the education sector had to turn to distance learning in 
order to save the education of students in this generation. The research aims to analyze how engineering students’ 
personal and academic experiences under an unusual online set-up create an impact on their well-being as an 
individual. Through the dissemination of survey questionnaires to the students, the researchers will measure the results 
through statistical analysis. With that, the independent variables identified in the study are manipulated into WarpPLS 
to foresee their relationship with the determined dependent variable through Structural Equation Modeling. It enables 
a concrete evaluation of which factors affect a student of abundant or sparse weight.

1. Introduction 
Upon the start of the COVID-19 Pandemic, online learning became the solution to the predicament the educational 
sector faces. However, despite the countermeasures, challenges throughout the journey were inevitable. Identifying 
the components that affect the performance of the students will greatly assist both private and public educational 
institutions to analyze and improve the existing systems they use in implementing Outcome-Based Education to 
engineering students. Additionally, the results of the study will not only help the engineering departments but may 
also serve as a basis to other educational programs in improving the systems they use to fully utilize the potential of 
the students. 
 
1.1 Online Modality 
There has been a rapid shift in the delivery of course instructions from the traditional way to distance learning. In the 
Philippines, it became necessary for most schools to pivot to online classes for learning because of the COVID-19 
pandemic since most areas in the country are under strict quarantine restrictions. This sudden shift has led to shock 
and tension among students and faculty members, whether personally or professionally (Khalaf, 2020). 
 
Different video conferencing applications and learning management systems are being used to transmit smooth 
communication and distribution of learning materials and activities online between teachers and students. This called 
for institutions to adapt and innovate to continue delivering course content amidst crises. 
 
In order to properly facilitate this type of education, the preparedness of the institution and the motivation for online 
learning of the students must also be taken into consideration to form an understanding between the instructor and its

Abstract 
 
There are many ways for businesses to advertise their products to their respective target markets. This includes digital 
marketing, content marketing, user-generated marketing, and many more. In general, most businesses nowadays use 
a mixture of marketing tools in each of their marketing strategies, not a lot stay in line in utilising just one. In relation 
to that, Ponipake as a business focuses on utilising word of mouth marketing as our prime focus in our general 
marketing strategy. The business in turn grows in line with the market demands as a direct result of this decision. This 
research focuses on the results in utilising word of mouth marketing as a prime tool in the business’ marketing strategy 
overall.  
 
Keywords  
Word of Mouth, Marketing, Marketing Strategy, Ponipake, Creativepreneurship  
 
1. Introduction 
Word of mouth marketing is essentially a free advertising tool that comes from a customer that has a positive 
experience in purchasing a brand’s product or service. If it’s free though, then why aren’t businesses focusing on it as 
a primary advertising tool? After all, with the utilisation of this tool, businesses can simply focus on their products or 
service, ensuring that the customers’ experience is a positive one. To answer that question, a lot of businesses utilise 
the digital platform nowadays such as Instagram, Facebook, and many others with almost zero regard to the usage of 
word of mouth as a marketing tool. While it is true that the usage of word of mouth is a little old-fashioned, businesses 
cannot survive without the usage of word of mouth in any form or way. Word of mouth alone drives $6 trillion in 
average in the annual global spending and is responsible for 13% of all sales (Todorov 2021). In addition to that, a 
recommended brand is much more likely to be trusted by 90% of people, with 88% of people having the highly trusting 
a brand that is recommended by a friend or a family member (Todorov 2021).  
 
In direct comparison to word-of-mouth marketing, 94% of people skip pre-roll ads, 91% of people have unsubscribed 
from mailing lists, 86% of people outright ignore or skip TV commercials, and 44% of direct mail is never opened 
(Tan 2015). It is very much obvious that people will prefer to trust the opinions of people they know rather than 
advertisements made by companies. In relation to that, word-of-mouth marketing also brings a great type of customers 
as according to Veerasamy (2014), customers acquired through word of mouth spends twice the amount of money to 
purchase a product or service compared to the average customer, and they make twice as many referrals on their own. 
The data is clear, and according to Bughin et al. (2010), word of mouth is the primary factor behind 20 to 50 percent 
of all the customer’s purchasing decisions.  
 
With all that said, what role does word of mouth play in relation to business growth? The answer is simple. A business’ 
growth needs to go hand in hand with the market’s demand. When a customer of a business makes a referral to their 
136

Conference, Asuncion, Paraguay, July 19-21, 2022 
© IEOM Society International","our customers is somewhere in the range of 30 to 40 percent. This, in conjunction with the growth in sales that we 
anticipate, provides us with a good approximation of the overall health of our company. It is generally accepted that 
a growth in sales of between 5 and 10 percent is a very positive sign for a company, especially one that is considered 
to be a small business. As an indication of the expansion of our consumer base, we may use the sales that we've had 
over the last six months. (Figure 4) 
 
 
 
Figure 4. Ponipake’s sales on the last 6 months. 
 
 
6. Conclusion   
The conclusion of this research is that word of mouth marketing is still one of the best marketing tools available for a 
business, with Ponipake capitalising on that point. With the utilisation of the Bowtie method as a tool to ensure a 
positive word of mouth coming from the customers, it will increase the likelihood of the customers perform referrals 
to their close friends and relatives. Although at this moment, the business’ growth is only on the consumer base side 
of things, hence an increase of equipment and work force is not necessary, below is the required factors to ensure a 
positive word of mouth and at the same time increase the market share and retained customers which that applied for 
Ponipake: 
a) High-quality materials 
b) Strict standards and quality checking 
c) Good after service or customer service

Indonesia’s culture and nature into a fashion product. Euvoria is one of fashion brand that is support the earth program 
by using all the natural ingredients for its clothing materials, coloring ingredients, until the packaging. As fashion 
business is one of the red-ocean business, and before starting a fashion business industry there will a lot of important 
things to do such as business validation. Based on a case study of Euvoria, the purpose of this study is to explain and 
identify the validation process followed by Euvoria’s business development strategies. The research method is using 
applied research type action research. The data then analyzed by the qualitative and quantitative data that collected 
from interviews, surveys, company’s personal data, etc. This study objectively found the importance of business 
validation before starting a start-up business that continued help business on their development process. The validation 
process that followed by the development strategy will further affect business performance and form the basis of this 
research.

1. Introduction 
In 2022, the fashion industry can return to growth as changing category landscapes, new digital frontiers, and advances 
in sustainability continue present opportunities (McKinsey, 2022). Fashion business has become the fourth largest 
sector in the business industry. However, due to the large number of enthusiasts, the business industry is one of the 
businesses that fall into the red ocean business category. Building eco-friendly business industries is also an 
opportunity in the business industry where the process of its operation also supports the earth program and helps solve 
existing earth problems. 
 
However, in becoming a start-up business in this eco-friendly fashion industry, entrepreneurs need to pay attention to 
essential aspects of their operation so that all opportunities and risks can be analyzed first. One method that needs to 
be done at the beginning of making a business start-up is to do business validation. In that case entrepreneur can plan 
and analyze their business prospect at first from certain aspect like marketing, operation, and finance. As the result, 
the best development strategy can be developed based on their own business behavior and characteristic.  
 
Business validation is a must in the view of the inherent risk associated with entering the market without even knowing 
if a start-up has got it right from the beginning. There are various steps involved in validating a business and any first-
generation entrepreneur must follow these like a cardinal rule. This is crucial as there is always a scope for rectifying 
the business idea and taking the right approach, there is any lapse during validation (Gill, 2017). From an example of 
a case study on one of the eco-friendly fashion businesses, namely Euvoria, this study will discuss specifically the

5 Conclusion 
1. Validating before starting a business is important because it can help minimize the risk of loss or business failure. 
The importance of business validation can also help businesses move in a structured and clear manner because the 
opportunities and risks can be analyzed early after carrying out the validation process. Validation in Euvoria's business 
is validating using 4 things, namely problem validation, market validation, product validation, and validation of 
willingness to pay. On validating the problem, Euvoria uses the empathy map to create the value proposition canvas. 
In market validation, Euvoria uses feasibility analysis tools. In product validation, Euvoria analyzes feedback from 
the potential target market. Lastly, to validate willingness to pay, Euvoria conducted a buying intention survey. 
 
2. According to the results of the survey and analysis, Euvoria has answered the problems in the market by providing 
products with good quality and comfort. 
 
3. A good business development strategy also begins with a business validation process, from various aspects from 
product to financial and market analysis. In executing a business, customer orientation is very important because 
almost the entire process relies on feedback from customers. Euvoria' s business development itself begins with 
identifying the problem, followed by proving the need for a potential target segment that has the potential for business 
development, then continues by measuring the market potential and target market, then making a business model, 
value proposition, and feasibility analysis which will then be validated, then commencement of making a viable 
business product/prototype which is then tested on target customers, followed by the manufacture of the final product 
which after success, then determined and applied a marketing strategy to gain brand awareness and sales.

Abstract  
 
In recent years the development of the tourism sector is quite important in rural post-conflict areas in Colombia, with 
the community being a key player that participates in the tourism activities that take place in the territories. Therefore, 
the need to characterize and plan tourism development is identified, in order to support local development. The method 
that applies consists of three phases, the first corresponds to the identification and search of secondary information, 
the second to the selection and implementation of instruments for the collection of information, and the last is the 
analytic hierarchy process method (AHP). 
 
The criteria with the highest assessment are sociocultural (32%), economic (22%) and ecological (21%), in which the 
most representative variables are social empowerment, local identity, financial capacity of the demand, offer price 
level, biophysical conditions and natural resource supply. Likewise, the AHP method indicates the following 
assessment in each municipality; Mesetas 2,37, Lejanías 2,17 and La Uribe 2.0.

1. Introduction 
The tourism sector is defined as a powerful force for change in the economy, in which community participation is an 
important factor in the planning, management and impact of tourism in the territories (Oritiz et al. 2019), as it improves 
the employment, infrastructure and increases the income of the population that participates in the development of 
tourism activities and that generally belong to communities that comprise the territories (Gurría 2020) (Sánchez and 
Sánchez 2018). According to the above during the last decades, the tourism sector contributes significantly to world 
GDP due to its rapid growth and development, which is evidenced by the rise in international tourist arrivals 
worldwide, showing a growth of 5% in the year 2018; therefore, the tourism is recognized as an engine of growth and 
economic development worldwide (Pololikashvili 2019). 
 
However, this favorable behavior changed worldwide in the tourism sector because of the impact of the 
pandemic(covid-19). That means, tourism is one of the most affected sectors as international tourist arrivals have

Likewise, five subsystems which allow the characterization of tourism development in the municipalities of interest 
are determined. Therefore, sociocultural (32%), economic (22%) and ecological (21%) subsystems have the highest 
valuation or weighting; the latter two criteria being very similar, in which the development of economic activities does 
not ignore this factor of importance because of the negative effects on the quality of life of the populations living in 
the territories. Finally, it is identified that the total valuation of tourism development in the municipalities has scores 
higher than 2 (the valuation scale ranges from 1 to 3; being 2 an average score), with Mesetas being the highest rated 
with a value of 2.37; followed by Lejanías with 2.17; and La Uribe with 2.0. 
 
4. Conclusions 
The municipalities of the study area, with 'first generation' territorial planning schemes in the projection of sustainable 
development recognize the need to incorporate new instruments that support the planning and management of 
sustainability approaches (environmental, social, economic, institutional, etc.) in the territories. 
One of the weaknesses of tourism development in the study area is the poor connectivity, especially with ground 
transportation, that affects the arrival of tourists to the natural attractions of the region. For this reason, it is essential 
to activate the expansion of new roads and improve the conditions of the current ones; and also to continue working 
on strategies that allow to diminish the concern about safety, which is still a key component for the sustainable 
development of tourism.  
The tourist offer of the study area is properly supported by a set of natural tourist resources that require its enhancement 
in the components of conditioning tourist support facilities (trails, viewpoints, stop stations, sanitary units), access 
assurance , tourist and environmental signage, and touristic guidance, which increases the quality of the tourist travel 
experience.

Abstract 
 
Global electricity consumption has continued to grow rapidly. This growth of consumption shows that energy will be 
one of the major problems in the future. Maintenance of the energy supply is essential, as the interruption of this 
service leads to higher expenses, representing substantial monetary losses and even legal penalties for the power 
generation company (Azam et al,2021). Hydroelectricity is the basis of the Brazilian energy matrix. Therefore, it is 
clear the need to maintain the availability and operational reliability of hydroelectric plants, so as not to compromise 
the continuity and conformity (quality) of the electrical energy supply to the end consumer. Ensuring availability along 
with the reliability of hydroelectric plants can be maintained by employing appropriate maintenance policies that 
reduce the likelihood of failure or even eliminate its root causes, preventing failure from occurring. The aim of this 
paper is presenting a proposed smart maintenance system model that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
algorithm and FMECA (Failure Mode, Effects & Criticality Analysis) database automated by Power BI® for the 
development of consistent maintenance plans for hydrogenerators assets. This integrated innovative tool can identify 
the operational subsystem chronic failure modes supporting industrial managers to incorporate tasks aimed at 
strengthening and increasing the maintenance plan consistency in blocking failure modes before them occurrences. 
This work was applied to a case study in a 525 Kv transformer of a hydrogenerator unit type Francis to demonstrate 
its use and contribute to its understanding.

1. Introduction 
Hydro generators are the main industrial assets in a hydroelectric power plant. The occurrence of failures in these 
hydro generators reduces efficiency and can stop the power generation. The unavailability of the power generation 
system demands costly maintenance actions for the reestablishment of assets and may incur in fines imposed by 
regulatory agencies, such as ANEEL (Brazilian Electrical Energy Regulatory Agency) in Brazil.

Hydroelectricity is the basis of the Brazilian energy matrix. Therefore, it is clear the need to maintain the availability 
and operational reliability of hydroelectric plants, so as not to compromise the continuity and conformity (quality) of 
the electrical energy supply to the end consumer. Ensuring availability along with the reliability of hydroelectric plants 
can be maintained by employing appropriate maintenance policies that reduce the likelihood of failure or even 
eliminate its root causes, preventing failure from occurring. 
 
This paper proposed an innovative and automated tool which contributes to ensuring the assertiveness in decision 
making to develop adequate preventive maintenance plans. This approach was applied to a maintenance case study of 
a 525Kv elevator transformer of a hydrogenerator unit type Francis to demonstrate its use and contribute to its 
understanding. 
 
As a main result, the smart maintenance system development using NLP algorithm integrated with FMECA database 
assists in a consistent maintenance plan development, which aims to anticipate failures and eliminate their causes. 
Thus, it is possible to determine and prioritize assertively the maintenance actions, ensuring availability and reliability 
operational to the energy generation process. In addition, it enables better maintenance planning decision-making, 
directing pieces, material, human and financial resources to execute the exact maintenance actions that mitigate the 
chronic failure modes. 
 
Consequently, it is expected that this study will contribute to researchers and professionals in the field of maintenance 
in improving decision making in industrial planning in electric energy generation systems. Thus, it is possible to 
determine and prioritize assertively the maintenance actions, ensuring availability and reliability operational to the 
energy generation process. 
 
As opportunities for future work, the authors suggest determining the optimal time interval for performing the 
maintenance plan (replacing assets components or operational systems preventive/predictive inspection) and 
automatizing the maintenance tasks decision through the NLP algorithm applied to maintenance work orders database 
analysis.

Ecuador produces about 6.6 million liters of milk a day, of which 31% is destined for cheese production. One of the 
main cheese producers in Ecuador has 90% automated production lines; however, it presents problems of 
nonconformity with the weight of its different cheese presentations. This study describes the application of the Lean 
Six 
Sigma philosophy to reduce the variability of the net weight of cheeses through the application of the Circular DMAIC 
methodology proposed by Villacis and Burneo (2020). This application consists in continuous cycles within the 
DMAIC process. The number of quick wins obtained increase and improvements are obtained in a shorter time frame. 
Through data collection, statistical analysis, and application of lean tools, it was possible to reduce the variability of 
the cheese molding process by 83%, which was reflected in a capacity increase with a Cpk racing from 0.37 to 1.12.

1.Introduction
Globalization has provided enormous business opportunities in several countries, which in turn has promoted market 
competition (Chiu Y. et al., 2020). A company, whether manufacturing or services, survives the competition only if it 
can respond to the market requirements through the added value offered in its products (Medeiros et al., 2020). In this 
context, the main objective of every manufacturing industry is to meet the customers’ needs by delivering a quality 
product on time and reasonably priced (Palange & Dhatrak, 2021). In this way, those industries maintain operational, 
managerial, and engineering activities focus on achieving and maintaining the desired levels of perceived quality 
characteristics (Critical to Quality, CTQ's) (Montgomery, 2013). 
Current competitiveness means that customers expect superior quality products, so organizations must look for ways 
to improve their functional performance (Rathi et al., 2016). There are several techniques used by professionals to 
achieve the proposed quality goals and increase the productivity of a company. According to Ikumapayi et al. (2020) 
two methods traditionally used with this approach are the Six Sigma method and the Lean Manufacturing philosophy. 
Six Sigma consists of several statistical techniques and tools focused to improve processes variability and quality 
(Kaswan & Rathi, 2019); whereas Lean Manufacturing is an effective philosophy to tackle non valued activities and 
wastes (Nandakumar et al., 2020). Ikumapayi et al. (2020) argues that the combination of these methods produces the 
best and most effective tools a company can possess to increase its overall productivity. 
Lean and Six Sigma (LSS) were integrated on the 2000s; since then, both the productive and service sectors have put 
this philosophy into practice to eliminate all non-value-added activities and reduce variability in production processes 
(Yadav and Desai, 2006). LSS is a philosophy focused on continuous improvement which seeks to improve 
performance, competitiveness, and values defect prevention over defect detection (Kubiak and Benbow, 2016). It also 
aims to achieve fast flexible flow of products and services whilst systematically eradicating any issues that could 
adversely affect the quality of that product or service: variation, waste, and cycle time (Thomas et al., 2016).

Abstract 
 
Indonesia is located on the Ring of Fire and has a huge thermal potential of up to 29,000 MW, which is equivalent to 
40% of the world's geothermal potential capacity. According to the latest records from the Geological Agency, 
Indonesia's geothermal potential in December 2019 was 23.9 gigawatts (GW). According to the Geothermal 
Authority (2019), this potential can only be used for a total potential of 8.9%, or 2,130.6. MW. Even though the 
government itself is targeting an increase in geothermal utilization to 7,241.5 MW or 16.8% of the total potential 
capacity in 2025, there is still much that has not been utilized. CNN Indonesia stated the expansion of geothermal 
energy as a source of renewable energies requires a long time and very high risk. Capital will return in the long term 
and investors will not explore much in this business. As a result, only a few investors are interested in developing 
geothermal energy in Indonesia. It is necessary to analyze the project financing to assess whether a geothermal 
project is feasible or not. In this study, data that were used are qualitative and quantitative data such as using a 
questionnaire given to experts, policy makers, and producers. This study identifies geothermal project feasibility and 
calculates the capital return estimation using Capital Budgeting method and determines the scheme using the Multi-
Criteria Decision Making (MCDM).

Abstract  
 
Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, face–to–face interactions are prohibited by the government, pushing various 
institutions to shift from the traditional to the online style of teaching. However, the question is whether online learning 
is as effective as a traditional learning mode. This research explores the learning experience and current issues within 
engineering education. It compares the Learning Experience between traditional learning and the enriched virtual 
mode of learning in Introduction to Engineering. The researchers conducted the study at the University of Santo 
Tomas, wherein they identified two groups of students. The controlled group consists of students from the traditional 
learning method, and the experimental group consists of students from the enriched virtual mode. The researchers 
used the Mann-Whitney-U test to see if there is a significant difference between groups under the factors chosen by 
the researchers that affect the learning experience. The main findings of the research state that there is no significant 
difference between the controlled and experimental groups in learning effectiveness, student performance,  and student 
confidence. Researchers found a significant difference between the two groups in the two dependent variables, student 
satisfaction and faculty interaction. The study concluded that online learning is significant as traditional learning 
methods and is even superior to the traditional method in some factors used in the study. Lastly, the researchers 
recognize that online learning can be adapted as the learning tool used in delivering Introduction to Engineering in the 
Faculty of Engineering at the University of Santo Tomas.

1. Introduction 
Higher Education is critical for students to prepare for global citizenship, develop a sense of well- being, and foster 
personal and social responsibility (Aragoni, 2019). One of the fields of higher education includes Engineering. 
Engineering Education focuses on providing societal growth by systematically applying both science and 
mathematics. The application of engineering education helps create new products, economic growth, and human 
development associated with technological advancements. Innovations necessitating scientific and technological 
knowledge are part of the processes that enable new markets to emerge and speed growth. (Cabaces, 2018). 
Furthermore, Cabaces elaborated that with the fast-paced changes in technology, there is a need to update engineering 
education to keep up with these changes. Thus, educational guidelines are proposed and issued to develop an 
outcomes-based education (OBE) system. This is not the traditional education system wherein the instructor lectures,

Abstract 
 
This paper presents an improved mathematical model to solve the driver’s scheduling problem for mass transit system, 
specific for small and medium size problems. The addition of valid inequalities generated by an extended analysis of 
the behavior presented in the results founds by solving previous mathematical models for the crew scheduling problem 
regarding the Megabus public transportation system, assures a more profound revision of the conduct when compared 
with the results found in the industry and previous investigations. Since every real problem have specific constrains 
that can worsen the solution process, the structure of the crew scheduling problem has been characterized regarding 
specific crew options and timetables. Any change can worsen the solution times and computational effort with only 
few new additions in the crew, change in work times limits or number of tasks for each test system. This is the main 
goal with the proposed constraints shown in this work, one of them presents interesting results, especially related with 
the topology and the size of the test system solved in this work which when compared with real systems, shows a 
better behavior than presented in previous works, resulting in a new approach to find the solution. This work uses the 
language C++ with the commercial solver Cplex to prove the new constrains, resulting in reduced computational time, 
and computational effort and presenting a new improved model which is proved using small and medium test systems 
built using real data and available in the specialized literature.

Abstract 
 
Winning strategy in the 2019 election in Sambas district, West Kalimantan, Indonesia in the industrial era 4.0 This issue 
has become quite interesting in developing general elections in the border area. The point of border builders who become 
political consumers is associated with the voter's decision to choose one of the presidential candidate pairs. And candidates 
for Vice President in Sambas Regency cannot be separated from the confidence of voters obtained through the current 
mass media. Data collection techniques, of course, are obtained through observation, interviews, and distributing 
questionnaires as comparisons in the field in 19 (nineteen) sub-districts in Sambas Regency, as well as documentation, 
starting from the coalition of political parties supporting the aware pair, voter data collection by the Sambas Regency 
KPU, the campaign process through open debates broadcast live via television, campaigns in the sub-districts by the 
Success Team through political parties in border villages in Sambas Regency. Political strategy through mass media or 
digital media is one of the things that impact people choosing and obtaining information on presidential and vice-
presidential candidates. So many problems with the condition of voters that occur in the field, issues develop very quickly. 
They want the candidates to be able to plan real work programs. Of course, voters can float if the candidates cannot be 
convinced to be elected, especially during the industrial era 4.0, where all activities have become digital.

Abstract 
Most Industrial, Mechanical, and Civil Engineering students suffer from mental breakdowns, information overload, 
and unhealthy lifestyles due to high stress levels, resulting in poor internship performance. Mental breakdown affects 
everyone. The feelings of being depressed, anxious, or worried are valid. Information overload occurs when the brain 
becomes overburdened with information. It's not uncommon for people to experience burnout, internet weariness, and 
student tiredness all at the same time. Students who lead unhealthy lives suffer from despair and weakness as a result 
of their lack of proper diet and physical activity. Previous studies have indicated that unhealthy children are more 
prone to learning challenges, affecting their achievement, attendance, and academic performance.However, the world 
is in a pandemic, including the Philippines. Since the outbreak, numerous schools and universities have had to close 
temporarily due to the pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived stress 
and performance of internship of graduating students at the Technological Institute of the Philippines in Cubao, 
Quezon City. A convenience sample of 90 respondents completed self-structured questions. The Perceived Stress 
Scale, Pearson R, and One-way ANOVA were used to evaluate the data. The results of the study show that there is a 
significant relationship between perceived stress and performance  and it conveys that Engineering students that took 
internships got high performance ratings despite the virtual set-up, pandemic restrictions and any hindrance that those 
students faced. The implications of the study and suggestions for future research were addressed.

5.Conclusion  
The low quality of public services is caused by several interrelated factors that create an ineffective and inefficient 
process. The adoption of e-government that focuses on improving the quality of public services creates a system that 
will eliminate processes that were not effective in the previous process. Factors that hinder the quality of public 
services will be eliminated automatically with the adoption of e-government. The use of mobile devices in the 
proposed model will make it easier for people to use public services because smartphones have become part of people's 
daily activities.

Abstract 
 It is true that increase in technological advancement increases continues to make the world we live in a better place 
to live. This experience and outcome is attributed to contributions from STEM fields. Therefore, it is imperative to 
aspire to encourage the increase of skilled workers in STEM disciplines. “The technology-driven economy and skilled 
workforce in STEM fields are the driving force for innovation of a nation.” Thus, a shift of paradigm is called for in 
all facets that will help to ensure that the US continues to sustain leadership of the world economy stemming from the 
possession of the “most innovative and technologically capable economy in the world.”  
 Through many research findings that supported the claim that “the US lags behind many less developed nations in 
STEM education in elementary, secondary and higher education Science, engineering, technology, and mathematics” 
is not only worrisome but requires immediate attention. This should be a concern to other nations aspiring to impact 
the global economy positively. Provision of a conducive learning environment where students can explore, learn about 
STEM related concepts in manners that will help sustain their interests to develop knowledge and skills for a future 
career in STEM related fields is important. This learning environment should provide the opportunity to learn how to 
problem-solve challenges from real-world situations. Through effective facilitation of student’s activities when 
engaged in learning would create critical thinkers with increase STEM literacy. This will enable the next generation 
“to do much more than just learn.” 
 Innovative learning space is a “success-oriented approach that places “problem-solving through collaboration as a 
priority” (Schmitz & Goddard, 2022). According to Schmitz & Goddard (2022) “The overarching idea was to create 
a welcoming learning environment and encourage group work that engages students in collaboration from their first 
moments in class. This innovative learning environment (ILE) is a flexible designed facility with required space that 
is sufficient to house both students and learning tools to enable student’s active involvement in learning. Therefore, 
the ILE is a state-of-the-art research and educational facilities, designed to enhance the collaboration and partnership 
among students, faculty, staff, and the community (Schmitz & Goddard, 2022). This paper will address the 
characteristics and factors that support effective innovative learning environment for problem-solving collaboration 
in STEM education

RESUMEN 
 
Una cadena de suministro (CS) es un conjunto integrado por actores y actividades con el fin último de satisfacer al 
consumidor, proveyéndole a este un producto o servicio. Las características de estas varían según los modelos y se 
pueden encontrar en variedad de organizaciones como lo es la industria de alimentos perecederos.  
  
En este proyecto se trabajó el problema PFSCND (Perishable Food Spply Chain Network), puntualmente con la carne 
bovina despostada, analizando su trayecto desde que sale de la planta despostadora hasta llegar al punto de venta 
donde lo podrá adquirir el consumidor final. Se tendrán en cuenta varias opciones de plantas y de puntos de venta con 
el fin de encontrar la ubicación que ayude a optimizar tanto los costos totales de la cadena como a minimizar el impacto 
ambiental asociado a la cantidad de energía consumida.   
  
Por lo tanto, se decidió diseñar un modelo bi-ojetivo enfocado no sólo en los costos que pueda acarrear la operación 
del eslabón a estudiar, sino también en reducir los efectos medio ambientales que resulten como consecuencia de este. 
La industria alimentaria consume gran parte de recursos naturales, y en muchas ocasiones estos esfuerzos se ven 
desperdiciados ante la temprana perecibilidad de sus productos, por eso hoy en día es esencial agregar en nuestros 
estudios las consecuencias ambientales de las diferentes operaciones productivas o una manera de mermar su impacto, 
para lograr producir de manera más limpia.  
 
Palabras clave 
Diseño de red de cadena de suministro de carne, carne despostada, multiperiodo, bi-objetivo, modelo determinístico. 
 
A supply chain (SC) is a set made up of actors and activities with the ultimate goal of satisfying the consumer, 
providing him with a product or service. The characteristics of these vary according to the models and can be found 
in a variety of organizations such as the perishable food industry. 
  
In this project, the PFSCND (Perishable Food Spply Chain Network) problem was worked on, specifically with 
butchered beef, analyzing its journey from when it leaves the butchering plant until it reaches the point of sale where 
it can be purchased by the final consumer. Several options for plants and points of sale will be taken into account in 
order to find the location that helps to optimize both the total costs of the chain and to minimize the environmental 
impact associated with the amount of energy consumed. 
  
Therefore, it was decided to design a bi-objective model focused not only on the costs that the operation of the link to 
study may entail, but also on reducing the environmental effects that result as a consequence of it. The food industry 
consumes a large part of natural resources, and on many occasions these efforts are wasted due to the early perishability 
of their products, which is why today it is essential to add in our studies the environmental consequences of the 
different productive operations or a way of reduce its impact, to achieve cleaner production.

• Se realizó la revisión de literatura sobre el problema de diseño de red de cadena de suministro de carne en cortes que 
permitió la modelación del problema estudio. 
• Se formuló el modelo matemático para el problema de diseño de red de cadena de suministro de carne en cortes 
guiado con la información recopilada de la revisión de literatura. 
• La literatura hallada permitió definir y desarrollar la técnica NSGA II para dar solución al modelo de la   PFSCND. 
• Mediante el uso del software GAMS se comprobó la funcionalidad y coherencia del modelo matemático planteado, 
como se evidencia en el apartado de estudio mono-objetivo en el libro tesis. 
• El tramo estudiado de la SC cumplió los tres niveles de decisión que conforman el SCM, Operativo cumpliendo con 
la demanda de los puntos de venta, Táctico dando manejo al inventario y Estratégico al decidir si abrir o no plantas en 
determinadas localizaciones. 
• Se encontró que para A=15, entre menor sea la probabilidad de mutación, más compacto y definido será el gráfico 
de resultados de las funciones objetivo. 
• Los costos totales hallados en todas las instancias estudiadas para el último eslabón de la cadena, concuerdan con 
los precios que se manejan actualmente en el mercado colombiano. Con esto, nuevamente se evidencia la coherencia 
en el funcionamiento del modelo matemático. 
• Se evidencia que para el último eslabón de la cadena de suministro el consumo energético acarrea gran parte del 
costo total. Esto permite reafirmar la importancia de manejar problemas desde una óptica multicriterio.  
• Se confirmó la importancia que tiene la distancia crowding y la probabilidad de mutación para las soluciones en las 
instancias examinadas como se pudo apreciar en el análisis de las instancias 4 y 5.  
• Se ratificó la importancia que tiene el análisis multiobjetivo en las cadenas de suministro, sobre todo en las de carácter 
perecedero con vida útil corta, como una herramienta para mejorar tanto económica como medio ambientalmente. 
• A pesar de que el NSGA II es uno de los métodos más utilizados en optimización multiobjetivo no se encontró en la 
literatura estudiada una aplicación que tuviera en cuenta la perecibilidad del producto. Con la presente investigación 
se demostró que el método puede ser aplicado en cadenas de suministro para productos con vida útil corta. 
• Se elaboró un artículo de carácter publicable que resumiera lo estudiado en la presente tesis.

© IEOM Society International","At the same time, Muslim customers can access the distribution channels for the halal food they consume from the 
existing block chain network. The government and society can also access halal food distribution channels through 
applications that are integrated with the global halal food supply chain blockchain network. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The number of parties involved from several countries and the complexity of the global halal food supply chain process 
makes it difficult to supervise all processes in accordance with halal standards. Whereas the halal-ness of a food 
product is as important as the food needs for Muslim consumers. Improved mechanisms in the global halal food supply 
chain cannot guarantee the transparency of all parts and processes in accordance with halal standards. The adoption 
of blockchain technology in the global halal food supply chain is a solution that integrates supervisory mechanisms 
and information technology. Blockchain technology with its advantages guarantees factories that produce halal food 
using halal food ingredients and processing with halal standards because each process will be validated by all nodes 
connected in the blockchain network and similarly for all processes in the global halal food supply chain.

Abstract 
 
Bill of Materials (BOM) is what makes the final product of a semiconductor manufacturing company producing high 
value RF power devices. Any waste in materials will be translated in material variance that will be reflected in 
unfavorable financial results. From data gathered in overconsumption of bulk material report, one of the contributors 
of material variance is AuSn preform used in one of high value products of RF Power device for Mobile Broadband 
application. The goal of this paper is to reduce the material over consumption as per six sigma approach and that is 
baseline – 70% (baseline-entitlement). This quantitative approach for the goal of this project will be the basis for waste 
reduction initiative. The approach or methodology that will be used to reduce material overconsumption will be 
through Six Sigma DMAIC approach. This will cover Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control phases 
necessary to set clear project goal (Define) until determination of potential X’s or potential causes of over consumption 
(Measure) until validation (Analyze) going to Improve phase and Control. The expected results after probing all 
sources of contributors of waste is to provide actions based on each potential causes and monitor the over consumption 
on weekly and monthly basis. This paper also aims to provide structural approach to prevent material wastage through 
appropriate controls.

1. Introduction 
Companies worldwide compete against each other to become the choice of the customers. Companies that fail to 
attract customers will undoubtedly disappear. The price setting of the products is an important factor. From the 
companies’ perspective the price should be set so that an acceptable profit margin can be achieved, preferably it should 
be set higher. Many manufacturing companies find that it might not always be possible to increase the price in order 
to increase the profit. Instead, a method could be to increase the profit margin by lowering the cost of manufacturing. 
One of the more famous concepts for making the production more cost effective is Lean Production. Lean originates 
from Toyota production system (TPS). One of the creators of TPS, Taiichi Ohno says that the goal with it is to decrease

For the Control phase, planning of AuSn materials with respect to volume will be continuously monitored to avoid 
expiration of preforms and from study on actual use of expired AuSn preforms, shelf life can be extended to 17 months 
with update in the system. For the unused preforms to be returned due to mismatch packing quantity of AuSn preform 
per process order, new way of working will be documented in Material Kitting document as well as Diebond or Die 
attach process to document the improvement. Also, FMEA was updated to show reduction of RPN after improvement 
actions were implemented. The metric was also shown where improvement was seen in June as taken from SAP data 
in Figure 16.

This is also back up by separate monitoring done by Material Kitting for the returns in June where AuSn preforms 
almost similar with calculated expected returns of AuSn preforms and these returned preforms were used right away 
in the next process orders.  
 
6. Conclusion  
This actual study on material variance reduction of AuSn preform through DMAIC approach led to a quantitative goal 
from Define Phase, identification of focused process and potential X’s in Measure phase, Analyze phase led to further

© IEOM Society International","filtering out on critical X’s through Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) and addressed through action to reduce 
AuSn preform over consumption.  
 
For the Define Phase, goal is coming from improvement from 21% to 11% % or 10% reduction on AuSn preform 
material over consumption. Project scope is defined from Material Planning, Material Kitting from withdrawal and 
issuance of AuSn preform until Diebond process only as AuSn preform is already consumed at Diebond process used 
as die attach interface to bond active dice to heatsink or flange. Define phase is summarized in a project charter started 
with a business case where material over consumption report included AuSn preform in top 10 contributing to 
139KUSD for 6 months as also stated in the Problem Statement. Objective Statement is to reduce over consumption 
of AuSn preform from October 2021 to March 2022 by 10% (21% to 11%) by end of May 2022 and that there will be 
no consequences on die attach or diebond quality and yield. Estimated cost savings is at 10% reduction valued at 
152.5KUSD projected annual savings. 
 
For the Measure phase, project scope defined from macro map at Material Planning, Material Kitting to Diebond or 
Die attach while detailed Process Flow Diagram (PFD) was done together with Input Output (IO) worksheet and 
Ishikawa, or Fishbone diagram summarized in Cause and Effect (C&E) matrix to get potential X’s from rating 
provided if it will be discarded or considered for next step in the Analyze phase. 
 
For the Analyze phase, Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) filtered out the highest risk priority number (RPN) 
for validation. Critical X’s derived from FMEA were planning of AuSn preform versus volume that will be realized 
to prevent expired AuSn preform but if expired preforms will be encountered, extension of 5.5 months was already 
validated from what happened in 2021 with no impact on SCAT yield. Another critical X’s is the way of working and 
consistent return of unused AuSn preform in its original packing content. Third is on dislodged preforms since the 
waffle case is unable to hold the preforms in place. 
 
Improvement actions were provided in Improve and Control phase to address critical X’s. One of these improvements 
aside from consistent monitoring of AuSn preform material planning aligned with realized volume is the qualification 
and evaluation of expired AuSn preform to extend shelf life from 12 to 17 months which can be used right away 
without impact on SCAT yield, but the Quality Description Sheet (QDS) will not be changed as suppler guarantees 
12 months shelf life and extension varies depending on its application. Consistent return of excess AuSn preform in 
production also implemented according to the new way of working at diebond by continuously using the preforms 
and collection will be at the end of two (2) process orders and collected preforms will be used on new process orders 
thus SAP will not see new withdrawals of AuSn preforms as it is fed back to next process orders leaving no unused 
or scrap preforms in production line. Control Phase has documented the new way of working on handling AuSn 
preforms while improvement in packing material to address dislodged preforms will be carried out by the Process 
Owner and Purchasing team as it will still take time to implement the change. Finally, last important item in this study 
is whether change can be seen in the metric of over consumption and indeed there was big improvement seen in June 
2022 data where over consumption already dropped to 5%.    
 
New opportunities seen in other materials used in production line of RF Power manufacturing company as they are of 
high value and no more reduction in price forcing reduction of wastages in various stages in manufacturing company. 
One of which is the over consumption of GaN dice or wafer as it is also showing up in the unfavorable factory variance.

Abstract 
Digital Transformation is considered to be one of the most significant advancements that happened 
in technology development. Intelligent systems and strategic enhancements are continuously 
improved as time goes by. Most industries use Digital Technologies as it is proven to provide an 
advantage in terms of productivity, communication, and efficiency. Digital Procurement is one of 
the most common uses of digital advancement in the construction industry. It demonstrates 
capabilities to automate systems that will reduce supplier risks and avoid supply chain disruptions. 
Digitizing the procurement process proves to increase effectiveness and reduce construction costs. 
The study's objective is to demonstrate the advantages of digital procurement in the construction 
industry. Four phases of the digital procurement model were established including the 
identification of the scope of procurement study, identifying applicable technologies, 
implementation, and warehousing and distribution. Cross Docking is implemented to strategize 
materials dealt with in the central warehouse logistically. The current study can be a basis for other 
companies planning to implement procurement digitization.

In scenarios where there are changes in material specifications and quantities, another implemented strategy by the 
procurement team is Backhauling. It is agreed among all suppliers that excess materials can be returned or replaced 
when necessary. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Digital Procurement plays a vital role in the Construction Industry as it aligns the inventory and construction schedule. 
Forecasting of materials not only ensures timely delivery of materials, but proper planning can lead to project savings. 
Companies that can maximize the benefits of digitalization will have a significant advantage over businesses that do 
not take full advantage of the technology.

Supply Chain Management is an integrated approach to planning and forecasting inventory and sales to cross-check 
data across suppliers and required demand. Technology is a vital aspect of analyzing trends and properly tracking 
resources' movement. This will result in a more cost-efficient distribution model to manage logistics and warehousing. 
The construction industry greatly benefited from digitization since collating necessary information is more accessible 
thru technology. Digital strategies are implemented to ensure a more effective supply chain implementation.

Abstract 
 
Software testing effort estimation is a critical phase in software project management. Software testing is an integral 
part of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). It ensures that requirement specifications are met before a product 
is deployed. Accurate test estimation is crucial to the on-time delivery of a project and ensures that it meets resource 
constraints. In this study fuzzy logic is used to estimate the manual test script authoring effort in the test process. 
MATLAB software is used to design the fuzzy logic system that would calculate the duration of the scripting effort. 
The variables considered were test complexity, test script reusability, and number of test scenarios. The crisp output 
is the effort estimation in hours. The Delphi method was used to collate the ratings of each expert for the parameters 
of each membership function in each variable. The linguistic rules were defined after. Crisp inputs for each project 
were applied to the model and the output was compared with the actual effort duration of previous projects and expert-
based estimation. The results showed that the mean absolutive relative error (MARE) of the fuzzy logic model has 
performed better than the expert-based estimation technique. Thus, the fuzzy logic framework may be used as a 
decision support tool in manual scripting effort estimation. This study is the first to explore the effort estimation in 
manual test script authoring. This model could serve as a baseline to test engineers, test leads, project managers, and 
business analysts.

1. Introduction 
Software supply chain is any activity involved which affects your software from development until deployment into 
production (Mcbride, 2021 and Iradier, 2021). In order to produce a high-quality software, it requires an efficient and 
effective software testing process (Tahvili et al, 2018). Software testing is a time-consuming and costly process, 
especially manual testing (Tahvili et al, 2018). Thus, effective management is crucial to minimize cost, waste, and 
time (IBM,2022), to build a competitive infrastructure, and to create customer value (Wisner, 2019).

Abstract 
 
Vendor Management (or Supplier Management) is a critical activity in which buyers, purchasing staff, or procurement 
officers are in-charge to execute. It is done to keep the suppliers engaged with the needs of the business and for the 
suppliers to be aligned with its goals. Also, vendor management is purposed to maintain a good business relationship 
with the suppliers which is beneficial to both the business and suppliers. Company OPQ is a chemical manufacturing 
company in the Philippines that serves various market industries (food, biodiesel, homecare, personal care, crop 
science, building & construction, etc.) thus, given these large industries being supported and to continue supporting 
them, the company’s supply base must be taken care of. Hence, Vendor Management System (VMS) is one of the 
programs that administer the supply concerns of the company by managing the suppliers and all concerns associated 
with them. Currently, the VMS of Company OPQ is comprised of 2 programs: Supplier Audit and Supplier 
Assessment. The study intends to assess these programs, identify areas of improvement, and create proposed revisions 
using a method inspired by the Systematic Literature Review (SLR). This is done by extracting data from the 
company’s VMS records and procedures and interviews with the internal and external stakeholders who are directly 
involved in the VMS programs. The proposed revisions for the VMS programs are believed to fortify the audit 
coverage questions and more comprehensively assess the supplier’s performance. Through this, the maximum 
potential of the supplier might be unlocked.

Shipment. The Delivery and Quality criteria are graded by the PD. Meanwhile, the Service criterion is graded by the 
buyer, accounting personnel, and logistics officers. There are two types of suppliers—local and overseas. Local 
suppliers are suppliers that are based in the Philippines, meanwhile, overseas suppliers are based in other countries. 
The compliance sub-criterion covers the compliance to certifications of suppliers (eg. ISO, Halal, Kosher, GMP, etc) 
and after-sales service. After-sales service applies to local suppliers only. The flexibility and responsiveness sub-
criterion cover price competitiveness, cost-effectiveness, and credit terms and the speed of response to inquiry and 
professionalism. Assistance to product development is included in the technical support sub-criterion. For the 
documentation and shipment sub-criterion, the completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of the suppliers in providing 
shipping or delivery documents are assessed by the logistics team. Meanwhile, this sub-criterion also includes 
compliance with bank requirements, promptness, and accuracy of the financial documents (which applies to overseas 
suppliers only). The computation for the delivery criteria is straightforward—the number of on-time deliveries or 
shipments is divided by the total number of delivery attempts. For the quality criteria, the rating is computed by the 
number of shipments accepted divided by the total shipments. The score for the Service criteria is computed by adding 
the scores per sub-criterion divided by maximum score (35) then multiplied to 30. The score for delivery is computed 
by dividing the no. of on-time shipments by the no. of total shipments then multiplied to 30. The score for the quality 
criteria is calculated by dividing the no. of quality-accepted shipments by the no. of total shipments then multiplied to 
40. Over-all rating by the supplier is the sum of the Service, Delivery, and Quality criteria. (Legend for the table: L – 
for local suppliers; O – for overseas suppliers; LO – for local and overseas suppliers).

Table 7 shows the proposed rubrics for Company OPQ’s supplier assessment based on the interview conducted to the 
stakeholders. In the proposed rubrics, the Service criterion is composed of 3 sub-criteria: (1) regularly updated 
certifications; (2) assistance to product development; (3) speed of response to inquiries and concerns. All these sub-
criteria are assessed by the Procurement team. The score per sub-criterion ranges from 0-5. The service criterion score 
is computed by adding the scores of all sub-criteria and then multiplying the sum by 25. The next criterion is Delivery 
and its score is computed by adding the score per sub-criterion which are: (1) no. of on-time shipments over no. of 
total shipments (score is computed by dividing the no. of on-time shipments by the no. of total shipments and then 
multiplying the answer by 5) and (2) completeness, accuracy, and timeliness of shipping/delivery documents (It was 
proposed that, contrary to the existing rubrics, all suppliers either local or overseas shall be assessed. This sub-
criterion, as also proposed, shall be assessed by the warehouse/receiving team for local suppliers and the logistics 
team for overseas suppliers. The following criterion is the quality which is assessed by dividing the no. of quality-
accepted shipments by the total no. of shipments. Finally, the addition of the Commercial criterion which emphasizes 
the supplier’s performance in terms of commercial terms and requirements is proposed. Its sub-criteria are (1) price 
competitiveness (which refers to how competitive the supplier prices its materials); (2) payment terms (which refers 
to how the supplier supports the cash flow of Company OPQ by establishing payment or credit terms); and (3) 
compliance to financial and bank requirements.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Vendor Management System truly keeps the relationship between the organization and its suppliers. For Company 
OPQ, where there’s an ongoing issue with suppliers, it is needed to fortify its vendor management system to motivate

interviews with internal and external stakeholders to come up with a proposal that improves the VMS programs. In 
supplier audit, some proposed coverage questions are added. Meanwhile, the proposed supplier assessment, as per 
interviews with the external and internal stakeholders, will measure more comprehensively the performance of the 
suppliers thus will yield results that are more accurate.

Abstract  
 
We study two classes of dynamic scheduling problems termed as ""allocation"" and ""advanced"" scheduling. In allocation 
scheduling, arriving jobs either wait in queue, are rejected, or served immediately, while in advanced scheduling, they 
are scheduled to time slots such as days in a booking horizon. We develop approximate dynamic programming (ADP) 
based on direct search that approximately solves the underlying Markov decision process models. We compare the 
performance of the proposed technique against the myopic policy under various scenarios. Numerical results 
demonstrate that the direct-search based ADP yields significant improvements over the myopic policy in all of the 
problem sets.

1. Introduction 
Scheduling problems that have the dimension of dynamicity arise in many fields such as manufacturing, 
communication, and transportation. Differing from static scheduling problems, those problems contain jobs arriving 
randomly at the system. In manufacturing settings, jobs correspond to orders or tasks, whereas in healthcare settings, 
patient requests can be considered as jobs (Göçgün & Puterman, 2014). In communication networks, requests for data 
or video transmission are viewed as jobs, and the resource corresponds to bandwidth (Altman, 2002).  
 
In a class of dynamic scheduling problems, termed as allocation scheduling, arriving jobs that are reviewed 
periodically may be served immediately or are rejected/diverted, with the goal of optimizing some performance metric. 
Another class of dynamic scheduling problems, termed as advanced scheduling, has the property that jobs arriving at 
the underlying system are scheduled to epochs within a booking horizon, taking into account resource constraints. 
Costs such as delay costs and penalty cost of rejection are incurred. One extension of these problems contains a waiting 
list, through which decisions can be postponed, putting some of the arriving requests on a waiting list. This gives the 
planner additional flexibility, improving service quality. The planner incurs a holding cost for each type-𝑖𝑖 job that 
stays on the waiting list for one period. In another extension, jobs that are scheduled in a booking horizon require 
multiple resources and are likely to be cancelled and hence must be rescheduled, as observed in chemotherapy 
scheduling where patient requests are viewed as jobs (Göçgün, 2018). 
 
The abovementioned classes of scheduling problems are termed as dynamic stochastic scheduling (DSS) problems 
(Göçgün & Ghate, 2012). This is due to the fact that these problem have dynamic features because of dynamic arrivals 
of jobs; stochasticity is observed owing to random arrivals of jobs. 
 
To this end, we consider two classes of DSS problems: allocation scheduling problems and advanced scheduling 
problems, the latter involving the following features: jobs requiring multiple resources, and waiting list for arriving 
jobs. In line with the literature, we provide an approximate solution to the underlying mathematical models of these 
problems. Specifically, we develop an approximate dynamic programming technique centered on direct-search to 
approximately solve the Markov decision process (MDP) models of these problems.

scheduling problems. This implies that this type of ADP can be utilized for solving other classes of advanced 
scheduling problems arising in fields such as healthcare and manufacturing. 
 
5.  Conclusions 
Dynamic stochastic scheduling (DSS) problems are commonly observed in diverse fields. Because of computational 
intractability, researchers resort to approximation techniques for solving large-sized DSS problems. In this research, 
we focused on two classes of DSS problems: allocation scheduling and advanced scheduling. We developed an ADP 
cenetered on direct-search for approximately solving the MDP models of these problems, and compared its 
performance against the myopic policy. Numerical experiments revealed that it is worth utilizing direct search for 
these kinds of problems since the resulting percentage improvement over the myopic policy is significantly high. 
 
It is worth stating that the performance of the direct search-centered ADP is contingent on the basis functions. Future 
research may address the performance of direct-search based ADPs using various basis functions.

Abstract 
 
The agro-industry is one of the main contributors to the food supply worldwide. Thus, the importance of its supply 
chain activities (i.e., harvest to fork) is crucial and should not be affected by any delays. However, inevitable 
disruptions may have an adverse impact on the supply chain activities in the agro-industry, such as natural disasters, 
climate change impacts, health crises, and technological lags. These risks must be appropriately mitigated considering 
the fragility and sensitivity of agricultural products to various factors (e.g., temperature, time). However, an 
assessment for agro-industry risk susceptibility remains unexplored in the literature. Thus, this study intends to assess 
the aversion of the agro-industry to such disruptions through conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) based risk control. A 
life cycle perspective will also be utilized to obtain a systematic view of the circular supply chain. The methodology 
used will be in two folds: (1) calculate the CVaR variable in the agro-industry supply chain and integrate it to the (2) 
life cycle assessment of agro-industry circular supply chain using the data collected from existing literature. The 
integrated methodology is utilized in the cassava starch production. The findings of the study show that the average 
loss at worst 10% volatile price is 15.22%, at worst 5% volatile price is 22.62%, and at worst 1% volatile price is 
33.94%. Furthermore, the environmental impact assessment conducted revealed that the acidification has the highest 
kg-equivalent in terms of the environmental impact of the cassava starch production. Machineries and equipment 
utilized in the current production process of cassava starch has contributed immensely to the adverse impact on the 
environment, specifically in the acidification due to emissions.

As shown in the results, acidification is the environmental impact that yields the highest kg equivalent. It is then 
followed by eutrophication and global warming, respectively. Thus, a large contribution to the adverse environmental 
impact was due to emissions caused by the machinery and equipment used in the cassava starch production. Certain 
measures must be initiated by key policymakers in order to mitigate the problem. Furthermore, other sustainable 
practices for the production process can be adapted by the industry, such as converting the residue into biogas. (Table 
3). 
 
To assess the robustness of the integrated model, a sensitivity analysis is conducted. The following confidence 
intervals of the CVaR value are considered in assessing the environmental impact of an agro-industry: 0.90, 0.95, 
0.99. The environmental impacts from the various CVaR values are compared (Figure 3) as part of the sensitivity 
analysis. 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Comparison of environmental impacts of the three confidence intervals (i.e., 0.90, 0.95, 0.99). 
 
As shown in the figure 3, the amount in kg-equivalent of the six environmental impacts (i.e., CO2, CH4, N2O, CO, 
SO2, NOx) does not differ despite the varying confidence intervals. It is apparent that the integrated model, at different 
confidence intervals yields the same result. Thus, the integrated model is robust. 
 
3. Conclusion 
This work integrates the risk susceptibility of agro-industry supply chain in assessing the environmental impact of the 
said supply chain through a life cycle perspective. To measure the risk of the agro-industry supply chain, the CVaR 
model is utilized. The risk considered in this study is the price volatility of the food commodity. Results show that the 
average loss at worst 10% volatile price is 15.22%, at worst 5% volatile price is 22.62%, and at worst 1% volatile 
price is 33.94%. This risk-based assessment is integrated into LCA to model cassava starch production. The findings 
revealed that acidification has the highest kg-equivalent in terms of the environmental impact of cassava starch

supply chain. The output of closed-loop process (i.e., sun drying residues ‘Anfrecho’ and ‘Mancha’) did not contribute 
to any other process in the cassava starch production. Aside from that, only one supply chain risk was considered (i.e., 
price volatility of the commodity). For future work, other process integrated for the circularity of the agro-industry 
supply chain should be considered. Such process includes the use of production residues as energy sources. By using 
the residues as an energy source, the environmental impact of the production process will be minimized. Furthermore, 
other models in measuring the supply chain risk in agro-industry should be utilized. Aside from that, various risks of 
the agro-industry supply chain such as loss of product quality due to logistical breakdown, and adverse weather 
disrupting production should also be considered.

Abstract  
 
Technology that suits the needs of the community can answer the problem and can be used easily and can increase 
economic and environmental value added. So that in its application it is needed the right pattern of technology 
dissemination so that people as users can receive it physically and psychologically and mentally (accepted).  This 
study aims to examine the readiness of technology application in the mangosteen supply chain management using 
blockchain technology.  The study considers different conditions both socially, environmentally, production capacity 
and products produced on the basis of mangosteen commodity.  This research was conducted with a qualitative 
approach by collecting primary data from 5 mangosteen farmers, 1 collector and 1 quality controller of trader.  The 
results show that the success of technology diffusion and adoption, especially blockchain technology, is greatly 
influenced by various factors such as: the pattern of dissemination from technology providers, business scale, 
technological suitability, readiness of the recipient or user of technology and market response.

cloud-based or data centre where these two services are directly connected to smart device vendors and hotel 
management. To increase the flexibility of integration between vendors and hotel management, the model proposes 
the adoption of API and integrated data that is connected to the data centre. Thus, vendors can directly monitor in real 
time smart devices in hotels and if there is damage, malfunction or replacement of smart devices can be carried out 
immediately. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The high investment budget of smart devices is expected to increase hotel customer satisfaction with comfort, security 
and convenience as a positive impact of smart device adoption in hotels. But the maintenance and supply of smart 
devices can cause cost problems if the supply and maintenance process is inefficient because of its negative impact 
on customer satisfaction and hotel performance in general. So the adoption of IoT on smart devices is very effective 
in helping the effectiveness of monitoring smart devices and supplying smart devices because with the adoption of 
IoT supervision and maintenance can be carried out in real time. Vendors can directly in real time know when to 
replace smart devices and management can monitor vendor performance in real time.

Abstract  
 
We analyze the pre-enrollment data pertaining to foundation universities in Turkey with the view of identifying factors 
that may impact the enrolment rate of department programs. The goal is to discover which factors have significant 
impacts on enrollment rate and then to derive policy implications that lead university administrators to have better 
strategies for enrollment-related issues. Utilizing a widely used statistical technique, multiple regression, we perform 
a statistical analysis based on the available data. We provide policy implications at the end of the paper.

1. Introduction 
 
Due to ongoing financial hardships affecting the entire nation, many families in Turkey have been losing economic 
power. This negatively affects demand for foundation universities, many of which rely on student tuition fees in order 
to maintain education standards and make investments for higher education. As such, enrollment rates of many 
programs belonging to different faculties have been far from ideal or close-to-ideal values. Hence, it is crucial for the 
upper management of foundation universities to make intelligent decisions about matters that affect enrollment rate. 
 
The related process of higher education in Turkey can be briefly described as follows. Each university determines 
quotas for the programs of its faculties by taking into account restrictions imposed by the Council of Higher Education 
(CHE) as well as their internal restrictions or needs. It is also common that new programs (of departments) or faculties 
are offered by those universities. All the programs and their respective quotas are announced to prospective students. 
Each year, after the university entrance exam is held, prospective students submit to CHE an ordered list of programs 
that are feasible according to their scores. Students are then allocated to programs of universities based on their 
preferences. 
 
In this paper, we examine the university entrance data of Turkey from the perspective of the incentives of foundation 
universities. Our objective is to propose a variety of policy implications for those universities based on the analysis of 
the underlying data. Specifically, we identify crucial factors that affect the enrollment rate of programs using multiple 
regression, a widely used statistical technique. By means of regression results, we are able to address important 
strategic questions such as which faculties/programs are worth being offered, whether offering specific programs in 
the most crowded city, Istanbul, would lead to high enrollment rates. Through this statistical analysis, we aim to help 
foundation universities make more intelligent decisions so that their loss of revenue as well as prestige would be 
minimized.  
 
Our paper is structured as follows. Related literature is discussed in Section 2. We describe the problem and the 
respective mathematical model in Section 3. Results of our statistical analysis and associated policy implications are 
discussed in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 includes concluding remarks.

The impact of a 75% scholarship on enrollment rate is twice as high as that of a 50% scholarship. 
• 
The relative effect of a full scholarship on enrollment rate is lower in the normal-demand scenario as 
compared to the low-demand scenario.  
 
5. Conclusions 
We analyzed the recent university entrance data of Turkey with the view of identifying factors that have impact on 
the enrollment rate of programs offered by foundation universities. Through the implementation of multiple 
regression, we answered highly important questions such as which factors should be taken into account when making 
enrollment rate-related decisions, and how the existing data can be utilized for improving strategic decisions such as 
whether a specific program should be opened or not. 
 
Future work can focus on the implementation of other machine learning techniques such as random forest regression 
and decision tree learning for this type of problem. With a more comrehensive dataset, it appears to be possible to 
discover other factors affecting the enrollment rate.

Abstract  
 
Location problems remain a practical necessity, despite their extensive theoretical development. The objective of the 
research is to identify the location of a coconut plant and its derivatives in the context of the Manabí agrifood chain. 
A procedure for locating a coconut derivatives processing industry was developed using a mathematical model. In the 
first stage: characterization of the variables of the value chain, it helps to determine the most feasible location of a 
coconut plant in the province of Manabí. The actors and links in the chain are identified. Along with the description 
of these. In the second stage: selection of the location method, each location method is analyzed with its risks and 
potential for decision-making on the location of the coconut derivatives processing plant in the province of Manabí. 
The methods selected for the location of the plant are applied and the one with the highest performance is chosen. The 
weighted method and center of gravity were selected. In the third stage, the model that best fits the one carried out

The research took as reference plant design information, bibliographic sources that are analyzed for a better 
understanding of the location term. This in order to implement a coconut processing plant within the value chain in 
the Ecuadorian context. It was determined that the methods to find the location within a productive sector require a 
detailed study of the characteristics of said value network. Which must include from actors, costs, locations and all 
the possible factors that intervene in the production and commercialization process, since many methodologies are 
restricted to various variables so that their results are accurate and the most functional for a possible company. From 
the analysis of the data collected in an investigative way, different sectors were found suitable for the implementation 
of a processing plant for coconut derivatives, which exploits local resources and surrounding areas. With the 
elaboration of a mathematical model, the identification of a possible location of the coconut processing plant was 
achieved, which resulted in the Portoviejo canton, Sosote sector. From this study, the project continues with the study 
of the production processes of the plant. This together with a market and feasibility study to choose the products to be 
produced and marketed by the agri-food chain.

1. Introduction  
Pandemic Covid-19 has become a challenge for the business world, including the service industry in the 
infrastructure sector, the crisis due to the Covid-19 pandemic has developed in such a way that it causes changes 
or decreases in global economic activity. In general, the main purpose of the establishment of a company is to 
obtain optimal profit or profit from utilizing the potential possessed by the company properly. However, the profit 
he is looking for means that he has to close all operations and others until he reaches the end of financial difficulties

1. Hypothesis 1 and 2  
Based on the results of the Table 3 above partially shows the financial distress variable has a t-count value of 
2.906 > a t-table value of 1.97047 and a significant value of 0.004 < 0.05, then H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted. 
The litigation risk variable has a t-count value of 0.407 < t-table value of 1.97047 and a significant value of 0.684> 
0.05, then H0 is accepted and H2 is rejected. 
 
2. Hypothesis 3  
Based on the results of the table above partially shows the Accounting Conservatism variable has a t-count value 
of 4.303 > a t-table value of 1.97047 and a significant value of 0.000 < 0.05, then H0 is rejected and H3 is accepted.

Figure 1. Hypothesis 6 and 7 
 
Based on the results of the path image above, it can be seen that the direct effect on financial distress on the 
sustainability report is 3,215, but the indirect effect of financial distress on the sustainability report through 
accounting conservatism is 2,906 x 4,303 = 12,504 then the total effect given by financial distress on the 
sustainability report is 3,215 + 12,504 = 15,719 it can be concluded from these results that the value of indirect 
influence is greater than the value of direct influence. So, accounting conservatism is able to mediate the effect of 
financial distress on the sustainability report, meaning that H0 is rejected and H6 is accepted. 
 
Based on the results of the path image above, it can be seen that the direct effect on litigation risk on the 
sustainability report is 1,035, but the indirect effect of litigation risk on the sustainability report through accounting 
conservatism is 0.407 x 4.303 = 1.751, so the total effect given by litigation risk on the sustainability report is 
1.035 + 1.751 = 2.786 it can be concluded from these results that the value of the indirect effect is greater than 
the value of the direct influence. So, accounting conservatism is able to mediate the effect of litigation risk on the 
sustainability report, meaning that H0 is rejected and H7 is accepted. (Figure 1) 
 
3. Conclusion  
This study aims to analyze the Role of Accounting Conservatism in the Effect of Financial Distress and Litigation 
Risk on sustainability reports in Infrastructure, Utilities, and Transportation companies listed on the IDX for the

Abstract 
 
Indonesia is an archipelagic country that has a lot of natural resources, with this condition Indonesia has become one 
of the tourism destinations in Asia. Indonesia is an archipelagic country with many areas surrounded by coastlines, 
including the Pangandaran beach. The Pangandaran area has several tourist areas, including the Pangandaran tourist 
market. However, there are problems with the Pangandaran tourist market; the tourist market is not following its 
function, the design of the tourist market looks generally does not represent the theme of Pangandaran tourism, an art 
stage that is no longer functioning. This study aims to design the sustainability of design tourism area, with limitations 
on the Pangandaran tourist market. The method in this study was carried out qualitatively, with direct data collection 
in the field. Field data is studied and analyzed using architectural theory and the sustainability theory (3BL - Three 
Bottom Line), then visualized into a 3D model. The results of this study are recommendations for the design 
Pangandaran tourist market in the form of 3D visualization so that it can also be applied or developed in other tourism 
areas.

1. Introduction  
Indonesia is an archipelagic country that has a lot of natural resources. Indonesia is known as a maritime country with 
the largest archipelago in the world with a sea area of 6.4 million km2, and the number of islands is 16,056 islands. 
This makes Indonesia have a long coastline, so it becomes an attraction for tourists (Kemenkomaritim 2019). The 
tourism sector is one of the most important sectors of the Indonesian economy. This is evidenced by the significant 
increase in income every year, this is also influenced by the transactions of goods and services in this sector. Revenue 
was 10% in 2005, experienced a 17 percent increase in 2012. As a result, GDP in 2018 which was valued at 4.5% rose 
to 4.8% in 2019 (Kemenparekraf 2020). One of the factors for this increase is the arrival of tourists both from abroad 
and within the country, as well as the support of investors for this tourism sector. 
 
One way to increase tourism in an area is to create and build tourist attractions in the area (Utami and Kafabih 2021). 
The following are potentials that need to be considered to increase Indonesian tourism; firstly the natural resources 
and diversity of national tourism resources, secondly the potential for tourism marketing development – in the form 
of foreign or domestic tourism markets (Kemenparekraf 2020).  
 
One of the well-known tourism sectors is Pangandaran Beach. This district has a geographical condition that is 
surrounded by beaches with a length of 91 km and is one of the marine tourism destinations in West Java. That's why 
Pangandaran is one of the tourist areas that supports the economy of the Pangandaran region itself, as well as being a 
source of income for the country (Kurniasih et al. 2020) . Learning about the potential design by the government, it is 
necessary to build new tourist attractions by exploring the natural resources from Pangandaran, as well as covering 
places for marketing tourism in the Pangandaran area. 
 
Tourist destinations in Indonesia that already have an attraction for foreign and domestic tourists, are located in 
Denpasar. According to statistics on visitor satisfaction when transacting more than 50% respond very well, and want 
to revisit Denpasar. The success of tourism in Denpasar is influenced by several characteristics, including; 34.0% 
culture, 30.0% nature, 12.0% resident friendliness, 11.0% price, 6.0% facilities and 4.0% various tourist attractions

The characteristics of sustainability design have three dimensions, namely economic, social, and environmental. In 
this research, in designing the Pangandaran tourist market, the research question has been answered, how to make the 
design sustainable of the Pangandaran tourist market. The method used is through designing based on the existing 
three dimensions, so that the Pangandaran tourist market can have sustainability for future generations. This design is 
not completely perfect, due to limitations in research time, especially in terms of material and culture. Such a concept 
may continue to be developed so that it can be developed in many tourism areas in Indonesia. Further research that 
can be done for this research is on the development of details on architecture and culture, it may need collaboration 
with expert academic colleagues to discuss this in future research.

Abstract 
Sustainable business performance needs company’s achievement to any set goals. This achievement needed in 
every kind of business, including The Heritage Hotel. Therefore, Heritage Hotel must be able to show some 
innovative method to attract consumer to buy the product offered. One of the innovative ways is to make Virtual 
Reality. This Study aim to examine the effect of Virtual Reality based by user experience queries to Heritage 
hotel, and their impact to sustainable business performance. Data collection gained by survey with purposive 
sampling approach. Data was analysed using path analysis – PLS. The results showed that Virtual Reality based 
on attractiveness and stimulation have no significant effect to Heritage Hotel, but perspicuity, efficiency, 
dependability, and novelty have significant effect to Heritage Hotel. Heritage Hotel has no significant effect to 
social performance and economic performance, but it has significant effect to environmental performance.

1.  Introduction 
Business performance can be interpreted as the result of the implementation of a series of activities carried out by 
all elements within the company as a process of achieving goals by fulfilling several indicators (Sebestova et al. 
2020). Good business performance will be seen from the level of productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency as 
well. A good level of productivity can be demonstrated through the company's ability to produce products or 
services that can meet and be in demand by consumers in the market. The level of effectiveness relates to the 
company's achievement of any previously set goals. Meanwhile, the company's ability to manage and utilize the 
resources it has to carry out business activities will affect the company's efficiency level. These three elements, 
namely productivity, effectiveness, and efficiency, are the main elements that reflect the performance of a 
company (Cornerstone 2020). 
 
Several studies have successfully proven the relationship between certain variables and business performance. 
Fairoz, et al (2010) discover the influence of entrepreneurial orientation with business performance. Calantone, et 
al (2001) find a positive and significant influence of innovation on business performance. The dimensions for 
measuring business performance also vary. Some researchers use the financial dimension. Other researchers use 
the non-financial dimension. There are also those who combine financial and non-financial performance. Business 
performance must be able to defend itself from various dynamic economic, environmental, and social situations. 
If the company succeeds in maintaining this state, then the company is considered to meet the requirements of the 
sustaining company.  
 
Business sustainability is reflected in the adoption of such strategies and activities that can address the 
requirements of economic entities and its current beneficiaries, while at the same time protects, supporting and 
improving human and natural resources for the future (Labuschagne et al. 2005). The triple Bottom Line, proposed 
by Elkington (1998), facilitates the application of sustainability in the investigations, as well as in the decision-
making process (Asadi et al. 2020). According to this concept, the maintenance of the balance between the 
environmental, social, and economic parameters of the organizations is essential to move to sustainable 
development (Nilashi 2019).

3.1.  Structural model assessment 
The model was validated through the bootstrap method, simulating 500 subsamples to determine, in the first 
measure, the significance of the correlations between the dimensions (for a t > 1.96 product of a two-tailed test 
and confidence level of 95 %). The model proposes nine significant relationships between Virtual Reality practices 
(Attractiveness, Perspicuity, Efficiency, Dependability, Stimulation, Novelty) to Heritage Hotel, and between 
Heritage Hotel to Sustainable Business Performance (Social Performance, Environmental Performance, 
Economic Performance). From Table 5, the result showed confirms the correlations between Perspicuity to 
Heritage Hotel (8.655>1,96), Efficiency to Heritage Hotel (2.792 >1,96), Dependability to Heritage Hotel (2.020 
> 1,96), Novelty to Heritage Hotel (27.130 > 1,96), and Heritage Hotel to Environmental Performance (2.984 
>1,96). There is no correlations on attractiveness to Heritage Hotel (1.813 < 1,96), Stimulation to Heritage Hotel 
(1.088 < 1,96) and Heritage Hotel to Economic performance (1.275 < 1,96).

4.  Conclusion 
The adoption of technology in operational activities in the hospitality industry has begun, especially the adoption 
of technology aimed at promoting hotels. Forms of technology such as room booking services through websites, 
standalone applications, and third-party service applications are carried out to adjust to the latest technological 
trends including adjusting to the wishes of guests. Heritage-type hotels also perform this service, namely by 
creating a Virtual Reality that describes the state of the hotel, showing all the facilities offered by the hotel and 
the services that will be provided to guests. The study aims to examine the effects that Virtual Reality may have 
with attractiveness, perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, stimulation, and novelty that can affect Heritage Hotels,

Conference, Asuncion, Paraguay, July 19-21, 2022 
© IEOM Society International","as well as the effect Heritage Hotels have on sustainable business performance. Virtual reality in this study as a 
whole was able to explain the effect of 74% on Heritage Hotel, and Heritage hotel can explain its effect on 
sustainable business performance with a social performance influence value of 64.4%, Environmental 
performance by 0.9% and economic performance by 4.7%. In addition, as the results show, visitors' assessment 
of virtual reality in terms of perspicuity, efficiency, dependability, and novelty has a significant effect on heritage 
hotels. This shows that virtual reality is quite capable of displaying Heritage Hotel with all the products offered 
and making visitors feel comfortable, easy to operate virtual reality independently, and love the programs offered. 
However, visitors find this program less attractive, because it does not feel friendly or has not displayed the 
hospitality of Heritage Hotel services that are usually received if they come directly to the hotel. Virtual reality 
programs are also considered insignificant in terms of stimulation because most visitors do not feel stimulated to 
access the program back. The visitor's assessment of the influence of Heritage Hotel on Sustainable business 
performance with social performance factors is not significant, because visitor satisfaction is not met. Visitors still 
prefer to come directly to the Heritage Hotel location as opposed to accessing virtual reality programs. The 
influence of heritage hotels on economic performance is also not significant. This is because visitors feel that they 
do not use the facilities offered by Heritage Hotel directly, nor do they feel it costs anything to improve the 
economic side of the Heritage hotel, by accessing heritage hotel through virtual reality. As far as the authors know, 
this study is one of the first experimental studies conducted to examine the impact of Virtual Reality on Heritage 
Hotels in Indonesia, and their relationship to sustainable business performance. The findings obtained here play 
an important role in understanding how virtual reality can be done in the hotel industry. Advice for further 
research, so that the research is carried out again in non-heritage hotels, so that it can be compared to the results 
so that the hotel industry has new insights when developing virtual reality programs in hotels.

implementation that affects upstream oilfield projects success, from the lenses of project management practice in 
ensuring project sustainability. Upstream oil & gas projects executed by project management office of oilfield 
service contractors globally are the focus of this study. This study offers pathways for future research in bridging 
resource-based theory of big data analytics, institutional theory, and project management practices, in the era of 
digitalization within the context of high-risk nature of upstream oil and gas projects.

1. Introduction 
Oil companies outsource exploration and production to oilfield service contractors to limit exposure to 
operational, environmental and financial risks following the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and the subsequent oil 
price slump (Pitatzis 2015). Upstream services in the oil and gas industry, as well as offshore installations, rely 
heavily on oil field service companies. Low oil and gas prices have had a negative influence on the entire value 
chain, but many oil and gas companies appear to have been hit the hardest by the 2014 oil price drop (Duane et 
al. 2019). 
 
The combination of low oil prices, high demand, and cancelled projects created an unexpected and disastrous 
environment for upstream oilfield services. However, to secure long-term success, oilfield service providers must 
restructure their businesses and embrace a new operating model (Duane et al. 2019; Eberhart 2021).  
An estimated 100,00 oilfield service workers were let go due to the pandemic in North America alone, or 34% of 
the oilfield workforce (Worldoil 2020). As a result, there is an internal pressure from oilfield service businesses 
to maintain sustainable project execution with the fewest resources available, aided by the faster digitization that 
began in 2016. 
 
Lack of resources during reorganization is a common occurrence in the upstream oilfield service business. The 
early stages of digital transformation, big data, and knowledge management adoption (Mittal el al. 2018, 2017) 
on a variety of high-risk projects in upstream oil and gas (Badiru 2013) requires significant resource investment 
to drive implementation. 
 
In one of upstream oilfield service company, a preliminary study performed. Relations between reduction of 
oilfield service workforce, DPMO (defect per million opportunity) of job services, number of projects, and Oil 
Price (WTI) are represented in Figure 1.

that, when coupled with digitalization, allow the efficient and effective execution of project management required 
for project success at a time of scarce resources. Bridging Institutional and Resource-Based Theories in the context

for the organization to retain project success through flexible adoption 
 
In a practical sense, this article lays out logical framework for organizations to implement digitalization to better 
suit their internal characteristics when executing projects and managing risks to gain a competitive edge, 
particularly in the upstream oil & gas projects. Additionally, this study gives information and feedback to 
regulators and standardization organizations on components of normative standards for project management body 
of knowledge (PMBOK) that have a significant impact on an organization's performance following a restructuring. 
It is believed that empirical research linked to project management practices needs to be conducted to make a 
difference in building a new perspective of big data analytics capabilities in the organizations that in turn may 
lead to better and longer project sustainability of the firm to deal with the environmental changes. It can be 
conducted by collecting primary data through a formal survey to the member of project management teams as 
respondents and followed by in-depth interviews. The new form of concept of big data analytics capabilities, 
project management practice, and project sustainability concerning the global environmental changes should be 
further explored and investigated.

Abstract  
 
Sustainability issue in the industrial sector donates challenges to solve with the appropriate framework. The objective 
of the research was to develop an intelligent system to assess the industry’s sustainability performance. A fuzzy 
inference system (FIS) approach was proposed to develop the model and infer sustainability performance with triple-
bottom-line inputs. A dashboard was provided as the model prototype to quick monitoring the current Industry's 
sustainability performance. The result showed that th e fuzzy inference system enables to infer the overall 
sustainability performance, which was not further discussed in previous research. This research generated 125 rules 
with expert validations to infer the sustainability performance. The dashboard of the current Industry's sustainability 
performance can assist decision-makers with sustainability controlling and improvement. Model validations show that 
the model was valid to assess sustainability in the various industrial sector.

1. Introduction  
Industry's sustainability holds an important role to maintain business competitiveness in the industry 4.0 era. The 
sustainability performance of the industry captures multi-dimensional performance involve stakeholders and entities. 
As defined in previous research, sustainability must consider at least three dimensions, also known as triple-bottom-
line. The triple bottom line is organized by economic, social, and environmental dimensions detailed in indicators to 
perform the current sustainability dimensions. The implementation of sustainability in the industrial sector is not only 
mandatory. Moreover, it potentially influences customer view and satisfaction (Ciasullo et al., 2017). 
 
The industrial sector is required to consider sustainability in business activities. As announced by United Nations 
(UN), sustainability is the global agenda to be implemented in any countries and sectors (Johnston, 2016). The 
sustainability considerations and implementations for the Industrial sectors find the way in business competitiveness 
(Zhang et al., 2018). Previous research related to sustainability implementation have been adopted for various 
industrial sectors. Muhsin and Noguchi, 2018) applied sustainability assessment model to find industrial zones with 
constraint to minimize agricultural impact; Ahmad et al., (2019) found sustainability performance of the food industry 
using proposed method and recommends improvement strategy; and Wiryawan et al., (2020) assess the vegetable 
industry performance and maintain the sustainability. As we found in the literatures, sustainability is required to assess 
the current performance to deliver future improvement. Besides that, sustainability assessment is essential for the 
competitive advantages and delivers exact policy based on the current sustainability performance (Khan, 2020).

This research has succeeded to design an intelligent model to infer Industry's sustainability performance.  A Fuzzy 
Inference System model is fire well to define sustainability performance with a linguistic label that are determined by 
3 dimensions, economic, social, and environment. The system is organized by 125 fuzzy rule-based to infer the 
sustainability performance to easily applied in the real world. A user interface for Industry's sustainability assessment 
has been provided for decision-makers to control the current sustainability performance. Model validation showed 
that the model is valid to apply in sustainability assessment in the various industrial sector.

Abstract  
 
Covid-19 pandemic has been affected globally as it forced us to change our behavior and daily activities. Physical 
distancing and health protocols as recommended by the authority had become a new norm to prevent human-to human 
infection for over a year since the pandemic announced for the first time in early 2020. The protocols were applied in 
all public spaces, included health facilities such as hospital, clinic, and pharmacy. This research is discussing the 
possibility of seating configuration to help patients of pediatric clinic in Jakarta avoiding physical interaction in the 
waiting area. Visitor management in Pediatric clinic become more crucial during the Covid-19 pandemic as the clinics 
were attended by infants, kids and adults. Proxemics in literature review and field observation were used as basic 
method to analyze the possibilities and determine the recommendation. The result is explaining how the seating 
configurations are able to interfering the way people interact each other.

1. Introduction  
COVID-19 pandemic has been existed for two years. It has pushed down the visitors of health facilities. In fact, 
number of visitors of the hospital and clinic (for the non-COVID-19 disease) seems decreases during the pandemic. 
Patients tend to be worried of the virus spread over the aerosol transmission. Preliminary survey to the 27 respondents 
of this research also shows that 92.6% patients are worried about the same issue when attending the clinic during the 
pandemic.  Unfortunately, this trend only occurs in the beginning of pandemic wave in every period. Visitors tend to 
increase gradually along with the government loosening over the policy of the pandemic situation. Essential services, 
such as vaccination, immunization, pregnancy examination, and other chronic diseases are mandated to be fully open, 
referred to regulation of the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Indonesia, in responding the COVID- 19 pandemic 
situation. Based on this instruction, the clinics, hospitals, or any of the health facilities in Indonesia have to maintain 
the implementation of COVID-19 health protocols.  
 
One of the facilities which regularly open and serve the patient consultancy during the COVID- 19 pandemic is 
pediatrics clinic. Pediatric clinic is a medical facility dealing with infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. In 
many countries, range of ages for the pediatric patients was diverse. The age limit covers from the new-born baby 
until the age of 18, but in UK it covers older until 21. From this service type, we can find specific category of pediatric 
clinic visitors, who routinely become the outpatients of this clinic. Category of high risk exposed people is the most 
attended patient on the clinic. They are consisting of infants, kids, and pregnant/ breast-feed mother. Paner and Zelnik 
had defined this category within different spatial needs compared to the other ordinary users (1979).  There is also a 
comfort factor needed to be fulfilled by considering psychological aspect of this category to implement the health 
protocols. Looking at this point, the health protocol has to be planned and communicated clearly and persuasively to 
guarantee the health protocols being conducted by this group of visitors. Focus of this research stands on the furniture 
lay outing on the waiting area in pediatric clinic which is organizing children behavior and the amount of the visitors. 
The research itself is also focusing on the implementation of the health protocols in the pediatric clinic.   
 
Non-pharmacological strategy in “New Normal Living” concept has also run by the authority to push over the 
infection. The condition needs certain obedience to the mandatory regulation of COVID- 19 health protocols. The 
protocols itself consists of several guides of prevention during the pandemic such as maintain physical distancing, 
437

term column in Table 3. The configuration layout on the pediatric clinic can be seen on the Figure 8 below. Advantage 
of this configuration is laid on the capacity of separating visitor by using existing furniture. By developing this 
configuration, the clinic will obtain cost efficiency and maintain physical distancing to conduct the health protocols 
in pediatric clinic area at the same time.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendation 
In order to fit the new normal living condition, we need to create a new order with various adjustments. With our 
analysis, we finally came to the conclusion that the most appropriate waiting chairs organization in the lobby of the 
pediatric clinic. First, considering the waiting chairs which in one set have a straight shape and is a three-seater chair 
or four-seater chair, should be placed back-to-back. One set of chairs is equipped with a divider that can be shifted 
according to the needs of people. Second, rather than using converging circular configuration, waiting chairs which 
in one set have a circular shape and consist of three to four chairs, the seats should be placed in a radiating circular 
configuration to avoid facing each other. The last and the most recommended set of chairs is the three- seater chair in 
order to avoid excess seats, because in one patient's family, it is limited to a maximum of three people.  
 
Moreover, this recommendation also becomes a new value in design science, especially furniture configuration design 
with the aim of responding to the new normal situation. This recommendation has several added values based on the 
idea that Covid-19 will be with us for a long time: 
 
1. It is a solution if the clinic wants to keep using the old chair (existing furniture) without having to replace it 
with the new one, adjustment is the best recommendation. 
2.  
3. Responding to the number of patients' families who are children and are accompanied by at least one to two 
parents. Aims to prioritize comfort among patients, since there are barriers to avoid the direct contact with 
other visitors.  
 
4. Optimizing the number of existing patients. 
 
5. Produces an optimal circulation area. 
 
       6. Contribute recommendations for new seat arrangements, based on alternative forms and other modules.

Abstract 
 
Revolution has a meaning as a rapid phase change, concerning the basis of life. Industry is one of the activities 
that are part of the history of human life, which signifies the development of the times. In the development of 
industry, revolution sometimes becomes inevitable. The fourth industrial revolution or Industry 4.0 is a new era 
that provides a leap, which prioritizes automation, connectivity, personalization and globalization on a large 
scale. The automotive industry has also undergone a business transformation, one of which is the Customer 
Experience Management (CEM) aspect, which is useful for managing a series of interactions between customers 
and service providers. Connectivity comes as a solution with a technology based on the CEM concept that 
connects, integrates, and exchanges information and data of a vehicle with the owner's daily life personally, 
through a system. The advantages of Connectivity are safety, traffic management, maintenance and 
entertainment for customers. But there are things that are of concern to Connectivity, namely data security and 
privacy, investment and capital infrastructure, then the product cycle between vehicle technology and 
communication tools. So that qualified regulations and standards are needed to regulate Connectivity.

managed by a system embedded in the Controller Area Network (CAN), or the meaning is a system that allows 
a number of control units in one vehicle to exchange information with each other in one main connecting line 
(Bates, 2008), to save data. These data actually come from all Electronic Control Units / ECUs in a vehicle, such 
as the Transmission ECU, Suspension ECU, Engine ECU, Body ECU (Kingston, 2018), and others. All data 
such as driving behavior, speed limits, braking systems and other traffic information are controlled by the CAN 
network. The collected data will then be sent to cloud computing using a wireless system such as a cellular 
network or Wi-Fi connection. DSRC can alert drivers to traffic, accident avoidance, car maintenance and more 
using infotainment to enable drivers to take action. The data in the cloud computing platform will be used by 
vehicle or insurance companies to analyze driving behavior to make an analysis of the improvements that must 
be provided. From the image above we can see that real-time data such as daily use, mileage and speed are 
transmitted to the cloud computing platform so that vehicle manufacturers can make driver-related analyzes 
such as driving style, incidents and make reports on the data collected (Jsman and Mastan, 2017). Until finally 
the use of Connectivity is very useful as a form of service personalization, increases safety, and makes life 
easier. More than a quarter have prioritized the application of Connectivity over other features such as fuel 
efficiency or engine power. However, there are several factors that must be considered by users, producers, 
governments and other parties who participate in the system. First, customers are concerned about digital 
security and data privacy where vehicle hacking concerns are. On average, up to 37% of respondents feel held 
back from using Connectivity when it comes to privacy and potential hacking (McKinsey, 2014). Figure 5.

5. Conclusion 
In accordance with the meaning of the Revolution and Industry. There was a rapid change faced by the 
Industrial World in the world, until the fourth industrial revolution which was a new era that provided a leap 
both quantitatively and qualitatively in the life of organizations, companies and globally. This new stage of the 
industry is committed to prioritizing automation, connectivity, personalization and globalization on a large 
scale. The automotive industry has also observed this technology-based transformation - just like any other 
industry. 
 
One of the important things faced by the automotive industry in the Industrial Revolution 4.0, which is related to 
managing customer experience, by answering questions, how to read what customers really want in service both 
when purchasing and after purchasing. Theoretically known as Customer Experience Management (CEM). This 
theory is a mechanism for managing the strategic sequence of 2-way interactions between customers and service 
providers (products or services). CEM itself is a holistic approach and involves many parties. Observing the 
current condition of the automotive industry that still uses traditional methods such as periodic service, checking 
manually and directly, delivering cars to a garage, etc., then the absence of realtime driving support, are the 
reasons that pose challenges for the automotive industry in industry 4.0.  
 
Until finally the focus of customer experience management for the automotive industry is on a technology called

Abstract  
 
Board exam takers are fond of struggling with mental health problems since preparing for examinations can be 
stressful and creates anxiety. The researchers found that perceived stress and anxiety affects the memory performance 
of board exam takers which can result in poor learning outcomes. This study aims to determine the relationship of 
perceived stress and anxiety on memory performance to degree holders of Civil Engineering, Accounting and Nursing 
who plan to take board examinations located in Metro Manila Philippines. The 273 respondents were then assessed 
through a deployed ergonomic tool including Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) which measures the stress level of degree 
holders, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) which accurately determines the severity of anxiety symptoms 
and the Everyday Memory Questionnaire (EMQ) assess memory loss in everyday experience. The findings says that 
the perceived stress has a p-value = 0.003 and anxiety has a p-value = 0.000 which means that it is statistically 
significant to memory performance. Furthermore, there is a low positive correlation coefficient of r = 0.401 between 
perceived stress and memory performance while there is a very high positive correlation coefficient showing result of 
r = 0.903 between anxiety and memory performance of board exam takers.

Abstract 
 
Schools play a vital role in building the students’ knowledge and personalities. Students’ lives are affected by their 
teachers and other staff in their school. Due to COVID-19 pandemic, many countries and organizations across the 
world have executed plans to change their work theme from face-to-face into remote working. The UAE has decided 
to change the learning theme from the traditional school-based learning into distance learning. With the changes that 
distance learning have, the happiness level of the school staff can be affected. Therefore, this paper aims to measure 
the happiness level of school staff at one of the primary schools in the UAE. A questionnaire was designed and 
distributed among all staff categories at the school. The questionnaire consisted of questions related to positive 
emotions, negative emotions, and overall happiness. The collected data was analyzed using statistical analysis 
techniques. The results revealed a high level of happiness among the school staff. The positive emotion was the leading 
factor that affects feeling happiness. This high happiness level reflects the effectiveness of the governmental plans 
executed during the pandemic.

1. Introduction  
Schools play a vital role in building the students’ knowledge and personalities. Students’ lives are affected by their 
teachers and other staff in their school. The positive influence of the school staff is critical to meeting the challenges 
of educating and guiding young minds to their full potential (Hills and Robinson, 2010). Therefore, the happiness and 
the well-being of the school staff are crucial to influencing the students positively. (Myers and Diener, 1995) defined 
happiness as the experience of both frequent positive effect and infrequence negative effect as well as the overall 
satisfaction with life. Happiness at the workplace is considered a key factor of productivity and motivation in any 
organization (Duari and Sia, 2013). There are many definitions of happiness in the workplace. According to (Wesarat, 
Sharif and Abdul Majid, 2014), happiness at workplace is how satisfied people are with their work and lives. (Sharma 
and Jain, 2018) found out that workplace happiness combines different factors, including positive feelings towards 
the organizational culture, work engagement, income, and team bonding. Also, happy employees tend to be motivated 
at work which leads to positive results, which plays a major role in the success of any organization. 
 
With the spread of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) throughout the world in March 2020, many countries and 
organizations across the world have executed plans to change their work theme from face-to-face into distance 
working. COVID-19 pandemic is considered a massive challenge to educational systems. Many countries decided to 
cease traditional classroom learning and switch to distance learning immediately (Daniel, 2020), and the UAE is no 
exception. The distance learning process has been more spread in the UAE due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
(Almuraqab, 2020). Since schools turned into distance learning for more than a year now, it is essential to measure 
the happiness level of school staff during the pandemic. Some studies aimed to see the lockdown impact due to the 
pandemic and happiness, such as the works of (Singh and Mishra, 2020; Greyling, Rossouw and Adhikari, 2021). 
Many changes occurred during distance learning such as recording lessons and conducting exams online which was a 
bit difficult in invigilation. In addition to that, the interaction between students and staff, as well as staff with staff was 
impacted. All of this can affect the happiness level. 
 
To the best of the author’s knowledge and based on the literature review (see section 2), the research work related to 
happiness at the workplace during COVID 19 is minimal. No work targets measuring happiness at schools in the

Table 2 shows the hypothesis testing results using the hypothesis in Eq. (1). The results indicate a high overall 
happiness score as the null hypothesis is always rejected. To examine if the happiness levels are high or very high, we 
repeat the hypothesis testing using 𝑀𝑀= 4 × 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁. The analysis reveals no strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis 
which indicates that the positive emotion, the happiness feeling, and the total happiness score are high. The negative 
emotion is found to be low.  
 
Table 3 shows the bivariate correlation between the different categories. Bivariate correlation helps understanding the 
relationship between the different factors. A strong positive correlation was found between positive emotion and 
feeling happiness. Weak negative correlation was found between negative emotion and happiness feeling.  
 
4. Discussions 
The school community was satisfied with working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic as the analysis revealed 
with a high level of happiness. The positive emotion was the leading factor that affects feeling happiness and 
consequently the total happiness score. This high happiness level reflects the effectiveness of the governmental plans 
executed during the pandemic. It also reflects readiness of the infrastructure and employees to move from face-to-face 
working environment to the remote working theme. To further increase the happiness level, authorities need to keep 
focusing on boosting employee’s positive emotions throughout strategies that considers employees, increase their 
joyfulness and positiveness. With the high positive emotion, the negative emotion remains low leading to less impact 
on the happiness feeling, i.e., positive emotions outweigh negative ones. 
 
5. Conclusion and Future work 
In summary, happiness of school staff can greatly impact the students’ lives. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
UAE started to cease the traditional learning at schools and move towards distance learning. This paper measured the 
happiness level of the staff at one of the schools in the UAE during the implementation of distance learning. The study 
revealed that the school staff was satisfied with working remotely as a high happiness level was obtained from the 
analysis. This implies that the developed governmental plans are effective, and the school management has effectively 
implemented them. For future work, this study can be extended to examine the well-being at the school. The scope of 
the study can be widened to cover more than one school in the country. In addition to illustrating the impact of COVID-
19 on happiness and well-being through a comparative study.

Abstract 
This study investigates if gender diversity on boards effectively drives firm profitability. For this purpose, this 
study uses two periods, before and during COVID 19 – Pandemic, to analyze how gender diversity existence 
strengthens or weakens the impact of the Board of Commissioners (BOC), Board of Directors (BOD), 
Independent Commissioner (IC) and Directors (ID) on firm profitability. This study also analyzed how BOC, 
BOD, IC, and ID influence firm profitability. The sample of this study consists of 40 Food and Beverage 
companies listed on the Indonesian Capital Market from the period 2011 - to 2021. The research models were 
estimated using panel data regression. The result shows that before Covid 19 – Pandemic, BOC and BOD had a 
significant negative impact on firm profitability. In contrast, IC and ID had a positive and significant impact on 
firm profitability. The existence of women in BOC, BOD, and as independent commissioners do not moderate the 
impact of BOC, BOD, and IC on firm profitability, while female directors had a positive role in moderating the 
impact of ID on firm profitability. During the Pandemic, BOD did not influence firm profitability, while BOC 
and ID had a negative influence, and IC positively influenced firm profitability. Interestingly during a pandemic, 
the existence of women in BOC and BOD negatively moderates the influence of the BOC and BOD on firm 
profitability. On the contrary, the women's role as independent commissioners and director positively moderates 
the influence of independent commissioners and directors on firm profitability.

1. Introduction 
One primary subject that draws widespread interest and controversy in discussing corporate governance is 
diversity, as gender representation on boards of directors. Gender diversity on corporate boards is becoming more 
of a concern, leading to the development of numerous legislation and policies to encourage female board 
nomination and participation around the world (Brahma, Nwafor, & Boateng, 2021). Gender diversity is 
increasingly seen as a value-driver and essential differentiator, as talented women directors could offer significant 
value to board decision-making. Nonetheless, the degree of diversity differs among countries. Female directors in 
firms listed on Bursa Malaysia significantly and negatively affect firm performance (Kweh, Ahmad, Ting, Zhang, 
& Hassan, 2019). While several other research found that gender diversity has significant positive effects on firm 
profitability (Duppati, Rao, Matlani, Scrimgeour, & Patnaik, 2020). In comparison, other studies have found that 
461
Proceedings of the 3rd South American International Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Conference, Asuncion, Paraguay, July 19-21, 2022 
© IEOM Society International","During the pandemic, as can be seen in Table 5 women's presence as directors and commissioners positively 
moderates the impact of independent commissioners and independent directors on firm profitability almost in all 
four proxies. Under challenging circumstances, female presence influences the firm's profitability stronger in 
companies with more independent directors and commissioners. Because they are more open to learning, more 
interested, and actively seek to understand the perspectives and rationale of others, female directors appear to be 
more equipped to assess each condition, especially the most challenging one, addressing a board more 
successfully. They might perceive more possibilities, alternatives, changes, and outcomes. Furthermore, they 
appear to be more effective at choosing the appropriate action to deal with a situation because they are better at 
stepping into and understanding the role/perspective of another person.  
 
Although various studies show that the existence of women on the board will lead to a decrease in agency costs 
and, in the end, will increase the company's value. However, during the pandemic, female directors and 
commissioners weakened the influence of the board of commissioners and board of directors on the company's 
profitability, as seen in Table 5. Women are considered more risk-averse than men, so the presence of women 
will influence the management to adopt a strategy that is too conservative, causing a negative impact on the 
company's profitability. This study is in line with the study of (Chauhan & Dey, 2017) that the presence of female 
directors will cause a decrease in firm value. The contribution of women on the board of commissioners and the 
board of directors has a negative impact on the company's profitability in almost all proxies. Without independent 
directors and commissioners, women significantly weaken the influence of both BOC and BOD on the company's 
ROE, ROA, NPM, and GPM. Therefore, the role of the independent board is crucial, especially in crises. 
 
   5. Conclusion 
This study examines the role of female executives in company profitability. In addition, this study also analysis at 
how the Board of Commissioners, Board of directors, and independent commissioners and directors affect the 
company's profitability. The research period is divided into two to see if there are differences in female executive 
behavior in certain situations, namely before and during the pandemic. The result shows that before Covid 19 – 
Pandemic, BOC and BOD had a significant negative impact on firm profitability. In contrast, IC and ID 
positively and significantly impacted firm profitability. The existence of women in BOC, BOD, and independent 
commissioners does not moderate the impact of BOC, BOD, and IC on firm profitability. In contrast, women had 
a positive role in moderating the impact of ID on firm profitability.  
 
During the Pandemic, BOD did not influence firm profitability, BOC had a negative and significant influence, 
and IC significantly positively influenced firm profitability, while ID significantly negatively influenced firm 
profitability. During a pandemic, the existence of women in BOC and BOD negatively moderates the influence of 
the BOC and BOD on firm profitability. On the contrary, the women's role as independent commissioners and 
directors positively moderates the influence of independent commissioners and directors on firm profitability.

Abstract 
 
In this article we compared the Kronecker model against the Intercept model for a mixture experiment. We 
investigated conditioning using the variance inflation factor, the maximum and minimum eigenvalues of the 
information matrix, and the conditional number, to assess conditioning. The pseudocomponents transformation are 
also discussed. Practical examples are provided to support the conclusions. Recommendations regarding when to use 
the Kronecker and Intercept modeling approaches are provided. Conditioning was assessed in both adjusted models 
using the variance inflation factor and condition number. Evidence was given that, for the Intercept model, the choice

Abstract 
Debt collection from a debt collection agency (DCA) has become more difficult due to the pandemic.  
Nevertheless, in the last year the population has incurred in more debts, while there has been a decrease in default 
loans. This has created an opportunity for DCAs to stablish strategies to improve the debt collection process. In 
this work, the CRISP-DM methodology is implemented in an Ecuadorian DCA to develop a machine learning 
algorithm that predicts a debtor´s payment probability and stablish a debt collection strategy. An unbalanced 
dataset with 7,447,856 registers is gathered, cleaned, and preprocessed to train a Random Forrest Classifier, 
Gradient Boosting Machine, Logistic Regression, and Multi-Layer Perceptron using a random under-sampling 
technique. The models’ performance is compared using the sensitivity, specificity, and AUC evaluation metrics. 
The best performing algorithm is the Gradient Boosting Machine with a sensitivity score of 0.97, specificity of 
0.93, and AUC of 0.98 on the validation set. This algorithm also allows to identify the most discriminative features 
for the prediction, these being the days past due, the day between the acquisition of the account and the default 
date, the name of the business category, the name of the prior account owner, and the number of direct contacts 
performed by a robot.

1. Introduction 
Debt management and collection is an integral process for the financial well-being of companies. In the last 
decades there has been an increase in the usage of loan services, such as credit card loans, which has made debt 
recollection management extremely important (Arora et al, 2022). Ecuador's credit portfolio, which records the 
credit amounts incurred by people in the country, indicates that the total amount grew at a rate of 18.1% between 
February 2021 and February 2022, and continues to show a sustained recovery after the contraction of the year 
2020 (BCE, 2022). This means that the population has increased its economical activity after the first year of the 
pandemic and can acquire more debt. On the other hand, the delinquency rate has decreased from 3.1% in February

Now the model has a better fit to a straight line, and presents a Brier Score of 0.425, so the model makes better 
predictions for probabilities. In Figure 8, a graph that shows the probability density distribution of the prediction 
while differentiating the actual values is built to visualize how well the model is making the probability 
predictions. 
 
Figure 8: Prediction probability density function 
The model makes good probability predictions since there is only a little portion of the probability density 
function for each class that overlaps with each other, and it is reflected in the high values obtained for the 
performance metrics.  
5. Conclusion 
After the pandemic the amount of debt collection and the ratio of people that perform payments has increased. So, 
for a DCA the analysis of the debt management process is necessary. In this project a ML algorithm is developed 
for an Ecuadorian DCA to predict the payment probability of debtors using the CRISP-DM methodology 
comprised of 6 phases. The business understanding phase begun with an approach to the project supervisor in the 
company for an explanation of the collection strategies and the dataset provided for the analysis. Also, the business 
objectives for the project were proposed. For the data understanding phase, an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
was performed with the categorization of input variables into continuous and discrete, identification of the target 
variable, analysis of outliers, calculation of correlation coefficients, identification and management of missing 
values. For the data preparation, specific data manipulation was set in place depending on the models used. Due 
to the data imbalance on the training set, a random under sampling technique was applied. For Phase 4, the 
algorithms of RFC, GBM, LR, and MLP were selected for training. For each model a hyperparameter tunning 
was performed to improve the default performance of the model. Once this step is done, in the evaluation phase 
the GBM was selected as the best model because it had the highest performance metrics. This model showed the 
most important features for the classification of the algorithm.

Abstract 
Organizations are seeking perfection in their products/services and processes to meet and exceed customers' 
expectations. Quality awards, excellence models, or excellence frameworks are considered essential tools to support 
organizations in achieving their targets. However, the literature analysis revealed that the Organizational Excellence 
Methodologies (OEMs) have six major gaps. The analysis showed that there is a lack of understanding of the OEMs' 
elements and how they should be structured. The second gap was that OEMs' literature lacks a methodology or 
structured process to facilitate the best practices adaptation at the initial stage of OEMs' implementation. The analysis 
also proved that most OEMs could not support organizations in sustaining an Excellent Organizational Performance 
(EOP) level after the initial stage of OEMs' implementation. Moreover, the literature analysis showed that current 
OEMs lack a method, tool, or techniques to support the organizations in the stages beyond the assessment stage. Also, 
there is a need for a unified list of Critical Success Factors (CSFs) to guide the organization's efforts toward achieving 
an EOP. The last gap was that the analyzed OEMs were unable to propose any Performance Management System 
(PMS). Therefore, this research aims to develop a comprehensive and practical framework for Organizational 
Excellence (OE) that provides a systematic and structured process to reach and sustain EOP. The proposed framework 
will fill the above-stated gaps.  
The research methodology was designed based on the research onion model, the research aim and objectives, and the 
Ph.D. research nature. The archival research analysis is used to identify the major gaps in the OEMs' literature, identify 
the framework's features, propose the framework's elements, propose the framework structure, unify the CSFs lists, 
construct the organizational Virtual DNA (V-DNA), and creating the Process Improvement Methodology (PIM). The 
archival research analysis, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the Technique for Order of Preference by 
Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) are used to construct the Performance Management Dashboard (PMD) and the 
decision-making tool. The case study strategy is used to test the framework elements and validate them.      
The proposed practical framework consists of eight elements that include start with leadership, best practices 
adaptation, selecting the CSFs, mapping the organization processes structure, creating a knowledge database and 
continuously developing staff capabilities, constructing the organizational V-DNA, developing the PMD with the 
decision-making tool, and using PIM. The practical framework process flow is composed of ten steps that show how 
the framework elements are used to reach and sustain EOP.

Abstract 
Nowadays, advanced technology is used in all aspects of business, even small ones. Thus, businesses need to 
understand the correlations between the products by analyzing consumer behavior throughout the transactions 
database to enhance the operations process and sales opportunities. This paper's primary objective is to analyze a 
polymer company's sales database using market basket analysis. The results show that new rules might be applied to 
control the procurement and sales of goods using association rules as supportive guidance. The correlation between 
products should be utilized to focus on cross-sales opportunities as it reflects on the revenue stream and attain the 
highest level of availability for strongly correlated items.

1. Introduction 
Studying the product correlation will help define which two products ordered together more than the others and prevent 
the delay in supplying them to customers. In addition, it contributes to managing the inventory problems and affects 
the forecasting of the demand. With advanced technology, businesses can extract useful information from the 
customer's database to enhance their competitive advantage and customer experience. A well-known tool called 
Market Basket Analysis (also known as association rule mining) was developed by Agrawal et al., 1993 that is looking 
for the purchasing pattern of customers in order to design product bundling. For management research, it had been 
implemented the market basket analysis to study customer behavior (Raorane et al., 2016). For instance, in 
supermarket transactions, bread and cheese are likely to be purchased together. There are different data mining 
techniques: classification, clustering, association, prediction, and outlier analysis (Kaur and Shivani, 2016). 
 
Furthermore, it had been discussed different association rule mining algorithms, such as the Apriori Algorithm, Rapid 
Association Rule Mining (RARM), AIS algorithm, and Frequent Pattern-Tree Algorithm (Zhao and Sourav 2003). 
The association rule mining approach may apply to many industries where customers tend to purchase a set of products 
together, such as retails, finance, communication, and many others. Thus, Management needs to identify these product 
correlations to boost their marketing, sales, and operation strategies (Chen et al., 2005). It has been implemented in 
the stock market to determine the correlation between stocks through the transaction database and to create a 
recommender system that helps the investor forecast the stock market price (Paranjape-Voditel and Umesh 2013; 
Srisawat 2011). Furthermore, in the case of analyzing the transaction data and consumer behavior for the business 
database, the Apriori Algorithm was proven to be a very useful tool to perform (Kurniawan et al., 2018; Sagin and 
Berk, 2018). However, in this paper, the association rule mining will be applied in the polymer industry to determine 
the correlation between a set of products that are more likely to be purchased together to optimize the operation process 
and sales opportunities.

3.4 Adding and Removing Correlated Products 
When thinking about listing or delisting a new or an existing item. It is very important to know if items are correlated 
or not. If the items are correlated, then the company should take care that the delisting of an item could affect the 
demand for another item with a strong correlation in buying decisions. For slow-moving items, it could be offered 
with correlated fast-moving ones to increase the sales rate for the poor performance one. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Market Basket Analysis also known as association rule learning or affinity analysis, is a data mining technique that 
can be used in various fields, such as marketing, bioinformatics, education field, nuclear science etc. The main aim of 
Market Basket Analysis in marketing is to provide the information to the retailer to understand the purchase behavior 
of the buyer, which can help the retailer in correct decision making. There are various algorithms are available for 
performing Market Basket Analysis. The existing algorithms work on static data, and they do not capture changes in 
data with time. But proposed algorithm not only mine static data but also provides a new way to take into account 
changes happening in data. This paper discusses the data mining technique i.e., association rule mining and provide a 
new algorithm which may be helpful to examine the customer behavior and assists in increasing the sales.  
The generated consumer purchasing behavior from the system may set new rules about product relationships. The 
analysis implemented in this paper might be applied to different businesses and sales systems to control the 
procurement activities as well as the sales of goods using association rules as supportive guidance. Correlation between 
items should be considered a revenue stream to focus on cross-sales opportunities and attain the highest level of 
availability for strongly correlated items.

Abstract 
 
Models are a tool that allow us to simulate real life systems in a virtual environment to generate scenarios and observe 
how the system reacts. Restaurant management systems incorporate the concepts of RevPash and Menu Analysis to 
support difficult decisions in pricing, promotions and resource management. In this paper, using Arena 14.0 software, 
a discrete event model was designed that incorporates the above concepts and simulates the operations of a restaurant. 
Based on the proposed model, measures were proposed to improve the restaurant's profitability and scenarios were 
designed with the possible effects. The value of this proposal lies in the economic advantage that can be obtained with 
the application of models and Menu Analysis in restaurant management.

1. Introduction 
Over the last decades, the restaurant industry has experienced a significant growth, mainly in Latin America, where 
local gastronomy plays an important role in tourism development. According to Kim et al. (2020), the restaurant sector 
comprises 10% of the workforce in the Americas. In the United States alone, jobs increased from 11.9 to 14.7 million 
between 2004 and 2017, likewise, industry revenues increased by 81.55%. This boom was expressed in multiple ways 
in countries such as Peru, for example, where a gastronomic boom was generated that led more than 80,000 young 
people to choose to study in culinary schools (Matta, 2021).

It is also important to highlight the limitations of the model presented. In the discrete event simulation study presented 
by Vergara et al. (2019), it is possible to measure the desired service level, the competitiveness of the business and 
make decisions based on resource efficiency. For a future study, it would be important to consider other variables that 
allow a more in-depth evaluation of operational management and thus obtain indicators that strengthen decision-
making, such as utilization per worker and service and waiting times; indicators that would increase weekly income 
and reduce operational expenses. 
 
Finally, it should be recognized that the results of the model are subject to the randomness of the simulation and that 
its application may differ in real cases. It is not possible to predict exactly what will happen, but it is possible to 
generate results that approximate the behavior of indicators such as RevPash and weekly income based on the 
conditions being considered in the scenarios. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research has documented the simulation of the operational management of a restaurant in Peru. The data used 
were collected through field observations and with the consent of the company. In that sense, a discrete event model 
was developed to represent the operations system, quantifying the main variables related to the service offered to 
customers and the capacity of the premises. The model was used to simulate alternative scenarios of demand variation 
in the face of the implementation of discounts on the restaurant's dishes during the hour with lowest demand.  
 
The results obtained show that, based on the premise that a discrete event simulation model allows improving the 
operational management of restaurants, this tool does contribute to decision making in the improvement of 
performance in this industry. As can be seen in the second and third scenarios, the correct use of discounts in the menu 
leads to an increase in weekly revenue, if the behavior of demand is favorable according to the simulated conditions. 
 
With respect to the indicators evaluated, it can be concluded that RevPash is a fundamental indicator in the operational 
analysis of this industry. Not only does it allow us to evaluate the current situation of a restaurant, but also its direct 
relationship with revenues and the efficient use of resource capacity allow us to consider it as a business driver. 
 
It is important to recognize the limitations of a simulation model and the challenge for future research will be to be 
able to predict more complex scenarios based on multiple situations. So that the model can contribute to the growth 
of the industry, especially in times when COVID-19 has stagnated its growth. The reports have been presented to the 
restaurant's management team with the objective of contributing to its operational management and fostering this 
growth. Likewise, it is also expected to contribute to the simulation community, especially to users of the Arena 
Simulation Software tool with modeling situations like those presented in this research.

 Abstract 
 
This STEM paper would study the Time Series Antarctic Glacier Mass from 2002 Apr. to 2021 Mar. The objective of 
this paper is to forecast the Antarctic Glacier Mass level for 2021-2041. Among four STEM components: Science is 
Geoscience of the Glacier; Technology is using the GRACE-FO satellites to collect Glacier Ice Sheet Mass data; 
Engineering would focus on COVID-19 factor on the Glacier melting rate, and Mathematics is mainly on Time Series 
ARIMA models. Both non-Seasonal and Seasonal ARIMA models were studied and compared.  Both the 12-month 
seasonal pattern and long-term year to year trend were significantly observed.  The Glacier meting rate was becoming 
2% faster based on the Seasonal ARIMA model.  Smoothing models were also significantly identified in the Seasonal 
ARIMA model to smooth out the random noise component to enhance the Time Series Trend and Seasonal component 
to enhance the forecasting model. Forecasting Glacier Melting for 2021-2041 would be a challenging task to address 
both seasonal and trend components for a longer horizontal time from today.  The prediction interval would become 
too wide to predict the future Glacier melting rate if more than 5 years away. Seasonal ARIMA model could provide 
a better fit than the non-seasonal ARIMA model, STEM methodology is a powerful and holistic way for conducting 
Scientific research project by modern GRACE-FO Technology in a practical Engineering sense through a 
Mathematical ARIMA Forecasting analysis.

1. Introduction 
This project would study the Antarctic Glacier Mass data from 2002-2021 March. Objective: Use the Time Series 
ARIMA platform to examine the time series Glacier data to predict the Glacier crisis for the next twenty years (2021-
2041). 
 
1.1 STEM Methodology 
Science: Geoscience (Earth Science) is the study of Earth. Geoscience includes so much more than rocks and 
volcanoes, it studies the processes that form and shape Earth's surface, the natural resources we use, and how water 
and ecosystems are interconnected. Geoscience uses tools and techniques from other science fields as well, such as 
chemistry, physics, biology, and math.  Technology: The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On 
(GRACE-FO) Satellites. Engineering: study the Antarctic Glacier Melting Crisis for 2021-2041. Mathematics: 
Statistical Time Series ARIMA Modeling analysis of the Glacier Ice Sheet Mass data. 
 
1.2 Scientific Research Literature and Technology: GRACE-FO 
The climate has been becoming out of control due to the Global Warming effect Arnold (2011).  The Gravity Recovery 
and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission is a partnership between NASA and the German Research 
Centre for Geosciences (GFZ). GRACE-FO is a successor to the original GRACE mission, which orbited Earth from 
2002-2017. GRACE-FO will carry on the extremely successful work of its predecessor while testing a new technology 
designed to dramatically improve the already remarkable precision of its measurement system. Global surface mass 
anomalies observed by the GRACE-FO satellites (for the month indicated on the map). Over land, red colors indicate 
below-average terrestrial water amounts, while blue colors show above-average water amounts (including ice, snow, 
soil moisture and groundwater. Over oceans, red colors indicate below-average ocean bottom pressure, while blue 
colors show above-average bottom pressure. Ocean bottom pressure changes are related to large-scale ocean current 
variations, as well as overall sea level changes from ocean mass changes.

5 Conclusions  
Exponential Smoothing techniques could decompose the time series components and enhance the Forecasting Power 
Non-Seasonal ARIMA model is working best when no seasonal component existing and it can forecast the linear or 
non-linear trend pattern. Seasonal ARIMA is working much effectively when a strong seasonal component existing 
and it can carry both seasonal component, local linear trend, global non-linear trend in Forecasting future points. 
Searching the optimal Seasonal ARIMA model could be done by today’s JMP platform by setting the selection criteria. 
Seasonal ARIMA model can forecast at about 20% faster Glacier Melting Rate than the non-Seasonal ARIMA model 
for 2021-2041.

Abstract 
 
This paper will study the Time Series Antarctic Glacier Mass from April 2002 to March 2021. The objective of this 
paper is to forecast the Antarctic Glacier Mass level for 2021 to 2041. The Science studied is the Geoscience of the 
Glacier; the Technology applied is the GRACE-FO satellites to collect the Glacier Ice Sheet Mass data; Engineering 
focuses on the COVID-19 impact on the Glacier melting rate; and mathematical/statistical tools like Time Series 
ARIMA models are applied. Although the Glacier melting rate sped up recently before 2020, the COVID-19 situation 
might have slowed down the rate of glacier melting in 2020 in both Antarctic and Greenland. During 2020 COVID-
19 period, Antarctic Glacier Mass seasonal pattern became a smoother single-peak cyclic pattern which is different 
from the double-peak cyclic pattern in 2002 to 2019. Authors conducted both non-seasonal and seasonal ARIMA 
models and concluded that only the Seasonal ARIMA Forecasting modeling algorithm can detect more reliable 
insights of the relatively small pattern change during 2020 period. The COVID-19 factor might have made certain 
impact on the Antarctic Glacier Melting rate. The Glacier Melting rate may have been slowed down by 20% in the 
2020-2021 period.

Abstract 
The changes in economy landscape, industry 4.0 give more pressure to enhance their capability to ensure an effective 
and efficient logistic system. Logistics company need to improve service quality by continuous improvement. This 
research aims to understand the correlation between goal difficulty, reward system, Human Resource Management 
(HRM) on continuous improvement success and the effect of corporate culture in moderating the relationship between 
goal difficulty, reward system, HRM on continuous improvement success in the logistics industry. The data collection 
technique is based on a questionnaire distributed to logistics companies. The samples of this research are 75 
respondents. The method of data analysis is based on SEM-PLS. The results of this research show significant 
relationship between HRM and continuous improvement success.  
Keywords

1. Introduction 
The philosophy of quality management strives for organizational excellence, efficiency, sustainability and 
competitiveness through a continuous and common focus on the improvement of processes, systems and procedures 
(Bastas and Liyanage 2019). According to Chaffey (2015), there are four combinations of strategy formulations that 
can be applied by companies based on SWOT analysis, namely attacking strategy, build strengths for attacking 
strategy, defensive strategy, and build strengths for defensive strategy. To implement these strategies successfully, 
companies need to improve competence by making changes in the company's internals, one of which is by carrying 
out continuous improvement activities. Continuous improvement (CI) is a method of identifying improvement 
opportunities to streamline how things work and reduce waste (Pqm.co.id 2021). One example of successful 
implementation of continuous improvement such as Abdulmouti (2018) regarding the implementation of continuous 
improvement in Toyota Saudi Arabia, continuous improvement activities have increased efficiency by decreasing 
labor costs by 27%, increasing production output by 13%, lowering product defect rates, and so on. Thus, in order for 
the company to succeed in implementing the strategies that have been implemented, the company should place 
emphasis on continuous improvement activities in the company's internals. Hall (2015) conducted research on the 
relationship between continuous improvement activities to the company's financial business performance where it was 
proven that continuous improvement activities were able to improve the company's financial business performance. 
 
Logistics business is one of the business sectors that currently has a high growth rate, along with the increasing needs 
of the community and the development of increasingly sophisticated technology, supported by the geographical

for the rest of independent variables. 
 
This research study the success factor of CI success in logistics industry limited to goal difficulty, reward system, 
HRM, and corporate culture. Considering limited study on CI in logistics, future research should be conducted to 
analyze relationship between CI and other key success factor in logistics industry

Abstract 
 
Smart tourism destination (STD) is an answer for the needs of current tourism development which shows strong 
relationship with Information Communication and Technology (ICT) application. Smart destination is built upon four 
main foundations which are technology, innovation, accessibility, and sustainability. This research aims to compare 
the four foundations of STD in five super priority destinations in Indonesia. Those destinations are Likupang, 
Mandalika, Labuan Bajo, Borobudur, and Toba Lake, which currently being the focus of tourism development by the 
Government. The research method used systematic literature review with specific criteria of reference used. The paper 
must be coming from Scopus or Google scholar within the previous five years. The result will show how destination 
implement each aspect of the foundation. Hopefully, the result of this research will be evaluation for local and national 
government about the smart tourism destination in their area, how each destination implements each foundation in 
Smart tourism destination.

1. Introduction  
In this digital era, the term “smart” is often used in various types of products, system, and service that use information 
communication technologies (ICT) for innovation enhancement. The smart product is defined as products that can use 
information about themselves and about the environment in which they run, and that are able to inter-operate with 
other products (Gutiérrez et al. 2013). The word “smart” has become a popular term also for describing the 
development assisted by ICTs (Lesniewska-Napierala et al 2020), including Smart City. The concept of smart city 
first appeared in the 1990s (Samih 2019). Smart city is simply defined as a term used to show a city utilizing 
technology in various activity related to social, economic, and environment (Sari et al. 2020). During its development, 
the idea of smart tourism is emerged, as one of the fastest growing industries in the universe. To be specific, the idea 
is derived from the concept of smart city, as technology has become an enabler of development of tourism 
(Lesniewska-Napierala et al. 2020). 
 
A smart tourism destination can be seen as a concept that response to the requirements and needs of the present global 
and mobile elites by facilitating access to tourism and hospitality products, services, spaces and experiences through 
ICT-based tools (Calisto and Gonçalves 2016). The use of ICT in tourism in something undeniable. It has resulted in 
significant disruptive innovation in the relationship between supply and demand (De Ávila and López 2015). In

Each destination of five super priority destinations has various way to implement each aspect of smart tourism 
destinations. This difference hopefully can be good case practice for another destination as well. Furthermore, the  
implementation of smart tourism destination in each location can inspire another destination in Indonesia for further 
impact. The suggestion of further research is to compare each foundation of smart tourism destination in one specific

Abstract 
 
Construction Management, in global perspective, are considered country’s primary economic investment and deemed 
as augmenting factors for Infrastructure Development. This Infrastructure Development is deemed ubiquitous with 
the establishment of Electronic Toll Gate’s Construction Management. The objective of this paper constitutes the 
elaboration among the Construction Management Risk (CMR) and Digital Technology (DT). Precisely, the 
elaboration is conducted through theoretical perspective and the Research Methodology of Multidisciplinary Trilogy 
of Civil Engineering, Industrial Engineering and Business Engineering. Construction Management in this paper 
constitutes centre stage of Systems Dynamic Modelling (SDM) including its critical review and future research. The 
aforementioned theoretical perspective is intertwined with the empirical perspective, in which Indonesia’s 
Infrastructure is in the full swing along with the car ownership’s growth in Indonesia is significantly needed to be 
aligned with the construction management of electronic toll gate. This paper analysis is using SmartPLS and its

Abstract  
 
The increasing competitiveness of businesses in recent time has encouraged many brands to be more creative in 
creating differentiation. However, winning the consumer with optimum pricing and excellent product quality are not 
considered as adequate by marketers (iMarketology 2020). Based on the recent marketing trends from Asia Marketing 
Federation (AMF), brand experience optimisation has become one of the most developing marketing trends in 2022 
(Kurniawan 2022). Through unique consumer experience in product or services, a brand could develop a solid 
differentiation to win the business competition. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand the relation 
between consumer brand experience and consumer-brand relationship. This study focused on understanding whether 
optimal brand experience is related to better consumer-brand relationship. Within the theoretical framework of this 
research, four main elements in brand experience constructs such as sensory, affective, behavioural and intellectual 
experiences will be measured towards consumer-brand relationship elements such as brand trust, brand loyalty, and 
brand satisfaction. The brand attachment construct is also incorporated into the framework to determines whether 
brand attachment could affect the relationship between consumer brand experience and brand relationship. Using 
Sequential Equation Modelling (SEM) and SmartPLS 3 analysis software, around 200 participants will be assessed 
through online questionnaire regarding their experience with cosmetic brands that are attempting to optimize their 
consumer brand experience.

Abstract 
This present research based on the many phenomena of companies that are still not aware of the importance of 
reporting and paying taxes. This statement is in contrast to the existing legal tax regulations in Indonesia. One of the 
rules that can ease the company's tax burden is the tax avoidance rule. Where tax avoidance has the aim of minimizing 
the tax burden payable and maximizing profit after tax but still fulfilling tax obligations that do not violate the laws 
in Indonesia. By taking tax avoidance measures, management can also choose to apply accounting conservatism 
measures or choose not to use them. By applying the rules legally, it can show that the company has good corporate 
governance. 
 
The purpose of this study is to determine the role of accounting conservatism in moderating corporate governance on 
tax avoidance. The data used are the financial statements of mining companies listed on the Indonesian stock exchange 
from 2017 to 2020 as many as 47 companies and 38 companies that consistently publish financial reports. 
 
Based on data from 38 companies that were collected and processed using warppls 8.0, it was found that institutional 
ownership and managerial ownership have a significant influence on tax avoidance. Institutional ownership has a 
significant effect on accounting conservatism and managerial ownership has no significant effect on accounting 
conservatism. However, institutional ownership and managerial ownership if moderated by accounting conservatism 
have no significant effect on tax avoidance.

Abstract  
 
The advancement of information technology encourages significant changes in individual behavior, including 
financial behavior. Recent financial behaviour paradigm is linked to the psychological aspect, where important 
concepts in psychology have been incorporated into the financial context. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the number 
of new investors in the Indonesian Stock Market experienced a significant increase, especially college students as 
investors. During the pandemic, individuals find it difficult to “make money” and the stock market offers the 
possibility of “money making” through profit from the invested capital. The increase in the number of new investors 
from the college student sector indicates that their intention to invest in the stock market is very high. College students’ 
intention to invest is the direct antecedent of their behavior, and individual factors from the psychological aspect are 
needed to support this behavior. We examined the relationship between emotional intelligence, locus of control, and 
risk-aversion behaviour on college students’ intentions to invest in the stock market. This research was conducted at 
six universities in Surabaya from March to June 2021. We found evidence that emotional intelligence and locus of 
control have a positive effect on college students’ intentions to invest in the stock market, meanwhile, risk-aversion 
behaviour have negative impact on college students’ intentions to invest in the stock market. This study contributes to 
a greater understanding of the importance of individual factors when college students intend to invest, especially when 
stock market uncertainty increases. These findings have significant theoretical contributions and provide 
recommendations for industries and financial policymakers.

Abstract  
 
Financial statements otherwise known as financial statements become an important instrument and have a big role in 
the operations of a company. Every company that publishes financial statements always wants to provide an overview 
to users of financial statements that the company is in good condition. It is intended that users of financial statements 
assume that management has good performance. Management will try its best to present and describe the state of the 
company as well as possible, it is possible that management will manipulate financial statements so that later the 
information presented in the financial statements will be biased. Biased information can provide invalid and irrelevant 
information to be used as a basis for decision making by users of financial statements, because later the analysis carried 
out is not based on information and the actual state of the company. This study aims to investigate the moderating role 
of female CEOs on the effect of financial distress on corporate financial statement fraud issued from the pefindo25 
index of the Indonesian stock exchange for the 2015-2020 period. Sampling in this study using purposive sampling 
method by limiting the selection of samples based on predetermined criteria. Based on the sample criteria, 216 
financial statements were obtained with a research period of six years. This study found that female CEOs have an 
effect on financial statement fraud. Further findings indicate that female CEOs do not moderate the effect of financial 
distress on financial statement fraud.

Abstract 
 
Customer engagement is one of the essential things in business continuity today. One of the most critical elements of 
marketing communication is communication with customers through social media to increase customer engagement. 
Social media can make customers involved with the brand so that customers will feel close to the brand. In today's 
era, social media has influenced all aspects of Indonesian people's lives. Social media can help people make work 
easier and make marketing easier. One social media that can help people, especially small businesses such as coffee 
shop, is Instagram. With Instagram, businesses can promote their coffee shop by utilizing various features. Based on 
this, it shows the importance of consumer engagement with coffee shops, making research on customer engagement 
and communication on social media important. This study aimed to find out how the social media features of Instagram 
and content types of influence customer engagement on coffee shop social media accounts. The method used in this 
research is quantitative, with the survey as a research strategy. According to the result of this study, the Instagram 
features significantly influences customer engagement by 74.6%. Furthermore, the most popular feature among 
Instagram users is Instagram stories and, the feature that has the strongest correlation with customer engagement is 
Instagram shopping.

1. Introduction 
The development of the era requires people to continue to grow and renew themselves. Humans inevitably have to 
participate so as not to be left behind. This requires us to be literate in using the internet. The use of the internet in 
Indonesia has almost affected all aspects of life. According to DataReportal (2021), in collaboration with Hootsuite, 
in January 2021, 202.6 million Indonesians have become internet users. This figure is a relatively large number for 
the people of Indonesia because this figure constitutes 73.7% of the total population in Indonesia. Internet users in 
Indonesia can have increased by 15.5% from the previous year. This data shows and strengthens the high level of 
internet adoption in Indonesia. 
 
Data on Internet users in Indonesia shows how vital the internet is in the lives of Indonesian people. Even more 
surprising is how many social media users are active in Indonesia, with a figure of 170 million. This figure is a

The overall Instagram feature is calculated through linear regression and scores very well. Supported by its attribute, 
the overall Instagram feature could have a significant impact on influencing customer engagement. As described 
before, Instagram has many features that could affect customer engagement in its way. Relying on the Instagram 
feature to boost customer engagement could be very effective for coffee shops, especially when coffee shops want to 
grow it organically. Coffee shops could flexibly utilize many features because Instagram provides many features for 
its users. With this result, hypothesis 5 (h5) is accepted and could be formulated into this equation: 
 
𝑌𝑌= 0.481 + 0.892𝑋𝑋 
 
Y = Customer Engagement 
X = Instagram Feature 
 
The outcome of Figure 2 indicates that Instagram features and its attribute could significantly influence customer 
engagement. With this outcome, all of the proposed hypothesis is accepted, and the influence given is highly positive. 
Currently, only a small portion of coffee shops in Jakarta utilize shopping features on Instagram; considering this 
result, it is a good idea to start utilizing shopping features to boost customer engagement. Following this result, several 
suggestions have been made for future improvement. So, the future steps of this study are to study more about the 
instrument that could support the Instagram feature to influence customer engagement. Moreover, it would be 
important to break down every instrument of the feature to understand which instrument could influence customer 
engagement the most. It is also essential, along with the customer engagement, that the effort to make interactive and 
entertaining content in each feature should be considered, considering small coffee shops didn’t have many resources 
to focus solely on making engagement in social media entirely. 
 
5. Conclusion and Future Research 
This research aims to analyze the effect of the Instagram features on Jakarta’s coffee shop customer engagement. 
Instagram could be used to promote small businesses, especially coffee shops, as long as they could utilize it to the 
fullest. In this research, some interesting result has been founded. Specifically, shopping features have the strongest 
influence on customer engagement at 38.9%, followed by reels at 33.9%, feed at 18.4%, and stories at 11.8%. The 
result of hypothesis testing shows that all of them are accepted positively. Furthermore, the result of all Instagram 
features significantly affects customer engagement by 74.6%. With the right method, even small businesses could 
utilize social media features to be a great marketing tool with a low budget. The result in this study could be more 
precise only if we could get sales data from each coffee shop and their daily Instagram routine. However, doing so 
will have some difficulty because some small coffee shops featured in this study didn’t store their data properly, and 
some of them refuse to share their data openly. For future studies, it will be a good idea to correlate each coffee shop’s 
Instagram routine with their sales. It will be very helpful for many small businesses to determine which feature they 
should focus on.

research proved that customer satisfaction is the underlying mechanism. This research also shed a light on which part 
of service quality and perceived value that is needed to be focused on. Lastly, implications for internet service 
providers are discussed.

1. Introduction 
In this pandemic era, people are staying home all the time and order foods and other things online. Thus, internet and 
its service provider become essentials. The world is moving toward digital world in an instant, regardless of their 
readiness. There is many previous research that studied how things turns into digital, such as in society (Hilbert 2022), 
arts (Yu 2022), health (Purnat 2022), servicescapes (Larasati et al. 2022), digital competence (Montaudon-Tomas et 
al. 2022; Saltos-Rivas 2022), digital literacy (Siregar 2022; Li and Yu 2022), digital educational games (Kaimara et 
al. 2022), digital employee experience (Sudrajat et al. 2021), digital business (Bharadwaj et al. 2013), and digital 
supply chain (Garcia-Reyes 2020). Not all countries, however, are ready with the digital world. Some countries may 
be more ready and equipped than others. Those countries that are less prepared may rushed things and thus this 
research intends to investigate it further through its service quality, perceived loyalty, customer satisfaction and 
customer loyalty.  
    
Indonesia is one of the countries that has not have steady internet before pandemic strikes. During pandemic situation, 
internet consumption increases significantly as much as 70.3% (Kusnandar and Bayu 2021). This creates an 
opportunity for internet service provider to offer more internet package or even create new subsidiaries. In this 
situation where demand is spiking, service provider might prioritize quantity over quality. However, consumers are 
getting more sensitive to the quality difference and might be less loyal. Thus, this research aims to examine whether 
or not that is the case in telecommunication service industry. This research proposes that customer satisfaction is the 
underlying mechanism. The structure of this manuscript is as follows. This manuscript will first introduce all 
constructs that will be used in the research together with the hypotheses. Then, this manuscript will describe all items 
that are needed to be measured. Finally, the results and implications will be explained.

5. Discussion 
This research successfully proved that customer satisfaction is the underlying mechanism in telecommunication 
industry, especially for internet service provider. Service quality and perceived value has significant and positive effect 
on customer loyalty, both directly and indirectly through customer satisfaction. This is consistent with previous 
research (Zehir and Narcikara 2016). This showed that customer satisfaction is the key in having customer loyalty. 
Similarly, previous research confirmed that customer satisfaction is the underlying mechanism between service quality 
and customer loyalty (Gopi and Samat 2020). This research adds to previous research in service quality (Kitapci et al. 
2014; Zehir and Narcikara 2016; Gopi and Samat 2020), perceived value (Tsiotsou 2006; Chen and Chang 2013; Zehir 
and Narcikara 2016), customer satisfaction (Chen and Chang 2013; Kitapci et al. 2014; Gopi and Samat 2020) and 
customer loyalty (Zehir and Narcikara 2016; Gopi and Samat 2020) by examining it in telecommunication service 
industry.  
 
The results showed that the relationship between service quality and customer loyalty was proven to be significant 
with reliability as the strongest indicator. Consumers think that the most important part of service quality is when they 
could rely on one service provider. They know that they could use the service in optimum capacity at any time and 
whatever problems that may arise in using the service, they trust that it will be solved. This is proved to be important 
in internet service provider. This research suggests that internet service provider focuses on being reliable and 
trustworthy. Some practical suggestions are they should establish a good internet connection and train their employees 
so they could deliver good quality service consistently.  
 
From the relationship between perceived value and customer loyalty, performance value was the strongest indicator. 
This showed that consumers in internet service provider focuses more on the performance objectively, instead on 
emotional, social and monetary. This is consistent with reliability as the strongest factor in service quality. This 
research suggests that internet service provider to focus on their internet and their service. In this research, consumers 
may care less about the value of the money, so the company may charge the service a little bit above the average. 
Consumers will still use the service as long as the service is performed good, dependable and consistent.  
  
6. Conclusion 
This research proved service quality in internet service provider has positive and significant effect on customer loyalty, 
both directly and indirectly through customer satisfaction. Similarly, perceived value in internet service provider has 
positive and significant effect on customer loyalty, both directly and indirectly through customer satisfaction. 
Customer satisfaction has an important role in shaping customer loyalty. Internet service provider should improve 
their service to become dependable and consistent.

Table 7. Anova 
 
Based on table 7, it can be seen that the calculated F value is 0.849 with a sig value of 0.439. This shows that the significance 
value < alpha (α = 0.05) (Ibid., 98). So it can be concluded that there is a simultaneous significant influence between product 
market competition, and research and development on firm value. 
c. Significant Parameter Individual Test (t-test) 
 
Table 8. Coefficients 
Based on the table 8, it can be concluded that the multiple regression equation is as follows: 
From the model above, it can be seen that the constant value is 0.747 which means: with the addition of PMC, and research and 
development, the value of the health sector company will increase by 0.747 in 2018–2020. The PCM coefficient value of 1.265 
indicates a positive result, which means that every increase or addition of 1% of product market competition in manufacturing 
companies will increase the value of the company by 1.265 times in the 2018–2020 period assuming other variables in the 
regression equation remain. 
The RDI coefficient value of 0.159 indicates a positive result, which means that every increase or addition of 1% research and 
development in manufacturing companies will increase the value of the company by 0.159 in the 2018–2020 period assuming 
other variables in the regression equation remain. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The title of this research is The Effect of Research and Development, Product Market Competition on Firm Value (Empirical Study on 
Health Companies Listed on the IDX for the 2018-2020 Period) and aims to determine effect of the independent variable on the 
dependent variable. The test resulted findings that can be concluded as follows: 
1. Product Market Competition has a significant positive effect on firm value. This study is consistent with the results of Ammann et 
al. (2018), Shahbaz Sheikh (2018a) and (2018b). However, the results are not consistent with the research of Beiner, et al. (2018)

Abstract 
In a rapidly changing business environment, organizations are facing a talent crisis dealing with high employee 
turnover. Changes in the composition of generations in the marketplace have led organizations to understand the 
majority generation who are already working, namely Generation X and Generation Y. It is important for 
organizations to know the generation composition and professional characteristics of their employees. 
 
This study compares the Generation X and Generation Y on the preferred retention factors including development 
opportunities, leadership, job autonomy, work environment, and compensation. Data collection is conducted through 
a survey using questionnaire to 352 employees consisting of 116 employees of Generation X and 236 employees of 
Generation Y. Data Analysis is performed using Independent Sample T-test.  
 
The study results show a significant difference between the mean score of Generation X and Y employees. The 
factors that have significant difference are development opportunities, job autonomy, work environment and 
compensation, while Leadership does not have a significant difference between those generations. This means 
organization needs to focus on differentiating the employee retention strategies for Generation X and Y related to 
development opportunities, job autonomy, work environment and compensation.

1. Introduction 
A major business crisis is occurring over many organizations and world economies related to projections about 
talent deficit in worldwide, especially in Indonesia. This means that it is essential to have comprehensive 
understanding about the strategic workforce planning and supply in the rapid changing business environment. 
 
Korn Ferry (2019) reviewed the global talent crunch (in the perspective of Indonesia) and revealed that Indonesia is 
already facing a talent crisis. The skilled worker deficit would reach 1.3 million by 2020 and worsened at a rate of 
11.2% annually to 3.8 million by 2030. RGF International recruitment report in 2019 also stated that 71% of 
employers in Asia consider the talent shortage as their biggest challenge in the hiring process.  
 
Meanwhile, Indonesia is facing a talent crisis and high employee turnover across industry. Mercer survey showed 
that the voluntary attrition rate stood at 8% in 2018 and decreased at 7% in 2019 across industries in Indonesia. This 
is a big challenge, especially for many companies that will face talent deficit and have potential problem in tackling 
employee turnover in the organization. The skilled labor shortages and high turnover rate problem mean that many 
organizations should make human resources strategy as key priority and consider how to retain the best talents. 
 
Based on the 2020 national population census (Official News Statistics no. 07/01/th. XXIV, dated on January 21st, 
2021), Indonesia has a population of 270 million people, consisting of pre-boomer generations (1.875%), baby 
boomers (11.56%), generation x (21.88%), millennials (25.87%), generation z (27.94%), and post-generation Z 
(10.88%). By referring to the composition of the Indonesian population, the majority population with productive age 
594

© IEOM Society International","generation X and Y on development opportunities mean score (0.013, p < 0.05). There is no previous research which 
shows that there is difference between Generation X and Y on Job Autonomy. 
 
4.2.5 Comparison between Generation X and Generation Y on Work Environment  
For Hypothesis 5, Equal Variance Not Assumed was used. The result shows that there is a significant difference 
between generation X and Y on work environment mean score (0.007, p < 0.05). This result is in line with Ertas 
(2015), showing that the importance of work, skill development, and support for work–life balance has small but 
significant differences between Gen Y and older employees. 
 
4.2.6 Comparison between Generation X and Generation Y on Compensation 
For Hypothesis 6, Equal Variance Not Assumed was used. The result shows that there is a significant difference 
between generation X and Y on compensation mean score (0.000, p < 0.05). This is consistent with the research result 
by Chumba and Gachunga (2016), showing that remuneration influences the retention of Millennial employees. 
Haynes (2011) also found that compensation is effective younger workers and attract them. 
 
5. Conclusions and Future Research 
• There is a significant difference between employee retention mean score between Generation X and Y employees.  
• Employee retention factors that have significant difference are development opportunities, job autonomy, work 
environment and compensation, while leadership does not have a significant difference between those generations. 
• The lowest mean score difference for employee retention factor is compensation for both Generation X and Y. 
This means the expectation of both generations has not been full filled by the organization. 
• Both Generation X and Y have intention to leave the job in the near future, but Generation Y tends to have less 
intention to stay in the organization. 
• Since leadership does not have a significant difference between Generation X and Y, therefore future research 
should attempt to analyze further about leadership effect as retention factor between those generations. 
 
6. Recommendations 
• Organization needs to focus on differentiating the employee retention strategies for Generation X and Y related to 
development opportunities, job autonomy, work environment, and compensation.  
• The leadership approach in the organization will give the same impact between Generation X and Y. Thus, there is 
no need to have different strategy related to leadership. 
• Organization needs to address the fulfillment of compensation expectation for Generation X and Y. Thus, it needs to 
evaluate the compensation policy.

Abstract 
 
Project Portfolio Selection is a process to determine which projects are aligned with organizational goals. In the last 
few decades, the development of technology has been growing rapidly, especially in the area of Project Management 
practices. Many applications on the market offer the feature to facilitate the implementation of Project Management. 
However, current applications on the market do not have the Project Portfolio Selection feature. Therefore, the author 
wants to create a Project Management application that focuses on the Project Selection Method using the multi-criteria 
scoring model so that the Project Management process can maximize project selection according to the needs and 
interests of the organization.

1. Introduction 
Currently, the application of the use of technology is increasingly widespread and rapid. Today's technology can 
facilitate our activities, one of which is in doing our work. This can make a complex activity easier and shorten the 
time of the activity. One of these activities is Project Management. 
Project management is defined not only as a set of knowledge and skills but also as a set of processes that are carried 
out to achieve a target and realize the desired goal. In this explanation, it can be concluded that Project Management

Abstract 
 
Hazards inherent to chemical products must be minimized to ensure the health of workers in processes where 
flammable and toxic liquids are stored, the integrity of piping, valves and equipment throughout the system must be 
ensured until its application. The main aspects to be considered for the storage of chemical products are compatibility 
between materials, temperature, ignition control, ventilation, segregation and identification. However, many potential 
hazards are associated with the storage and handling of hazardous chemicals. The purpose of this work is to present a 
technical solution for the automation of the mechanical handling operation performed by the operator, the filling of 
the tanks, level control, cleaning (purge), pressurization of the system with inert gas, reversal and rotation of the tanks, 
in order to guarantee the supply of liquid methanol with controlled pressure and flow rates used in atmospheres of 
heat treatment furnaces and reduction of metallic powders, eliminating operator handling, increasing the safety of the 
system, and making the process more robust. The methodology used for this purpose starts with an analysis and 
algorithm of the electrical components for automation, PLC programming, operation simulation via Festo's CodeSys 
software, and IoT techniques aimed at industry 4.0. This work presents a simplified technical solution for the 
automation of a methanol supply center, in order to prevent the operator from handling the toxics and highly dangerous 
chemicals products that are applied in atmospheres of heat treatment furnaces.

1. Introduction 
Synthetic gaseous atmospheres based on nitrogen and methanol are used in furnaces for the reduction of metallic 
powders and during the heat treatment of metals (Hryha et al. 2012; Silva et al. 2012). Among many processes that 
use dissociated methanol atmospheres, we can mention the reduction of metallic powders (copper, for example), and 
the carburizing and hardening treatments in automotive parts (Plicht et al. 2002). In these applications, methanol is 
the main source of reducing gases, where the methanol molecule is dissociated (“cracking”) at high temperatures (i.e., 
range from 800°C to 1000°C) generating gases such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide (Abbasi et al. 2015), as shown 
in Figures 1 and 2.

5. Conclusion 
This work presented a simplified technical solution for the automation of a methanol supply center, in order to prevent 
the operator from handling the toxic and highly dangerous product. Festo's CodeSys software proved to be an excellent 
simulation tool for the proposed open-mesh and closed-mesh circuit, and validated the electrical devices inserted in 
the mechanical automation project of the methanol supply system. The solution proposed an automatic control for the 
supply of the 02 reservoirs (two tanks) of the methanol storage system, indicates the maximum and minimum level of 
product, promotes filling, pressurization and depressurization with nitrogen for cleaning and safety, promotes 
automatic reversal keeping the supply of liquid methanol stable, with constant pressure and with the flow rates used 
during the application in furnaces atmospheres, avoiding unwanted stops due to product shortages. For future work, 
we can suggest the intercommunication of the PLC and the IoT devices specified in the project, including the selection 
of devices, layer types, networks for wi-fi and cable signals, and types of communication protocols to be used to 
remote control and management of the operation.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of workload and organizational culture on employee 
performance through work life balance which conducted on a public organization located in Bali which implements 
both work from home (WFH) and work from office (WFO). This research is an explanatory research with a sample 
of 133 employees, and the data is analyzed by using PLS-SEM which processed by WarpPLS 7.0. The results show 
that employee performance has no significant effect on employee performance during the implementation of WFH 
and WFO, but it has significant effect on work life balance. Furthermore, organizational culture has a direct or 
indirect effect on employee performance through work life balance, and work life balance itself also has an effect on 
employee performance. Organizational culture is more dominant and has an important role in improving employee 
performance during the implementation of work from home and work from office working style.

1. Introduction 
The spread of the Corona virus or Covid-19 is currently happening in various countries around the world. Not only 
takes lives but also has a negative impact on every country starting from the economy, education, tourism, and 
others. Seeing how dangerous the impact of the Corona virus is, almost every country in the world, including 
Indonesia, since March 2020 has taken steps to prevent the spread of this virus, such as social restrictions, physical 
distancing regulations, as well as limited and comprehensive regional quarantines. As a result of the implementation 
of social distancing and physical distancing, many government and private offices are implementing work from 
home (WFH) schemes. With the new policy, there will be changes that affect both organizations and individuals in 
completing their tasks. 
 
Human resources are assets that must always be considered, including in terms of maintaining a work-life balance 
within the organization itself so that it has the potential to produce optimal output and achieve the goals set by the 
organization. Because the main purpose of having employees is to help the company or organization achieve the 
vision and mission set by the organization. Muis et al. (2018) define performance as the work achieved by a person 
or group of people in an organization or company, in accordance with their respective authorities and responsibilities 
in an effort to achieve organizational goals, legally, not violating the law and in accordance with morals and ethics. 
Meanwhile, according to (Akbar, 2018) employee performance is the result of employee work to achieve better 
performance with good elements, what is meant by good elements is human resource planning that has been well 
structured, planned and neat, when people or these personnel do not perform with quality and do not have a high 
morale then all the planning will be in vain. It can be concluded that the higher the quality of the employee's 
performance in the organization or company, the easier it is for the company to achieve its goals, and vice versa, if 
the employee's performance is poor or low, the more difficult it is for the company to achieve its goals. For this 
reason, it is important for companies to pay attention to employees, including in terms of work life balance during 
the pandemic.

performance. 
 
Last hypothesis about work life balance impacts on employee performance are found to be significant with p-value 
of <0.001 which is < 0.05 and with coefficient value of 0.25. This means that the higher the work life balance, the 
higher the employee performance. This is in line with the research from Dina (2018) and Wolor et al. (2020) which 
found that work-life balance has a positive impact on employee performance. 
 
Based on the effect size value, compared to workload and work life balance, organizational culture has the greatest 
impact on employee performance during the application of work from home and work from office. These results 
provide a warning to organizations about the employee expectation during the implementation of work from home 
and work from office working style in order the company to provide a good organizational culture to maintain and 
improve employee performance. Another finding based on R2 values is that the model's ability to predict the 
phenomena studied is good, where workload, organizational culture and work life balance as explanatory variables 
are able to predict employee performance with quite high impact for about 69.9%. The other remaining 30.1% need 
to be studied in future research by testing the other variables which have possibility to impact the employee 
performance during work from home and work from office working style. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study aims to determine the effect of workload and organizational culture through work life balance on 
employee performance in company which apply work from home and work from office schedule. Based on the 
results of hypothesis testing, it shows that of the five hypotheses proposed, only one does not support, namely 
workload does not have a significant effect on employee performance, but it has a negative significant impact on 
work life balance. Furthermore organizational culture found to have positive significant impact on work life balance 
and employee performance, and the same thing, work life balance found to have positive significant impact on work 
lice balance. In addition, the model's ability to predict the phenomena studied is good, where workload, 
organizational culture and work life balance as explanatory variables are able to predict employee performance with 
quite high impact. Considering the results of the study that workload which does not have a significant impact on 
employee performance, it is necessary for additional empirical verification and further research in the future on this 
matter in the other company that apply both work from home and work from office working style.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to determine the emotional experience felt by consumers and examine the effect of social media 
marketing, service quality, and e-WOM on purchase intention. A sample of 294 respondents mostly live in West Java 
and Jakarta. The research findings show that social media users are attached to products or services on social media 
platforms when those products or services match their actual or ideal self-concept which in turn will result in the 
practice of emotional experiences. So the findings of this study strengthen and support the theory of Self-congruence 
in a digital context which shows that actual on social media platforms with products and services and ideal self-concept 
is directly proportional to consumer behavioral intentions. Thus, the resonance of the activity social media marketing 
is able to determine how much influence the emotional experience of consumers will have. So that, it ultimately directs 
consumers to have purchase attention and carry out purchasing activities. This article contributes to the discussion of 
methods to investigate the social media marketing on purchase intention that produce self-congruity by using Self-
congruence theory perspective.

1. Introduction  
Digitization has become a part of our daily routines shaping new ways in which consumers can interact with one 
another. Digitization, mainly social media has been claimed to be able to change consumer perspectives, behavior and 
preferences (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010). One of the social media that is the focus of this research is instagram. In 
Indonesia, instagram occupies the third position in terms of usage after Youtube and Whatsapp. Instagram users in 
Indonesia as of January 2021 as many as 85 million people to as of February 2022 as many as 99.1 million people. 
This reveals that Instagram users in Indonesia have increased by 14.1 million people (Kompas.com, 2022). Referring 
to this increase, the presence of social media in this case instagram has succeeded in resonating all marketing activities 
that have the value of service excellence with consumers as the basis for creating interactions. Engagement through 
social media can make consumers feel connected, has the potential to create long-term relationships, forge emotional 
bonds, consumer feedback, consumer interactions with consumers (helping other consumers), recommendations or 
reviews, and e-WOM activities that produce a motivational driver. In responding to consumer needs and expectations 
(Agarwal et al., 2014). Thus, the basis for contributions in science is to get an overview of the influence of social 
media marketing, service quality, and e-WOM on purchasing decisions through emotional experiences from the 
perspective of self-congruence (Sirgy, 1986). 
 
Furthermore, according to self-congruence theory, there must be a match between the personality of the product or 
service and the self-concept.. Aaker (1999) states that the basic understanding of self-conformity theory is the impulse

635","Effect of Emotional Experience to Purchase Intention 
Based on the hypothesis test results, there is a path coefficient value of 0.232 with a p-value of <0.001 or below 0.05 
on purchase intention, which indicates that emotional experience has a significant positive effect on purchase intention. 
To direct positive consumer behavior towards a product or service, a superior value of the product or service is required 
which expresses high suitability. When the congruence between the brand image of a product or service and their 
actual or ideal self-concept is high, consumers will feel that the brand encourages their self-verification of self-
improvement motivation. Thus, consumers will become attached to the brand (Japutra et al., 2019). 
 
6. Conclusion 
The stronger the match between the product or service and the actual or ideal self-concept, the stronger the emotional 
attachment to the product or service. Research proves that social media users are attached to products or services on 
social media platforms when the product or service is in accordance with their actual or ideal self-concept. This new 
study states that when the congruence between the product or service and their actual or ideal self-concept is high, 
consumers will feel that the product or service encourages their self-verification of self-improvement motivation, so 
that truly reflect from the congruence consumer's personality. Thus, the services represented through social media 
marketing activities are the basis of exchange that will become self-congruity is a cognitive mechanism that determines 
whether the value expressed by a product and service matches the self-concept.

1. Introduction  
Add Electronic commerce or e-commerce has become a trend in the digital era. The popularity of e-commerce can be 
seen in the significant growth of internet users from year to year. According to The Internet World Stats (2020), the 
number of internet users increased dramatically from 3.27 billion people in June 2015 to 4.68 billion people in June 
2020. Based on Statista Research Department (2020), the revenue of electronic e-retail worldwide in 2015 was $1.6 
trillion and reached $3.5 trillion in 2019. Based on Statista Research Department (2020), e-commerce retail sales 
worldwide amounted to $1.548 billion in 2015 and reached $4.206 billion in 2020. The revenue is projected to grow to 
6.542 trillion US dollars in 2023. With 268.5 million people, Indonesia is the country with the highest population in 
Southeast Asia (Kompas.com, 2020), and with 63 million internet users, the country has one of the biggest potential 
markets globally for e-commerce. The increase in e-commerce revenues in Indonesia from year to year. According to 
Statista Research Department (2020), there were significant ups and downs in Indonesia's e-commerce revenue of 
$8.459 million in 2017 and $20.337 million in 2019. Indonesia’s e-commerce revenues are predicted to reach $44.855 
million in 2022. 
 
Among the total 103 million internet users in Indonesia, 83% are e-commerce users, where more than nine out of ten 
Internet users in Indonesia aged 16 to 64 presently start making online transactions every month (Datareportal 2019). 
The growth of e-commerce in Indonesia is driven by the growing development of internet users. The rate of internet 
penetration in Indonesia is 65%, making Indonesia the fifth country with the highest internet penetration level in 
Southeast Asia. The progress of e-commerce is not separated by the government's support, which provides leeway on

Abstract  
 
It was the outbreak of the covid-19 epidemic that prompted Indonesia's economy to shift from an industrial civilization 
to a more entrepreneurial culture. Higher education institutions are being pressed harder than ever to do more than 
just teach. Academia has so broadened its goal to include entrepreneurial activity, known as academic 
entrepreneurship, in response. As the academic's research or the college's entrepreneurial environment grows, there is 
an increasing desire to promote academic entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurial experiences and entrepreneurial attitude 
among Greater Jakarta's higher education students will be the focus of this article. The researchers conducted a survey 
of students at Jakarta's higher education institutions in order to achieve their goal. The Rasch Model Analysis is used 
to quantify the major variations in entrepreneurial orientation based on entrepreneurial experiences. The Cross 
Tabulation is used to analyze the key impacts between entrepreneurial experiences and entrepreneurial attitude. First, 
there is a considerable variation in entrepreneurial attitude among higher education students in Greater Jakarta based 
on their entrepreneurial experiences. Second, entrepreneurial experiences and entrepreneurial attitude have a strong 
correlation among Greater Jakarta's university students. Entrepreneurial orientation among higher education students 
may be boosted by entrepreneurial experiences produced by higher education institutions, according to practical 
implications based on this study. It may help them become more creative and forward-thinking. Students in higher 
education who want to be entrepreneurs or intrapreneurs might benefit from a course on entrepreneurship.

1. Introduction 
The emergence of the covid-19 epidemic has prompted Indonesia's economy to shift from an industrial to an 
entrepreneurial one. One of the most recent trends in business is the rise of the entrepreneurs (Rahim 2021). As the 
informal sector grows, there is a huge rise in the number of entrepreneurs. Indonesia's vast market potential about 
68.75 percent of the present population is the Millennial generation (26%), and Generation Z (28%), both contribute 
to this number. For the same period of time, the government would aim to boost entrepreneurship by fostering the 
development of MSMEs and the enhancement of business capability and human resource quality (Natalia 2021).

668","experiences and entrepreneurial orientation is confirmed by comparison with the findings of other studies. It also 
explains why there may be a large variation in entrepreneurial orientation based on entrepreneurial experiences, as 
suggested by the first hypothesis. 
 
These outcomes may be explained by the fact that the entrepreneurial experience enabled students to refine their 
practical entrepreneurial abilities in areas of interest, something that cannot be achieved through classroom activities. 
Moreover, this entrepreneurial experience was clearly related to the three EO aspects. Students were encouraged to 
generate company concepts and prototypes through creative thought (innovativeness dimension). Moreover, they 
risked market validation for their product or service (risk-taking dimension). The students were ultimately motivated 
by the ambition to produce income and grow their firm (pro-activeness dimension). Students with entrepreneurial 
experience are more confident, goal-oriented, and courageous in their decision-making. 
 
Therefore, it is feasible that research supports the notion that university education enriched by students' entrepreneurial 
experiences might foster an entrepreneurial orientation. Entrepreneurship is essential to Indonesia's economy success. 
It was demonstrated by MSMEs, which account for 99 percent of all business units, and has a capability to employ 
around 97.30 percent of the labor force. However, due to a lack of an entrepreneurial orientation, Indonesian 
entrepreneurs are unable to develop swiftly. The contribution of MSMEs has been same for more than a decade, 
indicating that they are not rising. 
 
This research has significant implications for fostering an entrepreneurial orientation among Indonesian entrepreneurs. 
University curriculum must include more entrepreneurship experience. They must be equipped with proactiveness, 
creativity, and a willingness to take risks in order to expand the firm swiftly in the future. In MSME trainings, 
entrepreneurship experience can also be emphasized more. The trainings should not only give theory, but also provide 
hands-on practice with mentor feedback. By utilizing this strategy, Indonesian MSMEs will be able to develop their 
entrepreneurial orientation and scale their businesses more successfully. 
 
However, the survey is unable to identify students or participants who perform well in business. This is an essential 
topic for further study. Future research must investigate the impact of entrepreneurial experiences on business 
performance. In addition, more study may be useful in explaining the methodologies and skills of entrepreneurial 
experiences in order to improve entrepreneurial orientation. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The outburst of the covid-19 pandemic has urged Indonesian economy to have a transition from an industrial society 
to an entrepreneurial society. Entrepreneurship is regarded as a phenomenon that has received the greatest attention 
in recent years. Among scholars, there is a strong desire to investigate the entrepreneurial phenomena not only because 
of its unavoidable importance in boosting the economy and creating job possibilities. Higher Education Institutions 
have come under growing pressure to go beyond their traditional function.  
 
As a result, academia has expanded its mission to engage in entrepreneurial activities, referred to academic 
entrepreneurship. There is a growing interest in supporting academic entrepreneurship, based on the academic’s 
research or colleges provide an atmosphere for student entrepreneurship. The purpose of this paper is to examine the 
differences and the relationships between entrepreneurial experiences and entrepreneurial orientation among higher 
education students in Greater Jakarta. To accomplish the purpose of this study, the authors carried out a survey 
targeting higher education students in Greater Jakarta.  
 
Rasch Model Analysis is used to measure the significant differences in entrepreneurial orientation based on 
entrepreneurial experiences. The following analysis is The Cross Tabulation to examine the significant relationship 
between entrepreneurial experiences and entrepreneurial orientation.  
 
The research findings are first, there is a significant difference in entrepreneurial orientation based on entrepreneurial 
experiences among higher education students in Greater Jakarta. Second, there is a significant relationship between 
entrepreneurial experiences and entrepreneurial orientation among higher education students in Greater Jakarta. 
Practical implications based on this research is entrepreneurial orientation among higher education students can be 
empowered through entrepreneurial experiences developed by the higher education institutions.  It can promote their 
innovativeness and proactiveness. Entrepreneurship education could be effective for higher education students 
whether they want to be a real entrepreneur or intrapreneur in business organizations.

Abstract 
 
Cost overruns are quite common in the construction industry. The phrase refers to extra project costs relative to what 
was initially estimated. Examples of causal factors that can lead to cost overrun include mistakes in design, inaccurate 
estimations, engineering variations, and reworks. Due to the unique nature of construction projects that is characterized 
by different time-phased stages and quality, cost overrun factors will have varied impacts during different phases of 
the project lifecycle. Although significant research has been done on the topic of cost overruns, the presence of this 
issue requires more investigation into the root causes in order to develop workable tools and mitigation measures. It 
is argued here that cost overruns can be more noticeable in countries with rapid growth, such as the United Arab 
Emirates (UAE). The main goal of this research is to identify the major factors causing cost overruns in UAE 
construction sector projects with the focus on four project lifecycle phases, namely, the design, bidding, construction 
and Defect Liability Period (DLP). The number of factors that could lead to cost overruns during different phases have 
been identified in the literature review. A survey was carried out on UAE-based projects with consideration for 
numerous stakeholders, including clients, contractors, and consultants. The study identifies a number of significant 
factors shaping cost overruns based on a practical evaluation of projects. This research will support future steps 
towards developing extensive tools to monitor and mitigate cost overruns in construction projects during different 
phases.

1. Introduction 
Around the world, the construction industry is widely viewed as a leading investment sector, reflecting the quality of 
a country’s economy. Since the construction industry has been attracting investors, and employees and their families, 
governments should work on providing services needed for enhancing the functionality of their countries’

700","during the design phase are (DPF 1,3,4,6,7,8 and 14). Likewise, the most suggested seven cost overrun factors during 
the bidding stage are (BPF 1,2,3,7,8,11 and 15). Respondents focused on eight of the twenty-two factors during the 
construction stage which are (CPF 1,2,3,9,12,13,17 and 18). Finally, the survey results show that five out of the fifteen 
cost overrun factors are the most common causes of cost overrun during the DLP which are (DLPF 5,6,9,12 and 14). 
By filtering out the data to focus on the limited causes of cost overruns with the highest impact on the project cost, 
further study and analysis should be done to generate new engineering methodologies to mitigate the factors negatively 
impacting the project. 
 
5.1 Proposed Improvements 
The researcher will consider constructing more questionnaires to enhance data accuracy. Data will also be used to 
suggest mitigation measures and build a solid solution framework. 
 
5.4 Validation  
The questionnaire went through numerous validation steps. First, the face Validity was done through face-to-face 
interviews and experts reviews for the questions and the cost overrun factors. Second, a pilot study was conducted to 
filter out irrelevant questions. Finally, internal consistency was checked using Cronbach's Alpha test which resulted 
in values 0.92, 0.98 and 0.98 for replies by client replies, consultant, and contractor respectively.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The research objective was to look into the causes and determinants of construction project cost overruns in the UAE 
during the design, bidding, construction, and DLP phases of the construction project lifecycle. An extensive literature 
analysis was conducted to identify cost overrun factors whose impact needs to be accounted for.  At the level of the 
phases discussed in this paper, many factors seem to have contributed to overrun costs in many of the UAE’s projects, 
and experts have suggested solutions on how to mitigate issues in every phase. Common cost overrun factors during 
the design phase include delays in modification of designs, lack of communication between involved parties, mistakes 
and errors in design. While the relative common cost overrun factors during bidding phase have included incomplete 
design at the time of tender, unclear scopes of work and selection of contractor were based on lowest bidding cost 
only. Likewise, the questionnaire results suggested that the most common cost overrun factors during the construction 
phase are changes in the scope (goals, deadlines, and project deliverables), delays in decision making by client, and 
inadequate consideration of risks. In addition, relevant cost overrun factors during the defect liability period include 
changes to project made by client after construction, not involving maintenance teams during earlier phases, and poor 
design leading to issues. 
 
Moreover, beyond the literature analysis, this research paper conducted a questionnaire survey distributed to a group 
of professionals representing construction project stakeholders in the UAE, including clients, consultants, and 
contractors. Sixty-seven probable reasons of cost overruns in construction projects have been identified and classified 
into two groups: lifecycle phases and project stakeholders. The relative importance index approach was used to analyse 
the relevance of these aspects, resulting in the identification of the most significant four factors at each phase of the 
project lifecycle as per different stakeholders. This research has highlighted the major cost overrun factors in UAE 
construction projects. The findings have significant implications for the construction industry in the UAE and abroad. 
In addition, different steps were taken to verify the research findings. Future action includes collecting more data and 
investigating possible mitigation measures to reduce the negative impact of cost overruns. In order to reduce the study's 
limitations, we may need to consider the sample size and methodology.

Abstract 
Consumer Engagement is the main goal to be achieved for most companies, especially E-Commerce businesses in 
allocating their investment in marketing and branding. In addition to making improvements to achieve this goal, 
the company not only increased its terms of customer service but now companies, especially online, are also 
competing to improve the quality and capabilities of their online stores, especially in terms of User Interface 
Attributes in their applications. These User Interface Attributes will provide a direct experience to customers in 
transacting at the online store, so its existence is quite mandatory, considering its position as the main gate. 
Therefore, the purpose of this research is to understand and examine more deeply the influence of one of the driving 
factors for customer engagement, namely ""User Interface"" with various attributes that are owned by the Shopee 
marketplace, as one of the e-commerce with “decacorn” level in Indonesia. Later this research will be carried out 
using an explanatory quantitative approach and online survey research instruments. The influence given by these 
User Interface Attributes on consumer engagement in the form of a percentage can be presented as follows, the 
influence of Visual Design on engagement is 23.3%, the influence of Navigational Design on engagement is 14.8%, 
the influence of Informational Design on the engagement of 41%, and finally Collaboration Design has no 
significant effect on engagement.

consumers to use the Shopee marketplace, then h5 is declared accepted. This can be seen from the linear regression 
analysis with a qualified score. These findings strengthen the previous studies (Preeti Tak & Mansi Gupta, 2021 ; 
Fang, J., Zhao, Z., Wen, C., & Wang, 2017 ). In this article, we have examined a significant influence between 
consumer engagement and User Interface Attributes that include all 4 elements. All three factors were significant 
except the Collaboration design. It shows that each of the platforms created its own User Interface branding for 
customers to identify themselves with the User Interface Attributes success of their chosen platforms. So, the User 
Interface feature is valid to be one of the things that are included in the investment in increasing consumer 
engagement in the future, because it stands as a shield or the front line of an application. Through this investment 
strategy, a company like Shopee or any other can pay attention to each element included in the user interface and 
can be more observant of which elements can drive the most engagement. Given the significant relationship 
generated, this can be a reference for other beginner marketplaces as well, to pay close attention to the elements of 
User Interface Attributes followed by their futuristic and efficiency. This driver will attract more consumers to try 
and experience the product and company so that the marketplace competition in Indonesia can be more widespread 
and many more ""decacorn"" titles will be generated to bring Indonesia into the frontline in the worldwide business 
circle. Especially in terms of digital improvisation and technology to be better known in the eyes of the world. 
 
7. Conclusion  
The use, needs, and objective of this research are to analyze how big the influence the Shopee marketplace User 
Interface Attributes has on consumer engagement in using Shopee. Where later the results can be a reference for 
the Shopee marketplace in expanding or reducing their application investment in the scope of the user interface.  
 
Moreover, User Interface Attributes have a significant influence on consumer engagement. In summary, the most 
influential element of their user interface is the Informational Design display (41%) followed by Visual Design 
(23%). Its performance and quality must be maintained by Shopee. The information provided remains organized, 
complete, and accurate with a real but attractive visual appearance. The influence of navigational design (14.8%) 
is a challenge for Shopee to make the user interface easier and more enjoyable for consumers to navigate. The rest, 
Shopee needs to think about how the Collaboration Design elements can have an impact on consumer engagement. 
The total percentage of the influence given by User Interface Attributes on consumer engagement is 45.8% and 
can be one of the things that are considered in investment related to consumer engagement by other newcomer 
marketplaces in Indonesia.

Abstract 
This research proposes a production model capable of increasing the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) using 
the methodology Lean Manufacturing and TPM. The case study is a company in the livestock industry where the 4 
phases of the model were implemented. The first phase is the implementation of the Poka-Yoke tool. Then follows 
the implementation of the MRP. After that, the implementation of a preventive maintenance plan, and the last phase 
is implementing the 5S tool. After validation in the Arena software and the simulation of the implemented production 
model, it is shown that the OEE indicator increases by 15.69%, managing to achieve a productivity improvement.

1. Introduction  
The growth of the livestock sector in Latin America has risen by 3.7% per year. This is because the demands for both 
beef and poultry meats have risen in recent times, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
Nations (2022). In Peru, in 2021, the livestock industry has reached a production of 383 thousand tons. Of which, 
33.1% comes from poultry meat and 10.9% from the production of chicken eggs. 
 
According to the Ministry of Production (2022) an advance was registered in the operational development in the 
production of meat products due to the increase in local consumption and to satisfy the demand. 60% of the 
technologies for the development and planning of operations are multifunctional. These help in decision making in 
the operational management of the PYMES (Technological Institute of Production 2021). As evidenced, the use of 
engineering tools alongside the technology is vital for the competitiveness of a company nowadays. Thus, the absence 
of operational development and efficient production models is a significant problem that negatively and dramatically 
affects the profitability of an organization. Being this way, the implementation of indicators that measure the 
performance of production models is very relevant. The overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is a standard to 
measure productivity (Soltanali 2021). 
 
The purpose of the study presented by Tylor et al. (2022) is to optimize a production system. The collected information 
allows businesses to introduce a critical threshold production policy based on corrective and preventative maintenance 
strategies and sampling-based quality control. Finally, an analysis was run to guarantee the concept's viability. On the 
other hand, García et al. (2022) is a case study that remarks on the importance of maintaining the OEE optimal level 
that corresponds. The use of tools from Lean Manufacturing avoids waste generation and reprocessing in a way that 
helps to reduce the environmental impact and increase the economic benefits. This study confirms that the use of tools 
from Lean Manufacturing, like the 5´s, Poka Yoke and the Preventive Maintenance, are going to help increase the 
OEE indicator and the company profitability.

724","the production master plan was created, so we could establish a pre-analysis of the resource’s quantity and the required 
time. Because of this, this tool allows having a material requirement planning much more adequate and precise. In the 
third phase, a preventive maintenance plan was implemented, taking into account the life sheet of the machines, 
maintenance orders, inspection sheets, etc., to improve the equipment availability and don’t have unplanned stops in 
production. Lastly, in the fourth phase, the 5S tool was implemented to improve productivity and efficiency in work 
environments. 
 
The Arena software simulation of a manufacturing company was executed, using 12 effective hours per day and 100 
iterations, having a scoop in each one of the productive area’s scoops (crushing, grinding, classification, and bagging). 
As a result, an average production of finished product of 22 big bags of thin product and 16 big bags of thick product 
was obtained. Also, from the generated report, we obtained the following percentages of use of the machines. This 
were 66.40% the crusher, 70.32% the mil, 51.03%% the forklift, and 57.28% the vibratory sieve.  
 
Comparing the simulated results in Arena. The increase in daily production can be seen: 5 more tons of fine product 
and 4 more tons of thick product. In addition, the results indicate an increase of 16.8% on average in average utilization 
percentage of the machines. 
 
5.4 Validation  
In other similar research, where they apply the same tools and engineering methods that are being applied to the 
production model proposed in this investigation with the objective of improving the OEE and, with this, the 
productivity, profitability, efficiency and effectiveness of processes, they indicate the efficiency of maintenance 
increases due to the preventive maintenance by an average of 16% (Sembiring et al. 2018). In addition, the research 
published by Carranza et al. (2021) indicates that productivity improves from 8 to 12% applying Lean Manufacturing 
tools, such as Poka-Yoke, to reduce defective products, unproductive times and the unplanned machine stops. Lastly, 
Pooya and Pakadman (2019) conducted research about the effectiveness of MRP with an approach based on an 
industrial environment, managing to validate and affirm the effectiveness of this method, that has a significant impact 
on the supply chain and, with it, on the productivity and profitability of the operations.  
 
In the final scenario, with the implementation of the proposed production model, we have improved performance, 
going from average daily production of 29 tons to 38 tons of average daily production. This represents 31.04% with 
respect to the initial situation. The percentages of use of the machines also increased, as shown previously. With this, 
the availability increased from 56.10% to 73.62% and the performance went from 68.75% to 79.86%. Lastly, the OEE 
indicator went from initially 29.90% to 45.59% with the implementation of the proposed production model.  
 
6. Conclusions  
It is concluded that the production model proposed in this investigation will increase the Overall Equipment 
Effectiveness indicator by 15.69% with respect to the AS IS. This result is due to the operational development and the 
implementation of the lean Manufacturing tools and TPM in four phases. The first phase is the implementation of the 
Poka-Yoke tool. The second phase the implementation of the MRP. The third phase is the implementation of a 
preventive maintenance plan. The last phase is the implementation of the 5S tool. Likewise, as a consequence of the 
increase in productivity, the profitability will also increase. 
 
This investigation is validated by creating a model and simulating the procedures using the Arena software. Checking 
that Lean Manufacturing techniques are applicable and effective to increase the Overall Equipment Effectiveness in 
the different contexts and industrial sectors. This way, the proposed production model will contribute and demonstrate 
that using Lean Manufacturing methodology, TPM, and the OEE indicator will improve the effectiveness of the 
operations and reduce the downtime times in this type of industry.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this research is to evaluate the productivity and cost of heavy equipment on embankment work in 27 
km toll road development project in DKI Jakarta–West Java area and the cause of the different value of productivity 
from the planning. This research was conducted with quantitative method and analysed by comparing the calculation 
of productivity and costs based on survey result and theoretical data in an undisturbed and disturb conditions. This 
resulted that the productivity and cost of heavy equipment based on theoretical data in an undisturbed condition had 
better productivity and lower costs than productivity and costs based on survey in an undisturbed and disturb 
conditions. The different productivity value was caused by the dump truck that did not follow applicable regulations 
in compaction process and the after-rain condition that creates water puddles on site hence affected the heavy 
equipment’s productivity.

1. Introduction 
In this era, Indonesia rapidly developing the economy and social welfare, starting from the construction of public 
transportation facilities such as the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed train, Jakarta MRT, Jakarta LRT to the construction 
of toll roads in Indonesia. One of the ongoing infrastructure developments is the 27 km Toll Road Project in the DKI 
Jakarta – West Java Region which plays a role in the development and operator of toll roads for the length expansion 
of toll roads throughout Indonesia. The toll road corridor has fast traffic growth and the volume of traffic passing 
through the toll road has exceeded capacity. Therefore, in order to support and accommodate traffic growth in the Toll 
Road Corridor in the DKI Jakarta – West Java area, PT. Jasa Marga is building a new toll road development parallel 
to the Jakarta-Cikampek toll road.  
 
The implementation of construction work is always related to heavy equipment used by humans in doing work that is 
considered unproductive if done without the help of these tools. Construction projects certainly require heavy 
equipment to facilitate the work because heavy equipment is one of the most important things so that the project can 
achieve the target, so to produce optimal work, accurate planning is needed so that it can be achieved with optimal 
cost and execution time. Therefore, an analysis of the use of heavy equipment is needed in order to obtain the right 
alternative for heavy equipment for the construction of a project (Handoko, 2017; Miharja, 2019). One of the important 
works in toll road projects is earthworks. so, it is necessary to choose the right heavy equipment according to the type 
of work depending on the conditions, terrain, and performance of the equipment itself, but if the selection of heavy 
equipment is not by the work, progress will cause delays in achieving targets and inflated costs.  
 
Therefore, productivity of heavy equipment, scheduling, and the selection of heavy equipment for each type of work 
are very important so that operating capabilities can be optimal and mutually support other equipment considering 
that heavy equipment costs very expensive and the performance or contribution is quite dominant on the project (Supit, 
2020). Based on previous research, hourly productivity of each heavy equipment used to work on the aggregate B 
foundation layer works according to the project time schedule (Dwiretnani, 2020). In addition, when the calculation 
uses the theoretical method, the combination of 5 to 8 has an efficient productivity compared to other combinations

4. Conclusion and Suggestion 
 
4.1 Conclusion 
Conclusion Based on the results of productivity and costs of heavy equipment on 27 km Toll Road Construction 
project in the DKI Jakarta – West Java Region, the value of productivity in disturbed condition based on survey data 
has a lower value than the productivity of heavy equipment in an undisturbed condition based on survey data and 
theoretical data. The following is the conclusion of this research: 
 
1. 
For the productivity of heavy equipment value, it can be concluded that: the calculation of productivity from 
observation survey in undisturbed condition is closer to the productivity based on theoretical value and known 
data values from the equipment’s specifications, but the productivity in disturbed condition is lower than the 
others. Meaning that more care and preparation is needed to for this, and the calculation on the planning stage 
need to be more pessimistic to counter the actual outcome of heavy equipment productivity. 
2. 
The cost of productivity from each cycle can be concluded as: the cost in undisturbed condition is close to the 
calculated cost using theoretical value and known data values from the equipment’s specifications. But the value 
of those two is still higher than those planned by the project, meaning the planned calculation is most likely 
overly optimistic. Lastly the cost of productivity during the disturbed condition is higher than the rest, meaning 
it is very important to anticipate it, and not being overly optimistic on the planned calculation. 
3. 
Another conclusion is that there are factors that cause the difference in productivity values between the planned 
data and survey data, such as there are several dump trucks that pass the compaction work while it is in progress, 
so the compactor must repeat the compaction work again. Then, the condition of the field after the rain causes 
puddles of water on the compaction surface. so you have to add the number of passes from the vibratory roller 
and sheep foot roller so that puddles are reduced or lost.

Abstract 
 
MSMEs are required to continue to develop their business in order to survive in the competition. There needs to be 
innovation in terms of products, services and business processes that are carried out. In the process of assisting ideas 
generation, MSMEs facilitators need to understand the patterns that occur in the field. The purpose of this study is to 
find out what areas in the business processes of MSMEs require multiple and routine ideas. This study involved 87 
MSMEs in Bandung City, Indonesia. The data is collected from an online survey, using open-ended questions. The 
results of the study indicate that there are several areas that are focused on by MSMEs and require regular idea 
generation in the area of R&D and marketing. They need a lot of help in these two areas in terms of new solutions that 
can meet market needs. This research is useful for MSMEs assistants to understand the pattern of business processes 
undertaken by business owners, so that they can help the idea generation process in areas where they really need it. 
Scientifically for MSMEs, this research is useful to provide an overview of business processes and their relation to 
ideas generation. The limitation of this research is that the research object is only from one city, and only a few 
business categories. 
 
Keywords  
MSMEs, ideas generation, innovation, business process, idea management 
 
1. Introduction  
MSMEs are one of the sources of economic drivers, besides that they also create many job opportunities (Menon and 
Varadarajan, 1992; Holt, 2020). MSMEs need to digitize their business to increase competitiveness in the market. The 
potential of industry 4.0 is a good step for MSMEs to develop in that direction (Tortora et al. 2021). Industry 4.0 
demands continuous improvement in increasing business capacity with innovation. The concept of open innovation 
has become a trend in recent years. This allows companies to involve external parties in the innovation process and 
benefit from the programs being implemented (Helman, 2020). 
 
Covid-19 has had a major impact on economic development. An innovative approach is needed to face the challenges 
ahead. Collaboration between stakeholders is needed in order to give birth to a good ecosystem (Popov, 2021). 
Innovation is the answer to the changing business landscape and changing market trends. Innovation is an important 
part for companies to survive (Olsson et al. 2010). 
 
Entrepreneurship education has a positive impact on the growth of innovation and the birth of new businesses (Novela 
et al. 2021). In addition to technology, human resources and financial facilities, business incubators help tenants to 
understand the need for organizational management for business development (Somsuk and Laosirihongtong, 2014). 
The need for innovations that address community problems is one of the foundations of the entrepreneurial ecosystem 
(Moore, 1993). The process of exploring ideas, processing ideas and evaluating ideas is one of the most important 
things in the formation of entrepreneurs. Refinement of existing ideas is the basis of business formation and 
development (Ahmad et al. 2022). 
 
This study aims to examine areas in MSMEs that often require ideas for innovation. During a pandemic, innovation 
is a must for companies to survive and grow. In this case, a business incubator that accommodates MSMEs can help 
for the innovation process. However, it is necessary to know the business processes undertaken by the tenants, so that 
the facilitators can assist MSMEs to carry out the innovation process optimally and can assist in the stage of finding 
and managing their ideas.

ideas. In the agriculture and craft business categories, the data shows the need for ideas on products and marketing 
only. Meanwhile, in the F&B and Fashion categories, there is a need for ideas in these 3 areas. However, a large 
portion of the need for ideas is in the product and marketing areas.

In the cross-case analysis in Table 4 between the business stage and the 3 areas of MSMEs that require ideas, the data 
shows that there are 6 business stages being undertaken by MSME respondents. Ideation is a new stage in the idea 
process stage, then prototyping when you already have a sample product. Launching and developing are the initial 
business stages, while expanding and scaling up are stages of a business that is stable and wants to be developed 
further. The data shows that in the early stages of a business, the ideas needed are product development ideas. Then, 
as the business stages develop, the need for these 3 areas also becomes important. At the scaling up stage, the most 
important idea needs is in the marketing area to develop the business even more. To sum up, this research confirmed 
that in developing a business, optimizing R&D processes is an important thing (Chesbrough, 2003). 
 
6. Conclusion  
The results of the study show that there are 3 areas that require ideas generation in terms of developing their business, 
namely product, marketing and business strategy. Where the product and marketing areas become very dominant areas 
in the idea’s generation process. From the cross-case analysis data, there are special characteristics for MSMEs at each 
stage of their business, be it length of business, business categories, and business stages. This research can be useful 
for Institutions guiding MSMEs to understand the process of developing their business ideas in several areas of focus. 
The right assistance will provide optimal results in the ideas generation process. In addition, this research is useful for 
providing tools to help the ideas generation process. The limitation of this research is that it only obtains information 
from one city and several business categories. Further research can develop research methods and research objects to 
develop data acquisition.

Abstract 
 
The era of the pandemic in Indonesia has forced many businesses to focus on digital marketing as a skill to sell online. 
In business incubators at universities, students who are members need to develop their entrepreneurial skills, in this 
case the use of digital marketing. The purpose of this research is to explore the topics needed by business incubator 
members to develop their business using digital marketing. This research was conducted on 73 business owners with 
an online survey, using open-ended questions. This qualitative-based research was then analyzed using qualitative 
data analysis software. The results of the study show that branding, content marketing and social media strategy are 
topics that are needed by participants from business incubators. This research is useful for the business incubator 
facilitator to provide learning and assistance that focuses on the needs of the participants. The limitation of this 
research is that the object of research is focused on one business incubator at the university.

1. Introduction  
A good entrepreneurial ecosystem can facilitate business needs in order to develop their business (Gueguen, 2021). 
The entrepreneurial ecosystem focuses on innovation to address social problems (Moore, 1993). There is an important 
role for entrepreneurial universities in encouraging the birth of new companies, increasing economic numbers, and 
creating job opportunities. Universities with their educational curricula can help give birth to new entrepreneurs 
(Novela et al. 2021). Incubators can support the entrepreneurial ecosystem in the long term (Apa, 2017). Support in 
the learning process during the incubation period is important for entrepreneurs (Elia et al. 2021). Skills and intentions 
can be built on entrepreneurship through education (Nabi et al. 2017). 
 
The emergence of a pandemic has resulted in challenges that must be faced by many parties. The need for new 
development of the ecosystem for the economy to grow again (Popov, 2021). Consumer behavior changed with the 
arrival of the pandemic. E-commerce and online marketing are increasing in use. Various daily necessities to lifestyle 
products are available online (Sardjono et al. 2021). The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the development 
of e-commerce. Usage from the side of the seller and buyer is increasing. The need for daily products in the midst of 
a pandemic has made consumers turn to online markets (Bhatti et al. 2020). Social media has a lot of potential. The 
first is the involvement of consumers with the company, as well as the interaction between the two. Starting from 
selling products, to keeping loyal customers (Tuten, 2013). 
 
This study aims to explore the learning needs of digital marketing from business owners who are in business 
incubators. With the changing business landscape since the pandemic, MSMEs need to focus on e-business as the 
most important path at this time. Understanding of digital marketing is very important, where there are currently so 
many choices. Understanding the needs of business owners related to digital marketing will make it easier for 
facilitators to create optimal programs by inviting speakers according to the topics needed. 
 
2. Literature Review  
The incubator can be a positive influence for entrepreneurs to become a sustainable business (Schwartz and Gothner, 
2009; Guerrero and Espinoza, 2021). Business incubators at universities aim to encourage the birth of new businesses 
and assist in innovation (Theodoraki and Messeghem, 2018). One of the facilities provided by the business incubator

754","Data analysis is also carried out on the business stage. (Table 2) The category is divided into 5 stages. Prototyping is 
the stage where the business owner is making product prototypes and seeking feedback from potential customers. The 
next stage is launching, where the business has started to appear in the public. Next is business development activities 
to increase sales. In the expanding stage, the business carries out a much broader business development process, such 
as creating new products, opening new branches, partnering and others. In the scaling up stage, the business conducts 
business development at an even larger scale stage, for example in the funding stages, regional scale development, 
and others. 
  
In the data analysis carried out between the topics and the business stage. The data shows the need for materials that 
are building awareness in the prototyping and launching categories. At the launching stage and so on, the activity of 
making advertisements is visible in the data. Data analytics is needed to understand the condition of the product when 
it is already in the public. In the launching, developing and expanding categories, the data shows the distribution of 
needs in several aspects of digital marketing. This data provides an overview of the business incubator to be able to 
provide lecturers and facilitate business students to be able to improve their digital marketing skills. It is confirmed 
that intention can be built by training in entrepreneurship education and digital marketing can increase participants’ 
skills to building online business (Nabi et al. 2017; Hendiarto, 2018). 
 
6. Conclusion  
From the research, we can see that there are diverse needs between business categories for digital marketing materials 
needed to be able to develop their business online. Of the three categories, branding strategy, social media management 
and content strategy are topics that are urgently needed for the short term. In addition, at the business stage, the pattern 
of needs can also be seen so that it will help the business incubator to facilitate this need. This research helps business 
incubators map the digital marketing needs of business tenants who are MSMEs. This mapping makes the program 
right on target. The limitation of this research is the number of business incubators studied.

Abstract 
 
In recent years, a tendency known as ""omnichannel buying behavior"" has emerged in the global selling of branded 
fashion products. According to several studies, consumers, particularly millennials, prefer to web-room or review 
things online before choosing which ones to purchase directly in physical stores. The emergence of online channels 
and continuous digitization are some of the factors of web-rooming behavior. Branded fashion product retailers must 
widen their awareness of the drivers behind webrooming behavior to successfully implement the omnichannel 
shopping technique. This study attempts to identify the variables that may affect Gen Y consumers' intention to engage 
in webrooming and to create a conceptual framework based on the integrated Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) 
and Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). Researchers did a review of the literature from several sources that covered 
webrooming in the context of purchasing branded fashion products. Additionally, this study's conceptual model can 
be applied to future research.

1. Introduction 
The retail industry has seen a significant increase recently. Some of the causes are competition, increased consumer 
demand, the addition of new marketing channels by fashion companies to attract customers, and continuous 
digitalization (Christensen and Raynor, 2003; Verhoef et al., 2015). The buying habits of millennial consumers of 
branded fashion products are strongly influenced by digitalization. One of the reasons is that digitalization provides 
flexibility, ease, and convenience or accessibility to branded goods consumers through digitalization and various 
channels (Jo, Kim, and Choi, 2020). Although digitalization provides benefits for consumers, on the contrary, it is

4. Conclusion 
In this thorough systematic literature, the contemporary literature on webrooming is discussed in a number of different 
contexts. In addition, we also specifically address Gen Y consumers as identified in our sample. Nine factors have 
been discovered by this study as having an impact on customers' intentions to engage in channel switching behavior, 
particularly when it comes to webrooming to buy branded fashion products. Following a thorough investigation, it 
was discovered that these frequently occurring factors include the perceived ease of searching for information online, 
the perceived value or benefit of searching for information online, the desire to touch the product in person before 
making an actual purchase, the need for direct assistance of sales staff, socialization, attitudes, subjective norms, 
perceived risk of searching and purchasing online, and level of consumer innovativeness. A thorough literature review 
of 30 publications from Google Scholar and ScienceDirect was successful in obtaining these factors. We established 
a conceptual model based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which was integrated with the Theory of 
Reasoned Action (TRA), in addition to establishing what influences the intention of Gen Y customers to engage in 
webrooming. 
 
Although webroomers were found to be more likely to purchase more items than customers who purchased using a 
single channel, webrooming was also associated with free-riding behavior. Unfortunately, besides being profitable, 
this free-riding behavior can also bring losses. If a business doesn't retain consumers throughout channel switching, 
especially in the context of webrooming, it’s quite possible that lost sales will occur. Due to the fact that the final 
transaction is completed in a brick-and-mortar store, webrooming only benefits offline retailers. When it comes to 
offline retailers, a strategy is needed to actively deter webroomers from visiting competitors’ physical stores. There 
are a number of ways to deal with this behavior, one of which, according to the findings of a literature review, is to 
improve the shopping experience for customers by using interactive technologies like AR and VR to provide 
information about branded goods in retail settings. Retailers must convert from transactional stores to experience-
based stores in order to appeal to branded fashion product consumers, who highly appreciate experiences. 
 
Retailers can also offer unique solutions to people who purchased branded fashion products because this group of 
customers tends to be technology literate, very intelligent, and short on time (Adams, 2013). Retailers of branded 
fashion products should make every effort to make it simple for consumers to not only get detailed information about 
products online but also deal with their inquiries promptly through a website equipped with a virtual assistant feature, 
etc. in order to ensure that customers are satisfied with the product and eager to visit the physical store to make the 
actual purchase. 
 
When trying to upsell customers, salespeople frequently fail, especially when dealing with millennials. Retailers must 
therefore empower their in-store sales staff with more flexible and customer-focused techniques. Additionally, by 
leveraging more advanced technology, retailers can offer several options so that customers can still examine things

768","without physically visiting the store. A favorable online product evaluation can also be facilitated by the use of visual 
technology and kinesthetic communication. This technology is very diverse and has already begun to be applied in 
various sectors. Finally, apart from optimizing their online channels, retailers must of course also optimize their offline 
channels in order to direct consumers to physical stores. Retailers might implement marketing plans that encourage 
customers to visit their physical stores. This is anticipated to decrease consumers' free-riding behavior and boost their 
brand loyalty.

Abstract 
 
Entrepreneurship education in an academic environment cannot be separated from the academic tasks that need to be 
carried out, and the activities of running a real business. Students are given the opportunity to build their business 
from the start and are then accompanied by a facilitator. The purpose of this research is to see the motives of business 
students, whether students do business as an assignment, or continue after they graduate from college. This study uses 
an online survey with open-ended questions to 234 business students who are currently undergoing a program at a 
business incubator at a private university in Bandung, Indonesia. The results of the study show that 62% of students 
want to continue their business after graduation, the remaining 38% want to make business in college as a learning 
task only. This research is useful for entrepreneurship education actors, especially at universities, to see the patterns 
that occur in helping student businesses develop.

1. Introduction  
There is a demand for universities to continue to consider social and economic issues to make changes from product 
commercialization to industrial relations (Gibb et al. 2013). Universities help to activate innovation and assist in 
creating new opportunities (Kirby, 2002). Universities can increase the entrepreneurial spirit of the activities and tasks 
carried out during lectures. Programs from experts also help students understand the current state of the industry 
(Carey and Naudin, 2006). Universities play a role in the establishment of new businesses through their 
entrepreneurship education (Davey et al. 2016). Support from the entrepreneurship education program can influence 
students' intentions to become entrepreneurs (Shahab, 2019). 
 
One of the important things that helps new companies to develop is educational institutions (Haines, 2016). 
Entrepreneurs can be formed through entrepreneurship education programs. Research shows that there is a positive 
impact of the program, and the variety of programs has grown (Kuratko, 2005). Education that aims to teach attitudes, 
character and business skills, in addition to building a business (Fayolle, 2006). Another goal is to form entrepreneurs 
who have leadership, problem solving, managerial abilities and increase self-confidence to become entrepreneurs 
(Gamede, and Uleanya, 2019). A good measurement of the performance of the entrepreneurial ecosystem at 
universities is needed. It aims to explore the activities that have been carried out, find out the needs and motivate the 
people involved (Gabriela, 2021). 
 
This study aims to evaluate the program that is run on entrepreneurship education at the University. In practice, there 
is a task for students to build a business during lectures. The purpose of this research is to find out whether the business 
that is run in college will be continued after graduating from college or not. The results of this study are useful for 
stakeholders at the university to determine the effectiveness of the programs that have been carried out so far, as well 
as to determine the business motivation of students. 
 
2. Literature Review  
The entrepreneurial ecosystem focuses on connecting and managing the entrepreneurial environment both formally 
and informally (Shwetzer, 2019). The character of a good ecosystem is that there are entrepreneurs who lead, involve 
everyone, and there are mentoring sessions from dedicated experts or mentors because this is an important part of

771","6. Conclusion  
To sum up, this research provides an overview of entrepreneurship education at universities. How do students run a 
business and the stages they will do in the future. Overall, most businesses will continue after graduating from college 
because it has provided both technical and non-technical benefits. The existence of business potential and business 
development plans are the strongest reasons for students to continue the business that is being carried out in lectures. 
This research provides benefits to knowledge about entrepreneurship education to provide another perspective on the 
effectiveness of the program. In addition, entrepreneurship education implementers can maximize the program by 
knowing the motivations of business owners to provide optimal services.

Abstract 
 
In preparing sustainable business and entrepreneurship education in agriculture, it is important to have an initial 
approach to students to determine what learning needs are needed. The purpose of this study was to obtain the needs 
of agricultural students for the entrepreneurship education they need in order to become entrepreneurs in agriculture 
after graduating from college. This research is qualitative in nature using an online survey of 44 agricultural students 
at a university, in the city of Bandung, Indonesia. Data analysis carried out was coding, data validation, and cross-
case analysis. The results of the study indicate that entrepreneurial skills and the use of technology are the main 
concerns of agricultural students, as well as several other factors needed to support entrepreneurship education 
activities for agricultural students. The benefit of this research is that it helps universities to map out needs and also 
prepares curricula and experts that support these needs. Scientifically, this research develops knowledge in the field 
of entrepreneurship education in agriculture.

1. Introduction  
The existence of the COVID-19 pandemic requires a movement to improve the economy (Popov et al. 2021). 
Nowadays distribution has changed, consumers are choosing products online and there is a demand for home 
distribution. This happened due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a change in the business landscape (Hobbs, 
2020). One of the economic driving factors is the existence of entrepreneurship in the fields of agri-food, processing, 
trade, and others (Giourka, 2021). Much of the growth of agripreneurs is related to technology in various countries 
(Graff et al. 2019). The use of information technology in industry 4.0 can help increase the profits of agriculture 
companies, as well as increase sustainability (Ozdogan et al. 2017). Sustainable entrepreneurship is related to the 
commitment that the company will carry out well for future generations. These aspects include people, profit and 
planet (Crals and Vereeck, 2004). 
 
Agropreneurship education can strengthen students' desire to become entrepreneurs. Efforts that need to be made are 
how to balance entrepreneurship education with skills in agriculture. Learning is also expected to provide a 
multidisciplinary experience, starting from the basic concepts of agriculture, management, to digital tools (Pehin Dato 
Musa et al. 2021). Entrepreneurship education plays a role in the development of entrepreneurial skills (Fayolle and 
Klandt, 2006). Entrepreneurship education is part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem that provides education and 
training (Regele and Neck, 2012). Universities can help stimulate innovation and open up new business opportunities 
(Kirby, 2002). The important thing to note is to measure the performance and activities of the programs carried out so 
that they have an impact and become room for further improvement (Gabriela et al. 2021). 
 
The purpose of this study was to obtain the needs of agricultural students for the entrepreneurship education they need 
in order to become entrepreneurs in agriculture after graduating from college. It is hoped that the topics that are needed

From Table 2, the distribution of age data ranges from 18-43 years. The analysis was conducted in order to understand 
the pattern of the influence of age on the topics needed in entrepreneurship education for agripreneurs. Just like the 
professional categories in the previous table, the main needs are technology and entrepreneurial skills. This distribution 
is spread over various age ranges. Interesting data is that from the age of respondents 41 and 43, there is a need for 
marketing and learning about product quality, which is contrary to the needs of respondents who are younger than 
them. This study supports the research of Pehin Dato Musa et al. (2021) regarding agropreneurism education can 
increase the intention of students to become entrepreneurs. Needs can be recorded and developed. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The conclusion of this study is that there is a diverse need for topics needed in entrepreneurship education for 
agripreneurs. The point of view of those who work in agriculture and are students in college campuses that focus on 
agriculture is very important. This research is useful for universities to make programs and curricula that can be 
adapted to the needs of prospective agripreneurs. This research also provides a new perspective on entrepreneurship 
education in the field of agripreneur. The limitation of this research is the deepening of research from other necessary 
supporting facilities. Further research is to prepare a curriculum based on the needs and availability of resources from 
the university.

Abstract 
 
In the business incubator, one of the biggest obstacles faced by business students is public speaking skills. If students 
do not have this ability, the consequence is that it is difficult to develop a business, because it will have to do with 
convincing other people, discussing, and so on. The purpose of this study was to see the impact of the self-coaching 
method on business students regarding the evaluation of their public speaking skills. This study involved 73 business 
students, using the form of open-ended questions. This study uses a qualitative method. The results of this study show 
that students can evaluate obstacles, learn important learning points from Steve Jobs' video presentation, and evaluate 
weak points that the student wants to improve on. The benefit of this research for business incubators is that it helps 
to map the current constraints and abilities of students regarding their public speaking skills. Then, this research can 
be useful for preparing training and mentoring for students according to their needs. Scientifically, this research 
contributes to the development of entrepreneurship education and coaching. 
 
Keywords  
Entrepreneurship education, entrepreneurial skill, coaching, public speaking 
 
1. Introduction  
One of the most important programs in forming entrepreneurs is capacity building. Increasing knowledge, skills and 
competencies will have a positive effect on the entrepreneurial journey. The incubator plays a role in fostering through 
its mentoring program for business development from students (Elia, 2021). Incubators provide resources that can 
increase the capabilities of their tenants (Somsuk, 2014). Incubators can provide facilities that support business 
development to be sustainable (Schwartz and Gothner, 2009). Mentoring is one of the important programs to support 
tenants in the business ecosystem (Feld, 2012). 
 
Where the research is being conducted, there is a need to improve public speaking skills. Young incubator participants 
need to be equipped with good communication skills in order to develop their business. Generation Y needs mentors 
to get information on improvements they can make (Adiguzel, 2014). Mentoring programs are needed to help 
participants (Sullivan, 2000). Skills can be trained through training and learning processes in entrepreneurship 
education which will have an impact on participants such as creativity and courage in taking risks (Wei et al. 2019). 
 
This study aims to determine the impact of the self-reflection method on the coaching process carried out in the 
business incubator. The aim is to find out the obstacles faced, the learning of public speaking obtained from Steve 
Jobs' presentation, and aspects that will be improved by the students in improving their public speaking skills. 
 
2. Literature Review  
Entrepreneurial skills can be formed from entrepreneurship programs (Fayolle, 2006). There are many soft skills 
required in the Entrepreneurship Education curriculum. One of them is improving communication skills (Hood and 
Young, 1993). External factors can motivate and influence cognitive aspects of learning (North, 1990). Successful 
entrepreneurs can influence people to understand their entrepreneurial journey, in terms of business management and 
other skills (Acs et al. 2018). Currently, social media can be a tool to help learning so that practicing a skill can be 
done in an interesting way (Alabdulkareem, 2015). The use of social media can provide a fun learning experience, but 
not many teachers use this (Sheldon, 2015). Self-reflection can help identify what things need to be improved in the 
communication process. How is grammar, delivery, expression and pronunciation (Carter and Nunan, 2001). 
Currently, there are many technologies that can help in learning public speaking, such as videos, podcasts, films and 
others. These tools can help in improving the communication skills of study participants (Eshankulovna, 2021). In

his opinion about mastering the material, ""Trying to better master the material so as to reduce tension just before the 
presentation and not be in a hurry and adjust the intonation in giving a presentation so that the audience can understand 
the meaning of the presentation given"". Next is to improve the presentation skill, ""Master the stage and not get hung 
up on the material screen."" and “Tranquility and storytelling in presentations.” And students will improve other aspects 
such as speak clearly, calmly, body language and practice. This study confirms that social media can be an interesting 
learning tool and can improve skills (Alabdulkareem, 2015; Sheldon, 2015). Then, this method confirms that self-
reflection can help improve the communication process (Carter and Nunan, 2001). 
 
6. Conclusion  
The conclusion of this research is that there is a method during coaching, which can help business students to reflect 
on their public speaking skills. In the process, they reflect on the constraints, then look at best practices to get lessons 
from the experts. From the results of the study, all participants felt the benefits of the reflection method of public 
speaking skills. There are several aspects that business students will focus on to improve their public speaking skills. 
Because one of the skills needed by entrepreneurs is public speaking. This research is useful for business incubators 
to understand the public speaking skill needs of their members. The provision of programs can be effective and 
efficient to facilitate students so that they can practice their communication skills, especially public speaking skills. 
This research is useful for developing a business incubator perspective, entrepreneurship education, and coaching 
sessions. The limitation of this research is that it has only conducted research in one business incubator.

Abstract 
 
The Business Incubator at the university accepts business students every semester. There are several factors that make 
them a young entrepreneur today. Special assistance is needed from the Business Incubator so that it can help students 
desire to become the entrepreneurs they want. The purpose of this study is to find out the reasons for doing business 
from students so that a mapping of what motives can be used as a reference for them. This study uses an online survey, 
open-ended question, to 199 business students who are undergoing a program at a business incubator, at a private 
university in the city of Bandung. Qualitative analysis was carried out by means of first-cycle coding, second-cycle 
coding, and cross-case analysis. The results of the study show that the reasons for doing business are divided into 4 
categories, namely profit, passion, problems, and college graduation requirements. Two categories that dominate are 
reasons for profit and passion. This research is useful for business incubator managers, especially at universities, to 
be able to map student motives for providing appropriate facilities and companions. This research is also useful for 
developing knowledge about entrepreneurship education. The limitation of this research is that the new research object 
uses one sample business incubator.

1. Introduction  
There is an important role for universities to build a desire for entrepreneurship through program activities that increase 
entrepreneurial abilities (Carey and Naudin, 2006). Entrepreneurs can be formed through entrepreneurship education 
program activities (Kuratko, 2005). Entrepreneurship education is expected to increase the growth of new 
entrepreneurs, which can have an impact on increasing the number of jobs (Klapper, 2004). Teaching 'for' 
entrepreneurship is useful for improving entrepreneurial skills. (Rae, 2005). To develop the capacity of entrepreneurs, 
it is necessary to provide knowledge, business competencies and entrepreneurial skills (Elia, 2021). There will be an 
increase in the intention of entrepreneurship education (Nabi et al. 2017). 
 
Business incubators are tasked with increasing new business growth and innovations (Theodoraki & Messeghem, 
2018). Business continuity can be assisted by a business incubator with various facilities (Schwartz and Gothner, 
2009). Support for business development facilities will motivate business students (Guerrero and Espinoza-Benavides, 
2021). Program delivery and support can increase the intention to become an entrepreneur (Shahab, 2019). 
Entrepreneurship education can help the birth of entrepreneurs (Kuratko, 2005). It is necessary to measure the impact 
of the curriculum and program implementation of the entrepreneurship program. (Williams and Kluev, 2010). 
 
This study aims to determine the motivation to do business from students who are members of the business incubator. 
What are the reasons for doing business from students in college or after graduating from college. This research is 
useful for business incubator managers to provide the right facilities for each participant with various motivations. 
 
2. Literature Review  
Entrepreneurial ecosystems can help create impactful innovations that solve social problems (Moore, 1993). In 
addition, it can be a feeder to help a larger entrepreneurial ecosystem (Field, 2012). Universities have a positive impact 
on the birth of new companies and entrepreneurs (Novela, 2021). The university helps train entrepreneurs for social 
and technical skill development through the learning and training process (Lopes, 2021). 
There is an important role for entrepreneurial processes in the running of the entrepreneurial ecosystem (Shwetzer et 
al. 2019). The role of universities is important in building new businesses (Haines, 2016). The learning process in

The Table 2 relates students’ motivation in running business and their understanding towards business knowledge. 
Overall, majority of students who motivated by passion admit having knowledge understanding, whereas students 
who motivated to graduate show limited knowledge understanding. In contrast with two categories above, students 
with profit scattered in different understanding. Majority of these students has a low knowledge understanding, while 
some said to master the knowledge.  
 
6. Conclusion  
From this study, it shows that there are various student motivations in doing business in the business incubator. The 
two biggest reasons are profit and passion. There are 2 other categories that become reasons for doing business, namely 
problems and college graduation requirements. This research is useful for business incubator managers at universities 
to map the needs of students based on their reasons for doing business. Business incubators can facilitate their needs 
with the right target. This research can also develop knowledge about entrepreneurship education, business incubator 
and entrepreneurial intention. The limitation of this research is that the new research object uses one sample business 
incubator.

Abstract 
 
In business assistance in the business incubator, students are required to collaborate that can improve their business 
development. There is a matchmaking process to help students find the best partner. This study aims to see the pattern 
that occurs in business students about what type of collaboration they want. This study involved 73 students at a 
business incubator at a private university in Bandung, Indonesia. The research uses qualitative methods assisted by 
qualitative analysis software for data processing. The results of the study show several major themes regarding the 
type of collaboration desired by business students in business incubators, namely in the same or different industries, 
the same vision, sales channels, innovation, and being able to increase sales. This research is useful for facilitators in 
business incubators to map student businesses according to their needs and desires, so that they can meet each other 
with their respective partners so that they can carry out the desired collaboration. Scientifically, this research is useful 
to increase knowledge about the process of entrepreneurship education in the Business Incubator.

1. Introduction  
In the Covid-19 pandemic, it is a challenge for all industries to develop new opportunities and boost the economy 
again (Popov, 2021). Universities are required to have an impact on the social problems that need to be resolved. 
Collaboration between universities and industry is one of the most important things (Gibb et al. 2013). University as 
an entrepreneurial ecosystem has an important role in the birth of new businesses and fosters cooperation between 
parties (Davey, 2016). Entrepreneurship education is not only about building a business, but also helping to improve 
entrepreneurial skills and competencies (Lackeus, 2015). Program providers must continuously evaluate what students 
need in order to know the impact of entrepreneurship education (Williams and Kluev, 2010). Business incubators at 
universities act as drivers of innovation and assist in the development of entrepreneurial skills so that many new start-
ups are born (Theodoraki & Messeghem, 2018). 
 
Entrepreneurship is now developing in the creation and application of creative solution ideas and collaboration for 
their development (Kuratko, 2014). The entrepreneurial ecosystem needs networking opportunities between 
prospective entrepreneurs (Haines, 2016). One of the most important steps in entrepreneurship education is helping 
students to develop the ability to see business opportunities and apply them (Raposo and Paco, 2011). An important 
part of the entrepreneurial ecosystem is the birth of new innovative ideas (Ylinenpaa, 2009). A culture that needs to 
be built so that the spirit of entrepreneurship is born by building values and trust (Brownson, 2013). There needs to 
be support from universities to provide programs that can make students network, especially with industry and those 
who are already running their businesses (Saeed et al. 2015). Collaboration is an important part for companies to 
compete in today's era. Companies are now difficult to run alone (Penin et al. 2011). Collaborating can increase 
competitiveness in the midst of competition (Wirtz, 2011). This study aims to determine the type of collaboration 
desired by students in participating in the program at the Business Incubator, to help them in developing their business. 
 
2. Literature Review  
Character development and entrepreneurial attitudes can be developed from teaching techniques in entrepreneurship 
education (Fayolle et al. 2006). There are hard skill programs such as business plan preparation, management, etc. As 
well as soft skills such as leadership, human relations, negotiations, communication skill and others to be included in

791","From the table, it is clear that the majority of students are likely to collaborate with businesses in the same industry 
with them (37.9%). About twenty per cent difference with the first preference, 18.4% students prefer to consider the 
number of sales before deciding to collaborate. Different industry considers for 15.5% of students preferred 
collaboration, with each two per cent differences for innovation (13.6%), and vision (11.7%). Only few students have 
no criteria to take into account. 
 
The table 1 shows students’ type of collaboration for F&B and Non-F&B business categories.  According to the data, 
we can see both F&B (39%) and Non-F&B (34.6%) mainly choose businesses in the same industry to collaborate. 
Although both have the same main consideration, the rest participants’ answers show dissimilar preferences. For F&B 
group, sales (22.1%) come as the second reason, follows by innovation (13.0%), different industry (13.0%), and vision 
(10.4%). In the other side, more than quarter participants from Non-F&B group prefer to collaborate with businesses 
form different industry (23.1%). Both innovation and vision accounts for 15.4% of students preferred type of 
collaboration. This shows a contrast situation as sales showed less sign of consideration in 7.7%. However, only small 
minority from both business categories have no criteria to collaborate other than the main five. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The results of the study show several major themes regarding the type of collaboration desired by business students 
in business incubators, namely in the same or different industries, the same vision, sales channels, innovation, and 
being able to increase sales. The various types of collaboration needed can be linked by the business incubator manager 
to make existing businesses complement each other internally. Externally, existing businesses can develop their 
collaborations because they understand the partners they need. This research is useful for facilitators in business 
incubators to map student businesses according to their needs and desires, so that they can meet each other with their 
respective partners so that they can carry out the desired collaboration. Scientifically, this research is useful to increase 
knowledge about the process of entrepreneurship education in the Business Incubator.

Abstract 
 
Various challenges have been faced by PLN in carrying out its commitment to providing electricity to all corners of 
the archipelago and improving the reliability of services at affordable rates. Reduce the cost of supply (BPP) including 
by continuing to reduce the use of fossil fuel and optimizing cheaper primary energy sources in order to carry out the 
Government's mandate to maintain electricity prices to stabilize people's purchasing power, industrial competitiveness 
and target renewable energy (RE) in the energy mix by 2025 of at least 23%, a De-dieselization program was created. 
Several alternatives are offered in the form of isolated plant management models. Whether later the management of 
the plant will continue to be carried out by PLN or assignment to subsidiaries with Independent Power Producer (IPP) 
with Power Purchase Agreement scheme based on the calculation of the optimum Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE). 
Decision making uses the AHP method as a quantitative weighting method from qualitative data by PLN management 
respondents which is integrated with the Goal Programming method. Based on the AHP weighting on the sub-criteria, 
it was found that the LCOE / BPP had the highest weight of 0.304 and the respondents' preference for alternative PV-
Diesel (IPP) was 24.4% compared to other alternatives. Based on the integration of AHP-Goal Programming, the most 
optimal achievement vector value was obtained in the alternative PV-Diesel (PLN) with Min Z of 873.90 (4 of the 6 
Goals achieved), IRR 11.53%, LCOE / BPP Rp 2,860 / kWh and EAF 93.28%.

1. Introduction 
The availability of adequate electric power is one of the main basic infrastructures that have a major role in supporting 
the economic growth of a country. For PLN, the spirit to ensure that all areas in the country get an adequate supply of 
electricity is a form of support for the creation of prosperity. Efforts to reduce the cost of supply (BPP) continue to be 
carried out, including by continuing to suppress the use of fuel oil (BBM) and optimizing electricity production from 
cheaper primary energy sources in order to carry out the Government's mandate to maintain electricity prices in order 
to maintain people's purchasing power and power. industry competitiveness. PLN also continues to improve 
community access in Front, Outermost and Disadvantaged areas to obtain adequate electrical energy in terms of 
reliability and tariffs, one of which is the archipelago in Madura which is included in the work area of PT PLN 
(Persero) Unit Induk Distribusi Jawa Timur. Along with the transformation of PLN, one of the four main themes is 
GREEN “Leading Indonesia's energy transition through rapid and efficient scale-up of renewables” and in line with 
the Government program which has set a target for the utilization of New Renewable Energy (EBT) in the energy mix

In Goal 5, the constant for each alternative X1 to X5 is obtained from the value of the duration of the PV project. 
(Eq. 10) 
In Goal 6, the constant for each alternative X1 to X5 is obtained from the primary energy intermittent value based on 
the number of PV months that have decreased below the average monthly GWh production (January, February, 
November & December) multiplied by the number of years planned for operation without Diesel. 
By using software to simulate the script goal programming, the result is that the mathematical model is solved with 
an objective function value of 877.3938 as the minimum value. For goal 1 (p1) has a parameter value of 2.860 which 
is the minimum value so that the goal is declared achieved. For goal 2 (n2), it has a parameter value of 0 which is the 
maximum value so that the goal is declared achieved. For goal 3 (n3), the parameter value of 13.3 is not the maximum 
value so that the goal is declared not achieved. For goal 4 (n4), the parameter value of 3.2 is not the maximum value 
so that the goal is declared not achieved. For goal 5 (p5), the parameter value of 7 is the minimum value so that the 
goal is declared achieved. For goal 6 (p6), the parameter value of 8 is the minimum value so that the goal is declared 
achieved.  
 
Based on the results of the goal programming, 4 goals were declared to have been achieved from the 6 planned goals. 
The minimum objective function value and the highest number of goal achievements belong to alternative 4 PV-Diesel 
(PLN). For the three planned limits, all of them are achieved with an LCoE/BPP value of IDR 2,860/kWh smaller 
than the constraint of IDR 3,965/kWh, an EAF value of 93.28% greater than the constraint of 82% and there is only 1 
alternative chosen, namely the alternative 4 PV-Diesel (PLN). 
 
5.4 Sensitivity Analysis 
After obtaining the results of the AHP and Goal Programming analysis, a sensitivity analysis was carried out on 6 
parameters, including: (1) Increasing the weight of the O&M criteria by more than 0.500, (2) Increasing the price of 
land acquisition by more than 500%, (3) Increasing the maintenance cost by PLN to 300 %, (4) Increase Repayment 
Period from 12 years to 15 years, (5) Increase investment costs by 10% and (6) Increase investment costs by 20%. 
Based on the sensitivity analysis on these 6 parameters, it was found that Alternative 4 PV-Diesel (PLN) still has an 
optimal value compared to other alternatives so that it can be stated that the alternative value is ""Robust"". 
 
6. Conclusion 
In research on the selection of power plant management using the AHP method and Goal Programming in the 
framework of the Kangean PLTD De-Dieselization program, the following conclusions are drawn: 
1) Through the AHP method, the importance weight on the cost criteria is 0.304, the O&M criteria is 0.306 and 
the risk criteria is 0.309. 
2) Experts give the largest alternative weight to Alternative 2 PV-Diesel (IPP) of 0.244, greater than other 
alternatives. 
3) Through the Goal Programming method, the optimization results are obtained, namely Alternative 4 PV-
Diesel (PLN) is the optimal one with an objective function of 877,3938, the number of goals achieved is 4 
out of 6 goals and all constraints are achieved. 
4) The new renewable energy mix for alternative 4 PV-Diesel (PLN) is estimated at 72.7% PV and 27.3% Diesel 
(1st – 8th year). 
5) This research can be used as material for consideration or evaluation in decision making as well as material 
for negotiating the JOM contract on IPP compared to the operating and maintenance costs carried out by 
PLN itself.

Abstract 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic entered its second year and had impact on all aspects. The implementation of PPKM and 
health protocols resulted in changes in the pattern of community activities. PT. PHE ONWJ as one of the national oil 
and gas mining companies has changed the cycle of offshore platform workers, which was originally 12:12 workdays 
schedules changed to 21:21 workdays schedules. However, the increasing number of positive confirmed cases of 
COVID-19 in Indonesia and in the PHE ONWJ, company has resulted in co-workers who are unable to perform crew 
changes or work cycle changes, forcing colleagues at the bridge to perform extended days. Based on questionnaire 
data in the field, 51% of workers have had an extended day with an average total work duration of 28 working days. 
The analysis continued with the NASA TLX method to determine the mental load condition of offshore platform 
workers. Data from the NASA TLX questionnaire is divided into 2 groups, workers who have experienced an extended 
day and those who have not experienced an extended day. NASA TLX had the dominant workload averages are mental 
demand (276) and time demand (271) with an average WWL 80.68 (high category of workload). So that an analysis 
was carried out to determine the more optimal duration of the working day during the COVID-19 pandemic using the 
AHP method with 4 criteria, namely the mental burden of workers, accommodation and transportation costs, health 
protocols and operational needs in the field with alternatives of 12 days, 14 days, 18 days and 21 working days.

Abstract 
 
The advancement and rapid development of technology has led to a transformation in the retail industry and has also 
revolutionized the shopping channels available in the market to realize consumer variety in information seeking, 
product comparison, and buying behavior. In this phenomenon, consumers have shown a pattern of using combined 
shopping channels. For example, consumers exhibit showrooming behavior when they visit a physical store looking 
for product information but end up buying online. The concept of webrooming can be expanded as a form of 
omnichannel shopping where consumers search for information online before going to a physical store to make a 
purchase and also access the internet while in a physical store to look for information. Smartphones are one of the 
electronic products that consumers in Indonesia are looking for information on online. The purpose of this study is to 
analyze the factors that influence the intention of the millennial generation in Indonesia to do webrooming on the 
purchase of smartphone products. The model used in this study is a combination model of three studies that describe 
the factors that influence the intention to do webrooming with a total of 18 hypotheses. The method used is structural 
equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and the number of respondents is 255 respondents. The results of this study show that 
lower search costs, access to online reviews, perceived availability of salespeople, and touch and feel experience have 
a positive and significant relationship with intention to do webrooming.

811",,"visiting a physical store, namely the Apple brand, and the majority of the millennial generation in Indonesia purchased 
smartphone products with a period of > 6 months ago. 
 
Furthermore, based on the results of the PLS-SEM analysis, it was found that lower search costs have a positive and 
significant effect on the intention to do webrooming. Because the acceptance of these factors is because the millennial 
generation in Indonesia feels that the cost of searching for product-related information is much more effective and 
efficient in terms of time, wages, and effort through online platforms before deciding to make a purchase by visiting 
a physical store. Then, the findings from the results of the PLS-SEM analysis in this study also stated that access to 
online reviews had a positive and significant relationship with the intention to do webrooming. Millennials in 
Indonesia feel that online reviews provided by potential customers through online platforms are very useful for them 
to get information before they visit physical stores to make purchases related to smartphone products. The results of 
the subsequent PLS-SEM analysis also state that touch and feel experience has a positive and significant relationship 
with intentions to do webrooming. This is due to the belief that they will buy the product after they touch it first. So 
that the millennial generation in Indonesia feels that in the context of purchasing smartphone products they have to 
visit a physical store to find out the attributes of the product to be purchased. The results of the PLS-SEM analysis 
which then show that the perceived availability of asles people have a positive and significant relationship with the 
intention to do webrooming. This is because the millennial generation in Indonesia feels that the help of salespeople 
in physical stores is very helpful in the shopping process. The existence of the help of salespeople in physical stores 
is very helpful for consumers when they want to ask something related to the product to be purchased. So this really 
encourages the millennial generation in Indonesia to do webrooming on the purchase of smartphone products. 
 
This research has been carried out according to the research method used and the conceptual model that has been 
validated through PLS-SEM analysis. However, there are still some research limitations in this study. The limitation 
obtained is that the respondents in this study only cover the millennial generation, so the results obtained cannot be 
generalized to other generations for beneficiaries, namely smartphone offline retail stores. In addition, in terms of 
analysis, this study only uses PLS-SEM analysis, so the results obtained are still not optimal from various points of 
view of existing analytical techniques. Future research can explore other factors that can encourage someone to do 
webrooming. By finding these other factors will have an impact on the results of the study. In addition, from the 
analytical techniques used, further research is recommended to add technical analysis such as cluster analysis or 
ANOVA to get results from various points of view on the analytical techniques used.

Abstract 
Laboratory testing is an important process which relies on scientific analysis to identify problems with services 
or a product. It provides analytical data on the quality of a product or service to support other process depending 
on the type of the industry. Laboratory test results impact many areas of our daily lives since the results produced 
are often used as the quality control of the product or a service. 
This study examines root courses of why the laboratory under study was failing to meet customer’s Service Level 
Agreement (SLA), and how those bottlenecks can be resolved through the application of Lean Six Sigma (LSS). 
The study seeks to identify critical factors within the laboratory and customers’ perception about services they 
receive. 
The research design used in this study is based on qualitative research. Brainstorming sessions and questionnaires 
were used to collect data about the causes leading to lack of fulfilling customer demands. LSS tools were then 
applied to minimise or eliminate wastes in order for the laboratory to operates effectively. Finally, personnel 
surveys were conducted to verify the effectiveness of LSS implementation and customer surveys were conducted 
to assess the level of satisfaction after LSS application.  
After application of LSS, the results showed that the laboratory is now working in a lean environment, meeting 
customer demands while producing accurate and credible results timeously. It can, therefore, be concluded that 
bottlenecks were the cause on not meeting customer demand and they were eliminated through LSS application.

1. Introduction 
Water Testing Laboratory (WTL) is one of the departments within the organisation under study, which focuses 
primarily on the provision of analytical services such as testing water and water quality compliance in support of 
internal customers (Regions) within the organisation’s area of supply. These services are also extended to external 
customers (District and Local Municipalities) 
The results obtained from the laboratory assist in optimising water treatment plants, compliance in terms of final 
drinking water that is distributed to consumers as per Water Services Act No. 108 1997 Water National Legislation 
and meeting SANS 241:2015 drinking water standard requirements. This research is very significant as WTL 
plays a vital role in water sector, hence not producing valid, credible results timeously will affect end users at 
home who consume water since decisions cannot be made without the final test results from WTL. 
Currently the WTL is struggling with high volume of customer complaints due to Service Level Agreement (SLA) 
not being met, recurring customer complaints/non-conformances, occurrence of variable lead times which

822","Figure 12 above gives a clear insight of the level of satisfaction expressed by external customers after LSS 
application. 68% of customers strongly agree with SLAs being met. For reliability, accuracy, and validity of WTL 
test results, 56% of customers strongly agreed and 40% agreed, this is a huge progress since this has been a major 
problem. Customers are pleased with overall efficiency of the laboratory with 96% of them strongly agreeing to 
it. None of the customers are dissatisfied with the service rendered by WTL after application of LSS. 
Overall Analysis of Results 
From the analysis and discussions of findings of this study, it is clear that brainstorming teams were successful in 
identifying bottlenecks/wastes that lead to customer dissatisfactions. All identified wastes were the root causes of 
inefficiency of the laboratory leading to failure in meeting SLAs with customers.  The application of LSS tools 
was a success with accurate selection of the appropriate tools, hence there was an improvement since these were 
implemented. 
 
Internal and external customers are now satisfied with the laboratory services and WTL is now meeting SLA’s 
confidence in producing results that are accurate, valid and credible. Also, the communication between laboratory 
and the customers has improved which makes it convenient for customers to continue with their tasks of 
optimising water treatment plants. 
WTL can now confidently say that they are producing credible, accurate results timeously; customer satisfaction 
is enhanced; and now the working environment is lean, efficient, and effective after waste removal. 
6. Conclusion 
The root causes of not meeting customer SLAs as well as of not working effectively were identified through 
brainstorming teams and they were regarded as waste as per LSS concept. This exercise was a success since 
waste were addressed by means of LSS application. LSS was applied on each waste identified in order to 
improve the efficiency of the laboratory and its operations. This was a success as the method failure, number of 
non-conformances, credibility of results as well as meeting of SLA was improved.  
Customers SLA are now being met, which was the major problem within the laboratory with the customers 
having to optimise the Water Treatment Plant and comply with Water Services’ Act and SANAS 241 based on 
the results obtained from the WTL. Since the SLA’s are now being met, customers are now making sound 
decisions in terms of water quality and plant optimisation so that the community can consume clean and safe 
water without any outbreak. 
Based on the customer surveys conducted with both internal and external customers, the application of LSS has 
enhanced customer satisfaction. The number of non-conformances has decreased gradually which were derived 
from the customer complaints. The survey results from customers and WTL personnel, WTL has improved its 
processes through application of LSS and the laboratory is now working in a lean environment with improved 
processes. 
The entire laboratory is now working effectively and efficiently, and personnel seem to be pleased with the 
results obtained from LSS application is now performing well in terms of meeting customers SLA’s, delivering 
accurate and reliable test results, working in a lean environment effectively, however the current need to be 
sustained with measures put in place.

Abstract  
 
Green business has been a detrimental topic to the current industry in almost every sector possible. Cases of pollutions 
caused by business that accumulated over the years caused damages that might be irreversible if not changed. A 
transition into a more sustainable future is needed and as such need actions that help adapt and motivate people to 
work towards that transition. On its own, Pro-Environmental Behaviour helped in implementing actions that adapts to 
this transition, however, there is a need to see the influence these behaviours have on Leadership for Sustainability. 
Knowing the influence the variables have, helps us in knowing what actions we should take in order to make this 
transition going on more smoothly. With the help of knowing how much one variable influences the other, wae can 
make changes accordingly that helps adapting and motivating these kinds of behaviours easier.  To accomplish the 
purpose of this study, the researcher carried out a survey towards employees in Jakarta with the perspective that they 
are occupying most of the current consumer market as well as business owners. The methods that we use on analysing 
these data’s will be using Rasch measurement model and Linear Regression analysis that will show the reliability and 
validity of the data gathered as well as to confirm the hypotheses test done. The research findings are first, mainly 
where it is proven that Pro-Environmental Behaviour have a significant influence on Leadership for Sustainability. 
Second, the respondents with high degree of Leadership for Sustainability are also accompanied with respondents 
with high degree of Pro-Environmental Behaviour, and the other way around. Lastly, most of the respondents have 
high Leadership for Sustainability and high Pro-Environmental Behaviour. The practical implication of this study is 
people that have the vision of a better, more sustainable future, usually always shows to have behaviours that helps 
the environment. Most of the people in the recent days have been showing that and working actively towards it. Thus, 
this could serve as an opportunity from businesses to make products or services that helps in helping these people 
transition to a more sustainable future and at the same time helps decreasing the environmental impacts they have. In 
this study, the questionnaires were filled out by 221 respondents which later deducted to eliminate non-valid responses. 
A total of 191 respondents were the respondents with valid responses. Study regarding green business practices is 
currently on the rise, thus there haven’t been much of these studies in the recent years and there haven’t been much of 
studies that compares the variables of green business like this.

Abstract 
 
Climate change is one of the most widely debated issues in the world. This is mostly because of the rise in 
greenhouse gas emissions during the industrial revolution. The corporation publishes a Social and Environmental 
Responsibility Report as a form of corporate responsibility. The authors of this study want to explore how CSR 
reporting, carbon emissions disclosure, and eco-efficiency applications affect corporate value. The objects under 
consideration are 55 manufacturing corporations listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange, with an emphasis on 
the industrial sector (IDX). SPSS 26 multiple linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the data. According 
to this study, CSR has a considerable negative impact on corporate value. Furthermore, disclosing carbon 
emissions has a substantial detrimental impact on the companies' values. The same applies for eco-efficiency, 
which reduces firm value. This finding demonstrates that CSR, carbon emissions transparency, and eco-efficiency 
do not affect the enterprise value computed by PBV. The three independent factors investigated had little effect, 
especially on swings in the company's stock price.

1. Introduction 
Climate change is one of the most debatable and controversial issues around the world. According to Berkeley 
Earth Monitoring Group researcher Zeke Hausfather, there will be no indicators of climate cooling until 2021 as 
human activities create more heat (Lodie Tombeg, 2022). The rise in Earth's temperature is mostly due to increased 
emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution, the majority of which are caused 
by human activities such as the combustion of fossil fuels, which emit carbon dioxide gas. The beginning of the 
industrial revolution has ramifications for industrial developments in the accounting world, one of which is 
reporting (Rusmana & Purnaman, 2020). Even though a company's primary goal is to generate a profit, it must 
nevertheless use its resources as effectively as possible. In Indonesia, there is a Limited Liability Company Law 
No. 40, Article 74 of 2007, which specifies that firms must be conscious of the need to conserve the environment 
and be socially responsible while performing industrial operations involving natural resources. The effectiveness 
of the corporate social and environmental responsibility programme may be measured not only in terms of 
execution but also in terms of communication. When a company's CSR communication meets or surpasses 
customer expectations for how CSR should be conveyed, the business reaps more advantages from its CSR 
initiatives (Kim & Ferguson, 2018). It also tries to lessen the environmental effect of the Minimizing the 
company's production waste necessitates efforts on the part of the company to guarantee that the waste generated 
has a low impact on the environment. As a result, implementing the eco-efficiency concept is ideal for a company 
dealing with its material waste. 
 
The annual report of a company serves as a means of communication between investors and shareholders as well 
as an evaluation for investors looking to invest in a company. Thus, the following questions may arise. First, 
where is the long-term commitment of the firm? as well as the results of the company's performance in a year? 
and how do we track any achievements made by the company in the annual report? However, according to a study 
(Nur Utomo et al., 2020), the environmental performance has a favourable influence on environmental disclosure 
and enterprise value, but environmental disclosure has no impact on enterprise value. It does not affect the impact 
of environmental performance on corporate value. It does not affect the impact of environmental performance on 
corporate value. As a result, CSR disclosure and revealed components like effective waste management and

5 Conclusion 
 
The purpose of this research is to determine the relationship between CSR, Carbon Emission Disclosure, Eco-
Efficiency and enterprise value. The aim of this research is a manufacturing business specialising in the industrial 
sector that is listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange. This study demonstrates that the first hypothesis on the 
company's disclosure of CSR has a negative and substantial influence on the company's worth. The second 
hypothesis demonstrates that disclosing carbon emissions has a negative and considerable impact on corporate 
value. Finally, the third hypothesis demonstrates that the company's eco-efficiency has a negative and considerable 
influence on its value. The three independent factors under consideration do not influence the company's worth, 
notably the rise and fall in the company's imminent share price. This suggests that implementing and disclosing 
CSR, disclosing carbon emissions, and promoting eco-efficiency in Indonesian enterprises with a focus on 
industry would not boost enterprise value, especially when deciding share prices. The results of company value 
studies continue to change depending on whatever proxies or indicators are utilised to quantify the variable. This 
study has a lower sample size since the researcher solely used manufacturing in the industrial sector in this 
investigation. It is envisaged that additional study would strive to widen the spectrum of business sectors, both to 
other company sectors listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange and to firms operating outside the Southeast Asia 
area. Furthermore, the criteria utilised by researchers while processing sample data might have an impact on the 
study outcomes. As a result, it is envisaged that future studies would widen the criterion.

Abstract 
In 2013, FAO has made Food Waste and Loss a global issue, strengthened through SDGs 12.3 in 2015. Indonesia 
is a country that contributes to the second-largest food waste in the world according to the Food Sustainability 
Index. Since 2012 Indonesia has raised the issue of Food Waste and Loss as a national issue through PP no. 81 of 
2012, in 2018 again focused on Food Waste and Loss. However, the number of Indonesian FWL still continue to 
increase until 2021. This study aims to find out, Do government rules and programs affect FWL fluctuation 
conditions with regard to the existence of government rules and programs? This research uses mixed methods, 
qualitative research methods by using Value-Belief-Norm Theory as a testing theory to analyze the research. This 
paper will use a quantitative method by using a non-probability sampling method involving respondents who have 
the characteristics of adolescents aged 12-25 years, and adults aged 26-45 years, with the criteria of household, 
service, and retail actors. This study found that, in the Value-Belief-Norm theory, humans have egoistic 
values which can pose a threat to the environment, but biospheric and altruistic attitudes are pro-environmental 
actions.

1. Introduction 
COVID-19 has had a significant impact on lifestyle changes and behavior patterns in human life. Feelings of fear 
and anxiety make society tend to avoid risks more Pappalardo et al., 2020) which in its development creates 
changes in people's consumption patterns and purchasing styles. In lockdown policies in almost all countries in 
the world, directives to stay at home are aimed not only at the general public but also food and beverage businesses 
such as restaurants and bars that provide dine-in encourage people to do food ingredients. Conditions of the 
scarcity of food supply sold by shopping malls (Richards & Rickard, 2020, p.) and public concern about the effects 
of COVID-19 causing behavioral changes in purchasing large quantities of food and types of food purchased (Sim 
et al., 2020). Panic buying of food in supermarkets or food stores occurs when humans feel an increase in food 
insecurities created by the external environment. Therefore, it is important to conduct a study of changes in 
consumption and purchasing habits due to the COVID-19 pandemic which in its development has an impact on 
increasing household waste, especially to food worth eating, (Pappalardo et al., 2020).  
 
In Indonesia, from period 2000-2019 Food Waste and Food Loss or FWL has increased by an average of 44% 
every year (Bappenas, 2021).  Based on a study conducted by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in 2016-
2017, Indonesia occupies the second position after Saudi Arabia as the largest country contributing to food waste 
and loss (Saliem et al., 2021). The largest contribution from FWL comes from grain products, such as rice, corn, 
wheat , and similar products, with a value equivalent to 12-21 million / ton annually (Bappenas, 2021). Other

844","conducted by LCDI-Indonesia, the emission impact produced from food loss of 2,324.24 kg CO2-oak / 1 ton of 
food waste and loss results, or the potential impact of global warming is equivalent to 7.29% during a 20-year 
study. The emissions caused by 1ton of food waste are 4.3 times greater than food loss, with an average percentage 
of food loss of 23% and food waste of 77%, (BAPPENAS, 2021).  
Based on PP. No.81 of 2012, concerning the management of household waste and similar household waste, the 
government has issued regulations that produce results in waste management through the 3R method, (Reduce, 
Reuse, and Recycle). To be able to reduce food loss, it can be done on the provision of science and technology in 
the food production system, so that the products produced are more efficient, but the difference is felt in the stages 
of food waste, where people's behavior has not changed. 
To answer the hypothesis, the role of the government is aimed at being able to contribute to regulating policies 
more firmly. The proposal for the management of food waste is simply wasted and could have an impact on 
contaminated lingkunga, reducing hunger, and the Indonesian economy. Based on the survey conducted by 
surplus, there is still no government regulation that expressly regulates food waste, when conducting a survey on 
business actors, there are still many traders who choose to sell 100% of their food and if there is still a better thing 
to just throw it away. So that the results obtained are still not in line with SDGs point 12, (Pratama, 2020). For 
policymakers, it is necessary to make rules to suppress the behavior of people who carry out food wastage at the 
retailer stage to the level of consumption. It must be realized by stakeholders, that the emphasis on food wastage 
will be much more effective, (Simatupang, 2003).  
It can be stated that regulations have not been very effective in counteracting FWL in a dynamic Indonesia. So 
how the government cannot run alone in counteracting this FWL issue in Indonesia, the need for all levels of 
society in helping to reduce the increase in FWL numbers. 
6. Conclusion 
Food waste and loss have become part of a global issue that must be considered by all levels of society. Starting 
from the values, beliefs, norms, and behaviors possessed by each individual to the eight governments in a country. 
When viewed from the discussion above, the number of food losses has decreased due to changes in technology 
that are increasingly adequate and scientific. However, the issue of food waste has increased due to the behavior 
patterns of the community itself. The issue of food waste and loss has been regulated in the SDGSs in point 12.3 
concerning the reduction of food waste and this is in accordance with the Rpjmn of the Government of Indonesia, 
where food waste can be reduced in 2025, in Indonesia it can be reduced by 30%-70%. With the existence of PP 
No.81 of 2012, it is hoped that the community can apply the 3R (Reuse, Reduce, and Recyle) program so that 
food waste can be reduced and decomposed correctly.

Abstract  
 
The human capital concept has been applied in terms of human resources management in many companies including 
one of Indonesia’s electricity companies in Sulawesi. Regarding employee management, the company set human 
resources as an important asset in producing the best performance for the company. In 2019- 2021, 85% of employees 
who took part in the competency assessment had not been able to demonstrate individual competency as required by 
the company. If this lack of competence continues, it can affect both individual performance and company 
performance. Upon seeing these conditions, this study takes several factors that are considered to affect the 
competence of employees. This study aims to determine how the leadership style, work motivation, and company 
culture affect the competence and performance of employees while emphasizing the dominant factors to increase 
employee competence by using SEM – the PLS method. 142 respondents participated in this study. The results showed 
that transformational leadership style, work motivation, and company culture affect employee competence by 43.4%. 
For further explanation, leadership style has a positive and significant effect on employee competence with a T statistic 
of 2.281, the work motivation variable has a negative and insignificant effect on employee competence with a T 
statistic of 1.270, and company culture has a positive and significant effect on employee competence with a T statistic 
of 3.875.

1. Introduction  
Human resource management with the concept of human capital has now been widely applied to companies in 
Indonesia, including one of the national electricity companies owned by the Indonesian government. In its concept, 
every company wants their employees who can think widely and always try to improve their potential in achieving 
the best performance for themselves and the company. To achieve the best performance, employees with good 
competencies are needed so that they can manage to solve problems that might arise while carrying out the tasks and 
responsibilities that have been assigned to them. Employee performance can be interpreted as a description of the 
activities demonstrated by an employee in his daily life to fulfill his duties and responsibilities to the company he is

Based on Table 1, it can be seen that the loading factor value of each indicator is by the required standard, which is 
the loading factor of 0.7 (Ghozali, 2021), so it can be concluded that all the data analyzed are valid. In addition to the 
Loading Factor, AVE (Average Variance Extracted) is also important to see if it is compatible with the standard 
minimum limit value. Haryono (2016) explains that the threshold for an Average Variance Extracted is 0.5 so as we 
look at the results in Table 1, the AVE value for each variable has exceeded 0.5. 
 
After testing the validity, the next test is reliability testing by looking at Cronbach's Alpha and Composite Reliability 
values. The reliability test is carried out to prove the accuracy, consistency, and accuracy of the instrument in 
measuring constructs (Ghozali, 2021). The threshold for Cronbach's Alpha and Composite Reliability is 0.7 (Ghozali, 
2021) so it can be concluded that the results of the validity test according to Table 1 have been met.

Based on Table 2, it can be seen that the AVE root value of each variable is greater than the correlation value between 
constructs, so it can be concluded that the requirements for discriminant validity testing have been met. 
 
5.2. Inner Model  
After evaluating the measurement model (outer model) through testing convergent validity and discriminant validity, 
the next step is to evaluate the structural model (inner model). Evaluating the structural model consist of the suitability 
of the R Square value, path coefficient, P-Value, and T-Statistic. The results of the R-Square that have been carried 
out can be seen in Table 3 below.

Abstract 
Software as a Service (SaaS)-based academic information system has become a new trend in system procurement in 
universities, particularly in Indonesia. With the various advantages of SaaS-based academic information systems, 
many universities have decided to switch to this service model. Factors influencing college student acceptance toward 
SaaS-based academic information systems were examined using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of 
Technology (UTAUT) model that was modified by adding Trust (TR) and Quality of Service (QS) variables. Data 
were collected from 338 college students and analyzed with Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GSCA). 
This study reveals that the significant predictors of SaaS-based academic information systems are performance 
expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating condition. Further results and discussions are 
discussed.

1. Introduction 
Cloud computing has changed how computing resources are being used and paid. Unlike traditional Information 
Technology (IT) deployment models, cloud computing allows Internet-accessible IT resources by third-party cloud 
service providers, usually on a subscription or pay-per-use basis (Marston et al., 2011). This model allows 
organizations to reduce their capital investment in infrastructure but have flexible access to a large pool of resources 
tailored to their needs. These advantages have led many organizations to reorganize their IT strategies to include cloud 
computing (Oliveira et al. 2014). Universities as organizations must keep abreast of technological developments, 
always looking for more efficient and effective ways to develop IT-based services. The SaaS service model that uses 
a flexible payment scheme is a solution for universities (Sultan 2010). The academic information system is one of the 
higher education information systems that adopt the SaaS service model. This system is the backbone of higher 
education management in more than 60% of universities in Indonesia, where 80% of higher education services ranging

4.3 Discussion 
The model proposed examined whether: 1) Quality of Service, Trust, Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, 
and Social Influence affect Behavioral Intention (H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5) and 2) Facilitating Condition and 
Behavioral Intention affect Use Behavior (H6 and H7). The estimated model found support only for H3, H5, H6, and 
H7. This means that students are more likely to use a SAAS-based academic information system if it is considered 
beneficial or helps their daily work. In addition, the influence of people, such as friends, also affects the intention to 
use this system. Then facilitating the conditions and behavioral intentions are also significant factors for students using 
academic information systems. This finding is in line with the original UTAUT, and previous studies confirming the 
influence of these factors on behavioral intention and use behavior. 
 
Hypothesis testing showed there's no significant correlation between Quality of Service, Trust, and Effort Expectancy 
(H1, H2, H4). These findings contrast with previous research conducted by Alharthi et al. (2015) and Alotaibi (2016), 
which confirms that Quality of Service is a significant antecedent of SaaS Adoption. These findings also contradicted 
previous research by Khayer et al. (2021) which proved that Trust is a significant predictor of cloud computing 
adoption. In addition, this research also fails to validate that effort expectancy (H4) significantly affects Behavioral 
Intention positively. It's different from the original UTAUT model that proves EE significantly affects Behavioral 
Intention. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This research examines the factors influencing college student acceptance toward SaaS-based academic information 
systems with an extended UTAUT model with Trust (TR) and Quality of Service (QS). The hypothesis testing results 
show that only four got strong support among the seven hypotheses proposed. This research has theoretical and 
practical contributions. Theoretically, this research is the first to combine Quality of Service and Trust as extended 
factors in UTAUT model to measure the adoption of a SaaS-based academic information system in higher education. 
Even this factor founded not significantly affect student acceptance. Further research needs to add other factors to 
further determine the factors that affect student acceptance of SaaS-based academic information systems. In practical 
contribution, this research finding can be one of the considerations for management and vendors in implementing the 
system in universities. Such as the facilitating condition factor, which was very influential in increasing the use of the 
system by students.

Abstract 
 
This paper aim to analyze and examine how country of origin and perceived quality affecting the purchase intention 
of H&M products in Indonesia. This research uses a quantitative approach with convenience sampling method. In this 
research, the population are people who live in any city in Indonesia with age range of 17 years old and above as 
H&M product users. Samples taken randomly as many as 192 respondents with non-probability sampling techniques 
using online questionnaires with Likerts scale with one to five scale. Authors use software STATA for validity test, 
reliability test, and regression model. The result from this study shows that country of origin, and perceived quality 
have a positive effect towards purchase intention. Authors suggest that instilling a perception to customers regarding 
the country of origin is the key to compete, therefore maintaining the quality of the product is a must for multinational 
companies.

1. Introduction  
Era of globalization that is happening now has brought significant changes in various aspects of human life, including 
in the social, economic, cultural, technological, and other fields (J. T. Purba, Budiono, & Adirinekso. G.P., 2020). 
This will affect the improvement of the community's economy (Budiono & Purba, 2020). These changes appear to 
meet the increasing human needs, preparing them for the fashion sector. Based on Becraft data, which states that the 
fashion sub-sector is 18.15% making the development of the fashion industry in Indonesia rapidly. The fashion 
industry is widely known by the people of Indonesia. This industry is related to trends in society, increasingly wide-
open markets, new technologies, and shifting consumer needs, all of which present not only opportunities but also 
risks ((Poulsen & Hufbauer, 2011); (J. T. Purba, Budiono, & Adirinekso, 2020)). 
 
The developments that occur in the fashion world in Indonesia are increasing very rapidly, especially the development 
of clothes with well-known brands. Fashion is a term for a person's style of dress. Fashion and women are two things 
that cannot be separated from one another. Every woman wants to appear in a fashionable style, which indirectly 
wants her to look attractive ((Soboleva et al., 2015); (Blomström et al., 2003)). People often stop in front of a shop,

simultaneously influence the Purchase Intention (PI) on LBP Indonesia. 
Based on the results of partial testing of the Country of Origin (COO) is t-test = 9.52 and probability value t = 0.00 
states that we reject null hypotheses and accept alternative hypotheses. Country of Origin (COO) significantly 
influences the Purchase Intention (PI). So, the Perceived Quality (PQ) is t-test = 1.71 and probability value t = 0.089 
states that we reject null hypotheses and accept alternative hypotheses in tolerance 10%. Perceived Quality (PQ) 
significantly influences the Purchase Intention (PI) not more than 10%.  
So, testing together or partially shows the behavioral model in this study has met the statistically requirements. Next, 
we construct the equation of the econometric model in this study as follows. 
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃= 0.1351 + 0.77 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶+ 0.13 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 
From the results equation Country of Origin (COO) affects the Purchase Intention (PI) as the foundation of the 
maintaining Purchase Intention (PI) in Business. Each increase unit in Country of Origin (COO) will increase by 0.77 
level of Purchase Intention (PI). So, each increase unit level in Perceived Quality (PQ) will increase by 0.13 level 
Scale Likert of Purchase Intention (PI).  
 
6. Conclusion 
The marketing strategy for these two variables is the key to H&M's success in the fashion business. Policies that 
support the improvement of country of origin (COO) and perceived quality (PQ) for each other for consumers are 
absolute. 
 
Authors suggest that instilling a perception to customers regarding the country of origin is the key to compete, 
therefore maintaining the quality of the product is a must for multinational companies. Companies must innovate 
products to maintain product quality. Therefore, customers will have the perception that the product has high quality. 
Furthermore, consumers are carried away that the country of origin of the producer also contributes to the company's 
success. Thus, perceived quality and country of origin support each other's purchase intention of products.

Abstract 
Recently, Instagram is not only use for entertainment, but also act as a platform used for medium business, such 
as promotion and buying products. Roughneck 1991 is one of the brand fashions from Indonesia that use Instagram 
to promote their product to market through brand image which is Roughneck show up on their Instagram account. 
In this study, researchers used quantitative methods to analyze data obtained from Roughneck 1991 buyers using 
176 respondents. To test the hypotheses, this research using PLS-SEM as a statistical tool. From the results of the 
analysis, the researchers found that brand image as an intervening variable positively can helps Instagram content 
in influencing purchasing decisions.

1. Introduction 
Internet become an important part of life for every people in the world, also in Indonesia.  Until 2021, there are 
170 million users of social media in Indonesia. One of the popular social media in Indonesia is Instagram, and 
based on Napoleon Cat's data, until fourth quarter of 2021, there are 92.53 million users of Instagram. Compared 
to previous quarter, this amount increased from 3.9 million or up to 4.37% from 88.65 million user. Nowadays, 
Instagram is not only used for socializing, but is widely used by many users as a business medium, such as buying 
and selling businesses. By using Instagram social media, business actors can reach a wider number of consumers. 
There are many features that can be used by users to promote their products, such as reels, initiatory, and feeds. 
Marketers can also utilise feature boost post on this application for reach more target consumers.  
 
Content marketing is a process direct or indirect in promote product or service through content text, video, audio, 
to find a value added of a product both through online and offline (Meiliana, 2018). Through Instagram, users can 
load many interesting content and product information, so consumer realize the brand that built through a brand 
image that created by its producers. Consumers will evaluate the image of a brand after consumers try to 
understand what the brand has and how they feel about the product.  
 
According to Fianto et al. (2014), brand image is the understanding that consumers identify the brand or the 
consumer's total understanding of the brand obtained. This becomes important since it can provide an 
understanding of what the producer has to offer regarding the product and explained through the marketing 
process. For this reason, producer need to know the tastes and attractiveness of consumers so that consumers' 
views of the brand are said to be good. Therefore, the use of content on Instagram as a means of building a brand 
image is a very crucial step, where marketers must think carefully about the strategies that will be used in order 
to attract the attention of consumers. A positive brand image will affect consumer ratings. The better consumer's 
evaluate brand, the stronger the influence of brand image embedded in the minds of consumers on purchasing 
decisions. 
 
Purchase decision is a form of selection and interest to buy the most preferred brand among a number of different 
brands (Kotler and Keller, 2016). Kotler and Armstrong (2012) also mentioned that consumers will go through 
five stages in making purchasing decisions, consist of recognition of needs, information search, evaluation 
alternatives, purchase decisions, post-purchase behavior. Instagram is a social media platform for consumers to 
decide on product purchases. The purchase decision process is also based on the brand image factor created on 
the Instagram page which is the material for consumer evaluation before making a purchase decision in meeting 
their needs. 
 
Fashion is one of the products that has developed quite rapidly in Indonesia. This is indicated by the export 
performance of the textile and apparel industry in 2020 reaching US$ 10.62 billion with a contribution to the GDP

obtained the value of the significance of the study was t-value of 7.709>1.96, the significance level of 0.00<0.05, 
and the value of path coefficients was positive at 0.547 which indicates Instagram content against purchase 
decision through brand image is positive and significant. This demonstrates that the effect of mediation on brand 
image has an effect on purchase decision. Then, researchers evaluate variance scores on dependent variables, 
described by all independent variables, with reference to R2 values. Based on Table 4, the R2 values of Brand 
Image (BI), and Purchase Decision (PD) are 0.678 and 0.727, respectively.

6. Conclusion 
As a conclusion, found that brand image as an intervening variable has an important role between Instagram 
content and purchase decision for Roughneck 1991 product. The owner of Roughneck 1991 used social media, 
especially Instagram as a place for their consumers to search information about the Roughneck 1991 products. 
While, purchase decision itself influenced by Instagram content of this brand. Therefore, it can be concluded, that 
especially for online trading, producers need to make promotion and information about their product continually 
to their consumers. Furthermore, at the end it can be a good strategy to increase the purchase decision. Researchers 
believe that in the future, this study can be conduct in other brand to get the deeper information about the purchase 
decision factors. Also, there are many possibilities in the next research to include other variables.

Abstract 
 
During the pandemic Covid_19, the dynamic competition between restaurants is getting more challenging, and the 
dynamics of life in society. In order to survive, it is necessary to pay attention to food quality, price, perceived value, 
customer satisfaction, return visits, and the provision of EWOM, taking into account the things above to make a 
restaurant thrive. Those variables will be analyzed, and we want to know how far the restaurant performs its 
strategy. This study consumes more than six months, from the end of November 2021 until April 2022. In this study, 
eight hypotheses have tested, of which six were supported and met the criteria, and two were not supported and did 
not meet the criteria. From hundreds of questionnaires distributed, only 303 respondents could process them. The 
variables used in the research impact each other, which will be discussed in detail. From these findings, the authors 
also make recommendations on how to increase the profit of selling organic food restaurants in their outlets. Thus, it 
is hoped that with this research, the owner's thinking will be open about organic food that is healthy and reasonable 
from non-organic food in Indonesia.

Abstract 
 
Nowadays, the increasing use of body care products, the variations of the products and the marketing of the products 
are starting to increase in the most creative and interesting way as possible. But in this era, just being interesting isn’t 
enough, there should be an impact that can be made from using the product of our choice. Love Beauty and Planet 
(LBP) is one of Multinational Corporation (MNC) Unilever subsidiary which produces environmental-friendly & 
cruelty-free products that offer a lot of impact to the earth and the society. Researchers would like to see how some 
variables will impact the customers in Indonesia. This research was conducted to know more about the relationship 
between brand image to the purchase intention of customer and the relationship between trust to the purchase intention 
of customer. The researcher uses quantitative research, in which the data is collected in the form by spreading 
questionnaires. The number of samples is 190 consumers. To proceed data, researchers used software the Stata Release 
15, The authors conducted validity and reliability tests to ensure that the data were valid and reliable. After that the 
Authors conducted regression testing, the results showed that brand image and trust affect purchase intention in Love 
Beauty & Planet.

1. Introduction 
A business or a brand that is willing to try to minimize the impact of damage to the environment is starting to appear 
everywhere, and those brands that have already existed, are starting to transition their products and services to be more 
environment friendly (Buttenberg, 2017); (Lyapina et al., 2017); (Adirinekso. G.P. et al., 2020); (Rajagukguk et al., 
n.d.). Especially with the rising pressure for businesses to be more aware of the environmental issues it is impossible 
to be ignored. Businesses, brands and companies need to come up and develop their business models that can be 
implemented with a more environment and green trends that are becoming more popular nowadays ((Powers et al., 
2017); (Adirinekso et al., n.d.); (Surjana et al., n.d.)). Doing a more environmentally friendly strategy or green 
marketing concept is none other than because of the increase of the awareness of the target market to be more oriented 
towards the environment.  
 
Love Beauty and Planet is used as the brand that will be analyzed. Love Beauty and Planet (LBP) is an international 
body care products company, operating and selling in more than 15 countries globally. LBP is the subsidiary of

890","the research model that the results of the value of F-test = 117.43 and probability F = 0.00 smaller than the significance 
level of 5%, we reject the null hypothesis. The independent variable brand Trust (TRUST) and brand image (BI) 
simultaneously influence the Purchase Intention (PI) on LBP Indonesia. 
Based on the results of partial testing of the brand Trust (TRUST) is t-test = 4.64 and probability value t = 0.00 states 
that we reject null hypotheses and accept alternative hypotheses. brand Trust (TRUST) significantly influences the 
Purchase Intention (PI). Last, the brand image (BI) is t-test = 4.76 and probability value t = 0.000 states that we reject 
null hypotheses and accept alternative hypotheses. Brand image (BI) significantly influences the Purchase Intention 
(PI).  
 
So, testing together or partially shows the behavioral model in this study has met the statistically requirements. Next, 
we construct the equation of the econometric model in this study as follows. 
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃= −0.153 + 0.48 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇+ 0.50 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 
From the results equation brand Trust (TRUST) affects the Purchase Intention (PI) as the foundation of the maintaining 
Purchase Intention (PI) in Business. Each increase unit in brand Trust (TRUST) will increase by 0.48 level of Purchase 
Intention (PI). So, each increase one unit level in brand image (BI) will increase by 0.50 level Scale Likert of Purchase 
Intention (PI).  
6. Conclusion 
This study results that all independent variables Brand Trust and Brand Image significantly affect purchase intention 
of the product. The marketing strategy for these two variables is the key to Love Beauty and Planet’s success. Policies 
that support the improvement of brand trust and brand image for purchase intention are absolute. The magnitude of 
the impact between brand trust is not much different from that of brand image in influencing purchase intention of the 
product. Company needs a long time to convince customers to trust the product through service, product quality is 
maintained. Likewise, as long as the company does not disappoint and always provides customer satisfaction, the 
brand image will always improve continuously. So, brand trust and brand image will support each other to maintain 
purchase intention for the product.

1. Introduction 
Technology has become an integral part of our culture and is pervasive in our daily lives. Various technologies 
continue to shape how the way people and organizations work and think. Reporting from the McKinsey Global 
Institute 2022, digital technology adoption is developing quite rapidly in Asia compared to other parts of the 
world. The Asian region has accounted for about 52% of the global growth in technology company revenue and 
also influences technology-related economic developments. Aside from that, the Asia-Pacific region has taken the 
advantage of implementing various technologies from the industrial revolution 4.0, such as robotic automation, 
artificial intelligence, and blockchain (Ernst & Young, 2019).  
 
Robotic process automation defined as one of the industrial revolution 4.0 technologies software that records 
computer movements and repeat the process for recurring transactions, manipulating data, and be able to 
synchronize with other software systems Furthermore, RPA is recognized as a technology capable of overcoming 
cost reduction in corporate operations, which has benefits in accounting tasks such as: creating real-time 
accessibility to financial data, allowing reporting and analysis to be done at one time and constantly (Kaya et al, 
2019). According to Deloitte's survey, 63% of organizations examined failed to fulfil their RPA delivery deadlines

6. Conclusion 
This paper analyses the effect between three independent variables (Audit Process, Workflow, and Competencies) 
to dependent variable (Robotic Process Automation) moderated by emerging technologies in 10 largest non-
government Indonesian banking companies. The result of the paper shows that Audit Process (X1) and Workflow 
(X2) has significant effect on the implementation of Robotic Process Automation (Y). Meanwhile, Competencies 
(X3) does not have significant effect on the implementation of Robotic Process Automation (Y). However, three 
of the independent variables (X1, X2, X3) does not have significant effect on the implementation of robotic 
process automation if moderated by emerging technologies (Z).  
 
By concluding this paper, the writers hope that this paper could help banking companies in considering the factors 
that could help a company to implement the robotic process automation and for the future research related to the 
factors that affecting the implementation of robotic process automation in a company.

Abstract 
 
New Share Acquisition in the form of equity investment is a corporate action that enables a company to grow 
inorganically due to new capital used for expansion and the investor/acquirer market position & technology. Besides, 
consolidating two entities generally will create more value from the investor perspective than two separate entities 
due to the synergy effect. This research will develop a hypothetical case study of a new share acquisition done by a 
Telco company in Indonesia. The model and concept can be applied in real acquisition situations. Monte Carlo 
simulation will be used to analyze the acquisition cash flow and determine the effect of synergies based on the revenue 
increase, market positioning, and cost-saving in the financial acquisition model. Those synergies effect will treated as 
the variable of the Monte Carlo Simulation. The study aims to minimize the risk of failed M&A by determining if the 
result of the consolidated acquisition model projection will achieve the pre-determined acquisition success factor 
metric such as Investment Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and the acquirer’s potential market capitalization/Net Present 
Value (NPV) after acquisition. This simulation produces the probability of achieving those targets and helps the 
investor manage the risk of unsuccessful acquisitions.

1. Introduction 
A company's financial growth is essential for any business, organically or inorganically. Organic business growth 
happens by reinvesting profit along the way, and it considers a more conventional way to expand a business. Some 
large corporations with overflowing capital choose to grow inorganically through mergers and acquisitions (""M&A""). 
It enables a company to grow exponentially. It is caused by a new business line or capital expenditures that can be 
executed immediately after fundraising, typically from investors. Relatively instant funding from investors will boost 
the IRR of a project because of the time value of money factor.  
 
According to Oduru & Agyei (2013), M&A aims to increase the efficiency and profitability of a company due to 
synergy so that the financial growth can be exponential. Investors in M&A can transfer knowledge, technology, and 
network to grow the target company's business. Conversely, the target company gives the investor their business 
starting point/initial market. Vazirani (2012) also stated that the consolidation process between investors and the target 
company would form a more valuable company combined. The synergy between the acquirer and the investor enables 
the company consolidation to enhance revenue and save production costs by using each other's resources.

912","6. Conclusion  
The experiment shows that the acquisitions do not significantly impact the acquirer's potential intrinsic value based 
on the improvement in their cash flow. It is because the size of the acquisitions and the synergy value is insignificant 
compared to the entire market capitalization of the acquirers. However, the return on the invested capital itself is quite 
significant. Besides, this study offers a unique way to analyze a post- acquisitions financial performance effect. It 
shows that the risk/uncertainty of the pre-determined NPV/Market Capitalization success metrics is not being achieved 
so that the risk can be minimized. The reason of it because of the very small acquisitions size itself compared to the 
acquirer’s company valuation.

Abstract  
 
This systematic review aims to examine how the public sector may leverage artificial intelligence (AI) use through 
the exploration of AI adoption frameworks and how such frameworks can steer best practices of AI implementation 
and governance in the sector. Through inclusion and exclusion criteria, 30 articles were retrieved from academic 
databases, specifically Science Direct, Springer Link, and Wiley Online Library.  
 
The AI adoption frameworks are categorized into four groups: Regulatory frameworks, normative frameworks, 
applicative frameworks, and evaluative frameworks. Regulatory frameworks can provide standardizing and 
prescriptive guidelines to public sector organizations adopting AI technologies. Normative frameworks can strengthen 
the ethical and human rights aspects of AI adoption instead of devaluing human skills and eroding human agency. 
Applicative frameworks can help public sector organizations achieve positive and responsible outcomes for AI 
adoption. Alternatively, evaluative frameworks can spell improvements in the quality of public service delivery after 
identifying areas for improvement in an evaluation of AI systems.

1. Introduction  
The increasing interest in Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have corresponding societal implications, which can 
influence the direction of policymaking and decision-making. AI is a broad topic that has been referred to by a lot of 
terms, such as ‘machine learning’, ‘machine intelligence’, ‘algorithms’, and ‘intelligent systems’, amongst others. AI 
is described as a machine with the ability to think, reason out, and make human-like decisions (AlSheibani et al. 2018). 
Fueled by the power of data, AI technologies are expected to deliver positive outcomes in enabling government 
functions, thereby transforming the development of public policy and the delivery of public services. Nevertheless, 
AI is confronted by significant adoption barriers as well as negative deployment impacts (Hernandez 2020).  
 
Why a standard AI adoption framework should be in place in the public sector is because it can enhance safety and 
fairness in the adoption of AI systems. Additionally, it can influence similar frameworks at the local level towards 
leveraging AI use. Through an AI adoption framework, the public sector can embed the national values and earn 
public trust while putting humans at the core of technological advancement. Congruently, institutional theory provides 
insights into management commitment and trust, which should be considered in AI adoption (Li et al. 2021). While 
the private sector aims to maximize value over minimizing risk with regard to AI adoption, the public sector aims to 
minimize risk and maximize value. In order to do this, the public sector needs AI adoption frameworks in order to 
implement AI efficiently. It should have the needed IT applications and related technical resources to pursue an AI 
development effort. If not, it should promote existing or new partnerships to access the needed technical resources. In 
aligning themselves with their partners, public sector organizations assess risk against value, which can be either high 
or low (Dezousa et al. 2020).  
 
The motivation of this research is anchored on the necessity of the public sector to conduct its public service delivery 
more effectively and efficiently, in which AI use can play an important role. While there is justified scepticism that

Abstract 
 
This paper is the result of a final degree project, consisting in the design of a propulsion system for a transportation 
boat based on electric motors powered partially by solar energy comparing its costs with a conventional propulsion 
system by combustion engines. The boat is meant to be used to transport up to 30 passengers and 1 ton of goods on 
the Paraguay River in the northern part of the Paraguayan Chaco region. First was designed the most suitable hull, for 
which simulations were executed with computerized software with the main aim to optimize the hydrodynamic 
resistance of the vessel obtaining as outcome a 10 m long and 4.7m wide catamaran. Then was carried out the complete 
sizing of the electric propulsion system, including the photovoltaic array integrated into the roof of the boat, charge 
controllers, battery banks, electric motors, recharging stations and BOS. The dimensioning was made considering a 
route between various places located on an almost 250 km long section of the Paraguay River. The economic study 
showed that applying the Present Value of Costs for the solar propulsion system is 3 times lower than the one for the 
conventional system for a 10 years’ period.

1. Introduction 
Today, humanity still depends on more than 80% of non-renewable energies, such as petrol, natural gas, coal and 
uranium. Their reserves are limited and will inevitably run out in a not-too-distant future. Fuels also generate 
significant environmental pollution during their exploitation and use and when burned emit greenhouse gases that can 
alter the climate. It is for these reasons that the world is in search of alternative energy sources such as solar energy, 
wind energy, geothermal energy, biomass, among others, being friendly to the environment. The increasing spreading 
of these alternative energy technologies during the last 20 years has generated an incredible reduction of their 
investment costs and made many of them competitive to conventional energy technologies. 
 
The department of Alto Paraguay is one of the most isolated, less populated and poorest departments of Paraguay 
located in the northeastern part of the country along the upper part of the Paraguay river, which is until today an 
important transport way for the local population living alongside the river. Most roads are unpaved, what makes it 
difficult to circulate during rainy periods and therefore many communities are accessible only by water. Hence, since 
the beginning of its colonization by the Spanish and until today boats have been the most used transport medium in 
this part of the country. In our days they mainly use internal combustion engines (ICE) generating high operation 
costs, which lately are growing strongly due to increasing fuel prices on an international level.  
   
So, the aim of this study, which is the result of a final degree project of Cuevas, D. and Orué, R. tutored by Pulfer, 
JC., was to demonstrate that solar energy can also be used as a sustainable energy source for water vehicles, moving 
from the internal combustion propulsion to an electrical system. The proposed boat would work using partially the 
energy coming from on-board photovoltaic solar panels and batteries. The remaining energy would be coming from

immersed in the water. This dependence is shown in Figure 5 with the depth varying between 0.55 m and 0.85 m. The 
depth of 0.7 m is considered as the project value for the nominal payload.

6. Conclusion 
Using Delft Ship software, a hull for the catamaran boat with a low water resistance was designed. Then, using Michlet 
software was determined the optimum distance between both hulls and calculated the hydrostatic parameters of the 
boat. The main part of the study consisted in the design of electric propulsion system composed of the photovoltaic 
and energy storage systems and the electric motors. As on average the solar array covers less than a half of the energy 
consumption of the boat traveling in a weekly cycle between two towns distant of almost 250 km on the Paraguay 
river, the remaining electricity has to be provided from the grid through charging stations located in the deserved ports. 
The economic assessment was made using the method of Present Value of Costs (PVC) of the propulsion system for 
the solar boat comparing it with the same boat design using 2 ICEs. Despite of an investment more than 10 times 
higher for the solar system, it came out that its PVC for 10 years´ period is 3 times lower.

Abstract 
 
Knowing how to interpret the signals in markets as critical as the synthetic indices and keeping the ap-
propriate stop operations are, without denying it, two important variables when operating in trading. In 
this research, two manual trading sell techniques are proposed, one based on the first sell after the 
BOOM 500 trigger and the other based on moving average crossovers. The results showed an efficiency 
close to 70% for the first proposal, and the second regularly obtains an efficiency close to 100%.

Introduction 
Almost every area of human life has changed dramatically over time, and the pace of change is now much 
quicker. This also applies to financial techniques. Until the end of the twentieth century, actively managed funds 
had been at the heart of investment policy all over the world. The development of passive investing techniques 
has considerably reduced the expense of active fund managers and the risk associated with policies. market cir-
cumstances are more favorable than for conventional ones. Index funds are one of the biggest innovations the 
financial community has ever seen. Moreover, as it is, it is undeniable that it is beneficial to everyone who 
saves. Much cheaper than an actively managed fund. But a handful of companies Those who have passively 
managed funds should also be afraid. They are It may also affect future elections (Tahmaz & Medin, 
2019).Trading platforms are influencing price discovery and volatility in the forex market. Humans trade every 
minute and empirical analysis provides some important insights beginning. There is evidence that algorithmic 
trading tends to correlate, and algorithmic strategies.  The ones used on the market are not as diverse as those 
used by non-algorithm traders. Second, it despite the clear correlation of algorithmic trading, there is no clear 
causal relationship between them increased volatility in algorithmic trading and exchange rates. If anything, a 
more algorithmic existence of the transactions is associated with lower volatility. Third, some algorithm traders 
Algorithm traders seem to be shrinking activity minutes after the release of macroeconomic data increase the 
liquidity supply over the first hour after each release (Chaboud, Chiquoine, Hjalmarsson, & Vega, 2014).  This 
paper introduces a technique that may be appropriate for working with the Boom 500 synthetic index based on 
experience and mobile media. The final objective consists of working with accounts of less than 100 dollars, and 
in the measure of the cases, trying to obtain 8 dollars a day, with absolute restriction to the generation of any 
greater amount. It is also attempted to propose a ROC curve that essentially process in the methodology. To 
clarify the research proposal, the necessary description is described in this regard. Market depends on the struc-
ture and psychology, scalping the Boom and Crash market is the norm. As a result, many traders concentrate on

spikes (which are so evident and influential in smaller time frames) and focus on the market's overall broad Fig.

Conclusions 
To trade Boom 500 with amounts less than 100 dollars, it is not recommended to enter trades when it is above 
the averages (Fig. 3). This is since at that time many high candles are expected, and even though the lot is at 0.2 
and the multiplier at 1, there will not be enough capital to support the number of candles to be produced during 
its appearance. of a train When two candles appear simultaneously, it is necessary to immediately stop the oper-
ations. All this is even though it seems that the Boom 500 is at the bottom due to the large number of falling 
candles that you have, but it is necessary to observe the big shot of the Boom 500 after them. In those condi-
tions, it is not recommended to operate. The optimal operating conditions are those in which the candles are in 
decline, and especially when the Boom 500 is under the curves, it is there where it is effectively recommended 
to operate constantly (Fig. 4). Perhaps it is also possible to propose not to operate with recovery with more than 
five downward candles, to avoid surprises during operations. Likewise, it is recommended for small capitals-
profit not to have more than 2 open sales operations at the same time. It can be said that if perhaps more sales 
operations are required, it is necessary to have at least 1 purchase to prevent the possible appearance of the 
Boom 500. Figure 5 shows the signals it produces for the Boom 500. The ROC curve efficiency shows the fol-

Abstract 
  
We used regression model to analyze daily COVID-19 world fatalities and daily Bitcoin closes and prices. We 
discovered that COVID-19 levels drove a rise in Bitcoin values, notably to residual values. We contribute to the 
rapidly developing body of research on COVID-19's financial implications, as well as the current debate over 
whether Bitcoin is a safe haven investment. Scholars and policymakers, as well as investment professionals inter-
ested in the financial implications of COVID-19 and cryptocurrencies, should be interested in our findings.

Introduction 
COVID-19, also known as the new coronavirus, is not only a public health issue on a global scale, but it also has 
huge implications for energy, the economy, and the environment. Although all of the world's attention is justifiably 
focused on COVID-19's human toll, the outbreak's economic toll, which has impacted all of the world's major 
economies, has the potential to be devastating. As a result, the energy market has collapsed, resulting in an oil 
supply surplus and a price drop. 
 
When a proven case of COVID-19 (COrona VIrus Disease 19) arrives close to me, the world is working on an 
app that will notify me on my phone. However, regardless of whatever feature is implemented initially, the 
COVID-19 tracking system should address the challenges of location tracking legalization and scalability as a 
global platform. Additional issues that require answers include real-time authentication for data collection, blind 
naming and privacy of tracked individuals, and the Query/Reply procedure's quality of service.  
 
A large portion of pension savings is invested in the stock market and is thus subject to market volatility. Like 
past pandemic crises, the COVID-19 pandemic crisis harmed the gains made in those funds. The system will 
import historical stock data from the financial web and generate charts for stock price trend research. It will exe-

The US equities market in the first half of 2020 during the COVID-19 era. Prices soar to new highs, then fall to 
new lows, and then rise again to new highs. Fear and greed alternated throughout the era, resulting in significant 
volatility and a lot of short-term momentum. The VIX index served as a market indicator.  
Altought, the COVID-19 pandemic's outbreak is a once-in-a-generation global blow to India's economy. The In-
dian government has put in place specific preventative actions, starting with diet, to regulate the problem extra-

The fluctuating data in Table 1, assume that the variability of bitcoin does not adapt to some predictive model or 
perhaps to the regression model proposed in this work, it is necessary to verify the behavior with later dates.

Figure 5 shows the behavior of the BTC - USD for the last 300 days. In fact, changes in its value range from $ 
40,000 to $ 67,000. Can a prediction mechanism be established that allows somehow to determine what an average 
value is?

havior of BTC-USD ranges from 2012 to March 20213.

Abstract 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic caused immediate overburden to healthcare systems and initiated a race in search for means 
to prevent and treat the disease. Among the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 are the lack of equipment and 
technologies to attend all patients, especially in resource-constrained contexts of emerging and developing countries. 
Fast and frugal innovations were developed, especially for attending regions where the healthcare system was in 
critical condition. This paper analyses the case of the ventilator called INSPIRE, designed to tackle COVID-19 in 
Brazil. It was built utilizing the frugal innovations perspective and the narrative of one of the participant institutions 
(Federal Institute of Sao Paulo – IFSP). The following dimensions of frugal innovations: affordability, adaptability, 
accessibility, value proposition and sustainability. To conclude, a comparison is made with other initiatives across the 
country which revealed that although the development teams had not previous knowledge about frugal innovation, the 
projects helped creating a collaborative network of different institutions aiming to reach the same goal. Now that these 
networks are in place and advancing to develop other innovative products, there is a need to establish a framework for 
developing frugal innovations.

978","5.2 – Frugal innovation – other initiatives 
All ventilators’ initiatives started with the emergency caused by the pandemic, and they all suffered from the lack of 
important components such as valves, sensors and actuators of pressure and flow.  
In common, they used a network of volunteers, open-source hardware and software tools and produced results in a 
very short period of time. 
 
The adaptations vary from windshield wiper motor to power the AMBU to mixer valves used in bathroom sink faucet 
and showers. However, those simplest versions of ventilator were not able to receive ANVISA registration. 
 
5.2.1 – Affordability 
The ventilators with ANVISA registration listed in section 4 were all commercial, so the authors did not have access 
to the sales prices.   
 
5.2.2 – Adaptability 
Hortron developed their own FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) sensor and proportional valves to deal with the 
component’s shortage.  
 
5.2.3 – Accessibility 
According to the news report, Oxymed ran a single batch of 7,000 units in 2020; SENAI a total of 500 units (at the 
time when the news was released); Hortron increased sales in 30% and about Frank 5010 we found no information.  
Based on Hortron’s interview, the ventilator demand by the end of 2020 was low.  
 
5.2.4 – Value proposition 
Economic: the surplus of ventilators from those initiatives will certainly cause ventilators prices to drop. 
Social: the volunteer network was the most common practice for the ventilators development and shown in most of 
the news report. 
Environmental: unfortunately, we gather no information regarding the environmental aspect of their business. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Frugal innovation during the pandemic happened without planning and without methodology. The interviewees had 
not previous knowledge about the theme. The COVID-19 emergency helped creating a collaborative network of 
different institutions aiming to reach the same goal. Although these developments were, in concept, frugal innovations, 
now that these networks are in place and advancing new forms of collaboration and developing more innovative 
products, there is a need to establish a framework for developing frugal innovations under societal pressure. This will 
foster the development of adaptable, affordable, accessible solutions using less resources, building a more inclusive, 
secure, and sustainable future.

Abstract 
 
Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) is an all-intelligent radio network that supplants the traditional radio network. The 
major discrepancy that exists between the traditional radio network and cognitive radio network (CRN) is premised 
on the fact that; in CRN, all the white spaces (unutilized spectrum) are utilized maximally to the best of the available 
information at its disposal. The main advantage of the cognitive radio network is that it has the ability to sense and 
detect available channels from the spectrum frequency and alter the values used for transmission of data. This allows 
several unused spectrum frequencies to be fully utilized. Research on cognitive radio network (CRN) is still in its 
elementary stage. Therefore, there is a need for a thorough surveys and descriptions of the cognitive radio sensing 
mechanisms. The working behavior of the cognitive radio also needs to be revamped. This research work details the 
sensing and problems with interference in cognitive radio network. It also explains how and why the cognitive radio 
system is preferred to the conventional radio systems. There exist numerous technologies that are employed in the 
cognitive radio systems. Among these includes the Adaptive Radio and Software Defined Radio (SDR). The findings 
from this research have potential applications in areas such as cognitive-radio-systems design and implementations.

Abstract 
 
Human resources in a company are the most important assets of the company. Because it is so important, many 
companies need the training to improve the quality of human resources in these companies. PT. Delta Sinergi Prima 
(PT. DSP) is a company engaged in Management Consulting and Training. PT DSP still uses conventional services 
to conduct training. Therefore, it is necessary to use the LMS (Learning Management System) method. Due to the 
Covid-19 pandemic, many companies have suddenly stopped their business or have had to run slowly and inefficiently. 
Due to social distancing and the prohibition of large gatherings, many companies are switching and running their 
business online in the digital reforming business. The methodology used in this research begins with a literature study 
to see how the training process at PT DSP is carried out, followed by an interview as an analysis of system 
requirements by collecting information and a preliminary investigation as a formulation of the problem. Furthermore,

User validation used as an evaluation of the online delta training system that involved 40 respondents consisting of 
DSP and general employees. Researchers involve the general public as respondents because they also use this 
application either as a speaker or as a participant.  As for the user validation results of this online training system, 
show below: (Table 2)

Based on the results of the evaluation, the Online Training Application got an overall score of 1732 with an overall 
average of 43.30 and an overall percentage of 86% so that the online training application in all aspects of variables 
can be said to be very feasible for an online training application at PT. DSP 
 
6. Conclusion  
The results of the implementation of the online training system that have been carried out, show that the application 
built has met the main requirements, namely functional ease of use, usefulness, and an attractive and easy-to-
understand interface. The acceptance of the system is taken from three aspects of assessment, namely design 
(appearance), convenience and efficiency. The test results use Black box testing, where the overall system features 
are in accordance with the expected results. This is because no errors were found in the system test results. Meanwhile, 
at the user validation stage, the user strongly agrees that the system developed is easy to use when trying and according 
to user needs and the application can run smoothly. This online training application is still asynchronous, so this 
application can only run in one direction, where the training participants cannot express their opinion if they want to 
ask something, they need to contact the speaker number. Recommendations that can be made in the future are that the 
implementation of this website is carried out by adding several complementary features such as being synchronous, 
so that it can be discuss problem directly with the presenters.

Abstract 
 
During the last decade, Lean Six Sigma (LSS) in healthcare organizations has increased; however, most cases are 
registered in developing countries. We aim to show a detailed implementation of Lean Six Sigma in the Emergency 
Department of an Ecuadorian Children's Hospital to evaluate the applicability of LSS in a South American country 
and identify barriers, success factors, and tools applied. Following the Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control 
(DMAIC) methodology, the waiting time in front of the register and treatment section decreased by 79.5% and 
53.2%. The total service time was reduced by 55.6%, and the total waiting time decreased by 57%. An external team 
of experts led the implementation, which resulted in one of the critical success factors. Together with the leadership 
of the Hospital Director, it helped to reduce the most common barriers found in developing countries, such as lack of 
training, resistance among the staff, and lack of available data.

1. Introduction  
Applying Lean or Six Sigma methodologies is traditionally associated with manufacturing environments. Since the 
beginning of Six Sigma in Motorola in 1987, the methodology has been used in organizations of manufacturing 
industries like General Electric, 3M, DuPont, and Ford. Similarly, Lean originated in an automotive company, a 
relevant manufacturing sector. The term Lean initially used by Krafcik (1988) in an academic publication, is based 
on the Toyota Production System (TPS) developed in the mid-fifties in Japan (Monden, 2011). 
 
During the first years of the new millennium, some companies merged Lean and Six Sigma into a unique 
methodology. Lean Six Sigma (LSS) combines the strengths and compensates for each methodology's weakness 
when applied independently. For instance, LSS benefits from the Lean methodology's focus on improving the flow 
and reducing lead time by removing all types of waste from the process (Assarlind et al., 2013). Another advantage 
of combining both methods is taking the Six Sigma well-established approach composed of powerful statistical tools 
to reduce variation (Costa et al., 2018) (Henrique and Godinho Filho, 2020).  
 
Despite the origin of both methodologies in manufacturing, most of the articles of LSS are from non-manufacturing 
applications. According to Singh and Rathi (2021), in a literature review of LSS in service applications developed 
between 2005 and 2021, 60% of publications aim at service organizations within the financial, education, or 
healthcare sectors (Lu et al., 2017) (Pazeti and Calache,2017) (Vashishth et al., 2019) (Cudney et al., 2020) 
(Madhani, 2021). In the case of the healthcare sector, the LSS articles were scarce until 2004, when several 
publications showed the effectiveness of LSS in improving operational efficiency, minimizing defects, reducing 
cycle times, and increasing patient satisfaction (Mason et al.,2015) (Honda et al., 2018) (Godley and Jenkins, 2019) 
(Henrique and Godinho Filho, 2020)  (Trakulsunti et al., 2020). 
 
Like the Lean and Six Sigma methodologies applications, most of the initially published case studies of LSS in 
healthcare appear in developed countries. According to Rathi et al. (2021), since 2014, the aim of the articles 
presenting LSS healthcare applications has shifted to developing countries. These publications are focused on India,

Abstract 
 
To increase the output of a production line, it is necessary to identify the main causes of stoppages and establish 
measures to avoid them. This research describes the development of a Lean Six Sigma (LSS) project in a Chilean 
company that produces berry-based products. The aim is to increase output on dried fruit (DF) production line. A 
methodology based on the DMAIC cycle, and the application of principles and methodologies Lean was used. The 
output increase problem was divided into two sub-problems: unexpected stops and waste, based on the overall 
equipment efficiency (OEE) concept. The solutions focused on the cutting and selection, which are intended to 
maintain a stable flow of fruit throughout the process and avoid defects within the production line. The production 
solutions included mandatory temperature controls of the fruit to be processed, changes in the interior design of 
machines, application of visual management for cleaning, and action protocols. According to the results of the case 
study, a 42% decrease in the time lost due to breakdowns and a 50% reduction in the waste generated were obtained. 
In general, an increase in the output of the DF product of 9.3% is estimated.

1. Introduction 
The food industry today is characterized by production through automated online systems, where several machines or 
equipment are connected sequentially through transport systems to achieve simultaneous work, and therefore 
continuous flow production (Tsarouhas 2020). However, any stoppage or failure in any part of the line generally has 
effects on the entire line, which can cause high costs, loss of quality, reduction in production volume, and a direct 
impact on productivity. This is the case of the production of dried fruit (DF), object of study of this work, whose 
process includes operations of cutting, thawing, extraction, infusion, drying, oiling, and packaging, developed in 
automated production lines, with reduced human participation. 
 
One way that the effectiveness of equipment on the DF production line could be measured is through the concept of 
overall equipment efficiency (OEE). According to this, the equipment is only effective if it is available when it is 
required, running at the ideal speed, and producing a result within the specifications (Kenneth 2018). The OEE model 
operationalizes efficiency through the analysis of six major losses, which are grouped into three categories: 
availability, performance, and quality. Although the OEE concept was born from total productive maintenance (TPM), 
it has currently been adopted as one of the lean practices (Dave and Sohani 2019, Jebaraj et al. 2015). One of the goals 
of the lean manufacturing environment is the elimination of all types of waste such as: space, time, energy, movements, 
materials, inventories, and defects. In this way, the measurement and monitoring of OEE becomes a strategy that 
contributes for that purpose, by evidencing some of the waste. 
 
The detection or measurement of losses is not enough since it is only the recognition of opportunities for improvement. 
A research and analysis work must be developed to identify the root causes that originate one or another type of arrests 
or failures in the process. The Six Sigma methodology provides a very good option to carry out this research and 
analysis work that allows knowing the past behavior of the problem, trying to explain it from its critical variables and 
identifying key elements for improvement. The Six Sigma process emphasizes the use of statistical tools for the 
improvement or redesign of the process that impacts the result of the organization, based on a systematic approach to 
problem solving (Krishnamoorthi et al. 2019).

1022","has not yet been implemented; however, special emphasis was given to the operators in charge so that they comply 
with the cleaning in their determined time. As for temperature control, this has not been implemented as such; 
however, the analysis carried out has led to new improvement projects, specifically the control of the cold chambers 
to standardize the temperature of the bins loaded onto the line. 
 
To verify that the proposals have made it possible to meet the goal established in the define phase, that is, to increase 
throughput by 10%, it is enough to compare data before and after the implementation of the improvement proposals 
for unforeseen stops and waste generated. Before the improvements were implemented, there were stoppages for 
filling extraction and infusion equipment of 1.66 hours a day on average. After implementing the improvements, 
considering the data for the months of July and September of the year 2021, an average per day of 0.42 hours was 
obtained. This represents a decrease of 75%. Before the improvements were implemented, there was an average of 
2,270 pounds per day of press waste. After implementing the improvements, a decrease of 81% was obtained, 
achieving an average value of 434 pounds per day. These values show that the gradual implementation of the proposals 
presented have helped to reduce breakdowns and waste in the extraction and infusion equipment. 
 
However, the goals of the project are based on the reduction of breakdowns and waste in general, that is, considering 
all types of waste and all types of breakdowns that occur in the process line. These improvements obtained represent 
a 42% reduction in total breakdowns and a 50% reduction in total waste. When comparing these values with those 
presented in the define phase, it is found that the percentage of reduction in time lost due to breakdowns does not meet 
the goal in accordance with what was previously established (it was expected to decrease by 50%). Meanwhile, the 
generated waste decreases more than expected (it was expected to decrease by 35%). Considering these values and 
the main objective of this project (increasing the output by 10%), it is possible to increase the output by 9.3%. 
 
4.5 Control Phase 
After generating and obtaining improvement proposals, it is necessary to design action protocols for the use of these 
alternatives. In this way, possible failures in the implementation can be prevented and, in addition, it allows the 
changes made to be under control. The response and control plan (Table 6) provides clear information on who is 
responsible for complying with the required specifications of each option. It is a summary of how each improvement 
proposal should work and what should be done if the plan is not being carried out correctly.

5. Conclusion 
The improvement proposals presented achieve a significant increase in the production of DF in the berry company

The use of the DMAIC methodology was a success in terms of achieving in a short time some of the most important 
root causes of the problem presented, as well as understanding the problem and searching for customized production 
solutions. The adaptation of the Six Sigma methodology to a problem more related to production or time, than to 
product quality itself, was a useful practice for the company. Likewise, the incorporation of the OEE concept made it 
possible to focus from the beginning on critical variables from the point of view of loss of time in production, which 
constitutes a fundamental factor in the search for an increase in production.

Abstract 
 
Ecosystem services sustain life and biodiversity, in addition to making resources available to humans, and it is 
common for ecosystems to develop into structures created by man over time. This is the case of oil platforms, 
especially fixed ones, which according to Brazilian legislation, must be decommissioned at the end of the viability 
of oil production, but which may not be thinking about the loss of biodiversity. This work proposes a solution that 
maintains ecosystem services and still has financial potential to generate clean and renewable energy from the 
winds. For this, a proposal is built based on climatological, geographic, and wind power generation market data that 
seeks to demonstrate the financial viability of the specific case of the Robalo 1 Platform, which is located about 50 
kilometers from other platforms to be decommissioned, in the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, Brazil. It was found that when 
minimally valuing ecosystem services such as artificial reefs and integrating wind generation for the non-
decommissioning of the fixed platform substructure, from the point of view of net present value, the project proves 
to be viable.

1. Introduction 
According to the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment - MMA (2020), ecosystem services are about the benefits 
that nature brings to people, being vital for human well-being and economic activities. Thus, they can be classified 
into ecosystem services of provision, regulation, cultural and support.  
Decommissioning is the final phase of the life cycle of an offshore oil and gas exploration structure, when it is no 
longer viable to continue exploring, so all wells are plugged and abandoned (Kaiser and Liu, 2014). 
 
For Sommer et al. (2019), the knowledge regarding the environmental impacts with the strategies used in the 
decommissioning of platforms is still incomplete, since the simple removal of structures that have already been

It is noticed that the months in which there is a greater possibility of generating energy are October and November, 
with an average of 1895 MWh and 1982 MWh, respectively, while the months with the lowest potential are the 
months of April and May with a monthly average of 577 and 587 MWh, respectively. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The meteorological data used indicate that the offshore wind generation, 118 m from the surface, has adequate speed 
for the operation of wind turbines, so even for a c wind turbine, in terms of energy generation, the use of wind 
turbines as an alternative to decommissioning of platforms proves to be viable, as it allows reducing dependence on 
other energy sources, especially if we think of a distribution structure for the municipalities of Pacatuba and 
Pirambu, which are very close to the lease and could benefit directly from the public energy network. 
 
It should be remembered that the premises tested here assess the generation of a single isolated platform, and the 
financial additional for ecosystem services was restricted only to the artificial reef in the dimensions of the Platform, 
without considering the adjacent areas that integrate the coastal ecosystem services and that, if the extraction of the 
Platform occurs, its biological relationships may have a negative impact. Even so, without considering image gains, 
the permanence of the structure proved to be economically viable, since from an economic point of view, it is 
necessary to consider more than the positive NPV, but also the social and environmental impacts. 
 
As this work presents some restrictions, it is expected that in future works, the analysis of a wind farm will be 
developed that integrates the platforms that are close in the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin, that the technical, economic and 
environmental viability will be tested, that others will be evaluated. aspects of ecosystem services and that a more 
detailed cash flow is developed by proposing a minimum value for offshore wind auctions observing the model of 
other countries.

Abstract 
 
Servitization has been implemented in different sectors, highlighting the growing interest of manufacturing companies 
in this type of strategy, where they are challenged to rethink their offerings to develop and deliver Product-Service 
Systems. In addition, the literature has devoted special attention to the process of digital transformation of industries 
and companies, especially in the context of the so-called Industry 4.0, a process that has been supported by the 
implementation of basic technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). However, although the potential for applying 
AI in services has been demonstrated, there are still no studies that guide product companies in the use of AI for 
servitization. Thus, this study carries out a systematic literature review to identify and analyze the existing literature, 
thus obtaining a broader view of the topic. The results showed that AI has been applied in several back and front-
office solutions, but predominantly in support activities. Also, challenges were identified for the implementation of 
the technology, such as the need for base technologies and the understanding of the requirements for the new type of 
contact that AI provides. Still, it was possible to identify that the literature approaches the solutions in a very generic 
way, not deepening the type of AI applied nor how the implementation is done, being very superficial from the point 
of view of the implementation of AI solutions in servitization.

1. Introduction  
Servitization, widely recognized as a value creation process, adding services to products (Baines and Lightfoot, 2013), 
has been implemented in different sectors, highlighting the growing interest of manufacturing companies in this type 
of strategy (Bustinza et al. 2015; Paslauski et al. 2016). Through this strategy, companies benefit in many ways such 
as revenue growth, strengthening the supplier-customer relationship, greater customer loyalty, differentiation and 
robust market defense against the competition, and building new revenue streams (Grubic 2018). These companies 
are challenged to rethink their offerings, seeking to develop and deliver Product-Service Systems (PSS), and in this 
sense, one of the growing applications of digital technologies is the delivery of services linked to smart products 
(Marcon et al. 2019; Porter and Heppelmann 2015).   
 
In parallel, the literature has devoted special attention to the process of digital transformation (digitalization) of 
industries and companies, especially within the context of the so-called Industry 4.0 (Dalenogare et al. 2018). This 
transformation process has been supported by the implementation of four core technologies: internet of things (IoT), 
which provides connectivity; cloud computing, which enables ubiquity; big data, to create massive data warehouses; 
and artificial intelligence (AI) to provide advanced data analysis (Frank, et al. 2019). Digitization is seen as a source 
of competitiveness due to its potential for value creation and revenue generation, where suppliers and customers tend 
to shift from a product-centric model to a service-oriented one (Frank et al. 2019), the use of these digital technologies 
to support the servitization of product companies is called digital servitization (Kohtamäki et al. 2019). In general, 
these technologies facilitate the interaction of product companies with their customers, who often have complex and 
heterogeneous demands, and accelerate data-sharing throughout the supply chain (Wei et al. 2017). Thus, the

1046",,"As a theoretical contribution, this study compiles the findings in the literature on the application of AI in the 
servitization of product companies, with its applications in the back and front-office. It also describes the impact that 
the implementation of AI solutions can have on traditional business models, as well as the challenges that companies 
may face in this process. In addition, the study brings new cases and applications, pointing out research gaps, which 
can guide future studies.  
 
The study also brings practical contributions, since the results can be used by companies and their managers to guide 
the implementation of AI in the servitization of their proposals because, in addition to bringing examples of 
applications in product companies, it describes the application, as well as the challenges according to the socio-
technical factors that accompany the application in the back and front office and how this impacts their business 
models, which can make this movement of servitization with AI safer.  
 
Considering that most of the identified literature approaches AI generically, without describing the application and 
the type of AI that is behind the solution, an in-depth analysis of how product companies are implementing it is 
suggested for future studies. these solutions, what types of AI are implemented, and what is the motivation behind the 
use of this specific technology. Also, a case study is interesting to know fact in which solutions of product companies 
AI is present because in cases such as intelligent products, this study showed that it is not clear in the literature which 
technology is at stake. brings this intelligence.

Abstract 
 
The development of digitalization is currently speedy, and almost every activity is undergoing a digital transformation. 
Through the internet, we can get information in the public sector, even about financial or non-financial related, and 
digitalization transformation through system applications like websites or mobile apps can increase the attractiveness 
of investors to invest their shares. This study aims to explore and disclose information related to the Oceania 
government. This research focuses only on the accessibility of financial data information and reports in Oceania by 
using content analysis from government websites in Oceania. This study has 14 Oceania countries as objects of 
research. According to the United Nations E-Government Survey data. This research uses the internet financial 
reporting index to measure data accessibility. The results of this study found that New Zealand has a high level of 
accessibility compared to other countries. Meanwhile, Nauru has the lowest index, shown as 0 in the IFR Government 
website indicator. And the State of Samoa has the lowest index, which is a value of 0 with the IFR Ministry of Finance 
Website indicator. The inequality of index values on websites in Oceania countries does not rule out the possibility 
that these countries do not understand the importance of accessibility of financial statements in making decisions for 
potential investors in that country.

Abstract  
 
Implementing Lean system tools in the road transportation process is a way to make the process happen with less 
human effort, equipment, time, and space, allowing for planned transportation logistics. The limited use of Lean 
thinking in the trucking industry and the paucity of practical studies suggest that there is no clear understanding of the 
benefits of how Lean thinking can support improved operations in this industry. Thus, this study aims to identify the 
waste in the transportation process dedicated to the offshore chain in a company in the oil and gas sector, through a 
real case study, adding guidance on the limited research conducted in this field. This is a complex process where 
possibilities for competitive improvement lie for the internal logistics area of the company under analysis. The offshore 
supply chain case study was composed of multiple theoretical and empirical data collection methods, such as scoping 
review, focus groups, and participant observation. The field analysis allowed us to clearly identify the waste existing 
in the process in the studied area. We conclude that this work explored the applicability of Lean tools to reduce waste 
in road transport through a real case of intervention, resulting in the identification of waste present in the process and 
in a concrete action plan for the implementation of automation of activities and treatment of the points identified with 
a minimum estimate of reduction of downtime in monetary value of R$ 128,477.17 in two weeks of operation.

1. Introduction  
The impact of supply chain, logistics and transportation on the economy is an issue that has received and is attracting 
increasing scientific and political attention (CSCMP, 2013). Logistics is defined by the Council of Supply Chain 
Management Professionals (CSCMP, 2013) as the part of the supply chain that is responsible for planning, 
implementing, and controlling the efficient and effective forward and reverse flow. And it defines transportation as 
the composition of various methods to move products. A supply chain is often seen as a network of critical links that 
connects organizations (stakeholders and partners) and links the inputs of each organization to its outputs. Managing 
this network generally involves the set of activities and relationships that contribute to customer value and achieve a 
sustainable competitive advantage (Sartori, 2021; Al-Aomar, 2018). Adopting this premise and knowing that logistics 
incorporates all the details concerning a given operation, process or activity and that transportation management is

1063","5.3 Proposed Improvements  
As a suggestion for improvement, after meetings with those involved in the process, for the treatment of Waiting waste 
it is suggested to involve the company's technology area to adjust the system so that all loading and unloading 
operations are centralized and there is no need to use a parallel spreadsheet, improving the efficiency of the monitoring 
team, fleet, and data reliability. Alignment with destinations is also guided through analyzing local delays, especially 
in the Docks port and in areas that the company has no management over teams, as well as structuring KPIs to support 
the measurement of carrier operations and equipment utilization, according to Sternberg et al., (2012). 
 
It was also suggested the implementation of the planning of the daily demand of operations for the use of cargo moving 
equipment (forklifts, cranes) and the team that is used in the processing and unloading stages. And guarantee of 
mechanisms to stimulate productivity (the contracted company has to be stimulated to make the vehicle ""run"", 
otherwise it will be more advantageous for the company to have the vehicle stopped, delaying the operations). To deal 
with the excessive processing it is suggested to deburocratize, digitize the documents and analyze the sending of 
accessory documentations (cargo manifest, transport requisitions, invoices) via system to the destination (Nascimento 
et al., 2018), emphasizing the need to use technology, according to Alieva & Haarman, (2020). 
 
To deal with the waste of human effort, mentioned by Malladi et al., (2011), Damrath (2012) and Robinson et al., 
(2012) in their studies, it was indicated the creation and/or improvement of work instructions, insertion of disruptive 
processes to overcome the barriers of bureaucratization, training, development of a goal for monitoring the process, 
turnover analysis and insertion in the GD (Performance Management) of the employees working in inspection. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Was observed that the Lean philosophy already has its place in the management of companies and, when applied, 
arises with possibilities to motivate new academic studies, as well as to generate work environments with leaner 
processes. This paper explored the applicability of Lean through a real intervention case, resulting in important 
identifications for noticeable improvements in the dedicated transportation process. It can be said that Lean is not easy 
to implement. However, the field research allowed us to anticipate benefits, to visualize important barriers to dealing 
with problems that would occur in the long term, and to help the operation's professionals recognize the need for a 
lean service structure suitable to implement in their processes. Finally, the study, by operationalizing the conceptual 
framework, presented a useful practical approach to reduce resource waste and increase operational value. 
 
The treatment of the waste analyzed adds value by allowing contracted resources to be used in such a way that they 
can be dimensioned in critical and/or emergency demands and that they do not delay the delivery of essential materials 
for maritime activities, highlighting the company's end activities such as production and exploration of oil and gas, 
emphasizing that the non-delivery of transported materials can lead to extremely high economic losses for the 
company under study. It also improves the capacity gain and performance of the contractors involved in the process 
to perform the main activities with the desired quality and reduces contractual costs for the company. 
 
In addition to discussing the application of lean thinking in the trucking industry, the paper also contributes to the lean 
and logistics literature by using principles of lean application in this industry. The limited research conducted in this 
area, as has been highlighted through this article, will hopefully inspire scholars to further study lean thinking in 
transportation operations and explore its compatibility with other traditional methods such as mathematical modeling, 
operations research, simulation, and Industry 4.0. By doing so, a better understanding of this area will also be achieved, 
from which more effective strategies for improving transportation operations can be formulated. 
 
It is concluded that the process mapping technique was useful in identifying the waste and it is suggested that the 
process should continue to be monitored and that a lean ""future state"" resource matrix should be developed and 
implemented to improve the activities of the studied process and that in the authors' view the study performed 
highlights that this area is an important area for future research, and also suggests that a much more differentiated 
approach to understanding the role of digital technologies in operations and supply chain management is needed along 
with Lean philosophy.

This study aims to explain how the effect of the current ratio, capital structure, and ROE on firm value with 
company size as a moderation variable on consumer goods companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 
2015 to 2017. The sampling technique used in this research is the purposive sampling method, with 36 samples of 
companies that have met certain criteria. The data analysis method used is random-effects model regression analysis 
determined based on the results of the LM Test being run on eviews software version 9.5. The test result indicated 
that the current ratio has no significant impact on firm value. While the debt-to-equity ratio, return on equity, and 
firm size positively impacts firm value, firm size can strengthen the influence of return on equity on firm value.

1. Introduction 
The rapid development of the business world today is evident in the many companies that go public and are listed on 
the Indonesia Stock Exchange. The rapid development of the business world triggered intense competition, which 
made the company try to increase competitiveness to not be defeated by competitors. The industry of the consumer 
goods sector is one of the most competitive industrial sectors in the business world, which causes consumer goods 
companies to struggle to maintain their position. For companies engaged in the consumer goods sector to survive 
and develop, company management needs to have clear corporate goals and the ability to achieve these goals. 
 
The company established must have clear objectives.(Gitman and Zutter 2015)suggest that some of the goals of 
establishing a company are to maximize the wealth of the company's owner or shareholders. Therefore, financial 
decisions taken by management are decisions that support the company's goals of maximizing shareholder wealth. 
 
Company value is the available price paid if the company is sold. Company value can be reflected through stock 
prices. The stock price is the basis of investor valuation of the company's performance. Companies with good 
performance or companies that release successful new products tend to have high stock prices. Therefore, the higher 
the stock price means, the higher the company's value(Gitman and Zutter 2015).

1075","3.9 Significant Individual Parameter Test (T Statistic Test) 
In this research, the t-test is used to determine the effect of each dependent variable on the independent variable, 
provided that the other independent variables are not changed / constant (ceteris paribus). The test results based on 
the t-test based in Table 6 are presented as follows: 
 
1) Current Ratio Test Results to Price to Book Value 
In this research, tα -table at the significance level α = 0.05 with the degree of freedom = 95 is 1.658. Based on 
Table 6, it is known that the current ratio variable has tcount <tα -table, which is 0.636682 <1.658, which means 
that H0 is not rejected. This means that the current ratio does not have a positive and significant effect on the 
price to book value. 
2) Debt to Equity Ratio Test Results to Price to Book Value 
Based on Table 6, it is known that the debt-to-equity ratio variable has tcount > tα -table, which is 77.95386> 
1.658, which means H0 is rejected. This means that the debt-to-equity ratio has a positive and significant effect 
on the price to book value. Debt to equity ratio has a regression coefficient of 3.171 which means that if the 
debt-equity ratio rises by 1%, the price to book value rises by 3.171%. At the same time, the other independent 
variables are constant (ceteris paribus). 
3) Return on Equity Test Results to Price to Book Value 
Based on Table 6, it is known that the return on equity variable has tcount > tα -table, which is 27.64955> 
1.658, which means H0 is rejected. This means that return on equity has a positive and significant effect on the 
price to book value. Return on equity has a regression coefficient of 0.778 which means that if the return on 
equity rises by 1%, the price to book value rises 0.778%. At the same time, the other independent variables are 
constant (ceteris paribus). 
4) Company Size Test Results to Price to Book Value 
Based on Table 4.10, it is known that company size variables have tcount > tα -table, which is 3.242716> 1.658, 
which means H0 is rejected. This means that the company's size has a positive and significant effect on the price 
to book value. 
5) Test Results of Company Size as a Moderating Variable 
Based on Table 4.10, it is known that the interaction variable return on equity and company size has tcount > tα 
-table, which is 7.019082> 1.658, which means H0 is rejected. This means that the interaction variable return on 
equity and company size has a positive and significant effect on the price to book value. 
 
4. Conclusion and Suggestion 
The research object to be examined is the annual financial statements of the consumer goods sector listed in 
Indonesia. 
The results of this research can be summarized as follows: 
1) The results of hypothesis testing indicate that statistically, the current ratio does not affect the company's value. 
2) The results of hypothesis testing indicate that statistically, the capital structure has a positive and significant 
effect on company value. 
3) The results of hypothesis testing indicate that statistically, return on equity has a positive and significant effect 
on company value. 
4) The results of hypothesis testing indicate that statistically, the company's size has a positive and significant 
effect on company value. 
5) The results of hypothesis testing indicate that statistically, the company's size can strengthen the effect of return 
on equity on company value. 
 
Based on the results of the research, there are several suggestions, as follows: 
1) For investors, in conducting stock analysis using the price to book value approach, it is recommended to pay 
attention to financial ratios, especially the debt-to-equity ratio, return on equity, and company size. These three 
factors can be used as considerations for investors in investing. 
2) For company management, to increase the price to book value, the company needs to pay attention to and 
increase the debt-to-equity ratio, return on equity, and company size because the three factors have a positive 
and significant influence on price to book value.

Abstract 
 
This study examines the effect of corporate ownership structure and board size on earnings management for a 
sample of 30 non-financial firms registered on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2013 to 2016. Earnings 
management is measured by discretionary accruals using Modified Jones Model. The corporate ownership structure 
is measured with managerial ownership and institutional ownership. This study also uses three control variables: 
return on assets, financial leverage, and firm size. Using multiple regression analysis, the results show the 
relationship between board size and earnings management is negatively significant. However, managerial 
Ownership and Institutional Ownership have no significant effect on earnings management. The findings also reveal 
that return on assets and firm size has a significant positive effect while financial leverage has a significant negative 
impact on earnings management.

1. Introduction 
There are a lot of big foreign companies that are increasingly entering the Indonesian market in this era of 
globalization. Competition between companies is increasing as a result. Therefore, companies will continue to 
improve their performance by making good financial statements. A financial statement is used as information for 
external and internal parties of the company(Yuliana and Trisnawati 2015). 
 
A financial statement concerns the financial position and performance and changes in a company’s financial 
position. It is beneficial to many users in economic decision-making(Agustia 2013). 
 
Earnings are an important element in the financial statement. It is used to measure the performance of the 
management. In addition, earnings are also used by investors, or other parties concerned, as an indicator of the 
efficiency of the use of funds in the rate of return. It also may be an indicator of the increase in prosperity of the 
company(Ghozali and Chariri 2007). Hence, earnings become important information for the decision-making 
process. Earnings are usually measured on an accrual basis(Subramanyam 1996). Accrued earnings are considered a 
better measurement of a company’s performance than operating cash flows. This is because accrual reduces 
mismatching and time problems, as proposed byDechow (1994), which exists in the use of short-term cash flows 
(Siregar and Utama 2005). 
 
Earnings management can be efficient and opportunistic, as proposed byScott (2015). Efficient means an increase in 
the informativity of earnings in communicating private information. Opportunistic means that managers report

Based on the regression carried out in this study, it can be concluded that the board size of the non-financial 
companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange period 2013 to 2016 has a significant negative influence on 
earnings management. The conclusion is made by looking at the p-value of 0.0121, which is below the 5% 
significance level. The coefficient of the Board Size variable is -0.006382. Board size has a negative effect on 
earnings management because the increase in board size will increase supervisory measures. With the increase in 
supervision, the chance of earnings management practices decreases. On the contrary, the decrease in board size will 
lead to lesser supervision, therefore increasing the chance of earnings management practice. This result is consistent 
withAygun et al. (2014) and Xie et al. (2003) research. 
 
4. Effect of Return on Assets on Earnings Management 
Based on the regression carried out in this study, it can be concluded that the return on assets of the non-financial 
companies that are listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange period 2013 to 2016 has a significant positive effect on 
earnings management. The conclusion is made by looking at the p-value of 0.0001, which is below the 5% 
significance level. The coefficient of the Return on Assets variable is 0.328694. Return on assets positively affects 
earnings management because managers want to make the company’s year on year more stable. If the increase in 
return on assets is high, a sharp fluctuation might show. A sharp fluctuation is not good for the company. Therefore, 
earnings management is implemented to make year on year look more stable in the eye of the public. This result is 
consistent withAygun et al. (2014) and Guna and Herawaty (2010). 
 
5. Effect Financial Leverage on Earnings Management 
Based on the regression carried out in this study, it can be concluded that the financial leverage of the non-financial 
companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange period 2013 to 2016 has a significant negative influence on 
earnings management. The conclusion is made by looking at the p-value of 0.0083, which is below the 5% 
significance level. The coefficient of the Financial Leverage variable is -0.048447. Financial leverage has a negative 
effect on earnings management because if leverage is low, then interest expense will also be low. If interest expense 
is low, then net income will be high. If net income is high, the company will have to pay a larger amount of tax. 
Therefore, managers implement earnings management to avoid paying a larger amount of tax. Therefore, the 
implementation of earnings management is low because it is already tax saving. This study is consistent with Aygun 
et al. (2014) and Yuliana and Trisnawati (2015). 
 
6. Effect of Firm Size on Earnings Management 
Based on the regression carried out in this study, it can be concluded that the firm size of the non-financial 
companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange period 2013 to 2016 has a significant positive influence on 
earnings management. The conclusion is made by looking at the p-value of 0.0672, which is below the 10% 
significance level. The coefficient of the Firm Size variable is 0.011180. Firm size positively affects earnings 
management because the larger the company, the higher the investor’s expectations of them. Not only that, but the 
management must also be able to maintain the company in certain positions. With these pressures, management will 
always implement earnings management to meet all of the company’s interests. This study is consistent withDaljono 
(2013). 
 
 
5. Conclusion and Suggestion 
Based on the result of the hypothesis test, it can be concluded that: 
1. Managerial ownership has no significant effect on earnings management.  
2. Institutional ownership has no significant effect on earnings management. 
3. Board size has a significant negative effect on earnings management. 
Based on the result of hypothesis test and research limitations, there are some recommendations: 
1. For investors and creditors, not focus only on information regarding the earnings generated because there 
may be the accrual component that is arranged by the manager’s considerations for personal gain. Besides 
earnings, investors and creditors also need to pay attention to other non-financial information, one of which 
is the implementation of good corporate governance to make a decision. 
2. For the company to be willing to evaluate the results of the company’s performance. A better 
implementation of good corporate governance is needed to reduce earnings management practices. 
3. For future researchers, to use a longer study period to better illustrate the effect of independent variables on 
the dependent variable. Future research also recommends adding or using other independent variables to

management is also recommended to compare the result.

Abstract 
 
This research aims to analyze the influence of dividend policy determinants on dividend payment either partially or 
simultaneously in all industry sectors except the financing industry listed on Indonesia Stock Exchange in 2016. The 
factors examined in this research include profitability, leverage, growth, agency cost and firm size. Data were 
obtained from the relevant databases and financial statements of the sampled companies. This research examines a 
total of 149 companies. The results revealed that profitability and growth significantly influence dividend policy. 
Meanwhile, leverage, agency cost, and firm size have no significant effect on dividend policy. It is suggested that 
the company should always pay attention to the fundamental aspects of the company, and it may determine their 
dividend policies to keep attracting an investor. It is best for an investor to consider a company with high 
profitability, low leverage, low or high growth rates, high free cash flow, and a big firm.

1. Introduction 
Capital market is an activity that related to the public offering and securities trading, public company that related to 
the issued securities, and institution that related to the securities (Rusdin, 2008). Capital market provides various 
alternatives for investors to receive profit. One way is by investing. Investing is an important activity to develop the 
company operational (Anoraga & Pakarti, 2008). Investing is an important activity to develop the company's 
business operations. Investing is one of the capital market alternatives for the investor to receive profits. It can also 
be referred to as a capital investment. Capital investment refers to funds invested in the company to further its 
business objective. The capital can be derived from two sources, which are internal and external financing or 
sources. The internal source comes from funds generated by the company itself, i.e., retained earnings (Sakir & 
Miksalmina, 2006).  Unlike internal sources that tend to be limited, external sources come from outside parties 
willing to cooperate with the company, such as banks, creditors, suppliers, and the capital market. A company 
usually issue a share or stock. Therefore, investors will purchase the share and invest their funds in the company. 
Hence, the company will receive the needed capital. Investors can expect the return in the form of dividends and 
capital gain. O’Sullivan and Sheffrin (2003) stated that a dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its 
shareholders, usually as a distribution of profits. Another definition of dividend was also stated by Weygandt, 
Kimmel and Kieso (2012), a dividend is corporation’s distribution of cash or shares to its shareholder based on a pro 
rata. Dividend can be issued as cash, property, scrip (a promissory note to pay cash), or shares. Investors prefer 
dividends from stock rather than potential capital gains because of the inherent uncertainty of the latter. Even though 
the company can distribute dividends in other forms, most shareholders prefer and desire dividends to be distributed 
in cash because it can reduce the uncertainty of investments. Investors usually will consider many things before 
making an investment decision, as well as the company, will consider many things in determining the company's

1098","The comparison results between Tcount and Ttable shows that Tcount (0.167) <Ttable (1.655579) and the level of 
significance > 0.05 (0.868 > 0.05), then the decision to be taken is to reject HA5. In other words, the firm size (FS 
TA) does not significantly affect dividend payment. 
 
3.4 Multiple Linear Regression Model Analysis 
Based on Table-III, the equation for the multiple linear regression model in this research is: 
 
 
The following will explain the equations of multiple linear regression models above: 
1. Constant (α) = 0.424 
The constant value (α) of 0.424 indicates the amount of dependent variable, which is the dividend payout ratio, is 
not influenced by independent variables, such as Return on Assets (ROA), Debt to Equity Ratio (DER), Market to 
Book Ratio (MTBR), Agency Cost (AC), and Firm Size (FS TA). 
2. Return on Assets Regression Coefficient (β1) X1 = -1.986 
If the return on assets ratio increases by one unit, assuming the other independent variable remains, the dividend 
payment will decrease by 1.986. The negative sign on the regression coefficient value indicates that the independent 
variables with the dependent variable run in two directions or a two-way relationship, where each increase in the 
independent variables will be followed by a decrease in the dependent variable and vice versa. 
3. Debt to Equity Ratio Regression Coefficient (β2) X2 = -0.069 
If the debt-to-equity ratio increases by one unit, assuming the other independent variable remains, the dividend 
payment will decrease by 0.069. The negative sign on the regression coefficient value indicates that the independent 
variables with the dependent variable run in two directions or a two-way relationship, where each increase in the 
independent variables will be followed by a decrease in the dependent variable and vice versa. 
4. Market to Book Ratio Regression Coefficient (β3) X3 = 0.058 
If the market to book ratio increases by one unit, assuming the other independent variable remains, the dividend 
payment will increase by 0.058. The positive sign on the regression coefficient value indicates that the independent 
variables with the dependent variable run in one direction or one-way relationship, where any increase or decrease in 
the independent variables will be followed by an increase or decrease in the dependent variable. 
5. Agency Cost Regression Coefficient (β4) X4 = -0.176 
If the agency cost value increases by one unit, assuming the other independent variable remains, the dividend 
payment will decrease by 0.176. The negative sign on the regression coefficient value indicates that the independent 
variables with the dependent variable run in two directions or a two-way relationship, where each increase in the 
independent variables will be followed by a decrease in the dependent variable and vice versa. 
6. Firm Size Total Assets Regression Coefficient (β5) X5 = 0.004 
If the firm size value increases by one unit, assuming the other independent variable remains, the dividend payment 
will increase by 0.004. The positive sign on the regression coefficient value indicates that the independent variables 
with the dependent variable run in one direction or one-way relationship, where any increase or decrease in the 
independent variables will be followed by an increase or decrease in the dependent variable. 
7. Error Term (ε) 
The error term shows the confounding variable outside Return on Assets, Debt to Equity Ratio, Asset Growth, 
Agency Cost, and Firm Size. As explained in the previous chapter, the error term in the regression model confirms 
that many other independent variables can influence the dependent variable.  
8. Cross-Sectional Error Term (vit) 
Vit is the cross-sectional error term (for the random-effects model). As explained in the previous chapter, the 
existence of the cross-sectional error term is almost the same as the previous error term, confirming that many other 
independent variables can influence the dependent variable. Still, the cross-sectional error term is for the random-
effects model. The random-effects model assumes that the analyzed data is drawn from a hierarchy of different 
populations whose differences relate to that hierarchy. This model is used to overcome the fixed model data that 
uses a dummy variable. 
 
6. Conclusions and Recommendation 
This research shows that profitability has a negative effect on dividend payment, which means the higher the 
profitability rate of the company, the lower the company's intention to pay higher dividends. A profitable company 
Proceedings of the 3rd South American International Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Conference, Asuncion, Paraguay, July 19-21, 2022 
© IEOM Society International
1102","prefers to use its earnings to start a new project, acquire new assets, repurchase some of its shares, or even buy out 
another company rather than pay dividends to shareholders. A profitable company may have considered the risk and 
potential expense when issuing new stock. Therefore, they would like to avoid the risk of needing to raise money 
this way, and they choose to keep all of their profits. 
  
On the other hand, growth has a positive effect on dividend payments. This result proves the Dividend Signaling 
Theory, which states that a high growth rate company will pay a higher dividend because they want to attract more 
investors to invest in the company.  
 
Meanwhile, the remaining indicators, i.e., Leverage, Agency Cost and Firm Size, do not affect dividend payment. It 
means that these indicators will not contribute to changes in corporate dividend policy. 
 
Below are the recommendations given to further researcher: 
1. Further research can add other variables that can affect dividend payment to increase the coefficient of 
determination. In further research, the proxy of agency cost may use insider ownership, institutional 
ownership, dispersions of ownership, and collateralizable asset because it is possible to illustrate the agency 
cost.  
2. Further research may use all listed companies, including the financing industry. 
3. Further research may use the data in the previous year or the year after to increase the number of samples, 
so there is a possibility of getting more accurate results. 
 
Advice given to investors is: 
1. For investors and potential investors who want to invest in companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange, it is best to consider a company with high profitability, low leverage, low growth rates, high free 
cash flow and big firm. Profitability, liquidity, company growth, agency cost, and firm size can be used as 
the basis of investment decision-making. These variables can be a benchmark of the company's ability to 
generate a dividend payout ratio on the investment made in the company. 
 
As for the company, the recommendations are: 
1. The company should always pay attention to the fundamental aspects of the company, especially for the 
matter that concerns the dividend payout ratio, because the dividend payout ratio aspect attracts investors to 
invest their funds in the company as well as a gauge of the effectiveness and efficiency of all the existing 
resources used in the company's operational processes that will have implications for the increase in the 
dividend payout ratio of the company. 
2. The company may determine its dividend policies to keep attracting investors and potential investors based 
on its situation.

Abstract  
 
The purpose of this research is to analyze the effect of change of management, financial distress, Public Accounting 
Firm Size, percentage of ROA change, Client size, going concern audit opinion and audit tenure on voluntary auditor 
switching. This research uses the logistic regression method, which uses secondary data from manufacturing 
companies with observation years from 2012 to 2016. The result of the research indicates that client size and audit 
tenure influence voluntary auditor switching. While the change of management, financial distress, Public Accounting 
Firm Size, percentage of ROA change, and going concern audit opinion do not affect voluntary auditor switching.

1. Introduction  
Financial statements are one general description of the condition of a company. Financial statements also function as 
a media company to communicate various information about the presentation of financial statements used by 
management for accountability and economic measurement of the resources owned by interested parties to obtain 
information about the extent of their performance achievements to those in need. To improve the reliability of financial 
statements, financial statements must be audited by an auditor. Examinations carried out by the auditor must be 
objective and independent. Independence means that the auditor cannot be influenced by certain parties (Public 
Accountant Professional Standards / PAPS). Jensen & Meckling (1976) in Putranto and Raharja (2013) state that 
agency problems are caused by conflicts of interest and information asymmetry between principals and agents. This 
conflict can occur because the agent does not always act in accordance with the wishes of the principal and raises the 
cost agency. In agency theory, the auditor acts as an intermediary between agents and principals of different interests. 
However, suppose there is a relationship between the Public Accountant Firm (PAF) and company management 
(client) as a long-established assignor. In that case, it can make the auditor's independence decrease, indirectly 
influencing the quality of the audit produced. 
 
In Indonesia, the provision of audit services is carried out by the Public Accountant Office, which is regulated in 
Government Regulation No.20 of 2015 concerning Public Accountants in article 11 paragraph (1) containing the 
provision of audit services for historical financial information as referred to in Article 10 paragraph (1) letters A for 
an entity by a Public Accountant is limited to a maximum of 5 (five) consecutive financial years. The replacement of 
PAF (auditor switching) can occur due to government regulation or based on the company's wishes outside the 
regulations (voluntary). Switching auditors that occur voluntarily can occur due to various factors that originate from

paragraph has a drop cap. 
 
4. Conclusion  
1. Management change does not affect voluntary auditor switching. These results are supported by Astrini & 
Muid (2013) and Kurniaty (2014), which state that management change does not have a significant effect on 
the replacement of PAF. So, it can be concluded that the presence or absence of management change does not 
affect the occurrence of voluntary auditor switching because, ultimately, the management and PAF can 
renegotiate. 
2. Financial distress does not affect voluntary auditor switching. The results are supported by Aprillia (2013) and 
Salim & Rahayu (2014), which state that financial distress does not significantly affect auditor switching. So, 
it can be concluded that financial distress is not a factor that influences the occurrence of voluntary switching 
auditors because companies experiencing financial difficulties do not make changes to the accounting firm 
because it will require greater audit costs to understand the business model from the start. 
3. PAF size does not affect voluntary auditor switching. This is supported by the research of Salim & Rahayu 
(2014) and Astrini & Muid (2013), which state that the size of PAF does not affect the change of PAF. Then 
it can be concluded the size of the PAF is not a factor that influences the occurrence of voluntary auditor 
switching because as long as the PAF provides good and reliable audit quality, the company tends to maintain 
the old PAF. 
4. The percentage change in ROA does not affect voluntary auditor switching. This is supported by research 
conducted by Wea & Murdiwati (2015), and Yanti (2016) found evidence that the percentage change in ROA 
does not affect the auditor switching or the change of PAF. Then it can be concluded that the percentage change 
in ROA is not a factor that affects the occurrence of voluntary auditor switching because the company does 
not always switch to a new Public Accountant Firm in any condition. In addition, the long relationship between 
the company and the old client is another reason. 
5. Client size influences voluntary auditor switching. This is in line with the research of Kurniaty (2014) and 
Wea & Murdiwati (2015) state that the company's size influences the change of PAF. Then it can be concluded 
that client size is one of the factors that influence the occurrence of voluntary auditor switching because 
companies tend to make changes to the new PAF to show the suitability between company size and PAF size. 
6. Going concern audit opinion does not affect voluntary auditor switching. The research conducted by Arsih & 
Anisykurlliah (2015) states that going concern opinion does not influence the change of PAF. It can be 
concluded that the going concern audit opinion is not a factor that influences the occurrence of voluntary 
auditor switching because the company receives a going concern opinion is an opinion on the company whose 
business continuity is doubtful even though there is a management plan to resolve the problem in the company. 
With that opinion, the company will try to improve performance. 
7. Audit tenure affects voluntary auditor switching. It can be concluded that audit tenure is one factor that 
influences the occurrence of voluntary switching auditors because the longer the audit engagement period, the 
greater the tendency of client companies to make changes to PAF. Because of the regulations that limit it. 
8. Based on the results of simultaneous management change, financial distress, PAF size, the percentage change 
in ROA, client size, going concern audit opinion, and audit tenure have an effect on auditor switching. 
Simultaneous test results show the number 0.000> 0.05, meaning the overall variables in this study are jointly 
able to influence auditor switching voluntarily. 
With the limitations in this study, here are some suggestions for the development of further research and 
researchers: 
1. For the next researcher, replace or not be limited to the often-used independent variables. 
2. For further researchers, use the object of research that is more diverse and not limited to manufacturing 
companies. 
3. Further research uses other measurements in the calculation of the variables used in this study. 
4. Subsequent research uses a longer observation period to get better results.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to analyze the effect of short-term debt, investment in fixed assets, the board size, net working 
capital, leverage, firm size, and return on assets toward cash holding for consumer goods companies in Indonesia. 
Using the purposive sampling technique, only 27 of 45 consumer goods companies listed on the Indonesia Stock 
Exchange were selected as samples. With the sample data usage period between 2013 and 2016, the total sample 
used is 108 firms. The data analysis method used is panel data regression with a fixed-effect model using EViews 9. 
The results of the hypothesis show that short term debt, investment in fixed assets, and return on assets have a 
significant impact on cash holding with a positive direction relationship. Meanwhile, the other independent variables 
have an insignificant impact on cash holding.

1. Introduction 
The global economic crisis that hit the world economy began with the failure to pay for housing loans (subprime 
mortgage default) indirectly affects how companies take a policy. One policy that is of concern now is the policy 
regarding cash holding. This is because, at that time, high-interest rates made borrowing costs expensive and 
difficult to obtain. Gill and Shah define cash holding as cash available in the hands and easily available to invest in 
physical assets and to be distributed to investors in the form of dividends. Because the nature of cash is very easy to 
use and cash at any time without reducing the real value of the money, then the determination and supervision of the 
optimal amount of cash that must be owned by the company become an important thing to consider because it will 
affect the company's liquidity. 
 
The research on the topic of cash holding is taken because companies still have difficulty maintaining liquidity even 
though the liquidity problem is a serious problem because it will adversely affect the company. The liquidity 
problem is a problem due to the unavailability of sufficient cash to meet the company's financial obligations, so the 
determination of cash holding must be considered well like a double-edged knife if the shortage will hamper the 
company's operations while if excessive cash will not be good for the company because it will only become idle 
cash it will even eliminate opportunities for companies to obtain benefits such as interest income if the funds owned 
are invested in securities or projects that will benefit the company. Therefore, researchers are interested in 
researching the factors that affect cash holding in a company because previous studies still found inconsistencies in 
the study results. This research refers to previous journals conducted by Sulaman Jamil, Amna Anwar, NailaAfzaal,

1112","Return on Assets significantly effect on Cash Holding 
Return on assets measures the company's ability to utilize its assets effectively and efficiently in increasing net profit 
for the company. Return on assets has a positive direction toward cash holding with a value change coefficient of 
1.249517. If the return on assets variable increases by 1, cash holding will increase by 1.249517, assuming the other 
independent variables are constant. Based on the results of tests that have been conducted, it can be concluded that 
return on assets has a significant effect on cash holding in the consumer goods sector companies listed on the 
Indonesia Stock Exchange in the 2013-2016 period because of the significant value obtained is less than 0.05 
(0.0000 <0.05). A positive effect because the greater the profitability of the company, which is indicated by a high 
return on assets indicates that the company's ability to generate profits is also greater so that the company will be 
better able to reserve more cash to be able to offset the company's cash flow is also large. 
 
5. Conclusion 
From the analysis results, it can be concluded that short term debt, investment in fixed assets, and return on assets 
have a significantly positive effect on cash holding, whereas the board size, net working capital, leverage, and firm 
size do not significantly influence on cash holding. 
The advice that can be given is: 
1. For companies 
From the results of this study, it is expected that companies can pay more attention to the level of liquidity by 
maintaining optimal cash holding levels. If the cash owned by the company is too large, it is recommended to invest 
a portion of the cash into securities and profitable projects. 
2. For further researchers 
For researchers interested in researching the same topic, it is recommended to expand the research sample to other 
sectors both in Indonesia and outside Indonesia so that the results can better explain the factors that influence cash 
holding more broadly. Further research is also suggested to extend the research period so that the results can better 
reflect the company's condition in the long run and consider other factors that influence cash holding beyond the 
variables in this study.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to determine the effect of spiritual intelligence, product attributes, product innovation, product 
attributes, and product innovation moderated by the company's reputation for buying interest in body lotion product 
HF. This study uses a quantitative method and uses a questionnaire as the data collection technique with 75 samples 
by using convenience sampling. Data analysis is using PLS-SEM with SmartPLS 3 software. The results obtained 
from this research are product innovation significantly influences purchase intention. This result also indicates that 
to increase the customer's interest in buying the product, companies must pay attention to the aspects of product 
innovation.

1. Introduction 
The Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry in Indonesia is considered one of the attractive industries with 
a sales value of more than US $ 10 billion, along with the growth of the middle class in the country. FMCG has long 
been regarded as one of the driving factors for economic movement, and the figures show promising potential. With 
more than 255 million inhabitants and more than half of them in their productive age, this positive trend is expected 
to continue along with the growth rate of spending, which increased to reach 11.8% in the period 2010-2015 and the 
average growth of the FMCG retail industry which reached 10.8 % in 2015. Overall, FMCG products successfully 
contributed 18.5% to the national GDP in 2016, and this figure is expected to reach 30% in 2030 (Business HSBC, 
2017). The rate of growth of Indonesia's revenue from the FMCG industry compared to Southeast Asian countries is 
the highest, with an increase of 8.3% compared to last year Kantar in (S. Widianto 2017). 
 
PT XYZ Tbk, as a company engaged in FMCG, is one of the industries multiplying in a very tight competition. 
Innovation is one of PT XYZ’s strategies to face competition and dominate market share. Various forms of 
innovation are carried out by PT XYZ, one of which is creating a new product with values different from other 
products. 
 
One of PT XYZ's newest innovations is the body lotion product with the HF brand. Unlike PT XYZ’s other body 
lotion products, HF is specially formulated for women wearing hijab. Hijab women with busyness throughout the 
day often feel uncomfortable because of the heat and stickiness, especially in tropical weather in Indonesia. But 
Fresh Hijab can keep them feeling cool and fresh all day despite doing a lot of activities so that their skin becomes 
softer and more evenly white.

1123","4. Conclusions 
From the results of the analysis and testing that have been carried out, there are several conclusions as follows: 
1. 
 Spiritual intelligence, product attributes, product attributes, and product innovations moderated by the 
company's reputation do not significantly influence buying interest. That way, it means that there are still 
other factors beyond the variables examined in this study that affect buying interest. Based on the results of 
the path coefficient, sorted from the variables that have the strongest to the weakest influence on buying 
interest are spiritual intelligence variables, moderated product innovation, moderated product attributes, and 
the last is the product attribute variables. 
2. 
Product innovation significantly influences buying interest and consists of several dimensions, namely 
relative excellence, compatibility, communicability, product benefits, innovation attributes, and behavioural 
change. The strongest dimension is the attribute of innovation, while the weakest is behaviour change 
 
Based on the results of this study, the owners and managers of consumer goods businesses must understand that 
product innovation plays an important role in influencing consumer buying interest. In accordance with the study 
results, it shows that the hypothesis stating that buying interest is influenced by the product innovation variable is 
accepted. Product innovation is an important thing that must be considered by the owners and business managers, 
where innovation can be a major weapon of the company to attract consumers to buy and improve company 
performance. 
 
The study's factors of spiritual intelligence, product attributes, and company reputation did not significantly 
influence consumer buying interest. However, this does not mean that businesses do not need to pay attention to 
these three factors. Even though the study results indicate that the three factors are rejected, this does not mean that 
these factors do not influence at all. Although, indeed, in the context of this study, these three factors lack a 
significant influence, these factors can support companies in increasing consumer buying interest. In addition, these 
three factors are also interrelated with product innovation to attract consumer buying interest. 
 
There are several suggestions for further research. Most of these suggestions are proposals and recommendations 
related to research limitations. The proposals include: The next researcher should conduct research in several other 
regions in Indonesia with a broader scope, especially in big cities, to better cover the entire Indonesian community. 
The next researcher should allocate more time to collect more data from digging deeper into understanding and 
getting a more diverse picture in terms of the characteristics of respondents. 
 
This research model can also be modified for further research purposes by adding other variables, such as promotion 
or consumer behaviour, or adding a hypothesis to test the effect of each independent factor on the dependent 
variable. The modification will give new results and add insight. 
 
The next researcher can conduct research with different research objects, such as body lotion with other brands 
besides HF or product categories other than body lotion, to produce a new finding that is different from the results of 
this study.

Abstract  
 
This study aims to determine and analyze the influence of partial and simultaneous discipline, motivation, and 
organizational commitment on employee performance. To know and analyze the variables that most significantly 
affect the employees. Data collection techniques in this study are through questionnaires with respondents 116 
employees in analyzing this research data using multiple linear regression analysis methods. The research results can 
be concluded partially that variable discipline has a significant effect on employee performance while variable 
motivation and organizational commitment partially have no significant effect on employee performance. 
Simultaneously, the three independent variables, which are discipline variables, motivation, and organizational 
commitment, have relationships with dependent variables, that is, employee performance (Y). This can be proven 
through the value of multiple correlation coefficients (R) equal to 0.182. The research also shows that the relationship 
of independent variables (discipline, motivation, and organizational commitment) to employee performance (Y) is 
54.9%. The variable that has the most significant effect on employee performance is the discipline of work because 
the value of t count is the greatest. The authors suggest that it should be to find and apply the discipline that can affect 
the performance of employees is getting better simultaneously with the variable motivation and organizational 
commitment. In the discipline of work, authors suggest that companies provide training on how to accomplish work 
together in teams, organize events outside of work activities that bring together and familiarize employees, and reward 
teams for the best performing teams so that motivation and commitment organizations increase and positively affect 
employee performance.

1.  For forecasting in the next period, PT. XYZ should use the linear trend method. This method can help companies 
find out the number of requests in the future. To optimize the amount of production and maximize profits, PT. XYZ 
should use the linear programming method. 
2.   Subject should analyze the company's current production system because there is a fairly large slack. If there is a 
large amount of Slack / Surplus, PT. XYZ can reduce this amount. This is done to prevent waste in the production 
process.

Abstract  
 
Door-locking system with face recognition and fingerprint sensor is a system of door’s lock that uses two security 
parameters. These two parameters must be fulfilled for the door to be opened. When one of these two parameters do 
not grand the permission, then the door will not open. This system uses a Raspberry pi zero as a control centre and a 
dataset storage for the faces’ images. For the input process, a Raspberry pi camera and a fingerprint sensor are used. 
And the output uses a Relay and a Solenoid Door Lock. The results showed that only faces and fingerprints that are 
recognized by the system, that could successfully open the door.

1. Introduction 
Feeling secure improves productivity and it consequently improves our life’s quality as a society. According to 
Statistical Bureau of Indonesia, in 2011-2018, burglary has occurred in 45% from the total towns and villages based 
on (BPS RI 2020). This high percentage of burglary has impacted our economy both in the towns and villages (Delia 
2009).  
 
In this research, a System of door lock using a web-camera, fingerprint’s sensor, and a Raspberry pi Zero W, is 
introduced as an alternative for a more secure system in a residential area. Furthermore, the selection of the cheapest 
Raspberry pi Zero W, has proven that despite its low specification amongst other Raspberry pi’s products, it can still 
perform person’s detection software, that requires a powerful computing machine. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
The goal of this research is to prove that a Raspberry pi Zero W can run a deep-learning model to recognize a 
person. Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the door-lock’s design.

Abstract  
 
Violence against children has become a problem that is still found in society. This condition may lead to fatalities in 
children. The Indonesian Government is expected to contribute, to reducing this problem significantly, not only to 
prevent it but also to provide appropriate facilities for child survivors of Violence. Child violence is any act committed 
against a child that caused the child to suffer either physically, psychologically, sexually, or neglected. The impacts 
of these kinds of violence will affect physical and psychological trauma in children. A rehabilitation center for child 
survivors of violence should provide facilities that involve program activities during the rehabilitation period. An eco-
behavior method is a therapeutic process that presents a social environment to interact with children and their parents 
as survivors of violence. Eco-behavior has specific activities to be considered in designing an interior of a 
rehabilitation center. It is an interesting study case in supporting a sustainable human environment. The research was 
conducted through the design process of planning the interior design of a rehabilitation center for child survivors of 
violence. Data was collected from literature study, web observation, and interviews regarding the program activities 
that comprise the interior design process. The result of this research is an interior design presentation in three-
dimensional perspective drawings that specifically provide facilities for children’s recovery process. It is expected the 
Applicative the on of eco-behavior the method in rehabilitation center interior can facilitate the children to improve tr 
behavior as to support every process for trauma from both physically and psychologically.

1.Introduction  
Nowadays, there have been many tragic incidents involving children who are victims of violence. In 2020, cases of 
violence against children in Indonesia did not show a decrease, which refers to data from Sistem Informasi Online 
Perlindungan Perempuan dan Anak (Simfoni) Kementerian Pemberdayaan Perempuan dan Anak, the numbers of 
violence against children increased significantly from 2016. Kementerian Pemberdayaan Perempuan dan Anak at 
least recorded that there were 4,116 cases of violence against children in the period of January 1st to July 31st in 2020, 
which also happened during the Covid-19 pandemic (Kementrian, 2020). 
 
Violence against children does not only happen in poor families or bad environments. This phenomenon can happen 
in any ethnic group, all-gender, any social class even in a harmonious family. It is fact that some acts of violence did 
by the closest people to the victims, for example, relatives, neighbors, and even parents who are supposed to raise and 
take care of their children. However, it was also found that foreigners can also commit violence against children. 
Generally, children who experience violence have not been able to protect themselves, both in terms of defending and 
fighting physically or non-physically. This causes trauma to children physically and psychologically. The category of 
violence against children includes child neglect, psychological violence, exploitation of children, sexual abuse, and 
child trafficking (Huraerah, 2020). These actions have a different psychological impact on every child. It will impact 
their self-confidence, pull their selves out of society, and feel inferior, anxious, and excessive fear 
(dosensosiologi.com, 2020). 
 
Over time, this trauma will not go away unless the victims get complete treatment and therapy related to the incident 
that happened in their childhood. A study states that the rate of adult suicide attempts occurs in a person who has 
experienced violence in the past. In addition, children with violence are more at risk for depression as adults and act

1153","5.4. Group Counseling Room  
A counseling room is essential for a rehabilitation center. This activity is the main session in the healing process. Since 
the user of the rehabilitation center are children with trauma, the design should bring a cheerful ambiance that 
optimized natural lighting from the windows, curve lines, and light colors. Group counseling is held for children to 
share their problems with other children while the therapist observed their behavior. Group activity requires a 
discussion table and chairs. Although it is not a formal discussion, a discussion table was necessary to maintain focus, 
and participants will take turns in expressing their feelings during this session. The group counseling room design is 
shown in Figure 7.

6. Conclusion  
The rehabilitation center for children’s survivors of violence provides psychological services, therapy to change 
negative thoughts into positive thoughts, as well as a means of playing and learning while undergoing psychological 
therapy. This facility is supposed to support the children to recover and overcome their trauma. The healing process 
is supported by facilities that involved circulation, ergonomic – anthropometric, and space requirements as aspects to 
consider in interior planning. A rehabilitation center is established by applying the concept of Healing with Earth.  
The eco-behavior concept is applied through the nature inspiration that is brought into the interior space to support 
the healing process. Natural colors are applied to walls, floors, and ceilings to create a spacious area. The ambiance 
of each facility is to support the user to feel at ease, relaxed, and calm during the rehabilitation program. Based on the 
concept the main facilities in the rehabilitation center for children’s survivors of violence are: (1). The playing area, 
(2). Planting Therapy room, (3). Art Therapy room, (4). Group Counseling room. Those activities are carried out 
together, aiming to restore children’s social skills. These rooms have an important role in the healing process during 
the rehabilitation program that presents a social environment. A sustainable human environment is achieved through 
the healing process objective to improve the quality of human life.

Abstract 
 
The evaluation and measurement of the impact and efficiency of supply chains in the management of social problems 
have become one of the areas that currently demands immediate attention, and that includes the implementation of 
humanitarian logistics actions; all due to the role played by factors such as economic performance and social 
sustainability that allow work on the design of government strategies and policies to address the problems faced by 
those communities in vulnerable situations. In this article, through a case study, a proposal is presented based on the 
identification of the vulnerable population with high levels of marginalization, analyzing the routes and infrastructure 
available for distribution, and calculating the real distances of movement between locations, to finally describe some 
models for locating facilities based on qualitative techniques. 
 
The objective of this work was to make a proposal for the design of a facility location model considering qualitative 
and quantitative variables as a basis for applying a facility location model in humanitarian logistics. The results of this 
proposal allow the identification and select common characteristics in the target population to design the distribution 
network, allowing to determine those strategies that should be implemented in humanitarian logistics. 
 
Keywords  
Supply chain, social sustainability, facility location problem, qualitative approach, quantitative approach. 
 
1. Introduction  
The constant development and growth of the population attend to a great variety of factors that converge around the 
events that guide said action; however, change is not always synonymous with well-being; considering that, just as 
advances arise, there are also lags that represent contradictory situations (Centro de Estudios, SF). 
 
In the case of social problems, meticulous management is required based on a series of analyses that make it possible 
to visualize the origin points, track the effects and thus put the design of strategies into action. Economic performance, 
social sustainability, government policies, and other factors help reduce complexity in distribution and supply chain 
management. A specific case is humanitarian logistics, which aims to improve the conditions of those populations that 
are in vulnerable situations ( The Logistics World, 2010) 
 
The management of social problems in supply chains is an issue that is becoming increasingly important; together 
with economic performance, social sustainability is a factor that is considered within the design of government 
strategies and policies (Granillo-Macias, 2021).

4. Results and Discussion  
Properly, humanitarian logistics still lacks structural schemes that facilitate carrying out the objective activities starting 
from any crisis that may arise; prevent a natural disaster by following the precautions and recommendations put to use 
of reason for the entire population in general or those caused by man that are visibly more controllable and that, under 
the monitoring of an adequate culture, can be eradicated unlike the natural ones that cannot be stopped; act 
immediately, given that the scenarios in which the crisis unfolds can manifest itself in one way or another, the teams 
must be prepared to work in the face of any variable that arises during the situation; and subsequently, recover as 
much as possible using the most significant possible efforts since the main objective lies in saving the most important 
number of lives and avoiding the number of losses and human suffering. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Considering that each time, the theme of distribution and supply becomes more and more remarkable in tasks designed 
to safeguard human life and the conservation of the environment; At the same time, attending to emergencies that 
derive from global problems such as poverty, hunger and the most recent, of course, the COVID-19 virus pandemic. 
Identifying common characteristics in the target population when designing the distribution network will allow 
determining those strategies that should be implemented in humanitarian logistics, given the broad field of opportunity 
that opens up before an in-depth study on the subject. For example, suppose a high degree of insecurity is detected in 
a community food. In that case, the strategy should include mitigating this social problem through different types of 
breakfasts with nutritional values necessary for this population. In future stages of this project, the integration of this 
proposal with a Vehicle Routing with Time Windows (VRPTW) model is sought, ensuring that deliveries are made 
promptly at the established times, which leads to an improvement in the level of service to the community. 
 
Jointly, humanitarian logistics has, for its sound, to provide the necessary means to act in any situation that represents 
a risk to life, health, or the environment, coordinating efforts and drawing up action plans that avoid an increase in 
human and material losses.

Abstract 
 
Analog signals are generally expressed by sinusoidal waves, where sinusoidal waves are the basis for all forms of 
analog signals. The important parameters of the sinusoidal signal equation are frequency (fn) and sample rate (fs) which 
are formulated with the equation x(t) = sin 2πfnt. The time parameter in the t variable in the sinusoidal equation is the 
duration of data collection for the sinusoidal signal. Frequency data in this study uses two models, namely the first 
model with a frequency value of f1 = 0.25Hz, f2 = 1.5Hz, f3 = 3Hz and the second model with a frequency value of f1 
= 0.25Hz, f2 = 2Hz, f3 = 4.25Hz. The sample rate (fs) used for both models is 8 Hz with a total time duration of 32 
seconds. The method used in transforming the time domain of a sinusoidal signal into a frequency domain is using the 
Discrete Fourier Transform. The results obtained for the first model, namely the reading of the frequency value of f1 
= 0.25Hz, f2 = 1.5Hz, f3 = 3Hz can still be read clearly. As for the second model, the frequency value of f1 = 0.25Hz, 
f2 = 2Hz, f3 = 4.25Hz can still be read. However, a new frequency appears between the frequency readings of f2 = 2Hz 
and f3 = 4.25 Hz, with a frequency value of f = 3.75Hz. This is because the use of the sample rate (fs = 8 Hz) is smaller 
than 2 times the signal frequency (2 fn). Therefore, the Nyquist theory in the case study of the second model does not 
meet the equation fs > 2 fn.

1. Introduction  
The important parameters of the sinusoidal signal equation are frequency (fn) and sample rate (fs) with the formulation 
x(t) = sin 2πfnt. The time parameter in the t variable in the sinusoidal equation is the duration of data collection for the 
sinusoidal signal. A sinusoidal signal is a function of time is a continuous-time signal. The continuous-time signal is 
converted into a discrete-time signal in performing signal processing. The sinusoidal signal in the time domain will 
be transformed into the frequency domain. Fourier transform is one of the methods that are often used in transforming 
the time domain to the frequency domain [Smith, 2003; Taylor, 2003].

1173","According to Nyquist theory, the sample rate fs required in analyzing the signal is twice the value of the structure 
frequency (fs ≥ 2 fn). From this theory to the specified structure frequency value, there is one structural frequency 
value that does not meet the Nyquist theory rules, namely the frequency of the third vibration mode, namely f3 = 4.25 
Hz. The value of the sample rate fs required in analyzing the signal is a minimum of 2 times the structure frequency, 
fn. In this case, if in a signal there is a structure frequency value of 4.25 Hz, then a sample rate value of at least 2 x 
4.25 Hz is required or equivalent to fs = 8.5 Hz. 
The use of a sample rate that is less than 2 times the structure frequency causes the appearance of amplitude peaks 
that are not the structure frequency. Generally, the peak of the amplitude will appear between the two frequencies of 
the structure, or commonly referred to as the shadow frequency. The existence of an image frequency in a frequency 
domain is called aliasing, namely the presence of a dominant amplitude peak value at frequency points with the same 
value or similar to the structure frequency. This will have an impact on difficulties and doubts in reading the frequency 
value of the structure on the frequency domain graph. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The conclusion of this study is shown as follows: 
• The use of sample rate (fs) is an influential factor in transforming data from discrete-time domain to frequency 
domain using Discrete Fourier Transform. 
• The sample rate (fs) used must be 2 times the value of the structure frequency, to get the real value of the structure 
frequency of the discrete-time signal. 
• The number of N data does not affect the frequency value. The smaller the number of N data used in data analysis, 
the amplitude value at the frequency points decreases.

Abstract  
 
The article proposes a new definition of environmental competencies that facilitates the incidence of the organization 
in the development of people, which will show the reduction of the harmful impact on the environment, sustainable 
competitive advantages, and better performance in the medium and long term because of an increasingly competent 
staff from an environmental point of view. In its elaboration, methods and techniques such as bibliographic review, 
induction-deduction, analysis-synthesis, and mathematics were used, making it possible to carry out an 
epistemological and semantic analysis of the state of the art of environmental competencies. Subsequently, by 
employing Ward's method and the squared Euclidean distance, with the standardized variable, we obtained, as a result, 
the confirmation of groups that assume the highest-scoring variables, namely: observable behavior, motivations, 
sustainable business culture, green skills, environmental values, environmental knowledge and environmental 
performance; and the elaboration of a definition of environmental competences.

(Ward, 1963) was used, according to Eszergár-Kiss and Caesar (2017), where it is achieved to unite the elements in 
clusters so that the variance within the clusters is minimized, from the average report obtained, three groups of higher 
scoring variables are generated (Table 7): the first with three variables (V1 observable behavior, V6 motivations and 
V8 sustainable entrepreneurial culture), the second with three variables (V11 green skills, V12 environmental values 
and V13 environmental knowledge) and the third group with one variable (V5 environmental performance). The 
definition of environmental competencies is constructed with the identification of these most representative variables.

The analysis of the above definitions is adapted to the characteristics of each country; however, the authors of this 
research consider it important to define environmental competencies as: the set of green skills (environmental 
knowledge, skills to protect and conserve ecosystems, intelligence to ensure sustainability and an integral 
environmental culture) and behavior favorable to eco-systemic sustainability based on values, motivations, feelings 
and beliefs among others, qualities that guarantee the willingness of people to preserve a favorable environment for 
the life of future generations, from their correct work performance in the organization. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Environmental competencies constitute a valuable tool to create people's capacities, knowledge, and skills that favor 
their environmental performance to face current changes. The analysis of the theoretical principles provides a 
significant perspective towards a transformation in the process of management by competency that favors the 
improvement of environmental competencies in organizations for a socially responsible performance towards the 
environment. 
 
Inquiring into the definition of environmental competencies was the result of a theoretical reflection and the use and 
application of tools to build a new definition that will help organizations meet their objectives and goals and increase 
their competitiveness and business efficiency from an environmental perspective. 
 
This study still has some limitations. First, the scope of the research has a current tendency to correspond to certain 
databases, which were examined from previous studies; however, the addition of available literature in books and 
conferences may yield a diversified view on definitions. Second, the studies can be expanded by examining the new 
definition of environmental competencies from the perspective of organizational for the environment and 
environmental values, which would improve the conceptual elaboration. Third, in the selection of variables, there may 
be other factors that influence environmental competencies, and their consideration may not be exhaustive. For future 
work, the temporal scope of the study will be expanded, and more representative variables will be selected to refine 
the current study.

Abstract  
 
The Industrial Revolution 4.0 encourages the implementation of e-procurement in the ERP system as a strategy to 
facilitate procurement transactions between buyers and suppliers. E-procurement 4.0 is designed to improve data 
transparency and accuracy. One of the features of the e-procurement application is the self-service e-supplier. This 
feature connects the post-procurement process between buyers and suppliers. Self-service e-suppliers are expected to 
be integrated with external systems such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). The object of research in this study 
is manufacturing companies and information technology companies in Indonesia that have used Oracle JD Edward. 
These companies are assumed to be internal customers and involve management departments and functions such as 
finance, procurement, and IT as the main users. This study uses the Quality function deployment (QFD) analysis 
method for the product development process based on the technical response generated by the QFD analysis. The 
collection of consumer needs data is grouped using an Affinity Diagram. The relative importance of each need is 
determined using the Mudge Diagram method. In 3 phases of QFD, this research produces technical responses and 
design specifications from self-service e-suppliers. Integrating the oracle’s JDE and E-Procurement for the feature of 
self-service e-supplier has been successfully performed, as based on the usability testing at the stage of the user 
acceptance test (UAT).

1. Introduction 
The Industrial Revolution 4.0 represents the development of information, technology, and social media networks that 
affect consumer perceptions of innovation, quality, diversity, and service delivery. It designs a future industry where 
technology will be integrated into a community (Ferrari et al. 2021). Nick et al. (2021) explained some several sectors 
in logistics will be affected, especially activities in predicting the machine usage, machine downtime reduction, the 
ERP System for product management optimization and service scheduling. It also affected to machine repairment and 
security, as well as information flow between production lines, business management, and supply chain management 
(Holubčík et al. 2021). 
 
The need for an application in a transparent information system that supports the requirement for information flow 
with third parties has triggered the trend of developing internet-based ERP support applications such as E-
procurement, an application that includes modules or features for E-supplier self-service (Hong et al. 2021). E-
procurement is an internet-based application that provides procurement process features including search, sourcing, 
negotiation, ordering, receiving, and post-procurement review (Bag et al. 2020). 
 
Enterprise Resource Planning is software for automating manufacturing processes from raw materials to finished 
products and is a development of manufacturing resource planning software (Wallenburg et al. 2019). The ERP system 
contains some applications that combine the functions of finance, manufacturing, human resources, and other modules 
that automate the business administration functions. ERP applications that are widely used today are SAP, Oracle, 
People soft, and JD Edwards (Ramkumar et al. 2019).

1193","(b) Gap Usability Testing Data Integration 
 
Based on Figure 4.a, the percentage of gaps in the testing scenario for user finance and suppliers is 2%. Therefore, it 
can be concluded that the application is adequate to meet the needs of users of finance and suppliers. The data 
integration scenario group has 18 test scenarios (Figure 4.b). The results show that there are 17 successful scenarios 
and 1 scenario that has obstacles. Obstacles that occur during the implementation of UAT will be included in the issue 
log of improving the e-verification feature to prepare for go-live. In addition to UAT, users are also given training to 
know how to use the application from login to transaction. 
 
The implementation process is carried out after the application development was complete. There are several stages 
in this process. The stages carried out in the implementation of e-verification are user acceptance test, user training, 
go-live, and post-implementation support. The user acceptance test is the process of determining whether the 
application complies with user needs and is feasible to use. This stage involves users from the finance department, 
procurement, and suppliers to find out the obstacles and issue logs that occurred during the trial. The user acceptance 
test is performed using a script that contains a process, the process will be executed by the user using the e-verification 
feature. Measuring the application success rate and integration of e-verification features is carried out by usability 
testing using gap analysis. The details are summarized in Table 3.

6. Conclusion  
Today, from identification of the procurement process at several companies in Indonesia has shown that there is an 
ineffective process of purchase order in the payment verification section. The main cause is unavailable verification 
process on the system and there are no features of two-way invoice and payment verification for buyers and suppliers 
provided by the ERP, the absence of SOPs for the implementation of payment verification, the ineffectiveness of 
manual work during verification, human error, invoice matching incompatibility. The design uses the method of 
quality function deployment, adjusts the specification, and improves the method, and facilitates the needs of e-

based on the technical response from the members of the development team. 
 
Based on the third phase of QFD, the relative importance of feature characteristics of the e-supplier self-service is 
obtained. Based on the relative importance, it determined the specifications of the self-service e-supplier with low and 
high priority status to be developed. Design proposals based on QFD results can be developed and implemented, in 
the e-procurement applications for the invoice verification process. Integrating the oracle’s JDE and E-Procurement 
for the feature of self-service e-supplier has been successfully performed, as based on the usability testing at the stage 
of the user acceptance test. For further research, as follow is necessary consideration: 
 
1. Selling the features of e-supplier self-service through participating in presales activities for external customers. 
2. Assessment for further usability testing on the final prototype of the self-service e-supplier. 
3. Analysis of the effect of implementing the self-service e-supplier on procurement performance

Abstract 
 
CV. XYZ is a company engaged in the manufacture of rice crispies as a complement to snacks. The purpose of this 
research is to determine problems in the company's supply chain process and how to mitigate existing risks by using 
the House of Risk (HOR) method which has 2 stages. The priority risk agents are determined in phase 1, and the 
effective actions to deal with the priority risk agents are determined in phase 2. Based on research results, there are 23 
risk events with 36 risk agents that cause these risk events. The results of stage 1 HOR, there are 12 priority risk agents 
that need to be mitigated. The results of the stage 2 HOR, there are 11 preventive actions that can be implemented by 
companies to mitigate 12 priority risk agents. Then, four preventive actions were taken: performing daily, weekly, 
monthly, and annual maintenance by machine operators and maintenance parties; repairing machines / machine 
service; adding production hours; and evaluating supplier performance. This paper was proposed to the company's 
main manager who is involved in the supply chain process, and it includes several mitigations to be implemented, so 
they can mitigate the risks that they face, which are expected to improve the company in the future.

1. Introduction 
Supply chain management is the most important thing that is found in all companies, especially companies engaged 
in production. A good supply chain process will certainly have a good impact on the company today and its reputation 
in the future. All companies are competing to continue to develop their supply chain activities in various ways and 
methods. Each company will make every effort to improve productivity, efficiency, fast, easy service, and continue 
to create various new innovations to stay ahead and survive in the market. In addition to productivity and efficiency 
that need to be improved, companies must also understand and know what consumers need. Improving customer 
satisfaction is the primary goal of all businesses in all industries. One way for businesses to develop and create 
innovations is to reduce supply chain risks. The company examines problems that arise during the manufacturing 
process and then analyses the improvement and prevention of risks that exist at all stages of production in order to 
prevent problems that now frequently occur from recurring in the future. Disruptions or risks must be managed and 
controlled so that businesses can continue to operate and grow. Supply chain risks have a long-term negative impact 
on businesses, and many are unable to recover quickly from these negative impacts (Magdalena and Vannie, 2019). 
 
Supply chain risk management model using the House of Quality (HOQ) and Failure Models and Effects Analysis 
(FMEA) concepts to develop a framework for managing supply chain risk, known as the House of Risk (HOR) 
approach. The HOR approach aims to identify risks and design treatment strategies to reduce the probability of 
occurrence of risk agents by providing preventive actions to risk agents. The risk agent or the cause of the risk is the 
causative factor that drives the risk. Therefore, reducing risk agents means reducing the incidence of several risk 
events (Fitrianto and Sudaryanto, 2016). CV XYZ is a company that specializes in supporting ingredients for snacks, 
specifically rice crispies. CV XYZ already has ISO 9001:2008 certification, indicating that it has a well-implemented 
quality management system. CV XYZ frequently encounters issues in supply chain activities, such as rice quality, 
which is not always satisfactory from suppliers. Another issue is that when demand rises, the company does not have 
enough raw materials because many companies compete for raw materials from the supplier, which has an impact on 
the production process. The company currently lacks a structured risk management system for identifying and 
mitigating risks, particularly in the supply chain function. According to the background information, CV XYZ can

The supply chain process at CV. XYZ has 23 risk events and 36 risk agents that cause risk events. Based on the results 
of the HOR stage 1 processing followed by making a Pareto diagram, it was found that 12 priority risk agents need to 
be mitigated in order to prevent risk events from happening again and continue with HOR data processing. Based on 
the processing of HOR 2 stage, 11 preventive actions can be obtained that can be implemented by the company to 
mitigate the 12 priority risk agents. Then, the cumulative 80% of all preventive actions are taken. First, carry out daily, 
weekly, monthly, yearly maintenance periodically by machine operators and maintenance parties (PA5). The second 
is to repair the engine / engine service (PA4). Third, the addition of production hours (PA8). Lastly, evaluate supplier 
performance (PA2).

Abstract 
 
The increasing number of COVID-19 cases has proven to have a significant impact not only in health area but also on 
the global economy. Tenants/restaurants are not allowed to accept dine-in customers if there are many confirmed cases 
of COVID-19 in their area. Delivery solutions can solve the dine-in problem, but customers face other problems that 
can occur when food/beverage is being delivered: the delivery person opens the package and eats it without the 
customer's acknowledge and some even spit on the food/beverage. These overwhelming incidents have an impact on 
lowering the level of customer trust to buy food/beverage from tenants/restaurants because COVID-19 is an infectious 
disease that uses air as a medium that attacks the respiratory system and can also spread through droplets of saliva. 
We developed an innovative delivery box solution called BeeDelibox (BettEr DELIvery BOX) which can keep 
food/beverage hygienic while been delivered to customers. Internet of Things (IoT)-based delivery box is specially 
designed to be opened only when the customer gives the authorization to delivery person to open it. This novel solution

1. Introduction 
World Health Organization (WHO) declares that the Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak is a global 
emergency. The increasing number of COVID-19 cases has proven to have a significant impact not only in health but 
also on the global economy (Rowe et al. 2021). Economic stability in Indonesia was affected and caused the economic 
and business activities to decline drastically (Susilawati et al 2020, Evans 2020). The Micro, Small and Medium 
Enterprises (MSMEs) sector such as food/beverage and other businesses that rely on crowds are the most vulnerable 
sectors to have an economic crisis because these businesses depend on the velocity of money from their sales (Fitriasari 
2020, Kiram et al. 2021). Their revenue has decreased drastically, some of them even reach 80% (Wijaya 2020). The 
restrictions on business activities, opening hour restriction, and social distancing protocol make MSMEs cannot do 
their activities like usual/normal (Yanti et al. 2020, Harlianty et al. 2020).  
 
If there are many confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the areas where MSMEs sell food/beverage, they are generally not 
allowed to accept dine-in customers (Widayat and Arifin 2020). This situation forces a shift in business or lifestyle 
from dine-in (on-site) which requires a face-to-face meeting to go online using a delivery. MSMEs that have 
businesses in food/beverage sector are trying to survive during these difficult times by doing online marketing so the 
customers can still order food/drink and deliver it to their place (Kiram et al. 2021, Prasetyo et al. 2021).

During the evaluation period, all the testing case has been done satisfactorily. Although several feedbacks from the 
testers were received. The feedback is mentioned as below: 
1. Integrated payment system is necessary to make the transaction process easier for the tenants. 
2. Bee Deli box can deliver several orders to different customers. 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
Sealed package at least can reduce the possibility of food/beverages from being eaten/spitted by the delivery person 
and being contaminated during the delivery process. An innovative delivery box solution called Bee Deli box (Better 
Delivery BOX) which contains pervasive technology can solve these problems. This innovative solution can keep 
food/beverage hygienic when it delivered to customer, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The IoT-based 
delivery box is uniquely built to be opened only when the customer gives the authorization to delivery person. This 
solution prevents the package from being opened/consumed without customer’s permission/acknowledgement and 
stay hygienic during delivery. 
 
For future work, a password-based door lock using a keypad door lock can be added to Bee Deli box. After the delivery 
person arrives at the destination but there is no internet connection on Bee Delibox, he/she can ask the customer for a 
passcode to be entered into the keypad door lock.

Abstract 
 
There has been a steady decline in sales of small and medium enterprises caused by the recent global occurrence. 
Viewing these current changes, it is clear that the sustainability of local businesses and their ecology are under threat, 
and that an entrepreneurial viewpoint would yield a deeper understanding and solution to this emerging problem. The 
purpose of this study is to find out and analyze the entrepreneurial orientation impact on business sustainability during 
COVID-19 pandemic. Structural equation modeling and the partial least squares model were used to present path 
modeling and multigroup analysis. Data have been collected during November–December 2020 when the pandemic 
was still at large. Using a sample of 101 young online business owners in Jakarta area, our results reveal that 
entrepreneurial orientation has a positive and significant impact directly on business sustainability and indirectly 
mediated by innovation performance. This study suggests that online small and medium entrepreneurs need to 
implement entrepreneurial orientation strategy and make an innovation for their products/services to make their 
business sustain.

1. Introduction 
The COVID-19 pandemic forces most of the governments all over the world to respond by refocusing their 
development programs on economic recovery and reorienting policies related to sustainability issues. The impact also 
reverberates through the Indonesian regional economies as the decline in sales of its small and medium enterprises 
presents a sizable effect on the business sustainability (Anggraeni 2020). 
 
The organizational phenomenon of entrepreneurial orientation has become one of the crucial considerations in 
fulfilling its promise as a driver of firm performance outcomes (Wales et al. 2011). Defined as a business process of 
a company that generates entrepreneurial decisions to create competitive advantage, entrepreneurial orientation was

1223",,"In addition, this study found that innovation performance has a positive and significant influence on business 
sustainability. It can be concluded that improving innovation performance can make a business survive. Currently, 
there are more and more competitors in e-business, which prompts young businesses to innovate in developing 
products or services and to be able to produce a sustainable business during this pandemic. 
 
Finally, increasing entrepreneurial orientation during this pandemic can encourage innovation performance in a 
company or business. During this pandemic, many small businesses have emerged, which means there are more 
players. Therefore, a good entrepreneurial orientation can be used as a reference in determining the innovations that 
must be carried out so that they can become a competitive advantage for these small and medium enterprises. 
 
The limitation of this study is restricted to only the dimensions of the variables. Future studies may focus on other 
factors that are likely to affect the sustainability of SMEs. Secondly, since the primary objective of the study was 
achieved through commonly known methods, future researchers may wish to employ advanced methods and 
techniques in assessing different dimensions of each of the variables.

Abstract 
 
Environmental literacy is one of the most effective ways to get a grasp of a society’s understanding of climate change 
and other related environmental issues. To understand the learning and behaviour changing process, this research 
looked at gender dynamics that differentiate men and women when perceiving environmental problems. The 
environmental literacy of East Java Millennials was grouped into nominal, functional, dan operational categories. The 
result showed that around half of the respondents (both genders) were in the intermediate level. The main difference 
was that more than a quarter of the women were in the highest literacy level, twice higher than the men’s percentage. 
It showed that in general women are more knowledgeable and willing to change their behaviour for saving the 
environment.

1. Introduction  
As humanity develops advanced technology and expands industries through various means, environmental literacy 
has become more important than ever. Awareness about climate change and sustainability are very vital because 
fundamentally, all sectors rely on the stability of our environment. Furthermore, humans are the main culprit of climate 
change. Based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, the global warming that is happening 
today is increasing at a very alarming rate that is unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years (Masson-Delmotte, V., 
P. Zhai, A. Pirani et al.). In developing countries such as Indonesia, many people still think that the centre of the 
environmental problem is merely about waste management. This perspective is inherently false because environmental 
issues are very complex, it consists of various matters such as green energy, sustainability, pollution, carbon emission, 
biodiversity, and many more. When people around the globe already talk about how to leave fossil fuels and shift to 
green energy, Indonesians still struggle to educate the citizens about the importance of putting litter in the bin. 
 
One of the first steps to increase people’s awareness about environmental issues is by creating campaigns and 
spreading information through social media and mass media. In this digital era, more and more people get information 
from electronic media and social media. Thus, all kinds of news, information, and content on those platforms are 
getting more powerful than ever. This media consumption pattern change is recognized by the government, NGOs, 
and other private companies. Nowadays almost all huge organizations have social media account, including those 
which profoundly talk about environmental campaigns such as Greenpeace, WWF, Ministry of Environment and 
Forestry, and many more. From a communication science perspective, it is crucial to understand our audience for

1233","People who were categorized into the operational group are very aware of environmental problems. They could explain 
very clearly about climate change, actively doing green behavior, evaluating their choices that may affect the 
environment, and promoting others around them (family and friends) to do so. They also understand many 
environmental terms such as anthropocentrism and ecocentrism. All respondents in this category are doing the right 
choice regularly. 
 
Based on the gender-wise data, 44% of women were in the functional category, both nominal and operational 
categories have the percentage of 26%. This data spread showed that almost half of the women are in the intermediate 
environmental literacy level. Around a quarter were in the nominal and the other quarter was in the operational 
category. Compared to the men’s result, 51% were in the functional category, 36% were in the nominal category, and 
13% were in the operational category. This comparison showed that the majority of Millennials (around 50% for both 
men and women) have intermediate environmental literacy levels, they were in the functional category. However, the 
data spread showed that women with the highest environmental literacy level - operational category are twice as much 
as men (26% compared to 13%). (Figure 2) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3 Men Environmental Literacy 
 
The difference in gender roles exists in all societies, this affects how men and women think and behave differently in 
various aspects of life, including decisions about environment-related issues. Much other research showed the same 
result, women tend to have better environmental literacy. This finding strengthens that tendency, the proportion 
between nominal and operational category in the two genders are quite significant. In the men’s data, only 13% were 
in the operational category, almost 3 times more were in the nominal category. This showed the disparity between the 
very literate and the least literate. (Figure 3). On the other side, in the women’s data, the spread is more even. In both 
operational and nominal categories, there were 26% respondents. In conclusion, there were more women with higher 
environmental literacy compared to men. 
 
Although women tend to be more literate than men, it is still possible to increase men’s environmental literacy in 
various ways. Previous research found that East Java millennials from both genders agreed that the most effective 
environmental campaigns are from social media in the form of visual and audiovisual content [15]. With these two 
findings, the government, NGO, and other private sectors could create a better strategy in making environmental 
campaigns targeting the millennials. From the content perspective, we could specifically target the majority of 
millennials in the functional category. Instead of merely trying to increase their knowledge, the emphasis should be 
on behavioural change.

1237","5.3 Proposed Improvements 
This research could be improved with more respondents from more cities. It is still limited to 100 respondents from 
East Java, further research could have respondents from several cities in Indonesia with more than 300 respondents. 
 
5.4 Validation  
Respondents’ answers were validated with further interview. Some with unique answers were contacted to be 
interviewed. By doing this interview, researchers could validate their answers and get deeper knowledge about their 
intentions and daily habit related to environmental literacy. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The majority of millennials in East Java have a moderate literacy level, almost 50% were included in the functional 
category. In line with other previous research, gender played a role in East Java Millennials’ environmental literacy. 
While the functional category is almost the same between both genders (48% for women and 51% for men), the 
operational category is very different. Only 13% of men were in the category while there were 26% of women. This 
result reflects Millennial’s condition in East Java, while the majority is quite familiar with environmental problems, 
many still do not have a good understanding of this issue (particularly for men millennials). This research result could 
be used as guidance in crafting environmental campaigns. As for further research, it is essentials to create an effective 
environmental communication model which could encourage the millennials to take real actions towards saving the 
environment.

Abstract 
 
As a tropical country, Indonesia is located below the equator and has sunshine all year round, the sun's rays have been 
used to dry wet clothes after people wash their clothes. However, with climate change happening, the current weather 
is difficult to predict. there are many chances of clothes getting wet due to unexpected rain. Especially now that people 
are busy at work and clothes are hung unattended. To solve this problem, many projects have been carried out, such 
as standalone clothes drying system, web-based drying clothes system, and the most advanced is clothes drying system 
that recycle AC heat waste as source of heat. In this paper, automatic clothes retriever (ACR) equipped with mobile 
apps-based monitoring system was made. Using the ESP32 as the main controller, LDR, rain sensor, limit switch, 
motor, fan and heating lamp, the ACR will automatically recognize the weather and retrieve-out or retrieve-in the 
hanger to protect clothes from unexpected rain. As a result, ACR managed to respond to weather change, by retrieve-
inning the clothes hanger in 14.82 seconds with 10 Kg clothes on it. During the experiment, the maximum energy 
consumption of ACR was measured, which is 0.289KWh in one hour with full load in the system.

1. Introduction 
As a tropical country, Indonesia only has 2 seasons, namely the dry season and the wet season (Rahayu et al. 2018). 
Located below the equator, making Indonesia have sunshine all year round. But with climate change, Indonesia's wet 
and dry seasons are becoming less predictable (Moediarta R and Stalker 2007).  
 
One of the ways for humans to protect their bodies from the weather is by wearing clothes and clothing become basic 
needs in human civilization. Clothes is used to protect the human body from the cold, heat and for health purposes. 
Every time clothes are used; they must be cleaned before they can be reused. This is to ensure that clothes are sterile 
and free from risky microscopic organisms (Sundi 2019). 
 
Indonesian people usually wash clothes and dry clothes consistently. In Indonesia, solar energy is used as an important 
source for drying clothes. But in the rainy season, in certain areas there may be no sun rays for 1 to 2 days. In addition, 
the busyness of the community to work to support their daily needs forces people to leave their clothes to dry without 
being observed. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
The purpose of this research is to make a tool (clothing dryer system) to dry clothes automatically using a 
microcontroller and connected to the internet through a mobile application. Users can monitor the condition of the 
drying system remotely. This tool can also solve problems that often occur and are often experienced by people who 
live in busy areas. 
 
The expected benefit of this tool is that it provides solutions to the community, especially among busy people in urban 
areas, such as Jakarta, who have little time to take care of their household needs. Users can also set the tool mode and

1240","wattmeter. Figure 5 is the graph of energy consumption conducted by full load ACR. With full load, ACR will 
consumed 0.289KWh in an hour or 2.89 KWh in 10 hours.  
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the experiments and measurements in this project, ACR can retrieve-in or retrive-out the hanger 
automatically depends on the weather conditions. The LDR and the rain sensor need to be set correctly in order to 
response the weather changes. Based on the experiment, the LDR on the ACR needs to be set to a digital value below 
1000 to indicate sunny conditions, and the rain sensor needs to be set to a digital value above 3000 to indicate whether 
it is a rainy day. While a digital value above 1000 on the LDR indicates dark conditions and a digital value below 
3000 on the rain sensor indicates a rainy day. ACR consumes quite much energy in maximum load, it is 0.289KWh 
in one hour. Different load on the hanger affects the time for ACR to retrieve-in or retrieve-out the hanger completely. 
Heavier load will make ACR takes longer times to retrieve-in or retrieve-out hanger completely. ACR can withstand 
more than 5kg, based on the experiment it is recommended that user only put 10Kg load on hanger, so ACR can 
retrieve-in the hanger completely in 14.82 seconds if the rain occur. By using ACR, user can dry the clothes, control 
the hanger, monitor temperature, humidity and movement of the hanger from their smartphone.

services, consulting education, and consulting financial that can help SME entrepreneurs manage both their business 
and their financial. The methods for the website creation process, is Descriptive Analysis with SPSS, and Quality 
Function Development (QFD) for the scaling and comparing between for rival companies such as Udemy or Skill 
Academy. Results from SPSS are respondents agree to have a consultation, business funding and online learning to 
grow their business for at least 1 year, with a little amount to spend. Results from QFD Method also gained that the 
most priority that customer wants is this website could helped to develop SME business, with the importance is 34%.  
Also, achieved the priority gained the most difficult to achieved and giving an online learning takes the highest cost 
and time. The use of the Wix website as a model in creating a website to ensure that every idea from consultation, 
online learning and business funding could be implemented to the customers.

1. Introduction 
A Business is one of the activities carried out between an individual and a group of people with individuals and a 
group of other people by creating something that provides value by making goods or services to gain profit while 
meeting people's needs. One of the biggest types of business is small and medium enterprises (SMEs). SME are the 
engine that drives world economies and the steppingstone to industrialization, both for developing and developed 
economies (Muriithi, D. S., 2017). Based on research by Samuel Muiruri (2017), SMEs contribute more than 50% of 
most African GDP and an average of 60% of employment. Today’s problem is a COVID-19 pandemic, it’s not affected 
only global health, but also economy. By looking at this problem, researchers plan to create a forum in the form of a 
website that accommodates entrepreneurs or businesspeople to provide motivation and provide consultation on how 
SME entrepreneurs manage their businesses properly and healthily. One of method that will be used for thus research 
was Quality Function Deployment (QFD). QFD is used to analyze what customer wants compared to the competitors.  
Based on the research of (Aman, et.al. 2017) to analyze customer requirements in maintenance management are truly 
dynamic in nature. The focus areas of attention for the customer (economic, social, safety driven, technical, 
maintenance efficiency and environmental issues) were adopted for estimating future customer requirements. Survey 
done by (Waseem Ahmed Abbasi, 2017) gain a fact that SMEs are backbone of economies, the government of each 
country should play vital role in protecting and creating such facilities for SMEs so that they can run the business in 
effective ways and grow to strengthen the economy.  Government needs to help improved knowledge, financial

clients can directly choose what service features they want, and later they will be directly directed to the website they 
want. Figure 4 shown Service menu of https://up-ukm.wixsite.com/business 
 
The display that we wanted to show is about news all around the world. This interface is not correlated with the results 
from questionnaire, but in the home screen where we put news about economy, business and even some YouTube 
videos, it may help businessman to find out what happened around the world. 
 
5.4 Validation 
Researchers develop a website that integrates three functions, namely business education, business consulting and 
SME promotion events to attract angel investors. Currently in Indonesia, it is common to find websites that have three 
separate functions each, namely: education web (such as a Ruang guru), a website for business consulting and a 
website for loan funds for SMEs from investors. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The first conclusion was based on the case analysis that occurred to SME entrepreneurs in managing their businesses 
during the pandemic from March 2020 until this research was conducted in July 2021, are most SMEs face declining 
incomes, lack of business knowledge of SME entrepreneurs, and difficulty in finding loan funds. The second 
conclusion is to provide solutions by creating a website which combines three functions, namely business consulting, 
online business knowledge training, and business promotion to facilitate capital loans from angel investors

Abstract 
 
The process of batik using canting is essential in producing handwritten batik and requires supportive space conditions 
because it requires skill and takes a long time to process. This study aims to see how the characteristics of space affect 
the process of batik with canting in a semi-open canting workstation in the traditional batik house of Go Tik Swan, 
Surakarta. Observations of changes in behavior and space characteristics are carried out within a specific time using 
the Time and Motion Study method. The characteristics of the space observed are lighting, thermal, and humidity. At 
14.00 WIB, the recorded natural lighting level was 562 lux, and the temperature was 35.3 0C, while the humidity 
factor was 55.7%. As a result, there was a shift of batik artisan from the front area to the back area of the workstation. 
Changes in batik artisan behavior occur due to thermal discomfort, which causes batik artisan to move to a lower 
temperature area with lower lighting levels. Therefore, it can be concluded that lighting and thermal factors directly 
affect the behavior of batik when doing their work.

1. Introduction 
Batik is an intangible world cultural heritage originating from Indonesia. The process of making batik, both written 
and stamped batik, requires skill and time (Ishwara et al. 2012). In producing a piece of batik cloth, a series of 
processes are required, starting from designing the motif, making the motif (klowongan) and filling the motif (isen) 
with canting and hot wax, making the background of the motif (nembok) on the cloth, dyeing or coloring and drying 
it (Kudiya 2019). This process is repeated until the desired result is achieved. The process of batik with canting is 
essential in the whole batik process because making batik with canting is the key to translating the design of the motif 
maker (designer) into a handwritten batik. The batik process with canting takes a relatively long time, according to

1256","sometimes causing direct exposure to the body of the batik artisan. In this case, the batik artisan can quickly adapt 
positionally by moving from place to place and re-adjusting its place in a circular layout without disturbing other batik 
artisan workspaces. 
 
As part of the Go Tik Swan batik workshop, the canting workstation can function adequately by optimally 
accommodating canting activities. The process of batik with canting is critical in a traditional batik business. If the 
process of making batik with canting occurs well, then the effort to produce traditional written batik may continue. 
This process will take place continuously to support the environment of the traditional creative industry. 
 
5. Conclusion and Future Research 
Based on the analysis of spatial factors, space characteristics, and the solar movement, it can be concluded that there 
is a relationship between thermal and natural lighting on changes in the behavior of batik artists, as follows. 
• 
The division of zones and functions of space in the Go Tik Swan batik house is well structured, namely 
residential and retail, performance areas, and workshops and services. The well-planned concept is also 
reflected in the division of workshop space following the production flow. A building is a pavilion type 
(semi-open), making the wall opening optimal for natural lighting and air circulation. A free-standing wall 
in the workstation area is an anticipation of natural factors such as sunlight. Thus, it can be concluded that 
the Go Tik Swan batik house is well planned. 
• 
The batik artisan work and sit in a specific order with the stove at the center. Because they have the same 
type of work, sharing the hot wax on one stove is common. Sharing and collaborating in traditional batik 
work continues to be preserved, one of which is through the canting process. 
• 
Environmental factors influence batik artisan's behavior. For example, when the thermal comfort of the batik 
artisan is disturbed, she prefers to move her position and distance (displacement) to a work area that is more 
acceptable to her body, even though the work area has a lower level of lighting than the previous work area. 
As a result, batik artisan is better able to adapt visually well. 
 
However, this research is only a case study taken and observed in a specific time frame. Thus, more in-depth 
observations and analyses of other cases are still needed in Go Tik Swan batik house or other batik houses with the 
same type of typical buildings. Nevertheless, this research is the basis for further research that explores the problem 
of batik artisan posture and the minimum required area for batik artisans in a canting workstation. This study also 
states that the Go Tik Swan batik house is a cultural heritage building those functions as a traditional batik workshop, 
aims to preserve the architecture and the intangible cultural heritage, traditional batik tulis process, and Batik Indonesia 
motif.

Abstract 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic has brought major changes in Indonesia, one of which is people's shopping habits. People are 
more likely to use digital media. Marketplace is the main thing that people use to shop, thereby reducing their mobility 
out of the house and for the practicality and safety of themselves and their families against the threat of the Covid-19 
virus. When viewed from the seller's side, there are also many sellers who have been affected by the Covid-19 
pandemic, especially SMEs in East Java, so that making Marketplace applications using Flutter technology can help 
people sell and market their products.

1. Introduction  
The Covid- 19 pandemic is happening all over the world, including Indonesia. This has changed habits in daily life 
or commonly referred to as the New Normal, and one of these changes is the change in shopping behavior. During 
the Covid-19 pandemic, people tend to use digital media, many media are used such as social media Instagram, 
Facebook, Twitter and others. However, the most important thing is the use of the marketplace for shopping, thereby 
reducing the mobility of traveling out of the house for practicality and personal safety, for himself and his family. 
This is also used by several small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Based on the results of the Kadata Insight Center 
(KIC) survey [1], 77% of 392 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) assessed that the marketplace played 
an important role in marketing products. As a result, they can survive to sell during the Covid-19 pandemic. As many 
as 75% of MSMEs consider the marketplace to play an important role in attracting consumers because it has many 
promotional programs, such as shipping costs, cashback, and discounts. Then, MSMEs who consider the marketplace 
important for selling because the transactions are safe and easy to use are 69% and 66%, respectively. 55% of MSMEs

Abstract 
 
Circular design, as part of the circular economy (CE), aims to reduce the environmental impact of the production 
process. The city is an activity center where various levels of production to consumption ends in generating wastes. 
Lasem had significant historical victory stories, in social and cultural. Lasem was and is still a place for multiethnic 
life with all its dynamics. Over time the functional, visual and environmental qualities in Lasem have degraded or 
deteriorated, related to the decline in economic activity, including the production of batik in the walled house. Circular 
city design strategy is needed to overcome the challenge. Historical buildings need to adapt, where the functions in 
buildings consider contemporary needs and can be used optimally without having to change or renovate on a large 
scale and wastes energy. One of the strategies is adaptive reuse, propose framework, criteria and scheme that expect 
to be an alternative solution to achieve sustainable architecture of cultural heritage buildings functionally, 
environmentally and economically. Methodology used in this research is literature study to get brief comparative 
studies to enhance the value of cultural heritage buildings through circular design approach.

Abstract 
 
Cities are consumed by daily routines and ever-changing complications. A peri-urban supporting area arose as a 
location to dwell throughout the construction of the city’s center. Because the distance between work and home is so 
great, many feel compelled to take a break. We believe that repurposing historic structures as a third place can meet 
the needs of escaping space. The study aims to explore the use of adaptive reuse at Gedung Filateli – Pasar Baru, 
which serves as a third place, as well as to analyze the adaptive reuse of Gedung Filateli as an anchor store for 
economic, social, and environmental sustainability. We combine qualitative research with a field survey of the 
location, which is used as a cafe, and literature data to support our analysis. Based on our consideration of the 
challenges, we suggest that adaptive reuse of heritage buildings is a solution that may be used to satisfy the needs of 
sustainable urban escape in dense locations. Through adaptive reuse, anchor stores are crucial for achieving economic, 
social, and environmental sustainability. Purposing to attract people, extend the life of the building, and rotate 
economic activity in a sustainable manner, branding is essential as part of adaptive reuse.

Abstract 
 
PSBN Wyata Guna is a foundation that aims to provide services for visually impaired people. The studied area 
functions to facilitate dining activities or its residents could take away their meal from the area. Dining rooms have 
high potential complexity and level of activity. While user movement is one consideration in the area, lack of treatment 
in the room causes frequent collisions and difficulties for the residents in finding directions. Stimulus is needed to 
support them to circulate through space, and the ones that play a high role are sound and layout. This study uses an 
experimental method to learn how the layout and sound stimuli influence them in circulation. Sustainable Material 
usage is underlined in response to the recent environmental issues. Distance, on the other hand, is not a determinant 
of the movement duration in the circulation. The most important for the visually impaired are instructions in the 
circulation and sound stimuli located at relevant points. The instructions could be furniture or other objects and should 
not inhibit circulation and be consistently distanced, while the sound is to convince them whether their direction is 
correct. This paper could be an allusion to further studies and an input for interior designers and architects.

1. Introduction 
In the estimated table for the number of people with visual disabilities and low vision by province processed by the 
Ministry of Health's Center for Data and Information and published in the Situation of Visual Disabilities and 
Blindness in 2014, West Java ranks third with the highest number of people with visual disabilities in Indonesia. West 
Java has a home for people with visual disabilities in Bandung, namely the Bina Netra Wyata Guna Social Institution,

Based on the visually impaired people’s behavior analysis, the most often user's habit is touching the edge of the 
objects in their environment, that is, to sense the shape. Accordingly, in the figures shown Figures 10 & 11) above, 
there are material differences placed in the furniture edges. For the safety issue, it is recommended to reduce the part 
of the furniture near the feet to minimize people from tripping on their feet. In the figures shown above, there are also 
recommendations for dining chairs. They are intended for 2 users, with the automated movement of the backrest every 
time they are occupied. The feature is meant to help visually impaired people to know if the seating was occupied 
without the need for them to touch it. From the experiments that have been carried out, the following results were 
obtained: 
 
● 
In condition A which has a sound on the right side of the door, persons with visual impairments tend to move 
towards the right side of the door and cross the empty circulation without hesitation. Meanwhile, in condition B, 
which does not have a sound at the door, people with visual disabilities tend to move towards the left side of the 
door closest to the furniture they use as a guide in walking. 
 
● 
For the dining room conditions in PSBN Wyata Guna, the distance does not give too much difference in the time 
spent by each person with visual disabilities. There are several cases that have a considerable time difference, but 
this is followed by the layout of the furniture, sounds, and experiences of everyone. 
 
● 
The area that is most visited is the area closest to the serving table or entrance because this area is the easiest to 
access for people with visual impairments, so most of them will go to this nearest area first. The pattern carried out 
by each respondent tends to be the same, namely, after taking food from the serving table, they will go straight to 
the nearest area. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Design requirements are obtained to proceed to the layout design stage of the Wyata Guna PSBN. The serving area is 
closest to the entrance. If it has more than one entrance, it should have the same orientation as each door. The dining 
area is on one side of the room and has sufficient circulation to get in and out of the dining table. If it is in the middle 
of the room, it should be accessible from all sides and not be an obstacle for people with visual impairments in carrying 
out movement in the dining room. Circulation areas should have directions for persons with visual impairments near 
important areas. Sound sources should not be installed adjacent to each other, but they should be located in relevant 
areas and are far enough from each other, for example, placed on door A which is on the west, and door B which is on 
the east. If setting up an interaction area, it should be on a route that is often traversed by large crowds. Use floor

1293","patterns with different textures between areas, and also give floor patterns that are the main circulation in the dining 
room. 
 
In addition, based on the results of the analysis that has been carried out, it can also be concluded that the use of 
materials in interior elements can help people with visual impairments in knowing the location and finding directions 
in the PSBN Wyata Guna dining area. According to the existing theory, it can also be seen that some materials that 
can be used in the PSBN Wyata Guna dining area ideally use materials that apply natural principles of sustainable 
materials. Because basically humans are more familiar with things that are always around them. The use of sustainable 
materials in the PSBN Wyata Guna dining area is applied with a biophilic design approach with consideration of 
human nature, which is more familiar with things that are always around, in this case, the natural surroundings. 
However, we must still pay attention to how the texture of the applied material will affect how people with visual 
impairments perceive the area.

Abstract 
 
Placemaking are the complex process in cognitive, behavioral and emotional aspects in one’s mind. The physical 
space has primary role to deliver direct placemaking experience. Since technology play a role in almost every aspect 
of our life, digital space is merely closer to daily activity, including ‘going places’. Hybrid space comes in between 
the physical and digital spaces. When it comes to digital placemaking, there are noticeable highlighted aspects in terms 
of gaining efforts to sustainability. Heritage buildings and landscapes have a great potential support to achieve 
sustainable built environment that people can experience. This research aims to describe the possibilities of digital 
placemaking approaches and aspects in terms of addressing sustainable design in the heritage environment specially 
through hybrid space. The methodology chosen is literature studies about digital placemaking and comparative studies 
about possibilities of implementing sustainable urban design and architecture in heritage building and environment. 
Contribution expected through this research is to preserve the richness and values in architectural style and elements 
in heritage building and environment to achieve resilience and sustainability in social, economy, cultural and 
environmental aspects through digital placemaking.

Abstract 
 
Purpose – The paper aims to explore the co-existence between environmental sustainability and business profitability 
based on the Ecological Modernization Theory. The study seeks to reconstruct theory through inductive analysis. 
Methodology – This research uses a qualitative approach with grounded theory method. Data was collected through 
in-depth interviews with five young ecopreneurs engaged in the restaurant business sector. Data collection was done 
in Greater Malang region where most informants originate and live. The research subject or informants were selected 
purposively in which certain criteria have been determined previously by the researcher. After conducting a data 
validity procedure, the data was then analyzed by theme and interactive analysis technique. Findings – The results of 
this study strengthen the Ecological Modernization Theory. However, the research findings identify the significant 
role of Social Modeling. This study also formulates three important concepts related to “Influencing Factors, Inhibiting 
Factors, and Strategies” that underlie the co-existence of environmental sustainability and business profitability. 
Research limitations – Due to the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, 
researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further. Practical implications – The paper discuss 
implications for ecopreneurs in developing strategies to minimize waste while at the same time increasing business 
profit.  Originality/value – This paper fulfills an identified need to investigate how entrepreneurial profit orientation 
could align with actions toward environmental sustainability in the context of restaurant industries in Indonesia.

1. Introduction  
In Indonesia, the waste problem becomes one of a critical environmental issue that needs attention, since waste 
management has not been taken seriously. Data shows that there are 175,000 tons of waste per day produced by the 
Indonesian population, and only 7.5% can be recycled or made into compost (Sugiarti 2021). This means that 92.5% 
of the waste produced by the Indonesian population is still not managed properly. Garbage, which mostly ends up in 
landfills, can harm human health and environmental sustainability.  
 
Several opinions summarized by McEwen (2013) consider human economic activity to be one of the main causes of 
waste problems and environmental degradation. This is because economic activity requires a very large amount of 
material and energy inputs, as well as producing a very large amount of waste. Economic business activities have an 
enormous responsibility to contribute to environmental saving. Volery & Thierry (2002) claim that in recent decades, 
economic development has been carried out without considering its impact on the environment. In the same direction,

1298","This finding adds a new component to Ecological Modernization Theory. The role of Social Modeling in the 
implementation of environmental sustainability management can be considered as the new component in this theory. 
This finding is also in line with the concept of Social Cognitive Theory which was coined by (Bandura, 2005) that a 
person's behavior can influence and be influenced by personal factors and the social environment. Humans (in the 
context of this research are the entrepreneurs) can learn through observing and imitating the behavior of others (the 
ecopreneurs), even without reinforcement. However, when this observation (learning by watching what other people 
do) is combined with reinforcement (feeling the benefits of changing behavior), then the power of learning is getting 
stronger.  
 
In addition, these findings also show negative results regarding the role of the government as a regulator. However, 
the research findings show that even though the government's role is seen as not optimal, environmental sustainability 
management practices can continue if there is a contribution from society, the benefits are felt, and there is a clear 
strategy. The social environment involvement can be in the form of showing examples or becoming a partner,  
The results of the study also identify the importance of enriching learning content on environmental management and 
maintenance by educational institutions, especially institutions that teach business/entrepreneurship. Incentives to 
encourage inventions and innovations in waste treatment need to be enlarged and become a priority in the development 
of the national economy.  
 
This study also highlights the importance of formulating a clear strategy from two parties, from the ecopreneur side 
regarding waste management, and from the consumer side, who needs to be educated to increase their awareness and 
concern for the environment. If there is an imbalance of strategies (only one of them works), then the management of 
environmental sustainability and business profitability cannot run in harmony, they cannot support each other.  
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Since the scope of this research is specific to the context of restaurant business, the research findings cannot be 
generalized. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the co-existence of environmental sustainability 
management and business profitability persists in different industrial context, and different cultural communities. 
 
5.4 Validation  
The criteria used in qualitative validity and reliability, according to Daymon & Holloway (2008), include relevance 
or 
transferability, 
credibility 
(trustworthiness), 
authenticity 
(confirmability), 
and 
dependability. 
Relevance/transferability refers to external validity. This research must be able to answer the question: is this research 
useful for solving the informant's problem. The transferability criteria are obtained from the ability of the results of 
this research to be related to the academic literature and the wider context, specifically entrepreneurial behavior. 
Authenticity can be achieved when this research is carried out fairly and away from researcher bias. The researcher's 
bias was tried to be minimized by epoche and bracketing approach, that is to leave all assumptions and knowledge 
possessed by the author and act carefully in carrying out the research. Confirmability can be achieved if the research 
findings can answer the research objectives that have been determined. Dependability of qualitative research refers to 
the clarity of analytical procedures that are consistent and can be used by subsequent researchers. 
Credibility/trustworthiness refers to internal validity. Validity is an effort to check the accuracy of research results. 
Validity in qualitative research is carried out during and after the research results are obtained. The validity of data in 
qualitative research emphasizes more on the process, not on verification as used in quantitative research (Creswell 
2013). Furthermore, Creswell provides 8 validity strategies and states that at least researchers can use 2 of 8 strategies 
which include: prolonged engagement and persistent observation, triangulation, peer-reviewed, refine working 
hypotheses, clarifying researcher bias from the outset of the study, member checking – participant checking, rich and 
thick description, external audits. In this study, the validity of qualitative research was carried out using member 
checking and peer review.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The results of this study strengthen the Ecological Modernization Theory which states that it is possible to encourage 
economic growth by giving a higher priority to environmental sustainability, as co-existence. The research findings 
identify the important role of Social Modeling in the effort to harmonize environmental sustainability and business 
profitability. The role of the social environment in giving an example, can inspire and ignite changes in entrepreneurial

1305","behavior to be more concerned with environmental sustainability, and bring forth ecopreneurs with new environmental 
technology innovations.  
 
This study also formulates three important concepts related to “Pushing Factors, Inhibiting Factors, and Strategies” 
that underlie the co-existence of sustainable management and business profitability. The driving factor consists of the 
role of the social environment and the perceived benefits in the form of financial, operational, social, and moral 
benefits. Inhibiting factors include poor environmental management education, low involvement of the government, 
limiting waste processing innovation, low environmental awareness of the society. Therefore, for encouraging social 
movements toward environment sustainability, entrepreneurs are suggested to implement both waste management 
strategy as well as consumer education strategy in managing their business. Universities are also encouraged to raise 
awareness toward environment sustainability in their entrepreneurship curriculum. It is of high importance to highlight 
that economic and environmental performance should go hand in hand in managing business sustainability.

system in the Philippines. Increasing water demand has triggered an initiative to look for an alternative water supply 
providing sustainable water management. The paper aims to assess the rainwater harvesting potential and storage 
requirement for the operation of building XYZ. Rainwater harvesting potential for the building will be quantified 
using a 10-year worth of rainfall data from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services 
Administration (PAGASA). The average annual rainfall in Metro Manila is 2785.6 mm. Building XYZ has a roof area 
of approximately 500 sqm. The researcher shall identify the rainwater harvesting potential of the residential building 
XYZ located in Metro Manila Philippines and conduct a water demand forecast using a naïve forecasting model. The 
water demand of building XYZ was forecasted by utilizing a naïve forecasting method that resulted in an absolute 
percentage error of 16.23%. The rainwater harvest could provide 15 toilet flushes during the driest season and 320 
toilet flushes during the rainy season in each unit of building XYZ.

1. Introduction  
 
The reduction of water quality in the Philippines gives a huge impact on human livelihood because of the rapid increase 
of the country’s population, continuous urbanization, and industrialization (WEPA, n.d.). People who are living in the 
urban area are now having difficulty gaining access to sufficient clean water for everyday use. Other than human 
activities contributing to the water crisis of the country an unforgiving phenomenon is continuously giving a threat to 
the community which is the El Nino.  According to Water Roam (2020), the unusual warming of the water surfaces 
of the eastern Pacific Ocean causes droughts and severe rainstorms. As most of the cities develop and the limited

4.5 Potential Use of Rainwater  
 Building XYZ is an 84-unit residential building, and each has 5 water fixtures and 4 water fixtures provided for 
watering the landscape outside the building. All of the units have identical water fixtures each is designed to have one 
water closet with 10 liters (0.01 cu m) of flushing, two wall faucets, one showerhead, one lavatory faucet, and one 
kitchen countertop faucet.  
            
The rainwater harvested is considered for non-potable water use as it can be contaminated because it may absorb air 
pollutants and contaminants from the roof area or storage posing general hazards to be found in the rainwater 
(Struck,2011). The non-potable water can be used for water flushing, and landscape watering of building XYZ. 
Rainwater harvesting is more beneficial in cities that highly consume potable water as it will generate savings in the 
water bills of the residents (Ghisi et al 2015). The month of February has the lowest average monthly rainwater harvest 
of 12.31 cu m where each unit can save almost 15 toilet flushes per month while in the month of August the rainwater 
harvest of 286.80 cu m can save 320 toilet flushes per month or 10 flushes per day. The building XYZ has 87.3 square 
meters of the landscaped garden, and the area is covered with bermudagrass and several types of plants. According to 
Microdips (2019), plants need 2.5 cm of water per week making 2.18 cu m of water needed to water the gardens of 
building XYZ. Harvested rainwater in the month of February would be sufficient for watering the landscaped garden.  
 
5. Conclusion  
The rooftop rainwater harvesting in building XYZ show very good potential in relation to the average rate of 
precipitation in Metro Manila. Approximately 1405.31 cubic meters of water can be harvested in building XYZ with 
its 593.52 square meters of roof area. The month of February shows the lowest rainwater harvest as expected because 
of the summer season in the Philippines while the month of October has the highest rainwater harvest because it is in 
the middle of the rainy season. The rainwater harvest for building XYZ is considered to be a non-potable type of water 
that can be used for toilet flushing and landscape irrigation of building XYZ.  
 
The water demand of building XYZ was forecasted by utilizing a naïve forecasting method that resulted in an absolute 
percentage error of 16.23%. The forecasted water demand was compared to the average monthly rainwater harvested 
and evidently, it cannot wholly support the water demand of the building rather it could complement the needs that 
could involve non-potable water. The rainwater harvest could provide 15 toilet flushes during the driest season and 
320 toilet flushes during the rainy season in each unit of building XYZ. Also, the harvest would be

Abstract  
 
The aquaculture industry in Peru, in recent years, has been growing by 14.4% between 1998 and 2018, and has become 
popular among small entrepreneurs due to the climate conditions and extensions of water offered by the Peruvian 
territory. Feeding represents between 40 and 60% of the total costs and this figure is increases by 80% in small-scale 
or family productions, therefore, there is a need to implement an adequate feeding program for aquaculture. The 
objective of this research is to develop a linear programming (LP) model that allows the optimization of the fish feed 
formulation by manufacturing a balanced meal using locally available inputs. Authors like V.O. Oladokun and A. 
Jhonson (2012) have managed to make a similar model in the poultry sector, achieving a 9% reduction in feed costs. 
Information was collected from scientific articles and journals on nutritional content, ingredients, and alternatives fish 
feed consumption; the cost of the ingredients has been obtained using current market information. The mathematical 
model contains 10 decision variables and 11 restrictions, which was conducted with Solver on Excel. The fish farm 
used in the case study allowed us to collect the necessary information for the resolution of the model and the analysis 
of the optimal results. The optimal solution of the PL model reveals a reduction in feed costs with the new formulation 
compared to the feed used by fish farmers. The analysis of the optimal results allowed us to see how the total feed 
costs could be affected by the implementation of the sensitivity analysis with the Monte Carlo simulation.

1. Introduction 
During recent years, aquaculture in the Latin American and Caribbean region has been growing in production quantity 
by 8.3% per year between 2000-2020, where the cultivation of species such as shrimp, Atlantic salmon, tilapia from 
the Nile, Chilean mussel, and rainbow trout, in descending order, together contributing 80.4% of the volume of 
regional production. 
 
At the national level, despite its diversification efforts, aquaculture is oriented to the cultivation of few species, 
however, the region of San Martín (high jungle) stands out as the national leader in fish farming in the production of

The results shown in the dual prices of the surplus resources (fat, lysine, methionine+ cystine, calcium, salt, 
phosphorus, ash, and energy) are zero. This means that there will be no economic benefit in allocating more or less of 
that resource; nonetheless by increasing a unit in any other resource will cause a change in the objective value. For 
example, if a unit increases in the total quantity of protein value, the objective value will increase by 1.8492 withing 
the range of 0.5098 ≤ RHS 0.8210.  
 
4. Discussion 
From the results obtained, it is evident that there are many products that can be obtained locally at an affordable price 
for the preparation of feed for tilapia in the separate phases of the life cycle compared to the purchase of a balanced 
commercial product and that help to obtain a significant reduction in total cost production of this species. On the other 
hand, it is important to consider that the prices of inputs vary each season, added to global problems such as the crisis 
in Ukraine, where the supply of some products can influence their costs, therefore the importance of an analysis of 
sensitivity and local food alternatives present in this research. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Aquaculture is a growing industry in Peru that will be particularly important as a source of healthy food and to avoid 
the destruction of natural ecosystems. This study was able to improve the feed cost of tilapia fish farms with local 
inputs and the assistance of a liner modelling software. Tables show the nutritional values of all the inputs used and 
considered in the fish feed formulation; most of them are quickly found in Peruvian territory. It is showed that there is 
a considerable decrease in feed costs while using the feed formulation model and your own food than buying it from a 
seller or company.

Abstract 
 
Arboviral diseases are those transmitted by arthropod vectors with significant representation in the high burden of 
disease in the world, including the Americas. Therefore, it is important to focus efforts on the surveillance of vectors 
and the diseases they transmit, in order to implement preventive strategies to mitigate their impact on the population. 
Considering that, Colombia is a country with suitable conditions for the presence of these diseases, and Santander is 
one of the departments with the highest presence of dengue cases. The purpose of this research is to develop a 
framework for the prediction of dengue cases per week in five municipalities in the department of Santander, 
Colombia, using rainfall as a predictor variable. An important part of the work is the comparison of Machine Learning 
models for prediction, such as the visualization of the models using the Power Bi tool (Microsoft) with embedded 
code Python and R. Different ML models were implemented, here only three models are presented: ARIMA, Recurrent 
Neural Networks (RNN) and Neural Networks with Long- and Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The results show 
satisfactory predictive accuracy that can help different government entities in the public health decision process.

Abstract 
 
The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on supply chain logistics is on a global scale. This impact extends to the smaller, 
family-owned businesses, whose owners often rely on for their day to day living expenses. This study explores the 
current state of existing literature relating to supply chain management in restaurants on a global scale from the last 
12 years. A distinction is made on the pre-Covid-19 period (2010-2019) and the years of its biggest impact (2020-
2022) to better identify the evolution of the focus of studies and the strategies implemented to counteract the impact 
of the pandemic. The bibliometric analysis will be performed on scientific source database websites, such as Scopus 
and Web of Science, using keywords to identify relevant documents. VosViewer will be used to visualize the 
bibliometric network between authors, keywords and publication periods.

1348","5.6 Discussion 
It is evident that the first period had a greater number of publications, since more years are considered in the search 
range, however the second period obtained more publications per year, but less than 50% of them are related to COVID 
19 since it is a recent topic and the results of the impacts are not really obtained immediately, as it will be in a few 
years. It was also observed that many of the authors with more publications in the first period, decided to publish in 
the second period, enriching their previous publications with updates about their study with the effect of a pandemic. 
The institutions with the highest number of publications in the restaurant supply chain in both periods are concentrated 
in the USA and China. This could be a result of multiple factors such as population density or the fact that both 
countries are among the largest exporters and importers in the world. The journals where the collected articles were 
published belong mostly to the first quartile and all have high citation values for multiple topics. This is indicative of 
the relevance of the articles to the topic of food logistics. 
 
With respect to the analysis of co-authorship for the most part, the studies come from circles of researchers from the 
same institution or country. Within these, the studies conducted in Asian countries are those that involve the 
participation of more authors. While research conducted in China involves 5 authors from the same circle, European 
research involves a maximum of 3 authors. Once the Covid-19 period is entered, due to the lowering of the limitation 
on the number of studies to be taken into consideration, the density of the bibliographic network becomes higher. 
However, the same trend present in the 2010-2019 period of isolated creation by country can be seen. While this is 
not an exceptional occurrence, a study with authors from multiple countries and contexts to address the pandemic 
would be a possibility to take the reactions of different socioeconomic realities to a pandemic into consideration when 
developing future logistical solutions. This situation could be considered idyllic, but it would not be surprising if such 
a global study were to be conducted in the future or even currently underway. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Science and research in the restaurant supply chain sector is important for the economic development of a country, 
which is reflected in better utilization of productivity and implementation of technological advances in countries such 
as the USA or China. This study was able to identify and show the differences in scientific research on the restaurant 
supply chain before and after the pandemic in internationally recognized databases. It showed that the number of 
publications has gone from less to more in relation to a global event with high impact in recent years. and is expected 
to continue to do so in the coming years: However, there is no evidence of a large number of publications in relation 
to the restaurant supply chain to Covid 19. It shows that research published in both periods shows different approaches 
in relation to current trends.

Abstract 
 
Since 2020 there has been a continuous study of Portfolio Management in the Technical High School Course of 
Electronics in IFSP Sorocaba in the course of Integrated Project. In 2021 the second stage was developed with the 
participation of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), that often do not possess the knowledge, the manpower 
nor the techniques to bring to life their projects. This paper continues the research of 2020, with the lessons learned 
on that case study cycle presenting new ideas to overcome the difficulties and obstacles noticed by the project teams 
during that year and by the portfolio management team, with the purpose to increase the overall performance by 
meeting the NGOs expectations and to achieve better results focusing on solving the 2 biggest issues of 2020 – 
communication and NGO selection. At the end of the year the objectives were achieved, however new issues arose 
during the 2021 cycle – both new problems and new variants of existing problems – that were not expected. As a 
conclusion the 2021 edition showed an increase in performance of the individual projects and the portfolio 
management.

1. Introduction 
Since the 3rd industrial revolution, in the 1950´s, the attention for the fields of scientific knowledge and productions 
engineering methods has been intensified (Slack et al, 2009). As it in the production side, management is found in 
several areas of knowledge, being of supreme importance the level and efficiency of education in this particular subject 
(Dias, 2000).  
 
This study is a continuation of a three-year project based on PMI´s (Project Management Institute) PMBoK (PMI, 
2018) that will finish in 2022 with Social Entrepreneurship. With previous results showed and discussed by Lima and 
Caldana (2020), there has been positive and successful results in 2020 with several lessons learned in that year and 
the main objective of the second stage of the project that this paper will cover is to use that knowledge from the 
previous research cycle and build the knowledge to improve the efficacy by doing the necessary literature review on 
the failures and issues faced by the students in the last cycle and providing new methods to overcome and eliminate 
those problems. 
 
According to Link (2020) working with public projects needs constant attention to critical factor to achieve the 
necessary success, which normally means that they are susceptible to risk, both internal and external during its 
planning and execution, and as such the Project Manager and the Portfolio Manager roll is to find solutions for such 
obstacles. 
 
It is necessary to note that the execution of the 2021 projects and the Portfolio management still occurred using remote 
teaching and the technologies that would allow for communication in that format due to the pandemic of COVID-19 
and the known restrains it brings due to social distancing. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
As stated before, this paper has the objective to implement and observe the changes made in the both the planning 
process as well as the execution and monitoring stages of a project development as defined by PMBoK (PMI, 2018), 
especially considering the lessons learned during the execution of the 2020´s projects. The main issue found by Lima

1359","entrepreneurship was not going to be adopted, the next set would be to select students for the groups based not only 
on their individual interests but also on social and interrelationship factors. 
 
Another proposed improvement for 2022 will be a reference guide for opening an NGO, as the documentation is 
diverse and will vary depending on the type and size of the proposed organization.  
 
6. Conclusion 
Regardless of the situation, change or preparation the management of Portfolio will always experience new and 
unexpected problems and issues as showed in section 5.1. The human factor cannot be isolated nor ignored from the 
decision-making process and the longer a Portfolio Manager has contact with the problems the more experienced and 
better planner he or she will become. This is an important lesson learned in the two years this project has been running 
so far and has helped the Portfolio Management team to develop. The lack of communication caused by a lack of 
leadership (in project 2) and the lack of the ability to get all students to embrace P5 were the major factors that 
contributed to the failed individual projects. 
 
The new research conducted in 2021 proved effective in solving the follow-up issue, with only 5,33% of activities 
facing delays. As for the selection criteria of the NGOs the scores were better considering the 2020 cycle, showing 
improvement, however it was possible to determine that even though it did improve in 2021 it is still one of the major 
obstacles in the 3-year project and thus this is the risk factor that will be removed from the 2022 cycle when the 
students and the Portfolio team will face a new challenge of Social Entrepreneurship as described in section 5.5. 
 
In the face of the adversities in 2021, the roll of the Portfolio Manager when considering projects with NGOs should 
be to plan focused not only on the theory of PMBoK (or other project management theory), but also in organizational 
structure and especially in the human factors and relationships between the members.

Abstract 
The objective of the research was to collect information on the research variables: Machine Learning and Human 
Resource, through the literature review to generate a contribution to the scientific community and to future research. 
As part of this research, the Prism Method was more didactic and orderly for the search for information. Through the 
selected criteria, it was possible to obtain 214 articles related to the research topic that sought to answer the questions 
posed in the introduction of this work. The problem was duplication of information in the two databases. In this sense, 
the Excel program was used to solve this problem. The paper is based on the collection of information through a 
systematic review, which includes a bibliometric software such as VOSviewer.

1. Introduction. 
The notion of “Human Resources” has given way to other terms such as “Human Management”, to separate the 
“subject” from the notion of “resource”, which it shared with technology, raw materials, and financial capital. 
Likewise, to vindicate the complex nature of human beings, as a unit of the social systems that make up companies 
(Dorado et al., 2019). The area of Human Resources in a company is well known because it is responsible for selecting, 
hiring, training, motivating, and managing personnel to meet the objectives of the organization; Its functions include 
promoting innovative, proactive, and risk-oriented behavior, which will lead to greater innovation results and a greater 
competitive advantage for the company (Canet et al., 2020). Human resource management has evolved from the 
division of labor based on technical skills. A knowledge of technology and procedure contributes to the exchange and 
development of cognitive, affective, and communicative skills of individuals (Zavala-Villalón & Frías, 2018). It is 
pertinent to point out that the GTH is seen as a system in which the employees within the company are seen as a 
resource that must be constantly improved from an innovative and dynamic vision (Blanco-Ariza & Vega, 2019). The 
processes through which knowledge is created and managed, and therefore human talent, constitute the source of 
dynamic capabilities and sustainable competitive advantage (Barrios et al., 2020). Likewise, the management of 
human talent makes it possible to dynamize the work environment in companies to meet the demands of the labor 
market with personal care (Acurio et al., 2020). In addition, it collectively predicts and manages change, to create 
lasting strategies that ensure the direction of the development of the organization and its future (Ramirez et al., 2019). 
In the era of data science and big data analytics, people analytics is an alternative to reduce attrition for organizations 
and HR managers by attracting and retaining talent (Yahia et al., 2021). 
 
From the human resources management model, it is necessary to understand the processes of incorporation 
(recruitment and selection), the processes of development (training and careers) and compensation, and the 
remuneration system of the organization (assessment and compensation) (López et al., 2018). Human resources 
processes are evolving very quickly, and it is advisable to involve other points of view to identify areas of opportunity 
for their application, such as identifying the preferences and expectations that employees have regarding benefits and

Abstract  
 
Effective and efficient organizations use their asset management to resolve competing priorities and ensure that long-
term benefits are not sacrificed for immediate needs. Implementing ISO 55001 allows organizations to lead their 
operations orderly, creating value and improving their results and income. In Brazil, however, the standards are still 
little known and used by companies. On the ISO website about organizations certified with the 55001, only eight 
Brazilian companies appear on the list. Regardless that linking asset management to corporate strategy is relatively 
new, Brazilian companies have not been accumulating achievements with this standard. Therefore, through a survey 
with experts and open interviews with consultants in the area, this study seeks to answer why asset management 
standards have little adherence in Brazil. This research suggests that the main reason for the standards' non-accession 
is that the Brazilian companies have a culture of immediacy. Any process that will generate results in the medium and 
long term is not always a priority since the daily demands in the short time are very high, taking up all the employees' 
working time. So, the companies cannot deliver sustainable results.

1. Introduction  
Studies have shown the asset management efficiency in companies from different sectors. Implementing ISO 55001 
allows organizations to handle all their operations systematically. At the same time, this work perspective provides 
the data needed to improve asset operations and continually analyze the causes of failures. Better asset performance 
enhances the organization's ability to offer more reliability and higher quality products/services with shorter delivery 
times. Thus, improving their results and income (Alsyouf et al., 2018). Even though asset management activity has 
been developing alongside human development (Hastings, 2015), the formalization and standardization of these

1382","stakeholders; due to the little prospect of financial return with this certification; lack of recognition of the standard by 
INMETRO; and others. 
 
 
 
Figure 19 – The reasons to not get certified with ISO 55001 
Nevertheless, why do companies see no need for this certification? For this, the authors talked to consultants in the 
area.  
 
5.2 Open Interviews 
The factors presented by consultants in the field were: two groups work in favor of AM but with different objectives. 
One aims at ISO 55001 certification, and the other focuses only on improving AM processes. These groups are quite 
different. Consultants from other ISO standards form one group, and maintenance area professionals form another. 
Maintenance professionals who do not know or are not familiar with the 55001 focus only on good maintenance 
practices. On the other hand, maintenance professionals who understand the standard do not feel comfortable preparing 
the company for certification.  
ISO 55001 consultants, on the other hand, assess that non-adherence to the standard was impacted by the situations:  
 
• 
In maintenance, major projects have a long sales cycle. Short-term cycles are only valid for expenses that 
directly affect production assets. ""Small"" projects, as a certification, are sold at the end of the year, using 
budget leftovers.  
• 
The standard was launched in 2014. Therefore, in an optimistic scenario, own 2014 would be the year of 
disclosure to the market. 
• 
2015 would be the year for companies to obtain budgets for the implementation that would take place in 
2016.  
• 
However, the years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 were troubled years in Brazil due to political crises, which 
generated uncertainties, and there was little investment in the country.  
• 
2019 started uncertainly but seemed to be returning to normality.  
• 
In 2020 and 2021, the consulting market stopped. Certification contracts have been suspended and/or 
canceled.  
• 
Unlike ISO 9001, which qualifies suppliers, 55001 has no commercial appeal, although it encompasses 
customer needs and expectations.  
• 
Furthermore, another difficulty that co-occurred was that INMETRO decided that it was not a priority to 
have certifying companies installed in Brazil for such certification. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This research was specially formulated for companies whose physical assets represent the revenue-generating 
infrastructure. They are the assets that support the organization and, therefore, are essential to the ability to remain 
competitive. However, the survey shows that many participating companies do not have a clear AM policy, do not 
have procedures that help AM, or know the standard that could help them start activities to manage their assets better. 
Many professionals in the area do not even know the standard. Then, despite linking AM to corporate strategy is 
relatively new, Brazilian companies have not been accumulating achievements with the standard implementation and

1392","the adjacent benefits of this achievement. Like the TPM, introduced in the Brazilian market via the maintenance 
department, 55001 will have many difficulties integrating processes with other sectors. Therefore, compared with 
international references, the results are not achieved.  
 
The main reason for the standard's non-adoption and consent is that the Brazilian entrepreneurs have a culture of 
immediacy. Any process that will generate medium- and long-term results is not always a priority. Companies do not 
have solid and organized strategies to support AM since daily demands are very high and take up all the employees' 
time. Thus, people cannot organize themselves to deliver a sustainable result, the opposite expected by AM. Instead, 
effective and efficient organizations use their AM to resolve competing priorities and ensure that long-term benefits 
are not sacrificed for more immediate needs. In Brazil, ISO 55001 is far from the enthusiasm and success promoted 
by ISO 9001. 
 
As the survey was designed especially for manufacturing companies, many professionals did not want to answer it 
because they understood that their company did not align with the research. So then, there is a suggestion for a 
complete survey, a specific study for consultants, and another for ISO 55001 certified companies.

Abstract  
 
The increase in the competitive business environment forces business actors to maintain their position in the market. 
This study aims to examine the effect of the technology acceptance model, manager competence, and enterprise risk 
management on competitive advantage: mediating role by e-commerce adoption and moderating role by financial 
literacy. This study involved 100 business actors who were selected using the probability sampling technique. Data 
was obtained by distributing questionnaires to respondents through the G-Form. The collected data is then analyzed 
using Path analysis assisted by the Smart PLS application. Based on the research results, it is known that E-Commerce 
adoption, TAM, Manager Competence, and ERM have a significant positive effect on competitive advantage. The 
variables TAM, Manager Competence, and ERM were found to have a significant positive effect on e-commerce 
adoption. Meanwhile, Financial Literacy is only able to moderate the relationship between Manager Competence and 
E-Commerce adoption and has not been able to moderate the relationship between TAM and ERM to E-Commerce 
adoption. In addition, the researchers also found that Competitive Advantage was able to mediate the relationship of 
TAM, Manager Competence, and ERM to competitive advantage. Business owners are expected to be able to disclose 
enterprise risk management (ERM) and develop quality human resources on an ongoing basis so that the company 
can win the market competition.

1. Introduction  
The increasingly advanced era makes the business world an industry that is “driven” by the development of science 
and technology, no longer depend on the abundance of natural resources and cheap labor wages. Facing conditions 
like this, organizations that want to maintain their business are required to be able to adapt quickly (Ahmad et al.).  
 
The conditions that must be met by companies to be successful in the competition are trying to achieve the goal of 
creating customers and so the goals can be achieved, every company must strive to produce and deliver goods and 
services that consumers want. Business competition is so tight that it requires companies to have a competitive 
advantage, otherwise, the company cannot last long. Competitive advantage in an organization can be obtained by 
paying attention to superior value for customers, culture, and climate to bring improvements to efficiency and 
effectiveness. According to Raguž et al., (2017) achieving competitive advantage can be done by empowering tangible 
and intangible assets, enabling companies to understand and implement strategies that increase efficiency and 
effectiveness (Raguž et al.). Competitive advantage is not permanent. And when a business can't adapt and change its 
strategy, competitors can seize it. Competitive advantage depends on the speed of competitors to outpace the company. 
For consumers, competitive advantage means the company's products can satisfy their needs. When companies

research can add other variables that are predicted to affect competitive advantage.

Abstract 
 
The progressive climate change that the planet is going through is affecting the structure and functionality of the 
marine ecosystem, causing increases in temperature, deoxygenation and acidification. Consequently, this has affected 
the health of many marine species, in particular the population of the blue abalone Haliotis fulgens (Philippi, 1845), 
which is one of the species of the rocky reefs of the western coast of the Baja California Peninsula, for the which there 
are reports of effects due to environmental changes such as detachment of organisms from their substrates, and even 
mortality events. Therefore, the objective of the present work is to monitor the oxygen levels in the blood of abalone. 
To monitor the oxygen saturation in your blood, a sensor was designed that is suitable for working with biological 
samples under the principles of pulse measurement combined with photoplethysmography. 
 
Keywords

Abstract  
 
Early childhood is a crucial phase in the construction of the individual. It is a period of rapid development that leads 
to the acquisition of a battery of skills on which future physical and psychological constructions will be based. 
Investments in early childhood are effective when they begin as early as possible. This means starting with the 
children at an early age to ensure that they benefit fully from educational opportunities and are well prepared for 
parenthood later in life. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of early childhood education programs. The 
context chosen is public preschools, located in rural areas of Morocco. This work proposes a sequential 
methodology based on a conceptual analysis based on the SOR paradigm ""Stimulus-Organism-Response"", and an 
empirical methodology based on estimation by structural equations. Thus, the results of this work confirm the 
existence of a positive and significant relationship between the components environment of the preschool program 
and the skills acquired by the beneficiaries of its programs. Therefore, the results argue for the generalization of 
preschool education in rural areas with the support of public provision. Providing preschool education to those 
currently excluded is considered an efficient and equitable investment. 
 
Keywords  
Preschool structures, Preschoolers, Structural equation, S.O.R Paradigm and Acquired Skills. 
1. Introduction  
Currently, governments recognize the importance of investing in early childhood development programs. Positive 
development in early childhood will have an effect through the second most critical window of opportunity, 
adolescence.  Not only do investments continue throughout the life cycle, building on the fundamentals established 
in the early years, but cross-cutting investments in health and nutrition and learning reinforce each other for greater 
impact.

1409","The third and final test concerns the component of the distribution of preschool children in HO13 preschool 
structures. The validation of this hypothesis allows us to admit the role that the mode of distribution of children 
within the preschool structures plays on the expected results of the preschool programme, which is consistent with 
the existing literature (Vandell and Wolfe 2000). Indeed, the adoption of small class sizes optimises the positive 
effects of the preschool programme, that is, opting for a high staff to child ratio, small groups of preschool children 
per facility, allow preschool children to demonstrate better the cognitive and language skills acquired. Policy makers 
need to engage in significant class size reduction policies in the least advantaged schools, and these results tell us 
that this policy, although costly, is likely to reduce the achievement gap when implemented in a targeted and 
intensive manner. 
 
5.4 Proposed Improvements  
The main orientations drawn from the results of the studies carried out are as follows 
• 
Reduce class sizes and favour the lowest teacher-child ratio. 
• 
Establish a standard reference for the size of the surface area within its structures. 
 
6. Conclusion  
As a conclusion, and through the research within the SOR paradigm, we have accepted that there is a positive and 
significant relationship between the internal and external environment of the programme and the skills acquired by 
the preschool children. This relationship is significant for each individual construct. That is, the variables measuring 
the internal and external environment are significant. 
The results argue for the widespread provision of preschool education, particularly in rural areas, with support for 
public or community provision. Offering preschool education to those currently excluded is considered an efficient 
and equitable investment. 
In this regard, it should be noted that policies to improve equitable access to quality preschool education in rural 
areas, particularly for girls aged 4-6 years, are very limited and, if they exist, are most often offered in traditional 
structures. To remedy these shortcomings, government policies must expand the provision of quality preschool 
education services that promote safety, inclusion and sustainable outcomes, either through the creation and/or 
equipping of preschool facilities in areas of need, and according to standards that guarantee the quality, accessibility 
and sustainability of its infrastructure and teaching materials, and also through actions to strengthen teachers 
qualifications and working conditions, or awareness raising and information sessions that promote playful learning 
for young children at home, which supports the stimulation of learning in the family environment and which, in the 
event of local school closures (such as in the case of natural disasters or pandemics), offers a means of mitigating 
learning losses. 
Care should also be taken that tools are in placeto allows to maximise the impact of preschool reform on access to 
better quality education for all children, notably by (i) continuing the expansion of a network of high-quality pre-
schools, (ii) improving the quality of educational processes and focusing on pedagogical practices in the classroom, 
and (iii) improving the measurement of children's cognitive and non-cognitive development. 
The present status of preschool educators must be reviewed in order to enhance and perpetuate the profession of 
educator, especially in rural areas, by providing bonuses to staff working in these precarious environments.

Abstract  
 
Sustainability has become a relevant issue worldwide as organizations and consumers today are more concerned with 
ecological and social issues when consuming and using products and services, and therefore, they are taking greater 
responsibility for strategic organizational sustainability and environmental management. There are several factors that 
have proven to create company sustainability. However, different with previous studies which generally try to examine 
one or two factors that are considered affectual on organizational sustainability, this study tries to reveal the role of 
several factors such as digital transformation, operational effectiveness, supplier relationship management, logistics 
effectiveness, and competitive advantage on organizational sustainability. The subjects in this study are three 
newcomer IT manufacturers.  This research is conducted with a quantitative approach with the subject being the 
service users of newcomer IT producer companies as many as 75 companies with 200 respondents. The analysis used 
in this study is a Structural Equation Model (SEM) approach with the smart PLS. The results of the analysis show that 
digital transformation, operational effectiveness, supplier relationship, and competitive advantage have significant 
effect on organizational sustainability while logistics effectiveness has no effect. Therefore, any company needs to 
determine the significant factors to reach the advantages. In addition, because this research only focuses on several 
factors such as operational effectiveness, supplier relationship, logistics effectiveness, and competitive advantage, 
other research that involves several factors of company sustainability needs to be conducted.

1. Introduction  
Society today is experiencing rapid dynamic changes in the context of the global economy.  A time when companies 
face new opportunities and threats in achieving sustainable organizational development at their own pace and pace 
(Jamwal et al.). In the new global contextual economic and technological changes, organizations must develop under 
certain environmental conditions; one of which is the sustainability of a company. Sustainability has become a relevant 
issue worldwide as organizations and consumers today are more concerned with ecological and social issues when 
consuming and using products and services, and therefore, they are taking on greater responsibility for strategic 
organizational sustainability and environmental management (Kuzma et al.). Having company sustainability may have 
several advantages, such as able to improve their brand image, reduce overall running costs, is future-proofing 
its business against any future levies, attract right investors and employees, etc. 
 
Organizations may have different approaches to achieving it means and goals due to differences in capabilities, 
resources, knowledge, expertise, etc. Organizations are involved in operational relationships the interactions between 
individuals, organizational groups, and institutions in the workplace make decisions that are channeled to ongoing 
organizational and personal development. Organizational sustainability is affected by global and local sustainability 
challenges, concerns, and issues that need to be assessed and analyzed in order to design policies, strategies and 
practices that are likely to have broader economic, social and environmental impacts (Bastas and Liyanage). 
 
Gomez-Trujillo & Gonzalez-Perez, (2021) found that digital transformation can be said to be the driving force or 
initial strategy that can bring a company to organizational sustainability.  To be able to maintain business sustainability

Abstract  
 
Every construction service provider and construction service users always expect that the project they are working on 
can be completed properly and can meet the final project objectives. Thus, it is necessary to know the factors that 
influence the increase in project performance. Therefore, this study aims to determine the factors that can improve 
project performance so that it can run optimally. This study uses quantitative research methods by giving 
questionnaires to real estate workers (properties) in the city of Yogyakarta in order to obtain as many as 105 
respondents. The analysis of this study is a Structural Equation Model (SEM) approach with the help of smart PLS. 
The results of this study indicate that the factors that influence project performance are innovation project 
management, job autonomy, and knowledge absorption and job autonomy, job insecurity, dan knowledge absorption 
are able to affect innovation project management. Therefore, every project management needs to consider these three 
aspects to maximize project performance.

1. Introduction  
Every construction service provider and construction service user always expects that t, the working on can be 
completed properly and can meet the final project objectives (Oke et al.). The ultimate goal of the project is to get the 
maximum project performance, such as cost, quality, time, and work safety, by carrying out the stages of work, starting 
from preparation, planning, scheduling, implementation, and control that are more thorough and detailed (Ingle and 
Mahesh). Many things must be prepared, so that project performance during implementation is maintained properly, 
such as cost estimation, resource planning, work techniques and methods, risk management, project budget control 
and monitoring, quality control, work method planning, OHS management, environmental management , and other 
factors that affect project performance (Alaloul et al.). 
 
The Central Statistics Agency (BPS) noted that Indonesian construction companies reached 203,403 business units. 
Construction companies are most widely spread on the island of Java, which is as many as 77,116 units. Java Island 
dominates the top four with the province having the largest construction companies. These provinces are East Java 
with 24,596 units, Central Java with 15,961 units, Jakarta with 14,505 units, and West Java with 12,884 units. Then, 
Banten is in eleventh place with a total of 7,270 units. However, Yogyakarta is in the sixth lowest place with 1,900 
units. From this data it can be concluded that construction companies have a major influence on human life. The 
number of requests needs to be accompanied by good project performance. From dataindustri.com (2021) it is found 
that the performance of property industry companies in Indonesia has decreased from year to year. This is in 
accordance with media reports which state that throughout 2020, the performance of the real estate (property) industry 
experienced a positive growth of 2.32%. Although still showing positive and better performance than several other 
industrial sectors that experienced negative performance, the growth of the real estate industry in 2020 was still smaller 
than the growth of the real estate industry in 2019 and before.  
 
Project performance is a setback in most developing countries and can be traced to poor utilization of project 
management best practices, project performance measures, and critical success factors affecting construction projects

an organization's goals are pursued and potentially improve its long-term performance. 
 
5.13 The effect of job autonomy on project performance is mediated by innovation project 
management 
The results of hypothesis testing the effect of job autonomy on project performance mediated by innovation project 
management obtained a positive beta score (p=0.115) with t-statistics of 2,541 (p>1.96) and p values of 0.011 (p<0.05) 
indicating that innovation project management can mediate job autonomy on project performance. 
In innovation, there is a difference between invention, the creation of new ideas, and innovation. Innovation sees 
where the broad way lies in process or technological change themes that create value for customers or organizations. 
The different innovations are more than mere changes. Innovation is a representation of the unsustainability of past 
conditions. This discontinuity is a characteristic that distinguishes innovation from change because change represents 
a fraction of the previous or current service configuration and/or professional ability. Innovation is the introduction of 
new elements into the organization's services in the form of new knowledge, new organizations, and new management 
or process skills. Change is a picture of a gradual change from the current condition, also known as a picture of 
continuity from the past. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The results of this study indicate that (1) there is no relationship between knowledge sharing and project performance, 
(2) there is a significant and positive relationship between knowledge absorption and project performance, (3) there 
is no influence between job insecurity on project performance, (4 ) there is a positive and significant effect between 
job autonomy on project performance, (5) there is a significant and positive relationship between innovation project 
management and project performance, (6) there is a significant and positive relationship between knowledge sharing 
and innovation project management, (7) there is a positive and significant relationship between knowledge absorption 
and innovation project management, (8) there is a positive and significant relationship between job insecurity and 
innovation project management, (9) there is a positive and significant effect between job autonomy and innovation 
project management, (10 ) innovation project management can't k mediating the relationship between knowledge 
sharing and project performance, (11) innovation project management can mediate knowledge absorption on project 
performance, (12) innovation project management can mediate job insecurity on project performance, and (13) 
innovation project management can mediate job autonomy on projects performance. 
 
This shows that the factors that influence project performance are innovation project management, job autonomy, and 
knowledge absorption, and job autonomy, job insecurity, and knowledge absorption can influence innovation project 
management. Therefore, every project management needs to consider these three aspects to maximize project 
performance.

Abstract 
 
In recent years there has been an increasing competitiveness in the automotive sector with companies having to 
respond to an increasingly diverse choice of customers. Additionally, the incorporation of several technological 
features in cars and the consequent dependence on several electrical systems has increased the complexity and 
demands of the wire harness manufacturing and testing process. The high variability that these products present has 
required the production of test equipment highly diverse and, therefore, with a high customisation factor. The 
adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies has proven to confer flexibility to production processes, increasing their 
efficiency, without compromising quality, production costs and product manufacturing cycle times. Thus, the 
application of this type of technologies in the industrial context of the production of harness test equipment could 
prove beneficial. This paper aims to propose a solution network composed by Industry 4.0 technologies and based 
on the Internet of Things concept, which, in the context of manufacturing methodologies, could make the productive 
system more efficient and less prone to failures. As a case study, a wire harness test equipment company was 
analysed.

Phase 4 - Informatic System of Project Information Selection: This phase is triggered by the arrival of the QR code 
identifier information to the system and occurs simultaneously with the previous one. The association between the 
QR code and all the project information in the company database allows all the project information relevant to its 
machining process to be automatically identified and selected. Subsequently, through multiple commands executed 
automatically by the computer system, this information is sent via the network to the workstation computer/tablet. 
Phase 5 - Drawing's automatic opening on the workstation screen: This phase corresponds to the automated opening 
of drawings on the workstation screen. The integrated computer systems allow the identification of the parts to be 
machined at the workstation and so all the drawings of the parts to be machined are automatically opened on the 
screen after reading the QR code. In the case of CNC machines, these need to receive as input the Computer Added 
Manufacturing (CAM) program. So, in this case, the program number displayed on the sheet of the part in digital 
format, which is accessed and made available on the computer screen, gives access to a link that subsequently gives 
the order to open both the CAM sheet and the auxiliary tool sheet. 
Phase 6 - Computer Vision System: This last phase aims to replace manual inspection by a real-time computer 
vision system that performs this task in an automated way. The objective is to analyse the conformity, or lack of it, 
of a machined part by capturing a high-quality image and using image processing software that first highlights 
certain characteristics of the image and then verifies them by comparing these characteristics with those established 
for the part in its respective drawing. If the part is in conformity, a green light appears on the display of this 
equipment, otherwise a red light appears, as well as a photograph showing the exact location of the non-conformity. 
 
4.2 Critical Analysis of the Implementation of the Industry 4.0 Solutions Network in the Plant 
The fact that the proposed network is based on an Internet of Things system greatly speeds up the machining process 
and eliminates many of the occurrences that cause production stops and consequent delays and loss of resources. 
However, there are some challenges when implementing such a system. The imposition of a sequence of parts to be 
machined at each workstation can make the system less flexible. Also, the parameterised nature of the computer 
vision system's assessment may have some drawbacks, such as identifying a non-conformity in a part that, given its 
purpose and function, in practice may not be considered as such, leading to waste of time and resources. 
Besides this, there are occurrences in which the system cannot respond. Company operational issues, such as change 
of shift and simultaneous operation on more than one CNC machine, is one such example, where the automation of 
these activities may constitute added adversities, namely of a structural and/or financial nature. The measurement of 
the tool offset, an activity strictly necessary for the correct operation of the CNC machine, is another example, in 
which it is very difficult to find a solution that does not compromise its correct performance. 
In order to interact with each other, Industry 4.0 assets need to be correctly integrated into manufacturing 
environments. Various heterogeneous devices must be combined with each other to pursue a common goal. Having 
robust interoperability among sensors and actuators is essential to an Industry 4.0 production line that is flexible and 
dynamic. An efficient interoperability is essential for SNI4.0 to operate streadily (Lelli, 2019). 
 
5. Conclusions 
The need to satisfy increasingly diversified customer requests without compromising the efficiency of the 
production process and without increasing costs has become a huge challenge for organisations, namely the 
automotive industry. Mass customisation strategies, combined with the technologies of the Industry 4.0 paradigm, 
have been widely adopted for this purpose. The main objective of this paper was to propose a network of Industry 
4.0 solutions, based on the concept of Internet of Things where all the machinery is connected to each other, and to 
the company's database, through the network, storing in real time the data generated in the factory. Technologies 
such as QR code, RFID and Computer Vision System were incorporated into the network of solutions, in order to 
streamline the activities of the machining process, making it more efficient and less prone to failures. Furthermore, 
through this network and the data generated by the multiple equipment it is possible, through statistical and artificial 
intelligence software, to carry out trend studies aimed at improving the company's performance in the market. 
Although it has some limitations, this network can be adapted to similar processes comprising a range of industries, 
especially in the context of highly customised production.

Abstract  
 
Employees are an important part of generating innovation. The challenge that then arises is how to apply innovation 
in their respective contexts. In improving the behavior of work innovation, the researcher formulates the existence of 
variables in the form of increasing knowledge. So, this study aims to determine the knowledge-processing capabilities 
of employees on innovative work behavior mediated by employee creativity. Quantitative techniques are used in this 
study. In this study, using 6 F&B manufacturing industries, more specifically the large coffee beverage factories in 
Indonesia, so that the sample in this study were 100 respondents who were employees of these companies. The analysis 
of this study is a Structural Equation Model (SEM) approach with smart PLS. The result of this research is that 
environmental dynamism affects innovative work behavior. Knowledge acquisition affects innovative work behavior. 
Knowledge dissemination affects innovative work behavior. Knowledge utilization affects innovative work behavior. 
Employee creativity affects innovative work behavior. Environmental dynamism does not affect employee creativity. 
Knowledge acquisition affects employee creativity. Knowledge dissemination does not affect employee creativity. 
Knowledge utilization affects employee creativity. The results of the mediation hypothesis state that employee 
creativity is able to strengthen the relationship between knowledge acquisition and innovative work behavior. 
Employee creativity is not able to mediate the relationship between innovative work behavior and environmental 
dynamism, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge dissemination variables. It can be concluded that F&B 
manufacturing companies need to increase knowledge between individuals and perform knowledge processing 
capabilities to improve employee innovation behavior. 
 
Keywords  
Environmental dynamism, knowledge-processing capabilities, innovative work behavior, employee creativity 
 
1. Introduction  
The form of work innovation in employees needs to be grown in the F&B manufacturing industry. The food and 
beverage industry is one of the mainstay manufacturing sectors in making a major contribution to national economic 
growth. According to the Ministry of Industry of Republic Indonesia, the achievement of F&B manufacturing 
performance is consistent and continues to be positive, starting from its role in increasing productivity, investment, 
exports to employment. Recently, the beverage industry has started to show improvement in the coffee sector in 
Indonesia. Indonesia also has various types of specialty coffee which are known in the world, including Luwak Coffee 
with a distinctive taste and aroma according to geographical indications which are the advantages of Indonesia (Ibnu 
et al.). Currently, Indonesia is a producer as well as an important consumer of coffee commodities. As a producer, 
Indonesia at fourth ranks after Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia, and as a consumer is in seventh place (Fitriani et al.). 
ICO (2015) shows the growth of coffee drinkers in Indonesia is growing rapidly, more than world growth, which is 
8% for the growth of Indonesian coffee drinkers while the growth of world coffee drinkers only reaches 6%. The 
Association of Indonesian Coffee Exporters and Industry stated that the national coffee consumption growth increased 
from 0.8 kilograms per capita to 1.3 kilograms per capita. From the data above, entrepreneurs in Indonesia are starting 
to believe that building the F&B industry in the coffee sector will attract interest from all walks of life, especially 
teenagers. So that at this time more and more MSME are starting to focus on these drinks. This condition will cause

Abstract 
 
The government's civil service officers are linked to efforts that benefit the broader public sector services, assisting in 
the successful delivery of government services through innovative behavior and service excellence. The primary 
objective of this study is to ascertain how to regenerate innovative behavior from a knowledge-based public service 
perspective by examining the mediating roles of service behavior and two independent variables; service orientation 
and social capital. This study focuses on officials from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. A systematic questionnaire 
was used to collect primary data based on the literature review. Using SmartPLS (Partial Least Square) 3.28 software 
to test the model's hypothesis. The PLS-SEM analysis is a two-step procedure that evaluates the measurements and 
ends with evaluating the structural model. The research findings indicate that service behavior can mediate between 
service orientation and social capital, promoting innovative behavior. Furthermore, these findings imply that the 
emotional support provided by social capital can contribute to the capacity of public sector officers to innovate 
sustainably.

1. Introduction  
Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy - a diversified archipelago nation home to more than 300 ethnic groups 
– has had tremendous economic development since emerging from the late 1990s Asian financial crisis. Indonesia's 
economic planning is guided by a 20-year development strategy spanning 2005 to 2025. It is divided into five five-
year medium-term plans known as the RPJMN (National Mid-Term Development Plan), each having a distinct 
development priority. From 2020 to 2024, the current medium-term development plan — the final phase of the long-
term goal – is in effect. It aspires to further bolster Indonesia's economy by enhancing its human capital and global 
competitiveness (The World Bank in Indonesia, n.d.). To improve Indonesia's performance and competitiveness in the 
worldwide market, Indonesia must invest in human capital. Since human capital is a concept that combines the present 
objectives for increased performance, competitiveness, and sustainability (Kucharčíková et al. 2018). 
 
The government's role is inseparable from initiatives that benefit the broader public services, thus supporting 
successful government service implementation (Hariguna et al. 2021). Consequently, public sector organizations must 
invest in human capital. It comprises four capitals: human capital, structural capital, relational capital, and social 
capital (Ali et al. 2021). Intangible capital is one of an organization's most valuable resources, allowing for long-term 
growth, which refers to human abilities, competence, and motivation in human resources. (Kucharčíková et al. 2018). 
Moreover, it is critical since employees' experience, knowledge, and skills must operate successfully in today's fast-
paced and changing environment, including the public sector (Ali et al. 2021).

1471","increases the ratio of service orientation and social capital to innovative behavior. The findings support previous 
research that service behavior fosters innovation through the willingness to assist others, establishing a pleasant work 
environment, and compassion for the firm and its members (Freire and Gonçalves 2021; Khan et al. 2020). 
 
The research findings aim to bolster Indonesia's economy by boosting its human capital in innovative behavior. The 
first portal is dedicated to the selection process. The Indonesian Human Capital Department can conduct a more in-
depth assessment of the candidate's social capital. This research indicates that social capital significantly impacts both 
service behavior and innovative behavior. Furthermore, it implies that soft skills remain critical for achieving 
sustainable public service quality as part of social capital. The second attempt provides professional development in 
public sector organizations, emphasizing service-oriented development through case studies and public service 
simulations. It will bolster civil service officers' availability by providing a holistic view of those services, including 
results and processes. 
 
Additionally, it will provide civil service officers with clear guidelines when serving the public. Further, the research 
findings demonstrate that service behavior can mediate between service orientation and social capital on innovative 
behavior. Furthermore, these findings indicate that emotional support can help strengthen public sector officers' 
capacity for sustained innovative behavior. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Indonesia, Southeast Asia's largest economy, has had tremendous economic development since emerging from the 
late 1990s Asian financial crisis. The research findings aim to bolster Indonesia's economy even more by increasing 
the country's human capital competitiveness on a global scale. Based on the results of the SmartPLS analysis, the 
empirical evidence shows that service behavior is a mediating variable between service orientation and social capital 
on innovative behavior. 
 
Additionally, the research findings indicate that service behavior can mediate between service orientation and social 
capital, thereby promoting innovative behavior. Furthermore, these findings imply that the emotional support provided 
by social capital can contribute to the capacity of public sector officers to innovate sustainably. 
 
The study's limitations include the public sector's small sample size. Furthermore, the research findings are based on 
responses to a questionnaire survey provided by organizations' representatives. To increase the significance of the 
research, a more in-depth examination of the organizational issue should be conducted. In addition, it is critical to 
situate the investigation within another public sector context so that generalizable findings can be drawn from those 
samples. Finally, another study is required to ascertain how training efficacy is incorporated into the public sector's 
strategic plans. The training is specifically in excellent service-oriented development and employee career plans.

Abstract  
 
Information Technology (IT) Governance has always been an interesting topic even though it has been introduced for 
quite some time, especially since 2002, when the United States government enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
(Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Public Company Accounting Reform, and Investor Protection Act of 2002) as a 
response to several accounting scandals involving large companies such as Enron, Tyco International, Adelphia, 
Peregrine Systems, and WorldCom. Currently, almost all government institutions and the public sector in all countries 
in the world have used IT as a tool to carry out their operational activities. IT governance in government institutions 
and the public sector is a strategic point for a country. The Industrial Revolution 4.0 which is currently running makes 
the use of IT wider not only in organizations outside the government and companies but also in many countries that

Abstract  
 
One of the great problems faced by organizations worldwide is how to guarantee sufficient production capacity to be 
able to respond efficiently, effectively and effectively to the demands of the different social interest groups that benefit 
from the supply of goods and / or services manufactured by them.  Understood capacity as the rate of production that 
is expected to be achieved and defined this variable with the main responsible for organizations remaining in force 
within the productive context, since what is not produced is not sold. 
 
Taking into account the above, it is necessary to operationalize in organizations, methodologies that allow in the long, 
medium and short term to define in advance the behavior of production capacity and thus prepare organizations to 
face the high levels of variability faced by companies in terms of market behavior. 
 
Thus, in the present work we develop a process of planning the capacity of servuction in the medium term in an 
organization of specialized medical services (Outpatient Consultation), based on the aggregate planning of production 
and operations, also known as sales and operations planning, in which from the development and / or analysis of pure 
and combined strategies supported in heuristic techniques developed,  it is intended to help organizations with similar 
characteristics, within the economic context where they operate, have sufficient resources, capable of responding to 
such demands at the lowest possible cost.

Abstract  
 
CV. Wira Vulcanized is a company engaged in tire vulcanization. The company was established on December 5, 
2012. CV Wira Vulcanized has 16 workers who start working from 08:00-17:00. Work carried out on the floor of 
tire vulcanizing production will not escape work accidents. The workers cause many accidents on the production 
floor for not complying with OHS regulations. The work accident caused the company a loss of time and also a loss 
of income. To solve problems that occur in CV. Wira Vulcanized is proposed to improve the work system using the 
Systematic Cause Analysis Technique (SCAT) method. This method is one of the methods to identify the cause of 
the work accident from the actual picture so that it can be known as a picture of the direct cause and the root cause. 
The conclusion of this study is. The Frequency Rate (FR) of work accidents for everyone million human hours 
worked from 2018 to 2020 was 131. Meanwhile, the Severity Rate (SR) is 125 days lost for one million hours 
worked. The most common causative factors are hazardous to work equipment (Sharp Blades), not using PPE, 
exposure to tire debris, being hit by heavy loads, and slipping. Proposed improving the Occupational Health and 
Safety (OHS) system on CV.Wira Vulcanized in order to minimize work accidents, making OHS SOP, adding OHS 
signs, routinely conducting OHS training, and tightening supervision of the use of PPE.

1. Introduction  
Technological advances in the industrial sector have developed very rapidly, so to face fairly fierce competition, it is 
necessary to increase the quantity and quality of production by efficiently utilizing resources, as a consequence, 
companies need to emphasize the role of Occupational Health and Safety (OHS). 
 
Occupational Health and Safety is important for companies because the impact of accidents and occupational 
diseases harms the workforce and the company, either directly or indirectly. Occupational safety means the process 
of planning and controlling situations that have the potential to cause work accidents through the preparation of 
standard operating procedures that become a reference in work (Suma'mur, P. K, 1996 in casban, 2018). So OHS is 
a scientific field that studies the factors that cause an accident from the workplace and what efforts can be made to 
make a work accident on a CV. Wira Vulcanized can be minimized as small as possible.

has become accustomed to working using PPE.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of research that has been carried out on work accidents on CV.Wira Vulcanized, it can be 
concluded that: 
The Frequency Rate (FR) of work accidents for everyone million human working hours from 2018 to 2020, 131 
people experienced work accidents. As for the severity of work accidents or Severity Rate (SR) as a result of work 
accidents in 2018 to 2020, namely 125 days lost for one million working hours. 
  
The first causative factors that occur first the direct cause of work accidents are dangerous to work equipment 
(Sharp Knives), not using PPE, exposure to tire fragments, being hit by heavy loads, slipping and also tripping and 
the basic causes that can also cause work accidents on the production floor are worker coronation, lack of 
knowledge, inadequate supervision so that workers still do not use PPE, as well as a work environment that is not 
well maintained, as well as physical and psychological damage factors of workers. Therefore, corrective actions 
taken to prevent this accident are increasing worker awareness of the importance of workplace safety and the use of 
PPE through socialization, conducting OHS training, implementing correct OHS SOPs, strict supervision measures 
for workers who do not use PPE, and carrying out work environment maintenance Routinely 
  
The proposed improvement of the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) system to CV.Wira Vulcanized in order to 
minimize work accidents is to make OHS SOPs, add OHS signs, routinely conduct OHS training, and tighten 
supervision of the use of PPE

Abstract 
 
Research on implementing work standardization in an SME company in the veterinary sector is very scarce. This 
scientific article aims to increase productivity without neglecting the grooming service's quality and applying different 
engineering solutions to improve resource management. The results obtained can be of great value to similar industries, 
especially those that want to improve the performance of their operations, avoid waste, and improve their productivity. 
In companies such as a veterinary clinic, it is common to find that those in charge of the bathroom area do not perform 
an outstanding performance in their work, considering this task as not very important or definitive for the company, 
causing unnecessary delays, slow work speed, and unmotivated staff. We seek through this article to demonstrate that, 
through standardization of processes and areas within a company, the imperfections found can be significantly improved 
with a meager investment of money. This article refers to the implementation of the standardization of work in a 
veterinary clinic, achieving an increase of more than 30% in its productivity.

1. Introduction 
This study focuses on the veterinary services sector, representing more than 100 billion dollars in the global market, 
with an annual growth of 4.68%. In Peru, almost 60% (4 million) of households have at least one pet, spending only 
on Grooming an average of 44 soles per month for each pet and an average of 150 soles, including food and baths. In 
Lima alone, more than 640 veterinarians and 374 pet stores serve more than 1.5 million in demand. In 2020, the 
turnover of veterinary services at the national level was almost 250 million soles, with a growth of nearly 20% 
compared to 2015. A good part of the small and medium-sized veterinary clinics that offer bathing or pet grooming 
carry out their activities a priori without knowing their results or indicators that guarantee the correct management of 
the activities and processes in their different areas. Many of these veterinarians have limitations in their technical 
capacity and resource management, without having control of their ability to perform services or productivity 
indicators, thus implying difficulty in keeping their costs low and quality standards high. 
 
Likewise, this research aims to apply different engineering solutions not only to the country's veterinary sector but 
also to increase the SME sector's productivity at an international level. Therefore, the problem posed and the question 
to be answered is the following: How does the application of engineering and work standardization methods improve 
resource management and productivity in grooming service processes? 
1.1 Objetives 
As the main objective, this work aims to demonstrate that applying the engineering method and the standardization of 
work improves the grooming process in a veterinary company. First, the movements and times of the employees within 
the process will be identified. Subsequently, work standardization methods and SLP will be applied to improve 
unproductive times and reduce signs and downtime. Then, the MRP method will be applied to have better control over 
the production process. Finally, a flowchart of the grooming service and technical sheets were made to obtain adequate 
quality control in using materials for the service.

1500","1. Being a process carried out individually by each operator from start to finish, the average service execution time 
is given by the total sum of the standard times of each activity, the new cycle time of 39 minutes and 31 seconds. 
2. The effective working hours (Discounting Lunches) are 5 hours in total. 
 
Given these considerations, we proceed to calculate the productive capacity of the company: 
Time = 5 hours/day x 60 minutes/hour = 300 minutes/day (Per Operator) 
Production = 300 minutes/day ÷ 39.51 minutes/service = 7.59 daily services per operator 
With the new production capacity per operator, with two operators currently active, a maximum of 15 services per 
day can be achieved. Next, Table 4 shows the new unit costs of the process:

5.2 Cost analysis 
Through the data analysis, a cost-benefit of 1.74 soles was observed for each completed cycle, implying a substantial 
decrease in the long-term costs of these operations. This result is considered high since the investment required for its 
implementation is nil, as it only consists of theoretical-practical engineering techniques and tools for its application, 
without the need to acquire machinery, tools, or additional materials to those that the veterinary clinic you already 
have at your disposal in the Grooming area. 
5.3 Validation 
The proposed model was validated through the implementation of a pilot test with a duration of 1 month, analyzing a 
total of 20 services throughout May and June 2022. 
 
Through the data obtained from the pilot test, regular and drastic changes can be observed in the indicators to be taken 
into consideration: Daily attention capacity and productivity of the grooming area. 
Attention capacity: Maximum pets to attend per day. 
Productivity (Based on cost): Number of pets served for each sol spent. 
 
In the calculation of the initial attention capacity, there was a maximum capacity of 13 pets attended by the daily 
grooming area. This implied a limit in attention capacity on days with a more significant workload in which the clinic 
owner would have to stop receiving bathroom and grooming requests, resulting in a loss of income for the company. 
However, as can be seen, through the improvements in time, thanks to the standardization of time, techniques, and use 
of materials that the bathing and grooming area received, it was possible to increase its attention capacity by 11.29%, 
thus allowing the veterinarian to be able to carry out two additional daily grooming services, resulting in up to an 
additional income of 420 soles per week only in bathroom services, under normal conditions. 
 
Regarding productivity, initially, each sol of cost allowed to carry out 0.1343 services, while, after making time 
improvements, allowing a lower cost of labor for each service, as well as the improvement in the use of materials 
(mainly shampoo, which incurred much waste due to lack of standardization), managed to increase this indicator to 
0.1753, implying a productivity increase of 30.53% for each PEN spent, under normal conditions.

1508","successfully met the goals set for this article, whose main task was to demonstrate that, through engineering tools such 
as work standardization, requirement planning of materials, SLP, and the 5S, a substantial improvement in the 
functions of a production process can be achieved. However, it is essential to detail that to achieve the stated objectives, 
the workforce must continue respecting the work standardization guidelines that were provided to them on techniques, 
completion time, cleaning, and preparation, as well as establishing a continuous improvement of themselves and the 
company's processes in order to achieve better performance in the medium and long term. 
 
Finally, the company also has areas outside the bathrooms and grooming, such as the administrative area and customer 
service, which can present substantial opportunities for improvement that will allow this veterinarian to have a higher 
rate of acceptance and perceived value on the part of its clients, workers, and even suppliers.

Abstract 
 
Climate change and population growth trigger digital transformation challenges in various fields. Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) is considered a key element to answer the current challenges facing these multiple fields related to 
climate change. We present a bibliometric analysis to answer how the academic publication of artificial intelligence 
in various areas to systematically understand research trends on this topic. We used Scopus indexed references, 
bibliometric methodologies, and software to conduct the research. We retrieved 1264 published documents from the 
Scopus database over two decades from 2002 to 2021. Analysis was also performed by visualizing the bibliometric 
network using Vosviewer. The method used consists of five stages: determination of search keywords, initial search 
results, refinement of search results, initial compilation, and data analysis. Among the most published articles 
indexed by Scopus, papers published by researchers in the United States (US) have the highest number of 
publications with 296 scientific publications, then the second country is China with 136 academic documents, and 
the United Kingdom is in third place with 136 academic documents. Computer Science is the subject with the 
highest number of documents with 441 documents (18.3%). The processed data shows the patterns and trends of 
Scopus indexed international publications.

Abstract 
 
Along with the development of technology and information, various product transaction activities can be easily 
carried out by utilizing the internet network. Prospective buyers can make transactions faster with potential sellers 
via the internet without having to visit first. A company can easily sell a product through the website. Dua Ruang is 
a cafe selling drinks from coffee to mocktails in Malang City, Indonesia. The implementation of transactions at the 
Dua Ruang cafe still uses manual transactions where prospective buyers have to come to the cafe to buy their 
products, with this method less than optimal in business development. Based on these problems, we designed a 
website that will make transactions easier and digital. We use the Waterfall method for the design and design of the 
Dua Ruang website. This method starts with Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, and Maintenance. The 
test results show the website can function properly and can be used for further implementation. The existence of a 
website-based sales application will be the best solution for solving problems at the Dua Ruang Warnet so that it can 
increase sales turnover.

Abstract 
 
Indonesian healthcare application is growing and more people are relying on healthcare application for their needs 
especially during COVID-19 pandemic, customers can get professional help and order medicine without visiting 
hospitals. However, there are still problems affecting customer satisfaction mainly because they can’t get the same 
interaction as face to face meeting with a doctor. This research proposed E-Service Quality, Customer Perceived 
Value, and Price as antecedents of Customer Satisfaction for healthcare application users in Indonesia. 154 samples 
were collected on April 2022 using purposive sampling and data was analyzed using Partial Least Square. Result 
shows that E-Service Quality and Price positively affect Customer Satisfaction while Customer Perceived Value has 
no significant effect. This result provides insight for healthcare application to maintain or increase their customer 
satisfaction. Research result also provides opportunity for future research in reconfirming the results or develop new 
model for customer satisfaction in healthcare application. 
 
Keywords 
Customer Satisfaction, Service Quality, Price, Customer Perceived Value and Healthcare.   
 
1. Introduction 
During COVID-19 pandemic, travel and mobilities are less convenient compared to before. There were several 
restrictions on mobilities preventing people to visit places like hospitals or doctors except for emergency situations or 
appointments. With the development of technology, healthcare applications become alternative for outpatients in 
consulting their health and getting medical advices without physically visiting hospitals or doctors. Indonesia saw the 
rise of healthcare application users with 57% people surveyed are healthcare application users, the third in the world 
behind China and India (Burhan 2020).  
 
Although the prospect looks promising, there are still several problems faced by healthcare application users. Security 
issues, below expectation service level, unfulfilled patient’s needs, and different prices of medicine between regions 
are problems faced by healthcare users. These problems affect users’ satisfaction on using healthcare application.  
Da Fonseca et al (2021) found that mobile health and telemedicine are the most common e-health practices in the 
world. Yuan et al (2015) found that expected performance, habit, and price affect customers’ preference in using 
healthcare application. Fransiska & Bernarto (2021) found that service quality positively affect customer satisfaction. 
Mangkunegara et al (2018) found that perceived usefulness and perceived behavioral control effect healthcare 
application users.  
 
While the users of healtchcare application in Indonesia is big, there are still problems affecting their satisfaction 
especially the difference between face to face interaction and online interaction. To address this, healthcare application 
need to identify factors influencing their users’ satisfaction because their users are their customers. This research 
proposes E-Service Quality, Customer Perceived Value, and Price as factors influencing Customer Satisfaction in 
healthcare application. By understanding these factors, healthcare application can maintain or increase their user 
satisfaction to ensure sustainable growth in the future.

1523","6. Conclusion  
Statistic tests in this research resulted in two hypotheses accepted and one hypothesis rejected, confirming two 
relationships. The aim of this research was to identify factors influencing customer satisfaction for healthcare 
application users in Indonesia. This aim was fulfilled through this research and the objectives were fulfilled as such:  
1. E-Service Quality has positive significant effect on Customer Satisfaction 
2. Customer Perceived Value has no significant effect on Customer Satisfaction 
3. Price has positive significant effect on Customer Satisfaction 
 
By fulfilling the aim and objectives, this research also contributes interesting findings adding more reference for 
researches on Customer Satisfaction and healthcare application. Furthermore, this research was conducted in 
Indonesia with healthcare application users as population. Previous researches didn’t combine E-Service Quality, 
Customer Perceived Value, and Price as antecedents for Customer Satisfaction. This research combined those 
variables as antecedents and contributed a more comprehensive model for customer satisfaction in Indonesian 
healthcare application. Another interesting contribution is the finding showing there is no significant relationship 
between Customer Perceived Value and Customer Relationship, this can spark another research to reconfirm this 
finding in another industry or another population.

Abstract 
 
Purpose: The goal of this study is to systematically examine research reference trends related to digital transformation 
in the construction industry from 2016 to 2022. This research will focus on the development trend of digital 
transformation research in the construction industry on Google data-based scholar. 
 
Design/methodology/approach: A mixed method approach was used in this study, combining bibliometric methods 
and a literature review. From 2016 to 2022, 43 international publications with the keyword digital transformation in 
the construction industry were sourced from the Google scholar database via web scraping. 
 
Findings: According to the findings of this study, studies on digital transformation in the construction industry are 
dominated by several fields of study such as architecture, construction, management, engineering, digital technology, 
hotel industry, industry policy, financial, business, and economy. According to the findings of this study, there are at 
least four major perspectives that are commonly used when discussing digital transformation in the construction 
industry. However, this does not imply that no other perspectives are used in addition to these findings. 
 
Research limitations/implications: The research's limitation is the scope of the articles used, which were sourced 
from the Google Scholar database. The recommendations in this study can be used as hypotheses in the future, in 
addition to research with broader literature sources, and comprehensive and in-depth follow-up research can be 
conducted. The study's findings are expected to be useful to academics researching digital transformation in the 
construction industry.

1541","5. Conclusion 
Based on the findings and discussion of this study, it is concluded that the highest growth development in the 
topic field of digital transformation in the construction industry occurred in 2021, reaching 21 articles or an 
increase of up to 150 percent between 2016 and 2022. Furthermore, the review reveals that the majority of the 
journals that discuss the issue of digital transformation in the construction industry are science and engineering 
journals. This research also demonstrates that there is no dominant journal or publisher addressing the issue of 
digital transformation in the construction industry. This means that research in this area is still dispersed across 
different journals or publishers. Furthermore, development maps are classified into 24 clusters based on co-
occurrence and keywords. This review, on the other hand, summarizes the research trend of digital transformation 
in the construction industry into four major issues.  
 
First, based on the research location, it's worth noting that the majority of the countries or cities that have served 
as research locations in the last six years have been Sweden, Nigeria, China, Malaysia, London, the Netherlands, 
and Russia. Meanwhile, based on the research approach used, the results of data analysis show that the majority 
of the research employs an empirical study approach and a case study. The selected locations are generally objects 
that implement digital transformation in the construction industry or locations that have been assessed or analysed 
as having the potential to implement digital transformation in the context of the construction sector. Comparative 
analysis and causal relationships are two examples of research methods used.  
 
In other words, some studies compare the loci under study to objects that have successfully implemented digital 
transformation. Furthermore, several studies have been conducted to examine the impact of implementing digital 
models on a variety of factors, including efficiency and productivity. In this field, descriptive qualitative methods 
are still the most commonly used approach. Although quantitative methods are still used, particularly in case 
studies to assess the success of digital transformation. 
 
 Third, in terms of context or research scope, studies related to include architecture, construction, management, 
engineering, digital technology, hotel industry, industry policy, financial, business, and economy.  
 
Finally, this study discovers that at least four main perspectives are dominantly used when discussing digital 
transformation in the construction industry. However, this does not imply that no other perspectives are used in 
addition to these findings. Of course, many unexplored perspectives remain unexplored because they are not 
dominant perspectives. This is especially true when one considers how some researchers tend to use multiple 
approaches. As a result of this analysis, the contexts that are frequently discussed are also interdisciplinary or 
multidisciplinary issues. The scope of the articles used, which were sourced from the Google Scholar database, is 
the research's limitation. In the future, it is strongly advised to conduct research using a broader literature source. 
Furthermore, the findings of this study can be used as hypotheses, and comprehensive and systematic follow-up 
research is being conducted. The findings of this study are expected to serve as a resource for academics 
researching digital transformation in the construction industry.

Abstract 
 
212 Mart is a retail that sells basic needs with guaranteed quality products, prices and a comfortable atmosphere. But 
over time, new competitors emerged. Therefore, strategies are needed to maintain the Retail business. There are 
problems in inventory management, namely the occurrence of vacancies or running out of goods which can cause 
consumers to turn to competitors to look for similar goods and will have an impact on decreasing sales. ECLAT and 
EOQ can be applied to this problem. ECLAT aims to find the most frequently purchased product combinations 
together, , while EOQ aims to find the number of goods to be ordered from the supplier so that orders can be made 
in optimal and economical quantities. The analysis is carried out using a sales transaction data set of 85,038 
transactions in the 2021 period. The data was studied using the ECLAT algorithm with a minimum support of 0.1% 
getting 20 rules with the minimum confidence value of 30%. It is known the most frequently occurring product that

From the results of the application of EOQ in an effort to optimize product inventory, information can be found 
regarding the number of products to be ordered (Q), the number of times the product is ordered (F) and the distance 
of the product order day (T). Products can be ordered economically and optimally. By calculating EOQ, it can also 
overcome product availability and time management so as to avoid the possible risk of product unavailability or 
product vacancies that make consumer demand always available. There are few problems with the results of 
previous EOQ implementations. (Table 7)

Abstract 
 
This study aimed to determine the effect of diplomacy in the manufacture of Chinese hydropower dams on the 
downstream states of the Mekong River. This article mobilizes the political economy literature to see how China 
influenced countries in the Mekong River to agree with the Chinese hydropower dam projects. The article shows that 
hydropower dams are not only part of China's soft power but are instruments to support China's economic and political 
ambitions. Therefore, the success or failure of dam construction depends on the agreement and the level of bilateral 
political relations and the countries that establish cooperative relations for hydropower dams. Despite the benefit it 
can give, this development also negatively impacts countries like Laos and Cambodia. The impact can be seen in 
erosion, flooding, destruction of breeding fish habitats and population movements.

1. Introduction  
Over time, human beings have become aware of the impact of their daily activities on the environment, so much 
so that the concept of environmental protection has become a goal and a standard of action for the private sector 
and governments (Bernal, 2013). However, awareness of environmental care is still insufficient, and the level 
of concern in the social organization is increasing. Therefore, short-, medium- and long-term actions are 
required, duly articulated, in which the acquired knowledge is applied, and new actions and protocols are 
investigated based on the advances in environmental knowledge. Wills, policies and needs have to be united to 
get there, and everything depends on the culture and education of the people involved (Díaz-Horna et al., 2022).  
Currently, a global effort has been made to advance environmental education (EE) as the axis of sustainable 
development in the world since sustainable behaviors must be established among populations in order to have 
a rapid and sustained impact on the actions taken by countries from their political frameworks of law and 
economics (Sandoval Escobar, 2012).

here. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The purpose of this writing is to identify the principal authors interested in the subject, the documents with the 
most citations, and the countries interested in the topic. In addition, this document provides the necessary 
information to evaluate the growth trend in environmental knowledge, attitudes, and intentions in recent years. 
This topic is of vital importance today, as it tries to mark the key points to develop sustainability in people. It 
also manifests the connection that various authors have discovered between knowledge, attitudes, and 
environmental intentions. In this way, it can be increased the research bibliography for a more up-to-date 
document. On the other hand, we cannot fail to emphasize that even the most stubborn of interests or intentions 
to care for the environment are vital and signify a change in favor of nature.

Abstract 
 
This research focuses on the rivalry between Japan and China in the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway infrastructure 
project. Although the Indonesian government initially offered the project to Japan, China eventually won this project. 
The purpose of this study is to find out what factors encourage the decision of the Indonesian government to choose 
China over Japan as the strategic partner in this mega infrastructure project. This research uses the process-tracing 
method to analyze decisions taken by the Indonesian government. This article finds that domestic politics, such as 
perceptions of power, state’s domestic characteristics, and quality of political leadership as well as external factors 
such as the influence of China in Asia and the limitations of Japan in fulfilling the requirements given by the 
Indonesian government drive Indonesia’s decision to choose China over Japan despite Japan’s technological 
superiority in infrastructure project implementation.

Abstract 
 
The impact can be seen in erosion, flooding, destruction of breeding fish habitats and population movements. ASEAN 
has been one of the world’s largest markets for the automotive industry, among which Indonesia is the largest domestic 
market of automotive sales. ASEAN countries have implemented newer foreign trade policies and it affects the 
increase in industrial competition. So does Indonesia’s automotive industry. This research aims to explain the 
importance of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and its effects on the ASEAN automotive industry competition that 
benefits the Indonesian economy. Neo-classical economic theory was reviewed to observe FDI. The method applies 
a qualitative-quantitative approach, i.e.  SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity & Threats). The result of the 
analysis shows that the current FDI policy impacts the increase of Foreign Trade Agreements to expand domestic 
production. In conclusion, Indonesian Automotive Industry would develop with the support of relevant FDI.

Abstract 
 
PCL Company is a Small - Medium Enterprises industry engaged in the printing sector in Indonesia. The PCL 
company's production floor's layout problem is crossing production lines. It can hinder workers from doing 
production, and the long-distance between machines creates an alternating current which causes time and energy to 
be wasted in moving materials. Workers are hampered and make long distances. This research aims to redesign the 
production layout to improve the production flow and minimize material handling distances in the production 
process in Printing. Data processing is carried out using (CRAFT). The CRAFT method is done by swapping areas 
in the initial layout to find a better solution based on the Activity Relationship Chart (ARC). The area exchange on 
the ARC will lead to a layout close to the minimum material handling distance. The result of the calculation of 
material handling for the prefix layout is 20,432 meters. Alternative Layout 1 has a material transfer distance of 
5,849 meters, while alternative 2 has a material transfer distance of 7,095 meters. Alternative layout one was chosen 
as the best proposal because it has the smallest total material transfer distance. After that, the selected alternative 
proposed layout is used for the initial layout in the craft method processing. After processing the data using the 
CRAFT method, the optimal proposed layout is obtained.

1. Introduction 
One way to increase production productivity is to improve the components of production machines or the layout of 
factory facilities. The layout of the settings is related to the change from input to output. An effective and efficient 
layout is demonstrated by no backtracking, less overall material transfer, and no bottlenecks in the process. An 
effective and efficient layout helps reduce production cycle times, idle time, bottlenecks or material handling time 
and can increase production output, so the layout of production facilities must be done to help smooth the production 
process.  
 
PCL Company is an industry in Indonesia for Small and Medium Enterprises engaged in the printing sector. The 
printery has some machinery, including glue binding, cutting, and GTU printing tools. Every month, a defined 
production goal is established for custom chart items. With a typical processing time of 10 minutes for each bespoke 
folder sheet, it processes 2500 sheets every month. Based on a direct inspection of the printing location, several 
problems were found, which can be seen in Figure 1, a layout image of PCL Company that there are still production 
line crossings that can be seen hindering workers in carrying out production. The distance between machines is far

6. Conclusion  
After processing, then an effective and efficient proposed layout is obtained. Layout redesign is essential to increase 
productivity and reduce material handling distances. The material handling distance in the initial layout is 20,432 m. 
In the alternative, one layout is 5.8 m and 7.09 m in alternative 2. Then alternative one is used as the initial layout in 
the Winqsb application. It can be seen that after redesigning, the material handling becomes smaller, and after that, 
data processing is done using CRAFT to get a more effective layout.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine the factors that influence marketing strategies using the Strength Opportunity 
Aspiration Result (SOAR) matrix analysis and the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). This method would apply to 
Mie Rajawali Business, one type of business that produces various types of noodles. The problem in this business is 
the decline in sales and the presence of competitors. It is due to several uncontrollable factors, such as the Covid-19 
pandemic that has occurred globally, which has shaken Indonesia's economic stability and many businesses that 
have experienced sales cash flow problems, including the Mie Rajawali business. Soar matrix analysis consists of 
SA, OA, SR and OR. AHP is a method that can produce alternative options to speed up the decision-making 
process. Based on the calculations, the score obtained from the IFE matrix is 3.84, while the total score of the EFE 
matrix is 3.49. Where the result of the IE matrix is in a cell, I called the Grow and Built cell, where this cell is a 
growth and development strategy. Based on the calculation of the AHP method that has been carried out, the 
selected alternative strategy is obtained, namely the SA strategy, with a value of 0.49.

1. Introduction 
Covid-19 is a worldwide pandemic that has shaken the economic stability of Indonesia & other countries. From data 
from the Ministry of Cooperatives & MSMEs, it is known that the MSME sector was shaken during the Covid-19 
pandemic. This is because MSMEs usually occupy a strategic position in the economy, resulting in many businesses 
closing temporarily and experiencing cash flow problems. In response to this situation, the government is trying to 
establish an industrial economic policy system to offset capital shocks and production and sales systems due to 
disruptions in sales activities in certain areas. In this case it is necessary to carry out a marketing strategy that can 
restore the conditions of sales of products. 
 
Marketing strategy is one way that can be a winner in competing continuously, be it for companies that produce 
goods or services (Iasoma, et al., 2021). In the development of marketing strategies that need to be applied, namely 
the product (product), price (price), place (place), and promotion (promotion). Although the quality of the product 
produced is good, if the product is not sold well, it will not provide a selling point for the product. Meanwhile, the 
industrial ecosystem has undergone major changes and MSME players need to adapt to competitors who are also 
changing.

6. Conclusion 
In the Internal factor Evaluation (IFE) matrix, the Mie Rajawali business has the strength of the product not using 
preservatives. The product has price variations, various types of noodles, raw materials that are easy to find and a 
strategic location. Meanwhile, the aspiration of getting a discount if you buy in large quantities, the product can 
compete in the market, and product sales can be expanded if you promote it optimally. In the External Factor 
Evaluation (EFE) matrix, the Mie Rajawali business has opportunities that can be utilized, namely a large and wide 
market segment, most people in general like noodles, consumers increase during Ramadan and government support 
in developing community businesses. Meanwhile, the results expected by the Mie Rajawali business are guaranteed 
product quality, mutual benefit, maintaining product taste, effective promotion strategies, improving product quality,

Abstract 
 
This study aims to analyze the roles of metal industries in the Japanese national economy. This study applies Input-
Output (IO) analysis as an analysis instrument. More specifically, this study employs the parts of IO analysis, namely 
simple output multiplier, simple household income multiplier, index of the power of dispersion, and index of the 
sensitivity of dispersion as analysis devices. The analysis period of this study is from 1985 through 2005. In this study, 
the analyzed industries are non-ferrous metals, non-ferrous metal products, metal products for construction and 
architecture, and other metal products. The results display that, by using both multipliers, the analyzed metal industries 
did not include in the top five Japanese industries from 1985 through 2005. By using both indices, one can argue that 
the quadrant change on the analysis period was experienced by non-ferrous metals and other metal products industries. 
Interestingly, both industries experienced the change in 2000. On the other hand, the remaining industries did not 
experience the quadrant movement from 1985 through 2005. In other words, the industries showed consistency in 
terms of the quadrant position on the analysis period.

1. Introduction 
The industrial sectors are significant aspects from the point of view of a national economy. Their contributions can be 
detected not only on the micro part, but also on the macro part of a country. Also, their imperative roles can be seen 
both in developed and developing countries. One of the industries that worth to be discussed in this matter is the metal 
industry. 
 
There are many previous studies that explain the metal aspect. For example, Jahns et al. (2021) analyze the metal-
dusting behavior of additively manufactured binary Ni–Cu alloys with 30 and 50 wt% Cu, respectively, and the 
technical Monel Alloy 400 with a Cu content of 30 wt% under metal dusting circumstances. Touileb et al. (2022)

Abstract  
 
Today companies have maintained their success derived from the adoption and the constant effort that is made in the 
activities to achieve a correct implementation of lean manufacturing. However, the misuse of these tools can 
significantly affect a considerable increase in the costs and resources of the company. Something similar happens with 
the application of good practices and guidelines that are directed under the management of projects that consists of 
exposing reliable and successful results under permanent effects of continuous improvement. 
The purpose of the following article is to present a unified literature review that analyzes 53 English-language articles 
during the period 2011 to 2021. The following review was carried out with the support of four databases (Elsevier, 
SpringerLink, Emerald, Scopus), under a unified classification which presents the following: classification of article 
by source of publication, publication by year, area of knowledge, number of articles by area of knowledge, percentage 
of participation, percentage of use by type of article, number of articles by research methodology. This document will 
open and contribute at the academic level to implement future research gaps in the current state of the different 
industrial and/or manufacturing sectors.

1. Introduction  
The body of the acknowledgment about the project definition presented by the GUIE PMBOK® version (2017) is as 
follows: Projects are carried out to meet objectives through the production of deliverables. An objective is defined as 
a goal towards which work must be directed, a strategic position to be achieved, an end to be achieved, a result to be 
obtained, a product to be produced or a service to be provided. (PMBOK, 2017) It is said that the word ""Project"" in 
the modern sense only came into common use during the 20th century. Before that, it had several different meanings. 
The Oxford English Dictionary named the word used in the II century. In classical Latin, the verb to project means to 
throw away or discard. It was in the fifteenth century that the word was used to refer to the act of conceiving an idea, 
proposing a plan, putting something into action or venturing into the unknown (Davies Andrew, 2017). 
Over time, the evolution of correct project management has entered into situations in which the essence and the 
application of good practices to develop a project in accordance with the theories, come to cause confusion and 
decision making that can hardly be taken up again control over the current situation of the project, apply and develop 
the methodologies and tools that help achieve harmony and consistency between project management based on lean

1619",,"Figure 8 Level of implementation 
 
The level of implementation is the graphic representation that shows us the number of articles that indicate the level 
at which the contribution or research reached. We can see that 44% of the articles reached a proposal level, that is, the 
author(s) indicated what their methodology or framework was, without reaching a practical result. Figure 8 shows the 
result of the research. 
Finally, the level with the least attributions was those in process with a participation of 2.1%, which means that the 
authors who used this implementation are still creating or opening new lines of research, without yet having a 
satisfactory result or the use of the tools or methodologies employed are still under discussion.  
 
6. Conclusión  
The following literature review is directly related to the management and administration of projects to develop 
scientific and technological environments that serve as an overview of the attributions made in the last 10 years. It 
should be noted that identifying possible areas of opportunity for new fields of study and creating significant relevance 
on these topics, as well as possible behaviors under research techniques; the results obtained undoubtedly open new 
avenues for research, as well as the knowledge of new techniques to propose practical and efficient solutions to 
particular problems. 
 
For this analysis a great variety of areas of knowledge and implementation on the management and administration of 
process flow were obtained, the annual period of search showed the different contributions published recently on 
topics in environmental impacts, information technologies, however for the attributions by countries shows that 
Mexico does not have significant advances in management and administration of projects that can be applicable in 
schemes under the needs and characteristics for projects of the Mexican industry, this is not bad on the contrary the 
margins so wide to expand new research and contribution of scientific articles allow day by day to offer a more 
standardized approach. Without mentioning that (India) has a greater means of validation in their proposals which 
attributes with more successful and relevant publications for researchers seeking to open new paths with the use of 
lean manufacturing tools under a scheme of the use of good practices for proper project management.

Abstract  
 
Nowadays, Peruvian SMEs, with an initial business model, seek and achieve good acceptance in the market, which is 
obliged to acquire the necessary knowledge and tools to be able to continue and manage a great change in the growth 
of the company. In this context, the research aims to implement the tools of industrial engineering to achieve the 
improvement in the level of service in a pharmaceutical SME. 
 
It was decided to perform an external analysis of the company to know how it is compared to others in the same sector 
and internal analysis to determine its strengths and weaknesses. 
 
To identify the problem, a deeper analysis of the process will be carried out using the root-cause tree methodology, in 
which it is concluded that, due to poor management in the warehouse, there are delays in the attention of orders. 
 
For the implementation of the improvement, constructivism has been chosen as the theoretical framework; this choice 
is made to know in depth the different theories that allow corroborating the benefits that the implementation of the 
different tools to be investigated have brought to the companies. 
 
In this case, the normative networks are studied in two ways, 5S and MRP tools. The methodology used for this 
purpose is based on a quantitative-descriptive analysis, which frames the registration, analysis, and interpretation of 
an audit and checklist, as well as the times or processes of the phenomena within the company. 
 
Finally, after implementing the 5S and MRP tools, the technical validations are carried out through audits and the 
Arena Simulation Software, respectively.

1. Introduction 
The pharmaceutical sector in Peru presents a growth between 2 to 3% (Terranova, 2022), since, during the pandemic, 
the demand for the pharmaceutical portfolio is growing and therefore the sales of the sector were high. That is why 
this study focuses on a marketing company belonging to the pharmaceutical sector that decides to start its business 
model, and the good management of this, achieves a good acceptance in the market, which achieves high growth due 
to its large customer acquisition, but today, entrepreneurial companies do not have the knowledge or tools necessary 
to continue and manage a large change in growth, as well as not having established specific indicators to retain 
customers.

1631","For the validation of the 5S tool, audits were conducted to verify compliance and follow-up, which aims to collect the 
evidence presented, allowing to address the knowledge acquired and to be able to act correctly. Likewise, present 
corrective actions, which begins with the identification of nonconformities, determine causes, implement the proposed 
solution, validate the effectiveness, conduct a re-audit to verify completion and finally file and record the evidence.  
For this case study, Figure 8 shows the radar graph from the 5S audit, which presents a good indicator with respect to 
3 vertices: classification, organization, and standardization. Following a disciplined approach and cleanliness, which 
helps us to take immediate corrective actions.

6. Conclusions 
It is concluded that the service level increases due to the proportional increase of perfect orders, through the 
implementation of the 5S and MRP tools. These tools allow for reducing time in the processes, improving order 
picking, and better inventory control, which had been previously detected as the root causes of the problem tree when 
the company's initial situation was analyzed. 
 
In addition, it is concluded that for the improvement to be successful there must be a commitment of all the people 
involved in the activity, as well as the feedback is fundamental, since it allows to achieve the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the tool, achieving a sustainable and not temporary continuous improvement.  
 
By having a customer satisfied with the quality of service provided by the company, complaints are reduced and 
savings for the company, both in the reduction of discounts for orders delivered out of time or incomplete. All the 
above is related to customer satisfaction being positively impacted. 
 
This research will contribute to the 5s and MRP implementation in Peruvian SME’s and show the importance, financial 
feasibility, and the results of applying the tools to the process and to the warehouse. However, it also shows limitations 
and risks, such as, the organizational culture and time management problems.

Abstract 
The invention of EDM has changed the manufacturing industry and brought about revolutionary technology that 
has been highly effective. The idea behind the EDM machine was to exploit the destructive effects of electrical 
discharges and their use to manufacture high-precision workpieces. Components made out of conductive materials 
can be manufactured with high precision, which is required in industries like aerospace and automotive. 
Technology advancement has helped the industry overcome manufacturing problems such as difficult-to-machine 
materials like ceramics, superalloys, and composites. Many variants of EDM such as wire EDM, die-sinking die-
sinking EDM, micro EDM, and dry EDM have been developed lately, which are discussed in this review work. 
Further, an effort is made to elaborate on components of EDM, its working principle, different types, advantages 
and disadvantages, and future directions.

Abstract  
 
Work readiness is an important factor in preparing students to enter the real workplace. The lack of work readiness 
will make it difficult for students to survive in the contemporary workplace and lead to unemployment. Internship and 
self-efficacy are the keys that will lead the student to succeed in the workplace. This research aims to examine the 
influence of internship and self-efficacy towards student work readiness. The data were collected from 200 higher 
education students in Jakarta using a questionnaire. Only a few studies have been done on this subject, with Multiple 
Regression Analysis to explain the research phenomenon and to validate the research hypothesis. Rasch Model was 
used to clean biased data, converting ordinal data from Likert Scale questionnaires to interval data, examine the 
validity and reliability of the questionnaire. The findings show that the internship and self-efficacy directly impact 
work readiness simultaneously. Thus, in addition to academic achievement, the students should have internship 
experience and high self-efficacy to prepare them to enter the workplace after graduation.

Work Readiness, Internship, Self-efficacy. 
 
1. Introduction  
Higher education student graduates are one of the contributors to the highest percentage of unemployment in Jakarta 
at 13.58 percent after the vocational and high school levels. This phenomenon becomes a question, because the higher 
a person's level of education, the greater the chances of getting a job. One of the reasons is the expectations of 
companies that cannot be met. This happened because the company expects graduates to have technical skills in 
addition to theoretical knowledge to face current business challenges. In addition, self-efficacy is also needed, so that 
university graduates are able to compete in the real workplace (Azmi et al. 2018; Eldeen et al. 2018; Kusnandar 2021; 
Nurlaela et al. 2021). 
 
This gives an idea that work readiness is an important factor in entering the workplace. Without work readiness, a 
person will find it difficult to survive and thrive in the contemporary workplace. To have good work readiness, students 
need to acquire both technical skills and soft skills before they graduate (Jackson 2019; Kadir et al. 2020).

6. Conclusion  
Work readiness is an important factor in preparing students to enter the real workplace. The lack of work readiness 
will make it difficult for students to survive in the contemporary workplace and lead to unemployment. This study 
aims to examine the influence of internship and self-efficacy towards higher education student work readiness. A 
previous study has been on this issue used Multiple Regression Analysis to describe the study phenomena and test the 
validity of research ideas. The Multiple Regression results indicate that the internship and self-efficacy have a 
statistically significant direct effect on work readiness simultaneously.  
According to this study's findings, many students agree that their internship experience and self-efficacy can better 
prepare them for work. In addition, to support student work readiness, companies should open many internship 
programs to provide broad opportunities for students to gain work experience and foster self-efficacy. Also, 
universities must provide other activities to improve student work-readiness and self-efficacy, such as workshops, 
career seminars, and industrial visits.  
There are still certain limits to the research. First, there is still a lack of respondents who fill out this research 
questionnaire. So, if the number of respondents obtained can be more, this research will be more widespread. Second, 
researchers can add some other supporting variables and change population, such vocational high school students to 
gain more varied study. In addition, researchers also need to add more references to strengthen the hypothesis testing 
of the study.

Abstract 
Equitable use of fuel products must be carried out by the Indonesian government, especially for the eastern 
region of Indonesia where most of the natural conditions are in the form of the sea. Since consumer requests on 
the islands come in at different times, fuel product deliveries are made in response to local demand, and 
occasionally the cargo hauled is not entirely full. Another challenge in shipping by ship is crew costs and the 
increase of fuel prices, thus making the company try different operational strategies. In addition, the open water 
conditions around September to early March are in choppy conditions, making the company spend more fuel 
costs, and of course it will require more costs as well. The company that distributes fuel products to consumers 
has three depots, twenty consumers, and twenty vessels with different capacities. Under these conditions, the 
problem will be solved by using a multi-depot vehicle routing problem using a heterogeneous fleet and binary 
integer programming. At the initial stage, the solution to the routing problem is expected to get the smallest 
distance, determine the ship that will carry out the transportation and determine the customers to be served. The 
purpose of the study is to meet consumer demand with minimum transportation costs and calculate the number 
of emissions caused by the distribution of fuel based on routes and sea conditions. This study resulted in 13 of 
20 vessels owned by the company assigned to the delivery of fuel. When sailing in choppy sea conditions, the 
transportation cost increase by 16.70 percent, and emissions CO2 increase by an average 17.28 percent when 
compared with calm water conditions.

1. Introduction 
Transportation and distribution are components that greatly affect the competitive level of business processes 
run by a company. Meanwhile, transportation management is one of the components of supply chain 
management which has the aim of meeting customer demand, as a result of planning, implementing and 
controlling efficient movement activities involving goods, services and information (Soeanu, Ray, Berger, 
Boukhtouta and Debbabi, 2019). 
 
Parkhi, Jagadeesh, and Kumar (2014) stated that a good route for logistics distribution can reduce transportation 
costs thereby increasing shipping efficiency. The efficiency of these routes will affect the improvement of the 
logistics system (moving load, delivery, speed, service quality and usage of facilities) and especially the 
reduction of shipping costs and savings in terms of energy use. Determination of the optimum route in the 
distribution and transportation system is related to the distribution flow starting from the starting point (depot) to 
various consumer locations until ending back to the starting point (depot), as well as considering the balance 
between the routes formed. 
 
PT. ABC is a company engaged in the distribution of fuel oil (BBM) shipments through sea transportation 
facilities, which send fuel from the depot to the customer. Figure 1 shows the operational area of PT. ABC is 
located in the eastern region of Indonesia. PT. ABC has three depots and 20 vessels, each tasked with 
distributing products to a predetermined number of customers and shipping these products by ship. The use of 
ships exposes various challenges to be faced.  
 
The research gap is that the company is facing a situation where rising fuel prices, increasing crew costs and sea 
conditions such as wind and waves that often change can make inaccuracies in the calculation of fuel use, and

3. Conclusion 
A mathematical model has been developed using the Multi Depot Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing 
Problem (MDHFVRP) and the results obtained are to deliver fuel products to 20 consumers, which was 
originally carried out using 20 ships, after arrangements were made, 13 ships were proposed to make the 
delivery. The need for transportation costs for all ships on one calm sea voyage is Rp. 1,906,182,121 if using 
MDO, Rp.1,828,171,223 if using B30 and Rp. 1,879,993,728 when using LSFO, and transportation costs will 
increase by 16.70% if sea conditions are choppy, and CO2 emissions produced are 286.93 tonsCO2e when using 
MDO, 172.8 tonsCO2e when using B30 and 279.44 tonsCO2e when using LSFO and will increase by an 
average of 17.28%. Under these conditions, the company can choose the use of fuel for its operations. 
 
This research can be developed for consumers who are not fixed and unscheduled in ordering BBM products. 
Other research developments are calculating fuel requirements due to wind and waves coming from the front 
and side of the ship, paying attention to the real conditions of using engines related to fuel consumption and 
calculating ship maintenance costs for each ship, as well as setting up the ship's fleet if there are ships that are 
running. perform routine maintenance (docking).

Abstract 
 
This article examines the role of the Indonesian government in managing the marine environment after the Montara 
oil spill. Using the concept of environmental governance, this article analyzes Montara oil spill management from an 
environmental point of view. This article contributes to the literature on environmental governance by discussing how 
the Indonesian state handles the Montara case from an environmental point of view. In order to see the government 
efforts, we examine the interactions of various actors across levels in assisting state actors. Based on a qualitative 
methodology, this research analyzes official documents and reports and official websites belonging to agencies. The 
results show that the Indonesian government received assistance from the Australian government, the UN, local actors 
and communities, government agencies, and local governments. However, these interactions are limited in showing 
significant efforts for the environment. Instead, this article shows the interaction of actors in designing future

Abstract  
 
This study explores and examines the relationship between digital leadership, innovation capabilities, and total quality 
management (TQM) in the context of MSMEs in Indonesia. In addition, this study examines the shaping factors of 
digital leadership, namely visionary leadership, digital-based learning culture, systematic improvement, and 
professionalism. The conceptual framework proposed in this study refers to the resources advantage theory of 
competition. This study is quantitative research with a data collection method using a questionnaire. The sample in 
this study is MSMEs who are members of the creative community in Lampung, Indonesia. The number of samples in 
this study was 100 respondents. The sampling technique used purposive random sampling. Respondents in this study 
are MSMEs because they have knowledge and insight into business management. Data analysis techniques and 
hypotheses testing use structural equation modeling with the help of SmartPLS 3 software. The results of this study 
showed that visionary leadership, digital-based learning culture, systematic improvement, and professionalism are the 
antecedents of digital leadership. Meanwhile, innovation capabilities affect total quality management. All hypotheses 
in this study were accepted.

1. Introduction  
Total quality management (TQM) is the main focus for organizations that provide goods or services. The TQM 
concept puts forward the quality of products or services to meet consumers' expectations (Zhang et al., 2021). The 
TQM concept has been implemented in several countries, namely: Japan, America, India, Saudi Arabia, China, and 
also Indonesia (Antunes et al., 2021; Attri et al., 2021; Fok et al., 2021; Sahputra et al., 2021;Xin et al., 2021). Previous 
research explained that TQM is associated with several factors, such as organizational culture, knowledge 
management, workplace health, and job performance (Barua, 2021; Khurniawan et al., 2021; Lagrosen and Lagrosen, 
2022; Temiz et al., 2021; Yazdani, 2021). However, research linking TQM and digital leadership is still very rarely 
investigated. Most previous research has focused on visionary leadership (Soliman, 2018; Wasono and Furinto, 2018), 
and has scarcely looked at the relationship between digital leadership and TQM. Therefore, this study will try to 
explore the relationship between TQM and digital leadership.  
 
Digital leadership is a new science in human resource management. Digital leadership puts forward the figure of a 
leader who utilizes digital data to achieve the organization's strategic goals. Digital leadership is believed to focus on 
customer satisfaction through continuous improvement (Purwanto, 2022; Zhong, 2017). Therefore, digital leadership 
will encourage the implementation of TQM by increasing effective and efficient ways of working for quality

1667","all elements of the organization to understand and be sensitive to technological advances (Araujo et al., 2021; Mihardjo 
et al., 2019).   
 
The second finding in this study was that digital leadership has an effect on innovation capabilities. Digital leadership 
refers to leaders who encourage all elements of the organization to use technology to get work done (Araujo et al., 
2021). This shows that one of the characteristics possessed by digital leadership is innovation capabilities. Leaders 
will continuously innovate on work systems and technology to achieve effective and efficient work results. In addition, 
digital leadership always prioritizes innovation that makes organizations have competitive dynamics so that 
organizations will always experience changes for the better (Benitez et al., 2022). This is in line with the resource 
advantage theory of competition, which states that competition will encourage organizations to change and innovate 
so that new ideas emerge that can be used as competitive advantages (Wang and Gao, 2021). 
 
The third finding in this study was that innovation capabilities have an effect on TQM. Innovation capabilities refer 
to leaders who have the ability to innovate. Leaders with high innovation capabilities will encourage quality 
improvement and TQM (García-Fernández et al., 2022). Leaders are proven to contribute to the successful 
implementation of TQM significantly. Innovation capabilities possessed by leaders will encourage leaders to think 
about sustainable quality management systems (Lizarelli et al., 2021). For example, with technological developments 
in the form of artificial intelligence (AI), leaders with innovation capabilities will make changes by using AI to run 
the quality system to minimize errors (Zhen et al., 2021). In addition, when a leader has a digital leadership style, the 
leader will allocate company resources to use technology to support TQM implementation (AlNuaimi et al., 2022). 
 
5. Conclusion  
This study examined the forming factors of digital leadership, namely: visionary leadership, digital-based learning 
culture, systematic improvement, and professionalism. In addition, this study investigated the effect of digital 
leadership on innovative capabilities and examine the effect of innovative capabilities on total quality management. 
The results of this study indicated that visionary leadership, digital-based learning culture, systematic improvement, 
and professionalism affect digital leadership. Another finding from this study was that digital leadership affects 
innovative capabilities, and finally, TQM is influenced by innovative capabilities.

Abstract 
 
In previous studies, there are studies that focus on the factors that influence the desire to buy electric car products in 
a country and research on the effect of advertising and environmentally friendly marketing on product purchases. The 
purpose of this research is to focus on what aspects shape the younger generation's perception of electric cars through 
advertising. In particular, how is the response of the younger generation in Indonesia to the use of electric cars. This 
study uses a qualitative approach to 73 respondents (from 5 cities in Indonesia) through online open-ended questions. 
The electric car advertisement selected from YouTube is an electric car marketed in Indonesia. The results of the study 
show that most of the respondents are interested in buying the product after seeing the advertisement. Then the 
respondents gave their opinions about the factors that affect the selling power of electric car advertisements and 
opinions about the development of electric cars. The theoretical benefit is that it can contribute to aspects of consumer 
acceptance of electric cars through advertising, as well as practical benefits that can help industry and manufacturers 
to consider ways of communicating in environmentally friendly marketing for electric cars.

1. Introduction  
The development of car use is expected to continue to increase (Dnishev & Alzhanova, 2016). The car is a transport 
that has harmful emissions to the environment (Matsumoto et al, 2021). Electric vehicles or cars are one of the current 
solutions for use in everyday life. The demand in recent years for electric cars is very high. However, it has not yet 
penetrated into consumers (Abbasi, 2021; Jayasingh, 2021). Electric cars are a good solution as an alternative to 
gasoline-fueled cars (Cheron and Zins, 1997). With the advantages of being pollution-free and not using fuel oil, 
Indonesia can use electric cars as a solution (Gunawan et al, 2022). 
 
With the availability of cars, car advertisements that have been run, and green marketing that has been carried out at 
this time, we need to look at the perception of the younger generation who are potential consumers. In this study, this 
perception is seen from the advertisements displayed by electric car manufacturers. In previous studies, the focus is 
on the factors that influence the desire to buy electric car products in a country and research on the effect of 
environmentally friendly advertising and marketing on product purchases. The purpose of this research is to focus on 
what aspects shape the younger generation's perception of electric cars through advertising. 
 
2. Literature Review  
Awareness of the environment has increased from the consumer side, as well as the increasing trend of marketing 
strategies that focus on being environmentally friendly (Alamsyah et al, 2020). In marketing their products, electric 
car manufacturers need to increase consumer confidence in their brands and provide information that can influence

1676","There are perceptions given by respondents regarding prices and reasons for buying from customers, “In my opinion, 
the price of electric cars is more expensive than ordinary cars. Maybe the car can only be purchased by certain circles. 
Besides that, in my opinion, most Indonesians who might dare to buy electric cars are only because of their prestige, 
not because they care about the environment/air pollution caused by ordinary vehicles.” Another respondent also 
added, “For now, not all people use it, it's just that they are still adapting slowly. With the existence of an electric car, 
it will also be an advantage for the community for fresher and healthier air.” 
 
The Table 1 describes some interesting data about how ads affect young generations’ perception about electric cars in 
increasing the possibility of buying. It also provides information about how participants’ green living lifestyle affect 
their perceptions. According to the data, ads are likely to affect young generations with perception of charging 
location, global warming, not many users, and fuel saving.  
 
Majority of participants who think charging location and global warming as an issue admitted the most to be affected 
by the ads in buying electric car. Both stated by 24.3%, roughly twice as many as topic of not many users (12.9%), 
trend development (11.4%), and fuel saving (10.0%). In the other side, participants who did not affected by ads to buy 
electric cars are the ones who mostly think about charging location (35.3%), expensive (29.4%), not many users 
(11.8%), and fuel saving (11.8%) as the main topic.  
 
The Table 1 also illustrates how young generations’ green living lifestyle may affect their perceptions about electric 
cars. Participants who have not undergoing the green living mainly receive lack of information and have seen not 
many users of the electric cars. However, majority of participants who have been very living the green lifestyle relate 
the topic to global warming.  
 
6. Conclusion  
The results of this study show that there are many topics that become the perception of the younger generation of 
electric cars in Indonesia. Charging location and global warming were the two topics most discussed by respondents. 
In addition, respondents gave their opinion whether advertising influenced them to buy an electric car or not, the 
majority answered yes. In terms of how to live a green lifestyle, respondents started living a green lifestyle but not 
completely. Knowledge-wise, this research contributes to the development of research on electric cars, marketing, and 
customer insights. In practice, this research helps providers and stakeholders to consider ways of communicating in 
environmentally friendly marketing for electric cars.

Abstract 
 
The distribution process or activities is one of the most important aspects in ensuring the energy demand fulfillment 
in every country. This study opts for the case of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) distribution in supporting the sustainable 
energy demand fulfillment in Indonesia, especially at the Bali-Nusa Tenggara cluster. Indonesia is the biggest 
archipelago in the world where shipment through the ocean is the most prominent transportation mode. This study 
implements model fleet size and mixed vehicle routing problem (FSMVRP) combined with mixed-integer linear 
programming (MILP) to solve the stated problem by performing distribution route optimization. The constraints of 
this study consist of the fleet specification acceptance toward each terminal, and also the consideration LNG Terminal 
at Benoa and Makassar as only the warehousing area. Other than the distribution route, the FSMVRP and MILP model 
can be utilized to model the required fleet number and its utilization that has the minimum cost. This study is expected 
to enrich the energy distribution optimization literature and the FSMVRP and MILP combination literature in solving 
distributions problem that has a very strategic influence on the decision making. 
 
Keywords 
Distribution, vehicle routing problem (VRP), fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem (FSMVRP), mixed integer 
linear programming (MILP) and optimization. 
 
1. Introduction 
To meet the energy demand, distribution management plays a vital role in supporting the fulfillment of pre-determined 
energy demand. There have been many studies that aim to find the most efficient road for this case. However, those 
studies have already determined the fleet number and its type in determining the route. This study tries to approach 
the minimum distribution route by optimizing and determining the number and type of fleet to be used on that route, 
where the variable costs related to fuel, maintenance, labor, and other variable costs that affect distribution routes are 
also considered. There are several types of distribution problems and one of the most popular as a research project is 
Vehicle Routing Problem or VRP (Bittante, et al., 2018). Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) itself has been developed 
based on the conditions and limitations faced by the researchers (Bittante & Saxén, 2020). One of them is the 
development of heterogeneous vehicle routing problems which are divided into two types based on the availability of 
the fleet, if it has a predetermined fleet number, it is usually called HF-VRP. On the other hand, if the fleet number 
has not been determined or not limited it is usually referred to as Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem 
(FSMVRP) (Jokinen, et al., 2015). In this paper, authors addressed a model Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing

supporting the distribution process at the Kupang terminal, where the fleet originating from Makassar will utilize the 
Waingapu terminal to load the demand at the Kupang terminal, instead of directly traveling to the receiving terminal 
at Kupang. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Strategy 6 Distribution Scheme [Benoa Distribution Point] 
 
Figure 3 shows the distribution scheme from strategy 6 that utilize the Benoa terminal. The blue lines represent the 
fleet that performs the distribution from the Benoa terminal and returns back to the Benoa terminal, for reloading, 
before performing the distribution process again. 
 
6. Conclusion 
To answer the challenge of the case of LNG distribution scheme development in Indonesia, especially the Bali-Nusa 
Tenggare route, using the FSMVRP method to formulate and develop a distribution model is needed to understand 
which distribution route or strategy that will be implemented. By considering the Benoa terminal and Makassar hub 
as the supplying terminal for the Bali-Nusa Tenggara power plant as well as utilizing the direct shipment and milk-
run method for the LNG distribution, the strategy 6 is considered to give a benefit from the cost generation, which by 
using Pioneer Knutsen and AP504 fleets it will cost about $21.593.760 as the least cost possible from the six proposed 
strategies.

Abstract  
 
Decision making is one of the most important timelines in a company, this moment will create a critical moment for 
companies to decide the most effective location for their operational process. Miscalculation and not sorting out all 
the risks in determining an operational location will result in a profit loss and inefficient progress. The Delphi Method 
will help compare both type of industries in the current economic state, which covers manufacturing and non-
manufacturing industry as the main question to how each factor affects their business process and operational. This 
methodology will help determine each industry process to decide the most effective aspect of location decision process 
and how they will implement it to gain sustainability. A selection of journals will be used to review each of the 
understandings regarding manufacturing and non-manufacturing industries when deciding their company location that 
will start their operational process for their economic activity. Explaining the difference between manufacturing and 
non-manufacturing will be the main purpose to analyze the key difference between both different industries. This 
literature review has proven that there are key differences between both industries and each of them has its own 
advantages to fulfill their market demands. Main objectives of this research are to find the key differences between 
both type of industry and how each of the aspect of location decision plays a role in building sustainability.

Abstract 
 
The textile industry keeps on growing over time. This development has led to increasingly fierce and fast 
competition in the industry. Challenges keep on increasing and the products quality must continue to improve so 
as not to lose to the competitors. One of the methods and strategies recommended to be used in the textile industry 
for increasing profits and improving efficiency is Lean Six Sigma. The research methodology used for this study 
was a systematic literature review. To conduct the research, the researcher has used 46 literatures that have been 
filtered and adapted to the research topic. From the research that has been done, the researchers found that Lean 
Six Sigma can be successfully applied by companies in the textile industry, especially those that have problems 
with a high defect rate. In order to increase the likelihood of a Lean Six Sigma implementation's success, it is 
imperative to pay attention to the critical success factors. Several of the most significant factors for the success 
are the top management commitment, sufficient training about Lean Six Sigma, enough funds, and the acceptance 
or adaptation of Lean Six Sigma in the company’s culture. If successfully implemented, the company may get 
effects, such as increasing its product quality, reducing average damage or products defect, increasing the 
efficiency of the process, reducing, or saving costs in the processes of the company, and so on.

1. Introduction  
Textiles are something important that crucial in human beings’ everyday life, as we need it to fulfil our basic 
necessity for clothing and other things like fashion. (Narula & Desore, 2018; Madhav, Ahamad, Singh, & Mishra, 
2018). As a result of the increasing population and the increasing use of textiles, the textile industry became one 
of the largest industries worldwide. (Ibrahim, 2019; Sivaram, Gopal, & Barik, 2019) . The industry even plays a 
vital role in the development of any nation, like in India where the textile industry is significant in the country`s 
economic growth. (Noreen, Shahid, Iqbal, & Nisar, 2017; Pattnaik, Dangayach, & Bhardwaj, 2018). 
As time goes by, the challenges that the industry has to face keep increasing. Challenges such as providing 
sustainable growth with maintained quality of the textile, innovative design, reducing waste, competing in global 
market, and many more.  (Ibrahim, 2019; Ku, Chien, & Ma, 2020; Filho, et al., 2019). So, in order to be able to 
compete with other competitor and face some of the challenges, the industry needed to implement a good strategy 
or methods. One of the methods that will be discussed in this paper is Lean Six Sigma (LSS) in textile industry. 
 
1.1 Research Questions  
1. How to implement Lean Six Sigma in textile industry? 
2. What is needed for the successful implementation of Lean Six Sigma in the textile industry? 
3. What is the effect of the implementation Lean Six Sigma in textile industry? 
 
1.2 Objectives 
Based on the above research problems, it can be concluded that the main aim of the research is to learn how to 
implement Lean Six Sigma in textile industry, increase the likelihood of successful implementation, and to study 
the effects of implementation. 
 
2. Literature Review 
Many journal articles in various databases discuss the use of Lean Six Sigma in multiple industries, including the 
healthcare industry, manufacture industry, financial industry, education industry, textile industry, and so on. 
(Singh & Rathi, 2019). This paper will focus on the implementation of Lean Six Sigma in textile industry. With 
the compiled analysis and conclusion of various literatures that related to the topic, the researcher hope that this 
research will help the textile industry on reducing waste and increasing its profit by using lean six sigma.

Abstract 
 
The Industrial Revolution 4.0 is directly related to the digital transformation process, and this is because digital 
transformation is one of the efforts to participate in the 4.0 industrial revolution and is the topic of discussion in 
this research. The research aims to become a means of information for MSMEs that will carry out digital 
transformation and as a reference for MSMEs that have not yet carried out digital transformation. The data analysis 
technique in this study uses the Partial Least Square (PLS) approach, one of the Structural Equation Modeling 
(SEM) equation models. The data analysis technique in this research is path analysis. The research data was 
collected using an online questionnaire and distributed using accidental sampling and snowball sampling 
techniques, so that 393 respondents were collected. The results of this study indicate that the variables of customer, 
competition, and innovation (financial technology), which are the dimensions of digital transformation, have a 
significant positive influence on business sustainability. Meanwhile, Big Data Usage as a moderator does not have 
a positive and significant effect on the relationship between the customer variable and business sustainability and 
the relationship between the competition variable and business sustainability. It can be concluded that the variable 
of Big Data Usage as a moderator weakens the relationship between the customer or competition variable and the 
business sustainability variable. The results of this study found that digital transformation can help MSMEs in 
Jakarta achieve business sustainability, but Big Data Usage has not been utilized properly.

1. Introduction 
The presence of online-based businesses poses a threat to several industries in Indonesia that are still 
operating offline. Today, businesses and industries face challenges in transforming into digital business operations. 
Several business sectors started implementing the 4.0 industrial revolution in their systems. Herman (2016) says 
that the Industrial Revolution 4.0 is an era of digital industry where all parts of it collaborate and communicate in 
real-time anywhere at any time with the use of IT (Information Technology) in the form of the internet and CPS 
(Cyber-Physical Security), IoT (Internet of Things) and IoS (Internet of Services) to produce new innovations or 
other optimizations that are more effective and efficient. The Industrial Revolution 4.0 is directly related to the 
digital transformation process, and this is because digital transformation is one of the efforts to participate in the 
4.0 industrial revolution. Currently, the number of MSMEs that carry out digital transformation is still relatively 
small. The results of data taken via CNN Indonesia in 2021 show that there are 64 million MSMEs in Indonesia, 
but only 13.7 million have carried out digital transformation. This result is relatively low. This study focuses on 
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) which are conducting digital transformation in Indonesia. This 
study focuses on DKI Jakarta Province, which is the nation's capital, and the province of the country's economy. 
As the country's economic area, many MSMEs are domiciled in the DKI Jakarta province. The following are the 
number of MSMEs registered with the Ministry of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises of the 
Republic of Indonesia:

5. Results and Conclusions 
The results of the analysis that has been carried out to determine the effect of Digital Transformation 
moderated by the Utilization of Big Data Usage and its impact on Business Sustainability, the results of the study 
are as follows. Based on the results of the research that has been done, the Competition variable has a significant 
positive effect on Business Sustainability because it has a T-Statistic value greater than 1.96, namely 1.983 and a 
P-Value less than 0.05, namely 0.047, in line with the statement Prasanna (2019) which states that competitive 
advantage can help companies survive in the global market with the help of technological innovation. As 
mentioned in our research, the technological innovation in question is Digital Transformation. Carrying out digital 
transformation (Digital Transformation) is considered as an adaptive form of MSMEs to changes in the business 
environment considering the very rapid growth of technology to be able to increase competitiveness competitively 
(Competition) against its competitors so that business sustainability (Business Sustainability) can be maintained. 
Based on the results of the research that has been done, the Customer variable has a significant positive 
effect on Business Sustainability because it has a T-Statistic value greater than 1.96, namely 2.490, and a P-Value 
less than 0.05, namely 0.013, in line with the statement Strenitzerová, M (2018) where customer satisfaction and 
customer loyalty are considered as one of the main indicators of success that contributes to the sustainability of a 
business. The term consumer (customer) is the king of being a necessity that MSMEs must consider. Implementing 
technology into business is an action to keep up with changes in consumer behavior (customers) along with 
technological developments. So, MSMEs should carry out digital transformation (Digital Transformation) 
because consumers (Customers) influence the development of a business, so they must learn and adapt to what 
MSMEs want and need.. 
Based on the results of research that has been done, the Financial Technology variable has a significant 
positive effect on Business Sustainability because it has a T-Statistic value greater than 1.96, namely 5.962 and 
P-Value less than 0.05, namely 0.003, these results in line with the opinion (Gomber. P, 2017) but according to 
several other researchers, these results still need to be reconsidered considering that FinTech is a new thing in the 
business sector. Therefore further research is needed on these results (Al Hammadi, 2019), (Jamil. N, 2019). 
MSMEs must also adapt to changes in business models, such as changing the conventional way of transactions 
using cash to being cashless. Therefore, MSMEs must be able to follow the development of Financial Technology 
and implement it. For example, providing payment methods via an e-wallet such as OVO, GO-PAY, and QRIS. 
This is also related to the reduction of direct contact related to the current COVID-19 pandemic 
Based on the results of the research that has been carried out, the variable Utilization of Big Data Usage 
as a moderator Customer does not have a positive and insignificant effect on Business Sustainability because it 
has a T-Statistic value smaller than 1.96, namely 1.137 and P- The value is more than 0.05, which is 0.255. It 
tends to weaken the relationship between the Customer (X2) variable and the Business Sustainability (Z) variable. 
However, the research conducted by (El Hilali. W, 2020) using Big Data as an intervening or mediating variable 
got results contrary to this research. MSMEs should use Big Data because it contains qualitative information 
related to market conditions and market demand and information about consumers (customers), such as what

MSMEs still do not understand the use of Big Data, so the use of Big Data is still not optimal. 
Based on the results of the research that has been carried out, the variable Utilization of Big Data Usage 
as a moderator of Competition does not have a positive and insignificant effect on Business Sustainability because 
it has a T-Statistic value that is smaller than 1.96, namely 1.922 and P-Value is more than 0.05, which is 0.055, 
and tends to weaken the relationship between the Competition (X1) variable and the Business Sustainability (Z) 
variable. But research conducted by research (El Hilali. W, 2020) that uses Big Data as an intervening or mediating 
variable gets results contrary to this study. Awareness of MSMEs in the Utilization of Big Data must be considered 
because this is very important to serve as an analytical tool capable of becoming MSME business planning 
information. However, the reality on the ground is from the results of this study that not many MSMEs understand 
and understand how to work and process Big Data. In this case, the government is expected to be able to make 
MSMEs aware of the importance of Big Data.

Abstract 
The present investigation was carried out in a food manufacturing company in Metropolitan Lima, specifically in the 
Meats and sausages industry category. The investigation is focused on three stuffing machines within the sausage 
production line. The problem is the low overall efficiency expressed by the OEE indicator, which initially was an 
average of 60.479% for the three stuffing machines, compared to the world-class OEE, which according to Nakajima, 
is 85%. In order to improve the OEE indicator, the company implemented the use of Shoplogix software and applied 
lean manufacturing methodologies in its sausage production lines. Due to this, the main objective was to describe the 
impact generated by implementing lean manufacturing methodologies in the OEE. For this, information was collected 
from primary sources for four weeks, and historical data of four years was used on the OEE indicator, and the main 
problems detected in the stuffing machines. Finally, normality and Student's t-tests were performed, showing that 
implementing lean manufacturing methodologies positively impacted the OEE, increasing an average of 5.9583%. It 
was also shown that the software-generated implementation significantly changed the OEE's data collection and 
calculation. This improvement is translated into more than 2 million dollars in savings from its implementation until 
2021.

1716","Hi: The OEE had an increase of less than 5%. 
 
For this comparison of OEE, information was taken from 16 weeks of OEE between the periods comprised by week 
34 and week 52 of 2019; these data were compared with data from the OEE of 16 weeks from periods comprised 
between week one and week 16 of 2021, the use of data from the year 2020 was avoided due to the large amount of 
atypical data generated, for the most part, by the measures imposed to mitigate the COVID 19 pandemic. 
 
When performing the normality test, the Shapiro-Wilk test was chosen because there are 16 data points per period. 
For machine 1, a significance of 0.340 and 0.797 was obtained for the 2019 and 2021 periods. For machine 2, a 
significance of 0.305 was obtained for the 2019 period and 0.768 for the 2021 period. For machine 3, a significance 
of 0.255 for the 2019 period and 0.88 for the 2021 period. It was shown that a normal distribution is followed. 
 
The student t-test was performed for a sample in the three stuffing machines; a significance of 0.06 was obtained for 
machine 1, 0.06 for machine 2, and 0.046 for machine 3. The three-student t-tests obtained a factor coefficient greater 
than 0.05; therefore, the null hypothesis was accepted. This means that it was statistically verified that the increase in 
OEE was greater than 5% in the three stuffing machines. 
The initial hypothesis was accepted, statistically verifying that machine 1 had an average increase of 6.9375% in the 
OEE, machine 2 had an average increase of 5.5000%, and machine 3 had an average increase of 5.4375%. 
6. Conclusion 
The results obtained through validation using the SPPS statistical software reflected that the data collection underwent 
a significant change and then replaced the manual method with an automated method using the Shoplogix software. 
To verify this statement, a normality test was performed at periods before and after the change of method for 
measurement, and a student t-test was performed to demonstrate the significant change in measurement. Then, to 
demonstrate the significant change in the OEE, a normality test was performed again on the data under analysis, and 
it was determined that they follow a normal distribution. Consequently, another student t-test was used, and through 
the P factor, it was demonstrated that the hypothesis was fulfilled where it was proposed that the OEE indicator had 
an average increase of more than 5% for the three filling machines analyzed after applying the methodologies lean 
manufacturing on production lines; specifically, the OEE indicator has an average increase for stuffing machines of 
5.9583%. This increase was reflected in savings by the company of approximately 2 million dollars between 2020 and 
2021. 
 
When analyzing the present and previous related investigations, it was possible to affirm that the application of lean 
manufacturing methodologies had a positive effect and generated an increase in the OEE indicator.

Abstract  
Business in the food and beverage industry is currently growing rapidly. Changes in people's lifestyles, including food 
consumption styles, lead to instant food, one of which is frozen food. The frozen food product business industry is 
considered profitable, making competition in this field quite high. This is also supported by the style of people who 
currently like to shop online in e-commerce. With this, many people see the business of selling on e-commerce. This 
research aims to determine the effect of consumer reviews and stars, influencer reviews, and group references on 
consumer purchasing decisions. This research will find out what factors can encourage purchasing decisions for frozen 
food products based on the relationship shown in the results of the research. Analysis of research data will use the method 
of Structural Equation Modeling with Partial Least Square (PLS) model. The data will be processed assisted by the 
Microsoft Excel application and the SmartPLS 3.0 application. In this research, the questionnaire was filled out by 190 
respondents and then removed according to the respondent's profile that matched the research so that as many as 169 
respondents could be processed. The independent variables in this research are consumer reviews and stars (X1), 
influencer reviews (X2), and reference groups (X3) while the dependent variable in research on purchasing decisions 
(Y). The results showed that each independent variable had a positive and significant effect on purchasing decisions.

1. Introduction  
Food and beverage is one of the largest industries. Many entrepreneurs are trying their luck in the food and beverage 
industry because it has good potential and rapid development (Wijiati and Santosa 2013). The dynamics of society is 
increasing along with changes in the strategic environment in business development that cause changes in customer 
lifestyles, including shifts in food consumption patterns (Santoso et al. 2018). The instant food that is often chosen by 
the public is frozen food (Anggraeni et al. 2014). According to Purwaningsih et al. (2021), frozen food has a growth rate

1727",,"make buying and selling transactions. So, the entrepreneur in the food and beverage industry, especially frozen food, 
can use marketing techniques by involving several influencers, both celebrities, vloggers, bloggers or someone who 
has an influence on the right target market. Influencers are able to become role models related to one's lifestyle so 
that many people follow what an influencer does. 
4.  
5. Reference group has a positive and significant influence on purchasing decisions. Based on data processing from this 
research, the results show that references from friends, relatives, or family related to a product can be an 
encouragement for someone to make buying and selling transactions. So, the entrepreneur must maintain relationships 
with their customers because product purchase references from friends, family, or relatives can encourage someone 
to make buying and selling transactions. It is not infrequently someone recommends buying something and, in this 
research, it can be a trigger for a purchase decision.

Abstract  
Micro, small, and medium enterprise or MSME activities are one of the businesses that can develop and be consistent 
in this pandemic era. MSME become a good container in job creation that is planned by the government, private 
sector, and individual actors. Many MSME are engaged in food and beverages such as coffee shops. This article 
discusses about the use of social media in terms of digital marketing that has been done by Ijo Coffee Shop Malang. 
As a results, Digital marketing is very profitable for coffee shop business actors today. Because this uncertain 
pandemic situation makes visitors limited. However, with the marketing that can be done on social media, this is very 
helpful for business continuity. Because the introduction and promotion through social media is very fast. 
Furthermore, business actors are also easier to target the desired target market. The owner of the coffee shop business 
ijo admits that he must have the ability to manage social media and be familiar with social media so as not to stutter 
technology. The lack of a team in managing the digital marketing of ijo coffee shops is a challenge that must be of 
particular concern. Because in managing digital marketing, a solid and planned team is needed to be more able to 
achieve good sales figures.

TikTok is one of the most widely used social media in Indonesia. Apart from being used for personal entertainment, 
social media launched by ByteDance from China is also increasingly being used by institutions for marketing 
purposes. Some of them are educational institutions’ marketing teams that use TikTok for branding and promotion. 
There is a communication and coordination process flow that makes the planning to execution stages run smoothly, 
but it is possible that there are obstacles too. Departing from that background, the author's goal is to analyze the 
communication processes, as well as the obstacles faced by the marketing team of private education institution in 
Malang in creating TikTok content. This study uses a qualitative method with a case study approach to the marketing 
team of a private university in Malang. The data collection technique was carried out by conducting in-depth 
interviews with the marketing division staff of Binus Malang and strengthened by documents and observations. The 
results of the research show that the marketing team brings a collaborative and open communication environment, so 
that a dynamic two-way communication is formed. Barriers that occur such as miscommunication and lack of 
discipline from the talent team. Another problem that happens is that Person in Charge (PIC) and the timeline makers 
sometimes have difficulty to come up with new ideas and plans the timeline because their schedules collide with 
college and work.

Abstract 
ERP is a business tool that gather all the data and processed them into information and knowledge. In order to use the 
tools, ERP system needs to be implemented in the company with adequate technological facilities. ERP 
implementation can be influenced by various factors. Developing countries, such as Indonesia, have a lot of successes 
and failures of ERP implementation. This review studies the effect of communication, knowledge, and capability of 
stakeholders on the success of ERP implementation in Indonesia. Each successes and challenges in implementing ERP 
is classified using rule-based classifier and analyzed to form a judgement. The result shows that communication, 
knowledge, and capability have a moderate influence in overall ERP implementation.

Abstract 
At present, the use of ERP in developing countries, especially in developed countries, is of great concern, because in 
developed countries it is still being developed, especially for SMEs and still paying attention to large companies, so 
that all can make good use of ERP and have a beneficial impact on the company. This paper describes some of the 
advantages, challenges, success factors, differences before and after, and differences in ERP implementation in 
developing countries and in developed countries. Because if you look at it, there are still ERP implementation failures 
that cause losses for companies that invest in ERP and make other companies afraid or don't want to invest in ERP. 
So, the purpose of this paper is to explain that ERP utilization can be maximized and benefit the company such as 
reducing costs, more efficiency, and others if you take advantage of other approaches in ERP implementation such as 
CSF, ISP, and BPR.

Social Media, Promotional activities, User Interest 
 
1. Introduction 
Activities in cyberspace, especially in communication media such as social media, people can easily find or get 
entertainment and the latest information. Social media is not only a communication medium, but social media users 
can share and exchange information through photos or videos with other users (Kanwar 2012), Social media users in 
Indonesia were around 150 million in 2019, and there was an increase in 2020, amounting to 160 million users 
(Pusparisa 2020). Therefore, social media can be used or utilized as a media platform that can provide information 
quickly to many users, one of which is utilization in promotional activities. Promotional activities can provide 
information or interact with other users, making promotional activities effective and interesting. Promotions are 
carried out on social media, such as businesses. Users who have creative ideas such as pictures, photos, videos, and 
music can use social media as a medium for promotion. Social media in this research focuses on social media called 
Instagram. The researchers chose Instagram based on the large number of users in Indonesian society. According to 
GoodnewsForIndonesia.com, there were 62,230,000 Instagram users in January 2020, and in May 2020, there was an 
increase in users to 69,270,000 Instagram users in Indonesia (M. Iman 2020). 
 
1.1 Scope 
Social media is a medium used to socialize and a platform where people can search or provide information to each 
other online, allowing people to interact freely without being limited by space and time. In social media, users can 
discuss or exchange ideas with each other. Instagram social media is a group of applications using an internet base 
and web 2.0 technology that allows the exchange and creation of user-generated content, which can be called content 
created by users who create user-generated content. It can be in the form of photos, videos and also music (Haenlein 
2010), so in social media, people as users can provide their content or work, which will be uploaded later, and the

The diagram using the Instagram Live feature shows that the data in cluster 1 or marked in blue is higher than the data 
in cluster 2, which is marked in green. So in cluster 1, the use of the Instagram Live feature is more positive or has a 
greater value. 
 
Figure 6. Cluster data Diagram Base on gender and time of use Instagram 
 
In the results of cluster data processing, it is known in the table that cluster 1 and cluster 2 have the largest number of 
time data that are often used, namely at night, in which men and women dominate. In Cluster 1, it was found in the 
afternoon and morning, there were more male users than female users, and in the afternoon, there were more female 
users than male users. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The conclusion of the research ""Utilization of Social Media Platforms in Promotional Activities by Analyzing User 
Interests"", which has been examined on the results of the questionnaire on data collection, is that the feature variable 
in Instagram X3 has a significant influence on user Y interest which features are used to interact with other users. For 
people who want to try to do business using social media platforms, especially on Instagram social media, they can 
pay a little attention to the type of content that will be uploaded or promoted, and pay full attention to the use of 
features on Instagram, choose features that can make business promotions interesting with the use of Tag or Hashtag 
feature which can be used as keywords for every business in every uploaded post so when other users want to find or 
are interested, they will be able to find the post. The second is Instagram Stories which can be used as an attractive 
promotional feature that can be used by every business that wants to do a short or long promotion. The Instagram 
stories feature is very easy to see by other users, so it can easily attract the attention of other users. The third feature

activities. Other users can easily and quickly interact or ask questions. When doing promotions, it can be done better 
at night because, seen from data processing results with Clustering data mining, Instagram social media users use 
social media more at night.

Abstract 
 
This study applied Data Mining method to cluster sales transactions at Abie JM Stores experienced a decline in 
sales. Therefore, a strategy was needed to increase sales again. One way that can be done to determine customer 
needs is to analyze sales transaction data. The sales transaction data can be further processed to obtain more helpful 
information to increase income, sales, and purchase turnover. Data mining by using k-means grouping or clustering. 
Data mining can be used to find. solutions in making sales decisions to increase revenue. Sales data storage stores a 
large number of sales transaction records, where each record provides products purchased by consumers in each 
sales transaction. From the calculation results, it can be concluded that the k-means clustering method can support 
the system well. Therefore we need a data processing process using a data mining technique. This study's data 
collection process uses the interview process and shopping transaction data collection

The results of iteration 2 obtained C1 as many as 3 products, C2 as many as 11 products, and C3 as many as 168 
products and continued to the next iteration until there was no change in results. The results of clustering in 
iterations 1 and 2 are not the same, then the grouping is carried out again with Fuzzy K-Means with the same steps 
for the next iteration until the results obtained are the same, and in iteration 5 the same clustering results have been 
obtained with the previous iteration, namely : (Table 9)

Based on the results obtained, C1 is categorized as a product that has the lowest level of sales, there are 3 products, C2 is 
categorized as a product that has a moderate level of sales, there are 12 products, and C3 is categorized as a product with a high 
level of sales, there are 167 products. So clusters with low and moderate sales levels need to be considered by business managers 
to evaluate so that income increases at the Abie JM store. 
 
5. Conclusion  
From the results of processing and discussion using fuzzy K-Means, it can be concluded that the sales level clustering based on 
low sales levels, medium sales levels, and high sales levels at the Abie JM store in 2022, namely: 
1. 
The first cluster is categorized as products with low sales levels. There are 3 products. 
2. 
The second cluster is categorized as products with a moderate level of sales. There are 12 products. 
3. The third cluster is categorized as products with a high level of sales. There are 167 products.

Abstract 
 
Numerous studies have demonstrated and explored YouTube as distribution platform and information resources 
through content, quality and quantity of the video. However, few studies have examined the institution behind the 
account, and this article assesses how television station utilize this video-sharing website. This study explored the 
inside of the official YouTube Channel from television stations in Indonesia via content under different attentional 
focus cues to analyse how the television stations strategized their presence in YouTube ecosystem among another 
YouTube channel in the same niche. YouTube videos were used by television stations to archive and broadcast 
shortened-clip of TV shows, exclusive snapshot, and edited-version TV shows on a regular base after the actual TV 
shows broadcasted on TV. Qualitative analysis revealed difference between television stations for production 
YouTube videos as the social media content. The difference at the content and post scheduling were unique takes in 
the same niche followed by call-to-action and invitation to watch the TV shows in their airtime. Content strategy 
focuses on giving more information and backstage shot on a particular show that expected to attract more audience to 
the TV shows. Television station should be acutely aware of the conversation that YouTube viewers use in the 
interaction within the content, even among their peers.

6. Conclusion  
This paper examines the utilization of YouTube platform as channel to archive and promote programs and shows form 
television stations. 
 
From a social media perspective, television stations seem to be use content, quality, and quantity to presence for the 
audiences for improving outreaching within digital space. The findings show that content from these television station 
YouTube channel gained significant attention and interaction. They uploaded content from the snippet of their 
programs and shows and directed audiences to see more on TV or any other in-house platforms. Considering content 
strategy, the data shows that the television stations also follow trends to post UGC to their channel. In particular, the 
level of interaction expected to be higher when channel not really associated with corporation instead associated with 
personal peer content. These YouTube channel contents were boosted by the quality of television industry which take 
the audiovisual element into high consideration compared to other industry entering YouTube ecosystem. In this 
context, quantity of content in these channels could gain advantages form repurpose the content from TV programs 
and shows, especially taking snippet from the shows. In fact, this snippet content is the most uploaded type to these 
channel that might rise corporate engagement.   
   
From the media type point of view, it is important to point out that in the Web 4.0 scenario, industries characterized 
by presence and interaction in digital environment and open a platform for audiences to engagement in multimedia 
platform. Due to the social media interactivity nature, digital presence on YouTube can represent both a serious brand 
and an amazing opportunity of diverse audiences in video-sharing website.

Abstract 
 
Order picking and warehouse management is a key activity in any replenishment strategy. An inventory management 
model is proposed which can be managed through indicators such as order picking time and inventory turnover. For 
this purpose, a combination of different methods such as ARIMA forecasting, economic lot sizing (EOQ), 5S strategy 
and ABC technique were combined and taken to a simulation through ARENA software. Finally, the MAPE indicators 
were reduced from a range of 47.44% up to 79.39% to range of 5.93% up to 37.47%, which is the result of an initial 
situation versus a later improved one, as well as an increase in inventory turnover and a reduction in total order 
preparation time.

1. Introduction  
In these times of globalized competition, the supply chain of commercial business models must respond to the dynamic 
requirements of the market through factors such as integrated inventory management, lead time reduction and supply 
chain agility (Singh, 2015); on the other hand, according to Staudt et. Al (2015), it is also important to highlight 
dispatch time and inventory turnover of products that make up these dispatches. These are configured within the 
internal logistics of a company, planning, execution and control of the physical flow and internal information, whose 
purpose is to find the optimization of resources, processes, and services with the greatest possible economy (Pinheiro 
et al, 2017). This is how, order fulfillment becomes important, since it also includes human resources and the 
development of this activity in the storage and dispatch area can contribute to design a better order preparation system 
(Groose,2014). Thus, slotting (storage) and order picking activities that require human capital, are fundamental in the 
warehouse administration system and supply chain management, as they can represent more than half of the running 
and operating costs (Duque et al, 2020). Therefore, it is important to study these factors in the commercial sector, 
addressing problems such as the duration of order dispatch time and product inventory turnover, because these can 
affect the economic and logistical performance of a company's supply chain. Under these concepts, improvements can 
be made in certain processes and measured through logistics indicators such as order fulfillment time and inventory 
turnover (Almaktoom, 2017).  
 
This paper has been structured as follows: Sections 2 and 3 describe the literature reviewed and our research 
methodology. Section 4 discusses data treatment and collection processes. Section 5 provides results and the 
improvements proposed. Finally, Section 6 presents our conclusions and recommendations for future lines of research 
on the subject matter.

6. Conclusion  
The proposed improvement results increase the annual inventory turnover, because it reduces the number of immobile 
inventories after making planned supplies; the level of service, because it increases the number of customers properly 
served; the inventory coverage rate, because it provides a better response to unexpected demands in the supply time 
and the considerable improvement in terms of order preparation time, so it is proven that the customer will have to 
wait less to get his order. 
 
In addition, it is possible to generate a reduction in picking times by applying the 5S strategy and the ABC technique 
to the spaces within the warehouse. Also, a better replenishment process is generated after the optimization of 
inventory turnover using the ARIMA forecasting method and economic order-lot planning (EOQ). 
 
Therefore, the proposed model would improve the current scenario of the case study on which the research was carried 
out; however, better results can be obtained if it is supported by another prediction method such as the exponential 
smoothing used in this case study.

Abstract 
 
Creative performance is essential for creative companies in the game industry, especially when the competition is 
getting higher. This study aims to see how a high-performance work system, organizational creative climate, and 
creative process engagement can improve creative performance in game companies. This study used a survey to collect 
data. A total of 123 respondents participated, and the data was analyzed using SmartPLS 3. Results show that both 
organizational creative climate and creative process engagement significantly affect creative performance. 
Furthermore, both also act as mediating factors between a high-performance work system and creative performance. 
A high-performance work system surprisingly does not have any direct effect on creative performance. Still, it has a 
significant indirect effect on creative performance when creative process engagement and organizational creative 
climate are used as the mediator. Thus, this study provides the theoretical and empirical basis for factors affecting 
game companies’ creative performance.

and creative performance. All three factors are essential to increase the game companies’ creative performance. 
 
There are several limitations to this study. First, this study only analyzed data from the game industry’s employees. 
Future research in other creative industries is strongly recommended. Next, this study was done during the COVID-
19 pandemic situation. It will be interesting for future studies to do the research after the pandemic and compare the 
results. Finally, since this study focused on human capital, testing the creative performance from other aspects such 
as financial, entrepreneurship, or marketing will enrich this study.

Abstract 
 
This paper presents a bibliometric review of 303 studies on Industry 4.0 (I4.0) in the defense sector obtained from 
the Web of Science (WoS) platform, published in 227 academic circles, authored by 1211 academics. The objective 
was to broadly and comprehensively identify the concept of I4.0 within the defense sector and identify future 
research paths. The documents were analyzed using the Bibliometrix tool in the R software. Based on citation 
analysis metrics, we revealed the most influential articles, journals, authors and institutions. Using the bibliographic 
coupling methodology, we identified four research clusters: (1) Additive Manufacturing, 3D printing, spare parts, 
(2) Internet of Things, Deep Learning, military, (3) Machine Learning, suicide, prediction and (4) Systems, Artificial 
Intelligence, Expert System.The clusters were analyzed in detail and then a research agenda was proposed.

1. Introduction 
The technological advances in supply chain management brought about by I4.0 have been the object of study in the 
academic field and in the industry motivated by the temporal rupture of how logistics was thought before such 
advances and how it would represent a significant point of strategic advantage (Masood & Sonntag, 2020), however, 
digital transformation is not just about implementing new technologies in isolation, but about evaluating the benefits 
and challenges arising from such implementation, suited to the company's reality, both in terms of structure and 
business purpose (Zeller et al., 2018). 
 
Having pacified the understanding that I4.0 represents a disruptive milestone for the industry, when we turn our eyes 
to the defense sector, we can see the relevance of a more detailed study in this area that depends heavily on 
technological advances, investments in Research and Development (R&D), robust engineering practices and a 
trained and qualified workforce to face the country's defense challenges. These challenges stem from a variety of 
sources that include the pressing need to quickly adapt to an ever-changing operational and threat environment (de 
Mattos Nascimento et al., 2022), in addition to tight budgets, aggressive schedules, and a risk-averse organizational 
culture (Zimmerman et al., 2019). 
 
The defense and security problems of the present day are much more complex than those of other times, due to their 
global impact and the possibilities of the new digital technologies applied, as well as the “smart” weaponry used 
(Marín, 2020). If, according to Sony and Naik (2020), the topic I4.0 is still little studied, although there has been a 
great growth of studies on it in the recent years, its application within the defense industries is an even more obscure 
subject and, after evident importance demonstrated, it deserves academic attention in order to find gaps in the 
literature that allow more specific research.

Research topic 
Cluster 
Justification 
What are the practical implications of 3D 
printing in the manufacture of products 
aimed at the defense industry? 
1 
The studies present in this cluster show a great applicability of 
additive manufacturing in the design of products for the most 
diverse sectors. Knowing the implications of implementing this 
technology in the defense sector would meet the expectations of a 
dynamic and error-averse sector. 
How can blockchain be used to integrate the 
various industries that make up the defense 
sector? 
2 
The studies present in this cluster demonstrate that blockchain has 
the ability to optimize processes and facilitate coordination 
between different companies with a high level of security. Such 
characteristics are fundamental for the defense sector that, given 
the nature of the transactions it carries out, the integration of the 
agents involved in the process in a safe way is essential. 
How can Internet of Things (IoT) and Deep 
Learning concepts affect the logistics 
operations of the defense industries? 
2 
The logistics of defense industries need rapid adaptability and 
flexibility to meet unforeseen scenarios characteristic of a sector 
linked to the security of a country. In this way, the concepts of IoT 
and deep learning, as discussed in the studies of this cluster, are 
promising for the sector.

in defense industries. 
3 
A set of studies will allow you to have an overview of the I4.0 in 
the Defense Sector and therefore empirical evidence on the 
impacts that the technologies inherent in I4.0 generate on the 
operational performance of companies. 
Challenges for the implementation of I4.0 
technologies in defense industries. 
4 
According to the studies of this cluster, the implementation of 
artificial intelligence brings numerous challenges for companies. 
A study covering other technologies would provide a more 
concrete view on the subject and could be used by companies in 
the defense sector as a reference for the implementation process. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study comprehensively analyzed the concept of industry 4.0 through bibliometric techniques already 
consolidated by the doctrine as an adequate and relevant research design. 
 
We found that the concept of I4.0 in the defense industries is an autonomous research domain. We identified the 
main journals, articles, institutions and authors within this research domain and found the collaborative network of 
universities and authors. We mapped the conceptual framework of I4.0 in the defense industry, identifying and 
exploring research clusters. Finally, a research agenda was proposed that, although not exhaustive, will allow the 
subject to be dissected to the point of obtaining a consolidated theoretical framework. 
 
As a result of this study, it became clear that this is a field of research still unexplored by researchers and that it 
needs a lot of attention given the importance of a country's defense industries for both its national sovereignty and 
its economy.

Abstract 
 
The aim of this research is to investigate the factors affecting customer satisfaction and customer loyalty in digital 
health service. The independent variables are System Quality and Service Quality. The purposive samples are 102 
respondents in Jakarta area. The study reveals that ease of use in system quality and assurance, and empathy from 
service quality influence the customer satisfaction. There is no mediation effect found on customer satisfaction. 
This study concludes the importance of ease of use, assurance, and empathy in gaining customer satisfaction. 
Moreover, this research confirmed the positive relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. 
From the management perspective, this research suggested several action plans that could be implemented by 
telemedicine services providers to improve their customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. From the 
management perspective, they can improve the response time, security, and responsiveness to better satisfy and 
increase customer loyalty.

1. Introduction  
Covid 19 pandemic boost the usage of mobile digital health service. However, this research will focus on the 
evaluation of telemedicine services via mobile application. The mobile application is chosen since the recent data 
found that 96.4% of internet users in Indonesia prefer to access the internet via their smartphones. In Indonesia, 
Halodoc application is one of the most popular telemedicine service providers, reported that its telemedicine 
application has been used by 20 million users during Q2 2021.  
 
Recent research on telemedicine services has focused on the barrier to telemedicine services adoption (Samarraie 
et al., 2020; Zobair, 2019) and technology development (Ahmad et al., 2021). Many of the works are carried out 
without considering the dimension of satisfaction and loyalty as critical aspects in telemedicine services.

1809","Furthermore, including a mediator in the analysis has further helped in determining under what conditions Service 
Quality and System Quality could advance Customer Loyalty. From the study results, customer satisfaction did 
not have any mediating role in the relationship between system quality dimensions (ease of use, response time, 
security) and customer loyalty. In addition, the relationship between service quality dimensions (responsiveness, 
assurance, empathy) and customer loyalty is not mediated by customer satisfaction. These finding outcomes 
contradict the result of previous studies that support mediating role of customer satisfaction between system 
quality and customer loyalty (Ngoc Duy Phuong & Thi Dai Trang, 2018; Wilson et al., 2020); and between service 
quality and customer loyalty (Hadi et al., 2019; Slack & Singh, 2020). 
 
This research demonstrated the relationship between system quality dimensions (ease of use, response time, 
security), service quality dimensions (responsiveness, assurance, empathy), customer satisfaction, and customer 
loyalty. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study concludes the importance of ease of use, assurance, and empathy in gaining customer satisfaction. 
Moreover, this research confirmed the positive relationship between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. 
From the management perspective, this research suggested several action plans that could be implemented by 
telemedicine services providers to improve their customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. 
 
Research Limitation and Suggestions for Future Research 
First, there’s a gap between initial target respondents (150 respondents) and the valid responses (102 respondents). 
There might be an issue with the representativeness of the sample since the valid responses are limited. Future 
research should provide more valid responses to represent the population. Second, the moderating effect of 
demographic factors and education in this study has not been considered, the results of the effect of demographic 
factors and education on telemedicine customer satisfaction and customer loyalty would provide better insights 
in future research. Lastly, customer loyalty and customer satisfaction have been measured in terms of system 
quality dimensions (ease of use, response time, security) and service quality dimensions (responsiveness, 
assurance, empathy). Future research might explore other important indicators i.e efficiency, fulfilment, perceived 
usefulness, customer trust, and brand perception for further investigation.

Abstract 
 
The aim is to understand the relationship that predicts consumer intentions towards digital healthcare applications.  
The independent variable is Trust, Privacy, Perceived usefulness, Perceived ease of use, Resistance to technology, 
and Technological Anxiety and the dependent variable is Usage Intetion. The designed model was tested on the 
results of a survey of 270 respondents who actively use digital healthcare applications in Jakarta. Normality, 
validity, and structural equation (SEM) analysis were used to conceptualize the model and validate the seven 
hypotheses that had been designed. The results show that perceived usefulness and trust are factors that positively 
influence consumer intentions in Jakarta to use digital healthcare applications. In summary, this study can provide 
an empirical contribution to the literature on the factors that influence consumer intentions in Jakarta to use digital 
healthcare applications.

1. Introduction 
Digital healthcare application is the use of digital telecommunication tools to provide information and health 
services with a broad scope with the aim of improving public health. This digital healthcare application allows 
health practitioners to monitor and provide health checks remotely without compromising the quality of health 
services (save time, flexible, and high quality service) (Esmaeilzadeh et al., 2010). This digital healthcare 
application technology certainly has a positive impact on the community in Jakarta, where with a population of 
more than 11.25 million people, there are still obstacles in providing health services to consumers in remote areas

1818","6. H4 (Perceived ease of use positively affects usage intention to use digital healthcare application) 
Based on the test results, the correlation of p values shows a positive value (p values 0.002, lower than the 
standard 0.05). This is consistent with and is also supported by previous research conducted by Daud et al, 
2018, which suggests that the adoption of technology acceptance through the perceived ease of use variable 
is a very strong influence on consumer confidence. 
 
7. H5 (Resistance to technology positively influences usage intention to use digital healthcare application) 
In a previous study conducted by Safi, 2018, it was stated that the adoption of new technology in health 
services is believed to encourage consumers to be more enthusiastic in using digital healthcare applications. 
However, in a study conducted with a demographic scope in Jakarta, technological barriers showed a 
negative correlation value (p values 0.725, higher than the standard 0.05). 
 
8. H6 (Technological Anxiety positively affects usage intention to use digital healthcare application) 
In a previous study conducted by Tsai et al, 2020,  suggested that technology anxiety can affect the perception 
of computer users. However, in a study conducted with a demographic scope in Jakarta, technology anxiety 
showed a negative correlation value (p-value 0.085, higher than the standard 0.05). 
Managerial Implications 
From a managerial point of view, the main implication of this research is that technology that focuses on health 
services is currently highly developed and competitive for people who need health services of high quality and 
affordable cost. Therefore, management must find the best way to understand the factors that can increase 
consumer acceptance of technology. This study shows that factors such as perceived ease of use and trust greatly 
influence consumer intentions to use digital healthcare applications. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The conclusions that can be drawn from the results of this study include: 
1. Trust variable affects consumer's intention to use digital healthcare application. 
2. Trust variable through perceived usefulness affects consumer's intention to use digital healthcare application. 
3. Privacy variable does not affect consumer's intention to use digital healthcare application. 
4. Privacy variable through perceived ease of use does not affect consumer's intention to use digital healthcare 
application. 
5. The Perceived Usefulness variable does not affect consumers' intentions to use digital healthcare 
applications. 
6. The Perceived Ease of Use variable affects consumers' intention to use digital healthcare applications. 
7. The Resistance to Technology variable does not affect consumers' intention to use digital healthcare 
application services. 
8. Technological Anxiety variable does not affect consumers' intention to use digital healthcare application 
services.

Abstract 
 
Peru stands out as a country with a textile industry in constant development, which has made world-class brands set 
their eyes on its productive quality. Likewise, in order to achieve the growth of these industries, the workers of these 
industries have to work long and arduous hours, without taking the importance that is due, in some cases, to the well-
being and comfort of each worker. Ergonomics allows to identify the environment that helps to avoid occupational 
diseases and productivity. A workstation in the right conditions allows an increase in productivity since the human 
resource is something very important and is not yet fully prioritized by all industries. In the present work, the 
ergonomic factors of a cutting station, as well as its physical conditions of lighting and noise, are considered in order 
to redesign it. The objective of this project is, through the implementation of appropriate ergonomic and physical 
conditions in a workstation in the cutting area of a textile company, to increase productivity and reduce the risks of 
occupational diseases. An analysis of the three postures that caused the most fatigue to the operators was carried out 
through the ERP (Rapid Postural Evaluation) method, in order to identify the level of performance required and the 
improvements that the station needed. In addition, five KPI's were used to measure productivity before and after the 
redesign and identify its increase. The results obtained were positive, as an increase of up to 20% in productivity and 
in the level of operator satisfaction was evidenced.  
 
This work will serve as a guide to be implemented in future stations in the textile industry and provide a clear 
methodology for evaluating ergonomics and measuring productivity.

1. Introduction  
Since pre-Hispanic times, Peru has been classified as a textile country, not only for the quality of its raw materials and 
fibers, but also for the quality of its yarns. Its high levels of quality position Peru as a country with a differentiation 
superior to the rest of its competitors (Pino, 2012). However, it is remarkable the impulse that must be generated on 
the textile industry; however, to achieve such growth it is necessary to focus on the labor force in charge within the 
industries. For this, long hours of hard work will be necessary, so it will be vital to offer the ideal conditions in their 
respective work area. The concept that encompasses these concepts is ergonomics and its application to the workplace. 
It relates the presence of the worker and their respective workstation during its use, in addition to establishing a series 
of benefits around it (Rodríguez-Ruiz & Pérez-Mergarejo, 2010). For the present research, the cutting area, composed 
of 25 workstations of a Peruvian textile company, was used as the object of observation. For confidentiality reasons,

1825","way so that the observation experience provided further enrichment to the project. Also, the current noise of the cutting 
station is 81 dB, which is within an acceptable permissible level. This was achieved by replacing the old manual 
cutting machines with automated machines that emit a lower noise level. In addition, personal protective equipment 
(PPE) was added for the care and protection of each operator for certain activities or whenever they request it to avoid 
any discomfort or occupational disease. 
 
 The increase in productivity is directly related to the improvement in the physical conditions of the workstation. That 
is, the change in the tables, chairs, light and noise allow the operators to work with a higher performance, since thanks 
to the analysis of postures through the ERP method, the three main postures that caused fatigue to the operators were 
observed, which after the redesign and reapplication of the questionnaire, a greater satisfaction of the workers was 
observed, This is considered an acceptable level, since it means that the workers' satisfaction and postures are better 
and their level of risk of occupational diseases is lower. Because, now with chairs and tables adjusted to each task, 
incorrect inclined and prolonged positions are avoided. The limitation found for the analysis is that the study was only 
applied to one of the two existing shifts, the ideal would have been to analyze the change generated in all employees 
of the plant and the two shifts present. 
 
In addition to the main topic of ergonomics and the productivity generated based on it, as an additional contribution, 
during the experience it was observed that the manufacturing procedure is not ideal, since the analyzed company has 
3 different plants in which the procedures are carried out without considering the option of a production line, in such 
a way that allows the constant and automated flow of raw materials on their way to become the final product. 
One limitation of the present study is that the analysis was conducted for only one work shift.  
 
6. Conclusion  
With the present research work, it can be concluded that the redesign of a station taking into account the ergonomic 
factors of this, allows an increase in productivity, since workers are a fundamental part and the level of satisfaction 
and safety of themselves to work in an area that presents the optimal conditions and without risks.  
 
The activities carried out in good conditions allow the operator to increase his productive capacity. Likewise, there is 
a reduction of future occupational disorders or diseases due to repetitive tasks that may cause discomfort for long 
periods of work in inadequate postures that affect any limb.  
 
Through the applied study, it was possible to verify that, although the concept of ergonomics is an important factor in 
the optimal performance of the collaborators; however, many companies still do not internalize such factor as part of 
what is offered in the workstations of the workers. There is still a long way to go to reduce the high level of indifference 
towards ergonomics and employee satisfaction for the benefit of their performance. 
 
It was observed that the inadequate arrangement of workstations, in such a way that it does not consider the order of 
the operations performed, generates losses of productive time in transporting raw material to each of the plants.

1. Introducción  
Las medidas recomendadas de confinamiento por la pandemia de la COVID-19 han provocado una serie de 
consecuencias en todos los sectores; y mientras la pandemia ha resaltado las diferencias profundas en nuestra sociedad, 
paralelamente ha propiciado la creatividad para buscar soluciones a problemas sociales. Maximino Matus, 
investigador del Departamento de Estudios Sociales de El Colegio de la Frontera Norte (El Colef), comenta que en 
situaciones como las propiciadas por la pandemia, debemos (como sociedad) ser empáticos hacia nuestros pares, 
entender el entorno, salir de la burbuja individual y entender al otro, con el objetivo de resolver problemáticas que 
afectan a todo un territorio dado y, en conjunto, a la sociedad.  El concepto de innovación social, aunque popularizado 
en tiempos recientes, era mencionado y empleado en la década de los 80´s. “En términos simples, la innovación social 
es impulsada por la ciudadanía a través de un proceso de colaboración horizontal para desarrollar soluciones a 
problemáticas cotidianas de sus entornos, las cuales no han podido ser solucionadas de manera adecuada ya sea a 
través de la política pública de los gobiernos”, explica el Dr. Matus.  
 
En la literatura, la innovación social es vista como una poderosa herramienta para superar las adversidades que afectan 
a los grupos más desfavorecidos de la sociedad. La innovación social puede producir cambios profundos por su 
impacto generalizado en la población y puede brindar soluciones personalizadas a problemas de nicho. (Penco, L., 
2022). La innovación concibe por la responsabilidad de garantizar la solidaridad y la igualdad de condiciones de vida 
para los más vulnerables (Mildenberger, G., 2020). La innovación social no solo son acciones creadas y aplicadas

1838","4.6. Responsabilidad Social e Innovación Social 
Las empresas familiares en todo el mundo tienen ciertas características en su comportamiento, principalmente por la 
interacción de la familia en aspectos como la empresa, la propiedad y la gestión. Estas características, tanto internas 
como externas, influyen en que dichas empresas difieran en comportamientos relacionados con el desarrollo de 
prácticas de Responsabilidad Social empresarial y, por consiguiente, en la obtención de ventaja competitiva (Esparza, 
J., 2019). La pandemia de COVID-19 ha brindado otra oportunidad al sistema financiero para mostrar su resiliencia 
con los servicios financieros sociales y demostrar su valía nuevamente y emerger como el verdadero competidor del 
sistema financiero convencional. Se argumenta que las finanzas tienen un papel importante que desempeñar después 
de COVID-19 como la innovación social abierta del sistema financiero (Rabbani, 2021). Asimismo, respecto a las 
empresas sociales humanitarias (HSE), estas se enfrentan a una presión cada vez mayor para incorporar la innovación 
social en su práctica. Según la investigación de Shaheen, I. 2022), sugieren que la disponibilidad de recursos (es decir, 
la escasez frente a la abundancia) lleva a algunos HSE a centrarse en el desarrollo de la innovación social utilizando 
sus capacidades de colaboración, mientras que otros aprovechan su capacidad de absorción. Además, notamos la 
recurrencia a mencionar soluciones a través de ideas novedosas al relacionar la innovación social de las empresas 
sociales con la gestión de crisis. 
 
La innovación social es reconocida por organismos multilaterales como una forma de hacer frente de modo creativo 
y colaborativo a demandas sociales que no son satisfechas, ni desde lo público ni desde lo privado. (Torres, 2021). 
 
“La innovación social suele ser presentada como un instrumento normativo que busca resolver problemas en el ámbito 
social mediante la creación de nuevos servicios o productos. Sin embargo, aquella definición limita incorrectamente 
el campo de acción de la innovación social”. Considerando ello, un problema social no es necesariamente una 
innovación social debido a que pueden optar por otro tipo de soluciones como proyectos en ingeniería u/o programas 
que permitan desarrollar alguna solución. Cuando no referimos a innovaciones sociales, estas no son necesariamente 
tangibles ya que se pueden manifestar también en actitudes, comportamiento, o percepciones, Por último, el aspecto 
social de la innovación se relaciona a un cambio social y este debe ser la característica principal puesta en evidencia, 
tanto en los agentes sociales, sus interacciones y su impacto en el entorno (Merino, 2021). A través de la 
reconfiguración de las relaciones sociales, las comunidades conciben nuevas iniciativas que construyen capital social 
y cultural, lo que les permite adaptarse a los cambios externos y ser más resilientes. Este trabajo está motivado por 
dos aspectos principales: a) la necesidad de mejorar la categorización de la innovación social desde una perspectiva 
territorial; y b) la necesidad de considerar la innovación social específicamente en territorios rurales (Vercher, 2022). 
Los hallazgos ofrecen ideas novedosas al relacionar la innovación social con la Responsabilidad Social, el 
Emprendedurismo, la Educación, Seguridad Alimentaria, en sí, es un tema que ha tomado impulso debido a los casos 
presentados, sobre todo por la compleja situación en la que nos coloca el COVID-19. Asimismo, Basile, G (2022) 
menciona que debe tomar en consideración el hecho de que los diferentes países tienen diferentes prioridades y valores 
que dan forma a la forma en que opera el negocio por lo que a pesar de que la responsabilidad social es una estrategia 
para que mejoren su competitividad y reputación corporativa, también dependerá del contexto en el que se encuentren, 
así como los incentivos que se provean. 
 
5. Conclusiones 
La innovación social ha permitido acercar ese amor al prójimo de una manera desinteresada como se ha visto en las 
iniciativas a nivel mundial que se han destacado en el estudio, que tuvo como pico durante la pandemia del COVID-
19 por el confinamiento y aislamiento social, los contagios y perdidas dolorosas de vidas humanas. Se demostró el 
amor, la creatividad e innovación de las personas brindando facilidades mediante sus emprendimientos e innovaciones.  
La innovación social cobra relevancia en un contexto donde existen una serie de problemas sociales y ambientales 
que evolucionan a gran escala, donde los gobiernos actuales no cubren en su integridad dichos fenómenos, 
percibiéndose la necesidad de recurrir a la innovación social y es prueba que puede enfrentar complejos como el 
COVID-19. En el ámbito educativo, la innovación social permite implementar metodologías de enseñanza, en 
tecnología, facilita la vida financiera de los más pobres, en salud, mediante mejoras de la medicina, acceso al agua 
potable, dispositivos de bioseguridad; todas las iniciativas a raíz de la pandemia del COVID-19. La literatura analizada 
data entre el periodo del 2019 a 2023 por el tema de “Innovación Social” y “Pandemia COVID-19” que bajo una 
estructuración de ecuaciones se realizó la búsqueda en las bases de datos como: Scopus, ScienceDirect, Web of 
Science y SciELO, obteniendo un total de 294 artículos. De acuerdo con lo estudiado, se debe considerar el factor 
humano en el proceso de crear algún servicio o producto que presenta ""resolver tal problemática"", tanto a los actores,

Abstract  
 
The success of Robo Advisor is not only by intention but by the use of the technology and actual implementation by 
users. The rapid growth of internet penetration, online adoption of technology, and government support in Indonesia 
contribute to significant investor growth since 2018 with the presence of technology that makes it easier to open 
accounts and online transactions. Is the presence of Robo advisor technology also expected to be used and be a tool 
in investment decisions? This paper provides a conceptual model to extend potential variables in the usage of Robo 
advisor and behavior investor perspective to use Robo advisor as the decision tools to invest. We use Perceived 
Usefulness as the basic theory of the technology acceptance model and add Investment literacy, Trust, and Perceived 
Risk as variables related to investment decision variables. So that the proposed model can be used as a basis for 
empirical research in the future to validate the context of accepting and actual use of Robo advisors by investors in 
Indonesia

Abstract  
 
Internal combustion engines make use of the increased use of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are very harmful to the 
atmosphere as they emit Greenhouse gases. To overcome these limitations, LNG-driven IC Engines came into 
being. An effort has been made in the current research to study the existing technologies or methods available for 
analyzing the flow performance of LNG-driven IC Engines. The work will also focus on the methods available for 
predicting the pressure and velocity of the gas not only in the engine cylinder but also in the exhaust manifold. 
Various boundary conditions considered for the study are also elaborated. The outcome of the current research work 
would be helpful not only to the academicians and researchers but also to the practitioners.

Abstract 
 
The academic information system of UIN Suska Riau, called Integrated Academic Information System (IRAISE), is 
a web-based information system built with a view to the organization of academic data. The question of whether or 
not was carried out. Therefore, to maintain the quality of an information system, it is necessary to evaluate and factor 
in user satisfaction. End-User Computing Satisfaction (EUCS) is the method used to measure the level of satisfaction 
of the user of the application system by comparing the expectations and realities of the information system, determined 
by variable content, accuracy, format, ease of use, dan timeliness. The number of samples in this study is 97 responded, 
and used Probability Sampling with Stratified Random Sampling. Data analysis techniques using software MINITAB. 
This study collects data using the interview process and distributing questionnaires. From the interview results, it can 
be said that there are things that must be improved in iraise. Such as iraise often experiences errors when many are 
accessing. iraise must continuously be updated. From the evaluation, it can be stated that the user was less content 
with iraise on the format variables with valuation value 2.99, corresponding with value-3.92 value-value 3.06, content 
variable with value-3.16 value-and variable ease of use with value-3.26. This shows the user is less content with the 
Iraise.

Abstract 
 
CV. TMJ (Tuah Mujolai) is a company engaged in manufacturing that produces door frames, window frames, and 
tables. This research focuses on the manufacture of door frame products where this product always has ordered 
every month. In the production process, the make-to-order system is implemented. Based on the results of initial 
observations made by interviewing the company's owner and direct observation, it is known that there are 
indications of related problems. Namely, Waste or nonvalue added activity in the production process such as 
excessive processes, delays, defective products, and transportation. Therefore, to reduce the Waste that occurs, it is 
necessary to apply a Lean Manufacturing approach that uses several tools such as Value Stream Mapping (VSM) to 
visualize the flow of materials from raw materials to finished products and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to find the 
root cause of the Waste that occurs until the end. waste can be reduced or eliminated.

1. Introduction 
With the development of the manufacturing industry that is increasingly competitive in the business world, every 
manufacturing company must be able to increase its productivity from the increasingly fierce industrial competition, 
diverse demands and increasing numbers also make the company grow to provide the best value and facilities and 
improve production lines so that to be effective and efficient, and maintain production results so that the company 
can survive in the business environment. But of course, in every company's production process, there is Waste that 
must be reduced or eliminated. Waste is defined as an activity in production that does not provide added value 
(Febianti et al., 2018). 
 
Reducing Waste in the company is an effort that must be done to encourage companies to continue to win in market 
competence so that productivity and efficiency in the production line of a company can be achieved. To reduce or 
eliminate Waste that occurs, it is necessary to use a Lean Manufacturing approach. The definition of Lean 
Manufacturing is an effort to eliminate Waste in a sustainable manner in an industry as well as to increase the added 
value of a product, this method is also a systemic approach to identify and eliminate Waste through continuous 
improvement (Daulay and Syukriah, 2021).

1875","6. Conclusion 
Based on the processing that has been carried out by the researcher, the conclusion that can be drawn is that the 
product under study is the door frame because the demand for each month is always more. From the analysis of the 
Current Value Stream Mapping, the known wastes are, defect, waiting, overprocessing, and motion. The cause of 
the Waste is analyzed using a fishbone diagram. Proposed improvements to be able to reduce or eliminate Waste 
that occurs is to inspect the machine before the machine is used, such as making a maintenance report card and 
machine maintenance procedure sheet, as well as making a production control card. After the implementation of 
lean manufacturing and recommendations for improvement, Future Value Stream Mapping is made, then after VSM 
is described, it is known that the comparison of the actual lead time value is 2,490 and the actual process efficiency 
cycle is 69.40%, while the proposed lead time value is 1,959 and the proposed process efficiency cycle is 88, 20%. 
So that after improvements are made, the production process is more efficient where the production time reaches the 
target and consumer demand.

Abstract 
 
Technological progress is a good thing, but it also has a big impact on all parties, including the manufacturing, 
which is an influential industry in various sectors. Until competition in the international market is unavoidable, 
this triggers consumers to want high-quality goods. Manufacturing must produce quality products to retain 
consumers, by controlling the production process. This is an effort by the company to maintain consumer trust. In 
addition, the manufacturing must control the quality of its products, because quality is the identity of the company 
to maintain productive production activities. The use of seven quality control tools (7QC) is an effort by the 
manufacturing to maintain quality where these tools are able to control every production process, the seven tools 
are Check Sheet, Histogram, Preto Chart, Control Chart, Scatter Chart, Flow Chart, Fishbone Chart. By using

Abstract  
 
Each region has its characteristics of traditional food, snacks, and drinks. One example of traditional processed 
products is generally made from raw materials of tubers such as cassava and sweet potatoes and also processed from 
fruits and flour (Sari and Nurrizati, 2018). Through optimal inventory control, companies can meet consumer needs 
on time and minimize the cost of raw material inventory to achieve company goals (Lahu, E.R., 2017). This research 
focuses on controlling the inventory of raw materials for chips, which will later be useful for minimizing inventory 
costs to affect the company's benefits. The purpose of this study is to describe raw materials inventory by 
determining the number of ordering lots and calculating the optimum total inventory cost for the company. The 
method used is a continuous review system and a periodic review system by collecting data related to the cost of raw 
material inventory at the UKM Tungku Sanjai Minang Maimbau. The results obtained are the total cost of raw 
material inventory, the optimal order lot size of raw materials by comparing the Q and P methods, and the total cost 
of raw material inventory. The calculation of the two methods is then compared to get the best method for 
controlling the inventory of chip raw materials.

1889","that the method that has the lowest cost is the continuous review system method of IDR 2,652,784,376. So that the 
company using the continuous review system method in controlling the inventory of chip raw materials can save 
inventory costs of IDR 16,558,118.

Conclusion  
The conclusions from the results of the research that have been carried out are as follows: 
1. 
The supply of raw materials for chips at the UKM Tungku Sanjai Minang Maimbau often experiences 
overstock and stockouts. As in the raw material for cassava/yam, the company experienced a shortage of raw 
materials or stockout in May 2021, namely -65 sacks, August 2021 and November, namely -5 sacks. Banana 
raw materials also experienced overstock in January 2022 and February 2022, resulting in bananas being 
damaged due to being stored in the warehouse for too long this resulted in disruption of the production process 
for making chips. company can increase. 
 
2. 
he results of the calculation show that the most optimal number of order lot sizes is using the continuous 
review system (Q) method where the total inventory cost is more efficient than the company's method and the 
periodic review system (P) method. For cassava/yam raw materials, the order time follows the reorder value of 
29 sacks, for taro the reorder value is 25 sacks, for potatoes the reorder value is 23 sacks and for niali bananas 
the reorder value is 23 sacks. 
 
3. 
The actual total cost of inventory at the SME Furnace Sanjai Minang Maimbau is IDR.2,669,342,494 which is 
obtained from the sum of the inventory costs in one year for raw materials for cassava/sweet potato, IDR 
519,371,985, taro IDR.580,132,566, potatoes IDR 837,757,223 and bananas IDR 732. 080.720. To minimize 
the company's inventory costs, calculations are carried out using the continuous review system (Q) and 
periodic review system (P) methods where the calculations that have been carried out show that the continuous 
review system (Q) method produces the minimum total inventory cost of IDR 2,652,784,376. obtained from 
the sum of the cost of supplying raw materials for cassava/yam IDR 521,150,253, taro IDR 574,828,241, 
potatoes IDR 840,607,581 and bananas IDR 716,198,301. 
 
4. 
By calculating the inventory control of raw materials for chips at UKM Tungku Sanjai Minang Maimbau using 
the continuous review system (Q) and periodic review system (P) the total cost of raw material inventory can 
be minimized if using the continuous review system (Q) method, which is equal to IDR.2,652,784,376 
compared to the periodic review system (P) which is IDR 2,657,780,219, while using the company's policy it is 
IDR 2,669,342,494. So from the results of the total cost of inventory using the continuous review system (Q) 
method, it can save 0.62% or around IDR 16,558,118. So that the best inventory method in making decisions 
for controlling the inventory of raw materials for chips in UKM Tungku Sanjai Minang Maimbau is if the 
company uses the continuous review system (Q) method.

Abstract 
 
Technology helps MSMEs to increase sales and expand their sales channels. Currently there is a special m-commerce 
option for online food delivery. In Indonesia, there are already several brands of m-commerce platform providers used 
by MSMEs. This study aims to look at the choice of MSMEs in using online food delivery and what factors are the 
reasons. This study uses a qualitative approach, involving 72 F&B businesses using online food delivery in Bandung, 
Indonesia. Data was collected through an online survey. Data analysis used two coding steps and used cross-case 
analysis to obtain the results. The results obtained from this study are divided into two results, the first are those who 
use the platform and those who do not. Both have decisive factors in use. This research is useful for MSMEs facilitators 
to find out the patterns that occur in the field. Practically, this research also helps online food delivery platforms to 
increase the pull factors in their use, so that they can help MSMEs develop their business more broadly.

The table provides information about the factors of why F&B businesses manage to use online food delivery service. 
According to the data, the factors are widespread into three different categories. Most participants see online food 
delivery as a way to connect with the customers. Sales placed as the second reason, while marketing is considered to 
be the least factor among the three. One respondent revealed that participating in online food delivery is to increase 
engagement with consumers, “so that consumers can access our products from anywhere”. On sales, one respondent 
said, ""the impact of using the application increases our sales"". In terms of marketing, respondents gave their views,

This table provides factors that affect F&B businesses for not using any food delivery services. Overall, we may 
conclude it into three main factors; willing to register, pre-order, and the presence of offline store. In accordance to 
the data, more than a half of participants (52.9%) are actually willing to register their business. Online delivery services 
also become an issue for 21.6% businesses with pre-order system and 9.8% businesses who run an offline store. 
Respondents revealed that they have not yet used willing to register, “Not yet, maybe in the future they will use online 
food delivery. Because by using these apps we can provide attractive promotions and consumers can order them more 
easily.” Another strong reason is that their business is pre-order, so they can't provide it every day like online food 
delivery. This study confirms previous studies related to effectiveness and efficiency in food delivery (Das and Ghose, 
2019; Saad, 2020). 
 
6. Conclusion  
The results obtained from this study are divided into two results, the first are those who use the platform and those 
who do not. In number, there are more of those who have not used online food delivery. However, from the data 
obtained, half of them revealed that they are willing to register, because they are currently preparing their business in

Abstract 
 
In the process of helping MSMEs have good business development through innovation, in e-business, it is necessary 
to have an understanding from the MSMEs' facilitators at Business Incubator. Innovation through product 
development has aspects that need to be considered. The purpose of this research is to focus on the priority aspects 
that MSMEs focus on in product development for their online business development. This research was conducted on 
97 MSMEs through a qualitative approach. The data from the online survey is then processed using 2 stages of coding 
to get a theme, then followed by cross-case analysis. The results showed that there were 4 important aspects in the 
F&B category, namely price, product quality, product photo and marketing. Meanwhile, in the Non-F&B category, 
the important aspects are product quality, marketing, price, and product durability. This research is useful for MSMEs 
assistants from the government, private institutions or campuses. These aspects of the study can make it easier to focus 
on what MSMEs will do in order to develop innovation at the product development stage. So, product development 
in online business can be maximized.

1. Introduction  
E-commerce is impacted by the Covid-19 which has changed habits in the buying and selling process between 
businesses and consumers (Bhatti et al. 2020). In addition, the pandemic has an impact on the increasing use of e-
commerce and mobile commerce by users (Sardjono et al. 2021). MSMEs have an important role in the economic 
development of a country. The number of successful small businesses will help economic development (Menon and 
Varadarajan, 1992; Gunawan et al. 2019). Industry 4.0 has demanded MSMEs to continue to develop their business 
with digital innovations (Tortora et al. 2021). 
 
Innovation capabilities can be presented by utilizing knowledge from various sources, corporate culture in innovation, 
and involving all stakeholders (Rajapathirana and Hui, 2018). In business development, evaluating ideas and making 
improvement ideas, can help entrepreneurs to ensure business in the long term. This skill helps entrepreneurs to 
innovate (Ahmad et al. 2022). Consumers and competitor orientation are factors that influence the success of new 
product development (Floren et al. 2018).

interesting promos"". 
 
If we compare the condition between F&B and non-F&B businesses, they express quite dissimilar opinions. For non 
F&B group, product quality has the most important role with 22.7%, while the F&B group considered two aspects to 
be significant with 14,2% each for product quality and price. In the other side, non-F&B group thought marketing as 
second important factor with 13.6%, and price to be considered after at 11.4%. It is slightly different with F&B group 
which stated photo product with 11.8% and marketing with 11.2%. This study confirms previous research that product 
development can improve business performance (Kohn, 2005). 
 
6. Conclusion  
The results showed that there were 4 important aspects in the F&B category, namely price, product quality, product 
photo and marketing. Meanwhile, in the Non-F&B category, the important aspects are product quality, marketing, 
price, and product durability. This research is useful for MSMEs assistants from the government, private institutions

Abstract 
 
The development of the digital world affects the development of business in the financial sector. The payment process 
is crucial in both large and small businesses. Currently, there are many payment gateway providers that MSMEs can 
use to process their sales transactions. The purpose of this study is to find out what payment gateways are used by 
MSMEs and the reasons for using these payment gateways. The research method is 97 MSMEs from various business 
categories. Data was collected using an online survey. Data analysis is done to find the determining factors through 
coding and cross-case analysis. The results of this study indicate that there are various variations in the use of payment 
gateways. Ease of transaction processing and ease of access to transaction data are important factors in choosing a 
payment gateway. This research is useful for payment gateway service providers to find out the habits and reasons of 
MSMEs to use payment gateways as sales. Understanding of the use of payment gateways can help providers provide 
key features and make more precise offer points.

1. Introduction  
The role of small business is very important for the economy of a country (Menon and Varadarajan, 1992). Having 
the ability to develop e-business can be a strength to compete in business (Bharadwaj, 2000). One of the important 
things in doing business online is payment transactions (Kumar, 2011). Transparency is key in e-commerce (Zhou et 
al. 2018). Currently there is an e-money innovation to help MSMEs and consumers transact (Gunawan et al. 2019). 
In m-commerce, its development is influenced by many things, such as the telecommunication industry and payment 
systems (Hossain et al. 2011). 
 
The pandemic has had an impact on increasing online business activities and consumer behavior (Sardjono et al. 
2021). In online business, maintaining consumer trust is very important in the transaction process (Siau and Shen, 
2003). Digital payments have several types such as digital wallets, credit cards, digital cash and others that make 
online business transactions easier. There are also several old payment methods that are still used by businesspeople 
today, namely cash and bank transfers (Gupta, 2014). The QRIS system is the official QR Code from Bank Indonesia 
to assist cashless transactions from sellers and customers. This QR code is owned by the seller with a unique code, 
then the customer can scan it using the mobile app for payment (Lonardi and Legowo, 2021). Information data needs 
to be kept secure in the online business payment process (Song and Whang, 2000). 
 
Currently in Indonesia there are several types of payments used in e-business, namely, cash, bank transfer, e-wallet, 
e-commerce, credit card, paylater, and QRIS. This study aims to see the phenomenon of the use of payment gateways 
in MSMEs. In the midst of increasing online business, it is necessary to know the business landscape about payment 
transaction methods that are often used today. By knowing this pattern, it can provide an overview for providers and 
users in the midst of online business development. 
 
2. Literature Review  
E-business is a differentiator for business in the midst of competition in the industry (Beheshti and Sangari, 2007). 
Some indicators of the success of business growth is how to make strategy and planning (Street and Cameron, 2007). 
One of the organizational abilities to develop is influenced by the competence of the entrepreneur (Man et al. 2002). 
There is an influence of knowledge and awareness of the owner on the use of e-business, so it needs a deeper approach

Many respondents still choose bank transfer as the current payment method used by MSMEs. They reasoned that it 
was easier for sellers and customers to check the status of their payments. “Payment via bank transfer is because it is 
simple and easy to make transactions.” In addition, the selection of bank transfers because of its convenience for cash 
withdrawals, “Transfer. Because it is very easy and can be withdrawn at any time.” There are also other opinions from 
other respondents regarding the number of users on the bank transfer method, ""Bank transfers, because they are 
practical and have many users"". 
 
""Payments using the e-wallet method are considered easier and faster,"" said one respondent. In the e-commerce 
method, the respondent argues, ""I use the e-commerce system to make it easier"". For those who use QRIS, the 
following is the opinion of the respondent, ""QRIS because funds come directly in and can be double checked."" And 
there are still some MSMEs that use cash in their business processes. Every business has a payment gateway option 
that is used based on their needs, the ease of technology and also the number of users. This study confirms previous 
research that digitalization in the financial sector can help small businesses to improve their business performance 
(Tayibnapis, 2018). 
 
6. Conclusion  
The results of this study indicate that there are various variations in the use of payment gateways. Ease of transaction 
processing and ease of access to transaction data are important factors in choosing a payment gateway. Payment 
gateway is one of the important things in the business process. Therefore, a strategy is needed in its use in order to get 
maximum results. This research is useful for payment gateway service providers to find out the habits and reasons of 
MSMEs to use payment gateways as sales. Understanding of the use of payment gateways can help providers provide 
key features and make more precise offer points. The limitation of this research is that it is only looking for data on 
the use of payment gateways for MSMEs which are included in the early stage. It is necessary to look at MSMEs in 
various categories and expand their capacity by looking at SMEs.

Abstract  
Product reviews have the ability to form consumer impressions of a product, which in turn helps consumers decide 
whether to buy the product or not, while good service leaves a positive impression on consumers and can build 
consumer confidence to make a purchase. The purpose of this study was to determine how much influence the variable 
Product Reviews and Service Quality on Purchase Decisions on Tokopedia E-Commerce consumers in Bandung. The 
demographics of this research are consumers who have made purchases at Tokopedia and use a quantitative 
methodology with 400 respondents who fill out questionnaires through online media using simple random samples or 
probability sampling. Analytical descriptive approach and multiple linear regression analysis were used in the analysis. 
Based on the results of the study, there is a partial effect between Product Reviews and Service Quality variables on 
the Purchasing Decision variable, either simultaneously or partially. The Product Reviews variable has an influence

1921","product can get more information from people who have already bought it. The statement regarding product 
reviews as a source of information received the most votes (89.4%) and was included in the Very Good 
category. This shows that people care about what others have to say about a product before buying it. People 
with the lowest scores are sure to buy the product immediately after reading reviews from other customers. 
The statement received a score of 81%. This shows that people pay attention to what others say about a 
product, but that does not mean they sell it immediately. Every potential customer has something else to think 
about. 
 
Based on the results of hypothesis testing to see the effect of the Product Review variable on purchasing 
decisions, the value of tcount (2.293) is greater than the value of ttable (1.649), and the value of Sig. Less 
than 0.05. This means that Product Reviews significantly impact people's decisions about what to buy. Based 
on the partial determination coefficient test, the Product Reviews variable affects 6% of the Purchase 
Decision. Based on the test results, we can say that H1 does something. So, Product Reviews significantly 
impact people's decisions about what to buy. Setianingsih and Aziz's research (Setianingsih & Aziz, 2021) 
states that the Product Review variable (X1) positively and significantly affects Purchase Decisions. This 
study's results align with that study (Y). 
 
Based on the results of descriptive analysis, the Service Quality variable as a whole has a percentage value 
of 85%, which is in the excellent range. Of the 9 Service Quality variable statements, the security statement 
when doing business at Tokopedia received the best response from respondents. It gets a score of 92% and 
is in the Very Good category. This shows that Tokopedia has done an excellent job of making its users feel 
safe when making transactions, such as with the extra security features in the Tokopedia application. The 
statement received a score of 78%, which was included in the Good category. The one who got the lowest 
score was about how to file a complaint in the Tokopedia application easily. Although in the excellent 
category, this shows that some Tokopedia users still have difficulty submitting their complaints. This could 
be due to many things, including that Tokopedia has so many active users that it is difficult for the site to 
keep up. 
 
The value of tcount (6.333) is more significant than ttable (1.649), and the value of Sig. the value is 0.000 < 
0.05. This conclusion can be drawn from the findings of hypothesis testing conducted to determine the effect 
of the Service Quality variable on purchasing choices. This shows that the level of service provided 
significantly influences decisions made by users regarding purchases. Based on the partial determination 
coefficient test, the variable representing service quality has a partial effect on purchasing choices, accounting 
for 21% of the total. Based on the test results, it can be concluded that Ha has a significant effect. According 
to the findings of this research project, the choice to buy a product is significantly influenced in a good way 
by reading the reviews of the product. The findings of Pramono, Eldine, and Muniroh (2020) state that if the 
number of product reviews increases, sales will also increase, by the previously described findings. 
 
Based on the research findings, if users get a good experience with their experience in using/shopping at 
Tokopedia, it will be able to stimulate these consumers to shop again/reuse Tokopedia in online shopping. 
This finding is in line with the findings of research conducted by Fahrevi and Satrio (2018) which found that 
the higher the level of service quality provided by e-commerce to customers, the higher the decision to make 
purchases online. Customers will have a good view of your business and more confidence in their ability to 
make purchasing decisions when you provide them with high-quality service. 
 
          6. Conclusion  
The findings of the research lead one to the conclusion that the Product Review and Service Quality variables 
simultaneously and partially affect the Purchasing Decision variable. This result can be deduced from the 
findings of the study. The investigation findings allow one to draw this conclusion as a possible outcome. 
When deciding what to buy, Tokopedia E-Commerce customers in Bandung are influenced to a certain extent 
by two factors: the Product Reviews variable, which accounts for 6% of the total, and the Service Quality 
variable, which accounts for 21% of the total. There is a simultaneous influence on Purchase Decisions made 
by Tokopedia E-Commerce customers in Bandung of 28 percent on the variables of Product Review and 
Service Quality. In comparison, the influence of other factors not evaluated makes up 72 percent of the total.

Abstract 
 
The distribution of dividends or profits in the company is something interesting to discuss. In this dividend distribution 
process, of course, companies have their own policies on profits that will be distributed to shareholders.  Factors that 
influence dividend policy include ownership structure, company growth, and liquidity ratio.  The purpose of this study 
is to analyze the influence of these factors with dividend policies. The research was conducted on insurance companies 
listed on the IDX in 2018-2020. From the existing population were taken 9 samples of enterprises. Data collection 
techniques use documentation taken from the company's official web and literature studies. The collected data is then 
analyzed using a t-test to determine its effect. The results showed that the variable ownership structure of both 
managerial ownership and institutional ownership had a positive and significant effect on dividend policy.  Variables 
of company growth and liquidity have a negative and insignificant effect on dividend policy.

1. Introduction 
Dividends are the distribution of profit (retained earnings) to shareholders owned and carried out by the 
company(Pramudena, 2020; Aleknevičienė et al., 2006). In this dividend distribution process, of course, companies 
have their own policies on profits that will be distributed to shareholders. The company has a full policy regarding 
dividend distribution so that at the time of dividend distribution, it can reduce the amount of retained earnings which 
results in a reduction in the source of internal funds that should be used for the development of the company. However, 
if the company does not distribute its retained earnings as dividends to shareholders, it can increase the company's 
internal source of funds and of course can make the company more developed because it has large internal funds. 
In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the company is very trying to distribute dividends to shareholders so that 
investors who are going to buy shares of a company must also look at the prospects of the company. The sector that 
still distributes its shares to shareholders is the financial sector of the insurance sub-sector. Based on the website article 
(newssetup.kontan.co.id) cited based on data from the OJK. Insurance companies are still distributing dividends to 
shareholders amid the pandemic. Some of these companies are PT Asuransi Ramayana Tbk (ASRM), PT Asuransi 
Dayin Mitra Tbk (ASDM) and PT Asuransi Bintang Tbk (ASBI). PT Asuransi Ramayana distributed cash dividends 
to shareholders in 2020 amounting to IDR 46 per share and also on August 9, 2021, the value of the dividends 
distributed reached IDR 13.99 billion.  PT Asuransi Dayin Mitra also distributed cash dividends to shareholders in 
2020 of IDR 95 per share with a value of IDR 18.24 billion. The company plans to pay a cash dividend on September 
14, 2021.  PT Asuransi Bintang distributed dividends of IDR 3.48 billion to shareholders or IDR 10 per

6. Conclusion 
This study was conducted to determine and prove the influence of managerial ownership variables, institutional 
ownership, company size, company growth, liquidity and leverage on dividend policies in insurance sub-sector 
companies listed on the IDX for the period 2017 to 2020. Based on the results of the tests above that have been carried 
out by researchers, the following conclusions were obtained: 
 
First, the ownership structure of both managerial ownership variables and fundamental ownership has a positive and 
significant effect on dividend policy. This is in accordance with the framework of thought in the first and second 
hypotheses which states that manajerial policy has a significant positive effect on dividend policy so that it can be 
proven and accepted in this study.  
 
Second, the company's growth variables have a negative and insignificant effect on dividend policy. This is 
inconsistent with the thinking framework in the fourth hypothesis which states that company growth has a significant 
negative effect on dividend policy so it is not proven in this study. This proves that the high or low growth of the 
company does not have a significant influence on dividend policy. 
Third, liquidity variables have a negative and insignificant effect on dividends. This is inconsistent with the thinking 
framework in the fifth hypothesis which states that liquidity has a significant negative effect on dividend policy so it 
is not proven in this study. This proves that high or low liquidity does not have a significant influence on dividend 
policy.

Abstract  
 
Tourism has become the essence of human life. The purpose of this research is to help people when they want to 
travel, especially in Indonesia, and set out in the form of an application. The research method used are questionnaire 
distributed to people who like to travel and a comparison of similar applications. System analysis is carried out by 
designing the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and testing and evaluation which is carried out in four ways, 
namely: Black Box Testing, User Acceptance Test, 8 Golden Rules, and 5 Measurable Human Factors. The results 
obtained from this study are that the recommendations provided by the application can assist users in selecting and 
designing itinerary, coupled with the steps to make itinerary and expense records that are easier to use while the user 
is on a tour.

1. Introduction 
Smartphone is not something foreign in human life. Even some Indonesians consider smartphones to be a part of their 
lives. According to the Pew Research Center, Indonesia is ranked 24th as the most smartphone users with a percentage 
of 42% or around 112.4 million users in 2019 (Silver, 2019). 
 
The use of smartphones greatly facilitates human life from morning to night. The total time of smartphone use in 
Indonesia reaches an average of 5.5 hours per day (Kompas, 2016). Starting from waking up using an alarm provided 
by a smartphone, calendar, or reminder that makes every day needs and essentials easier. Ordering motorcycle taxis, 
shopping for daily necessities, buying food online, to ordering plane tickets can all be done in the hands of humans. 
 
Apart from smartphones, another thing that is one of the human needs is entertainment. Entertainment can be obtained 
in various ways, one of which is traveling. Traveling or vacations can produce several benefits, including reducing 
stress, increasing happiness and satisfaction, and increasing creativity (American Psychological Association, 2006;

6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the analysis, design, implementation and evaluation carried out on the Gubo application, the 
following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The Gubo application can make it easier for users to make travel notes 
compared to manually taking notes using paper or talking about it orally because making an itinerary can be done 
using a smartphone. (2) The Gubo application can provide recommendations based on ratings that are in accordance 
with the holiday preferences chosen by the user so that users do not need to have trouble finding tourist attractions.

Abstract 
 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is a United States state agency responsible for the space 
program. The state agency observes space objects including asteroids. Information from www.kaggle.com There are 
an infinite number of space objects, some of which are closer than we think, although we may think that 70,000 
Kilometers are not dangerous to us, but on an astronomical scale it is a very small and disturbing distance. natural 
phenomena and including dangerous. Judging from the infinite number of objects in outer space that will cross the 
earth's orbit, predictions are needed to determine the level of danger or harm when crossing the earth's orbit. Prediction 
is an activity that can know or predict what will happen in the future which aims to find out the approximate asteroids 
that will cross the earth in the future. In this study, data mining classification techniques and the K-Nearest Neighbor 
algorithm are used to make a prediction system for the threat of asteroids when they cross the earth. Classification is 
the task of mining data into groups of data by classifying data items into predefined class labels, building a 
classification model from the data set, building a model that is used to predict future data. To determine the distance 
of the asteroid threat across the earth, data mining classification techniques and the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm are 
used. The data that will be used is 3,500 data sourced from NASA, the data will be processed using the K-Nearest

Abstract 
 
Retail business is the business of selling goods or services to consumers in units or retail. This retail business is part 
of the distribution channel that plays a vital role in a series of marketing activities as well as a liaison between the 
interests of producers and consumers. Based on sales transaction data in retail stores in 2020 obtained from 
www.kaggle.com, the inventory of goods is not proportional to the sales of goods. Excessive inventory and low sales 
levels resulted in goods accumulation in retail stores. When the sales cycle of goods is down, the stock must be 
prepared according to the level of sales. It takes a grouping of data to schedule an inventory of interests following the 
status of the purchase of goods. The data grouping used in this study uses the K-Medoids algorithm. K-Medoids is a 
method of partitioning clustering to group a set of (n) objects into several (k) clusters. Based on the elbow method, 
the optimal cluster number is 2 clusters. From the clustering process, the results obtained are cluster 1 has 320 data 
and cluster 2 has 765 data. The accuracy level of the cluster formed using the Davies-Bouldin Index method is 
0.662748, and the Silhouette Coefficient is 0.276353.

In the evaluation of the silhouette coefficient, the value of s(i) is 0.27635. 
 
5. Conclusion 
From this research, the k-medoids algorithm can group the sales transaction data obtained. From the elbow method, 
determining the number of clusters as many as 2 clusters, then the results obtained are clusters of 320 data in cluster 
1 and 765 data in cluster 2. 
 
Based on the results of the evaluation of cluster results using the Davies-Bouldin index method, the result is 0.662748 
which indicates that the results of the cluster formed are quite good, while the results of the cluster evaluation using 
the Silhouette Coefficient method are 0.276353 which are included in the cluster category with low structure.

Abstract  
 
Supply chain adaptability relates to a logistics service provider's ability to adapt to market change regarding strategies, 
products, and technologies. Adaptability is one of the critical aspects of consideration for implementing blockchain 
technology in the supply chain. At the same time, supply chain resilience refers to logistics service providers (LSP) 
preventing disruptions and reducing their impact according to their readiness, quick response, and recovery. Service 
climate relates to LSP employees' perceptions about how their companies appreciate them if they provide excellent 
customer service. In this study, supply chain adaptability is an exogenous variable measured by three indicators: 
design, operations mix, and physical facility mix. Supply chain resilience is endogenous and measured by five 
indicators: relevant information, timely information, accurate information, collaborative plan, and flexibility. The 
service climate is a moderation variable measured by three indicators: employees' perception of service quality,

Abstract 
 
This paper presents an analysis of structural transformation in Morocco and its contribution to productivity growth 
over the period 1990 to 2018 and highlights two major findings. The first is that there has been an increase in 
agricultural productivity that has been accompanied by a reallocation of labor to the service sector, particularly trade 
services. This situation reflects sectoral mobility between activities with low requirements in terms of specific skills, 
or what is called a structural transformation without industrialization. Moreover, it turns out that the main driver of 
labor productivity gains is intra-sectoral dynamics; indeed, the contribution of structural change to productivity growth 
accounts for only about a quarter of these productivity gains. 
 
Keywords  
Employment, Morocco, productivity, structural change  
 
1. Introduction  
Productivity growth involves two distinct but closely related processes: the first is structural transformation (or 
structural change), which results in an increasing share of the workforce being employed in higher-productivity 
sectors, while the second is intra-sectoral productivity growth, which is the result of several factors, including the 
impact of technical progress on human capital skills, on the production process and the mode of organization. The two 
processes are linked insofar as productivity gains allow for transfers of labor and capital between sectors of activity, 
McMillan & Rodrik (2011). 
 
At the national level, despite significant progress in terms of macroeconomic stability and diversification of growth 
sources, which have resulted in less volatile growth levels than in the past, the pace of sustainable and productive job 
creation remains low and significantly correlated with the performance of the agricultural sector.

1965","productivity dynamics within this sector benefited more from the reallocation of labor from other sectors than from 
intra-sectoral productivity growth.   
 
7. Conclusion  
The Moroccan economy has experienced a productivity gain of nearly 2.6 percentage points, as an annual average 
over the period 1990-2018, of which a large part is attributable to the internal component (capital accumulation and 
technological change), whereas structural change has contributed little to overall labor productivity growth. Thus, the 
Moroccan economy could have achieved a much higher rate of productivity growth if the structural change had been 
given greater weight.  
 
Thus, accelerating the process of structural change in the Moroccan economy requires catching up on the delay in 
integrating into the formal sector the labor force absorbed by the informal sector, which still plays an important role 
in the Moroccan labor market. Indeed, according to the National Survey on the Informal Sector conducted by the High 
Commission for Planning (HCP) between 2013 and 2014, the informal sector employs 2.4 million people representing 
36.3% of non-agricultural employment at the national level and contributes 11.5% to the national GDP. In addition, 
improving the competitiveness of industrial companies is a guarantee of success to establish a powerful industrial base 
developing the exportable offer, and being able to meet local demand, relying more on industrial ecosystems and 
activities that focus on the digital.

Abstract  
 
Supply chain alignment is one of the blockchain roles in supply chain digitization. In this study, supply chain 
alignment is the ability to integrate processes of all supply chain members for better logistics service company 
performance; supply chain complexity relates to the number, variety, variability, and uncertainty performed by the 
services, processes, and network of the logistics service provider; supply chain resilience refers to supply chain 
capabilities of logistics service providers to prevent and minimize the disruption impacts by developing readiness, 
quick response and recovery abilities. The study intends to examine the moderating effect of supply chain complexity 
on the effect of supply chain alignment on resilience. Supply chain alignment consists of three indicators: internal, 
suppliers, and customer integrations. Furthermore, Supply chain resilience constitutes an endogenous variable with 
five indicators: relevant information, timely information, accurate information, collaborative plan, and flexibility. 
Supply chain complexity is a moderating variable with three indicators: product complexity, process flow complexity,

The banking industry has a very important role as a driving force for a country’s economy, including in Indonesia. 
This research was carried out to test the influence of Corporate Governance Mechanism on Financial Performance 
in the state-owned banks on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) in 2010-2020. This research used a quantitative 
approach with panel data regression analysis method. The independent variables in this study are Board of Directors, 
Remuneration Committee, and Risk Monitoring Committee. While the dependent variable in this study is financial 
performance (ROA). The results showed that simultaneously Board of Directors, Remuneration Committee, and 
Risk Monitoring Committee had a significant effect on Financial Performance.  Partially, Remuneration Committee, 
and Risk Monitoring Committee have no effect on Financial Performance, while Board of Directors has an impact 
on financial performance.

1. Introduction  
According to the Constitution Number 7 of 1992 about Banking, the role of bank which states that the purpose of 
Indonesian banking is to support the implementation of national development in order to increase equity, economic 
growth, and national stability in order to improve people's welfare. According to Sunarsip (2003) in (Bachtiar, 2019), 
in developing countries, such as Indonesia, the existence of the banking industry is becoming increasingly important 
because of the saving-investment gap that cannot be overcome by the government budget. The involvement of banks 
in collecting and redistributing public funds will greatly assist the process of economic development.  
Besides being able to be an important role in supporting national development, the profits generated by banks, 
especially state-owned banks, also contribute to state revenues in the form of taxes, dividends, and Non-Tax State 
Revenue. The following is an image showing the contribution of State-Owned Enterprises to national revenues in 
2010-2020.

Exchange in 2010-2020, while partially remuneration committee and risk monitoring committee have no effect on 
financial performance, but the board of directors has a impact on financial performance. This research is anticipated 
to add to the existing literature. The authors suggest the next research to to add other sample of banks that not used in 
the study. Next researchers can add or replace the proxy of the Good Corporate Governance variable with the proxy 
of the corporate governance committee and replace the proxy of financial performance using Return of Equity (ROE). 
And next research can use the same independent variable proxy and dependent variable proxy by conducting research 
on another company industry. For the company, the results of this study can be a consideration for the implementation 
Good Corporate Governance there must be a board of directors, remuneration committee, and a risk monitoring 
committee so that the company can run well and improve the company's financial performance or ROA. For investors, 
should pay more attention to company’s good corporate governance when they want to invest in a company. Because 
the better the implementation of corporate governance, the better the management performance, thereby preventing 
financial performance from deteriorating.

Abstract 
 
Puskesmas is one of the government agencies that handles community services. Puskesmas activities in providing 
public health services certainly store a lot of data. In general, the Puskesmas records data to make reports. One of them 
is the drug management report. Generally, the drug management system at the puskesmas is an activity that involves 
aspects of planning, requesting, receiving, storing, distributing, using, recording and reporting by utilizing available 
sources. This research focuses on the planning aspect. Drug planning activities are useful for ensuring drug 
availability. The drug planning stage is very important. Inaccurate drug planning can lead to drug accumulation, drug 
vacancies, and drug damage which can lead to less than optimal health services at the Puskesmas. The planning stage 
will also affect the following stages. The case study of this research is the Cicangkanggirang Health Center. This 
research is related to data mining. One of the algorithms/methods/techniques of extracting or searching for information 
in data mining is data classification. One method that can be used in data classification is using the K-Nearest 
Neighbors method. The purpose of this study is to analyze the classification of drug data regarding planning aspects 
at the Cicangkanggirang Health Center by using the K-Nearest Neighbors method, in order to facilitate drug managers 
in preparing a Needs Plan. Drugs (RKO) at the time of submitting a drug requirement. This study uses the K-Nearest 
Neighbors method by applying several research stages, namely, data collection, Knowledge Discovery in Databases 
(KDD) process, classification techniques (K-Cross validation, Euclidean Distance, results and accuracy), and software 
development.

Abstract 
 
In recent years, manufacturing SMEs have been of great importance for the Peruvian economy, representing 29.60% 
of the national GDP; however, a high percentage of these companies report various problems in their processes, since 
they do not have adequate management to carry out their activities. In relation to the above, an example of this is the 
unproductive times generated by unplanned stops that impact the productivity levels of a textile company based in 
southern Lima, so this research was implemented lean manufacturing tools such as 5S and SMED, with which it was 
possible to increase the ratio by 18.06%, also, the arena software was used in the process to simulate scenarios with 
the reduction of unproductive times structured through the proposed improvement of the Deming Cycle (PDCA).

1. Introduction 
Small and medium-sized companies are considered the engines of the economy of Latin America and the country 
(Cañari 2019). These have the capacity to increase and promote both the economy and the sustainable development 
of a country (Gonzáles 2021). They are an important sector of the country's economy, since they represent a significant 
share of the gross domestic product and contribute to the increase in labor productivity; Likewise, it contributes to 
international trade and is a source of creation of various jobs (Larios 2017). The growth and relevance of the textile 
sector is reflected in the textile-clothing sector because exports have increased compared to pre-pandemic times, it 
can be assumed currently that this industry is one of the most important markets in different countries because of high 
Consumption (Palpán et al., 2020), having a value of USD 848 million between January-July 2021; this reflects a 
growth of 3.9% compared to the same period of time in 2019. But one of the reasons that generates low 
competitiveness in the market for SMEs such as those in the textile sector is inadequate management, lack of control 
and order of their processes, which leads to an unprofessional act, since they orient their goals to growth, but not to 
their methods. The lack of knowledge of the use of Lean and business management tools generates lower efficiency, 
productivity and the aforementioned lines of competitiveness in the market. 
 
Before the pandemic, SMEs represented 99.6% of companies in Peru, where they accounted for 29.7% of GDP and 
approximately 59% of the workforce. These faced the measures taken by the executive to deal with the health crisis, 
presenting losses in their majority, reason for the exit of the market of almost three million companies in 2020 
(Gonzáles 2021); however, in 2021 the textile sector represented 30.6% of the country's income (Carhuavilca et al., 
2021). Currently, the competitiveness of manufacturing companies is increasing, their leaders are required to verify 
the best performance of both production processes and equipment maintenance and time measurement, in order to 
improve their competitive advantage (Sayuti et al, 2019). This is reflected, for example, in the investigation of a textile 
company in Juliaca-Puno, where when evaluating the times in the production process, 407.5 minutes of waste were 
found. This caused the daily production to be thirty-three divers, but by applying Lean Manufacturing techniques such 
as the 5s, an improvement of 12% was achieved, reaching thirty-seven divers per day (Luque and Rojas 2021). 
Likewise, the results of an investigation in a manufacturing company where Lean principles and tools were applied to

1988","improvement and use of resources is how after the analysis the high time of unproductiveness of the process in the 
circular area was determined, with the information collected and the use of complementary tools it was determined 
that the process with the lowest productivity was the weaving process, in this way this operation was achieved selected 
for an improvement implementation based on a proposal, expressed graphically and quantitatively. Followed stage, 
with the support of antecedents such as scientific articles oriented to the topic to be developed, information was 
collected that was reflected in the choice of tools to be used. Then, in order to have a more precise control, indicators 
were chosen to determine quantitatively and with greater precision the impact for an improvement scenario, 
implementing them in a simulation through the arena software to contrast the current scenario and the proposed 
scenario. For this case, the use of lean methodologies was proposed, such as: 5S and SMED, which allow increasing 
productivity in the processes, based on an optimal distribution of the instruments that intervene in the process, as well 
as an adequate order to avoid reduce times productive; As a complement, the SMED technique was developed, this 
allows taking advantage of time resources, converting internal tasks into external ones, the latter being defined as 
operations that are carried out with the machine running. 
 
5.4 Validation 
The problem of this work focuses on the high unproductive times that affect the productivity of the company. These 
unproductive times are reflected in the low availability rates of the machine and its performance. With current values 
of 62.5% and 57.69%, respectively, which are values below the world average of 90% and 95% respectively. This 
problem generates a loss of 231,328.08 PEN per year. 
 
The values of the indicators in table 5 have achieved a significant improvement, due to the Lean Manufacturing tools 
used. Where the 5s and SMED helped increase availability by 21.67% and performance by 23.08%. Whereby applying 
the work of the 5s with the standardization and SMED with the reduction of the Setup times, said improvement in the 
indicators was achieved. 
 
The limitations of space within the company still do not allow these indicators to be increased to a greater extent, since 
they are under construction in some areas. What is expected with the implementation of these is to increase the 
indicators up to at least 90% in both, therefore, increase productivity. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In the present case, the main problem was the high level of unplanned downtime that resulted in high costs of using 
the machinery due to inefficient use for production, the importance of this study as the use of an adequate alternative 
through of lean manufacturing tools allowed a correct reduction of unwanted times, likewise, a greater use and 
performance of the machinery involved in the process was increased, because by implementing techniques such as the 
5s that allows an optimal order and distribution of everything involved in the activity followed by the SMED technique 
that takes advantage of the time of the machinery in operation so that tasks that add value to the process can be 
developed by the operator, this development allowed the fulfillment of the objective. 
 
The proposed methodology of Lean Manufacturing tools such as 5s and SMED incorporated in the Deming cycle 
(PDCA), helped reduce downtime, it has been shown that Lean Manufacturing tools are very useful in companies and 
as mentioned above, it is even more vital that SMEs can implement them, as it will help them grow in a more orderly 
and professional manner. 
 
Increasing productivity is what every company seeks, and with the implementation of Lean Manufacturing tools in 
the present company under study, it was possible to increase 18.06%, taking as a valuable resource to use, the time 
used in production. This increase is thanks to the implemented lean manufacturing tools.

Abstract 
In order to generate comprehensive strategies that address the activity of providing security to basic public goods, the 
State establish policies. For this reason, for public spaces, especially those administered by municipalities, it is relevant 
to have a good security and surveillance system which attends to the large flow of people (users). In the process of 
providing these services, it is crucial to optimize the available resources. Currently, the Municipality of Asunción 
manage the Asunción Botanical Garden and Zoo (JBZA). In the present work, we analyze the current situation of the 
park, with the aim of design a coverage mathematical model to support the security and surveillance system of 
recreational and sports areas. The proposal is based on the theory of fixed coverage, where the installation location of 
the servers is indicated, and the objective is to maximize the demand covered by the security posts to be installed in 
28 zones of the JBZA. In addition, due to the limited availability of information, an approximation of the demand of 
the zones is made. We compare the results obtained with the current working model.

1. Introduction 
For service provision problems, as is the case of security management and surveillance of public spaces managed by 
government entities, it is valid to apply an Operations Research (IO) tool. Based on the theory of location models, 
more specifically coverage models. Firstly, the current situation of the security and surveillance system must be 
surveyed, detailing the available resources such as human resources, material resources and economic resources. 
Subsequently, a mathematical model of deterministic coverage must be designed. (Ballou, 2004) In said model, its 
objective could be to maximize the coverage of the demand of the zones, employing security personnel strategically 
located in security posts. In the first place, the recreational and sports areas of the property would be zoned, and then 
the proposed model would be applied, efficiently assigning the available resources to each zone, in order to provide 
service to the demand of the zones. With the implementation of the proposal, it is estimated that social and economic 
benefits will be generated. For the first case, it would occur because the users would have the feeling of greater security 
in the property due to the visible organization of the personnel, increasing the level of control in the JBZA. And for 
the second case, due to the efficient administration of resources, it would be possible to optimize costs. Having as a 
result a coverage plan for the recreational and sports areas of the JBZA. In the first part, an introduction to the case 
study is made and then the applied methodology is exposed, which goes from the approach of the problem with the 
survey of data of the current situation to the development and analysis of the mathematical model with its result.

2000","The time slot contemplated for this work covers the morning shift and the afternoon shift, since the scope of the work 
is limited to entering the recreational and sports areas. In the morning and afternoon shift there are 7 security personnel, 
and 3 of them are intended for recreational and sports areas. Therefore, in the real scenario, 3 security personnel were 
considered. 
 
6. Conclusion 
With the proposed methodology, a deterministic coverage model was designed to support the security and surveillance 
system of the recreational and sports areas of the Asunción Botanical Garden and Zoo (JBZA). The model was 
programmed in Python computational language, and the solutions were obtained with the Gurobi optimization 
software (academic license). 
 
With a series of considerations, some calculations were made to estimate the covered demand, and a zoning of the 
property was carried out. Having as an optimal result the installation of 7 security posts in 7 locations, and with this 
the coverage of 493 people (100% of the demand) is ensured, which is equivalent to providing coverage to 28 zones 
(100% of the zones). 
 
According to the current situation and the results of the programming, it is suggested: Increase the security personnel, 
from 3 to 7 troops for the recreational and sports areas per shift (morning and evening).

Abstract 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant impact on the global economy and significantly slowed down 
human activity. Paraguay (PY), a small developing South American country, was not an exception. Since this 
pandemic reached this country, the local government implemented a series of lockdown and restrictive measures since 
early 2020. In order to contain the spread of this virus, school activities such as course lectures, especially laboratory 
practices, were placed on hold indefinitely. As a result of restrictive access to online learning in Paraguay, the faculty 
of dentistry requests the faculty of engineering (FIUNA) to design a safe ventilation system to allow resuming 
laboratory practices in the faculty of dentistry. This led to the urgent need to reopen universities, schools, and other 
academic institutions to resume teaching activities. 
 
Computational Fluid Mechanics was utilized to validate a localized air exhaust system design. This work helped to 
support the use of this engineering tool as part of the engineering design procedure. Results showed that a localized 
airflow of 150 CFM near the patient’s head combined with a transparent wall and personal protective equipment 
helped avoid virus spreading. Different exhaust configurations were taken into consideration. In addition, air flow 
lines and velocity profiles surrounding the dental chair are shown in this work. It is essential to remark here that this 
worked to help the school administration to reopen laboratory activities. This helped to confidently decide on resuming 
practices and, at the same time, keeping students and faculties safe.

1. Introduction  
The COVID-19 pandemic hit the world in an unprecedented manner in early 2020, forcing its population to unforeseen 
lifestyle changes and leaving them in an urgent need for safety guidelines in order to shield themselves from the 
dangerous unfamiliar virus. As it happened in many regions of the world, a strict curfew was placed in Paraguay in 
the second week of March in an attempt to restrain the transmission of the virus once the first case of the disease was 
confirmed in the country. Schools and universities were ordered to close while authorities and officials worked on 
safety protocols for students and education workers and, in a similar way, many other working sectors were demanded 
to cease their activities in the time that health authorities contemplated how hazardous their professional endeavors

2011","Lastly, the airflow velocity profile was analyzed on the same level plane with configuration (d). The velocity profile 
showed a better air distribution from the back of the doctor to outlet G, but the detriment of the air distribution between 
doctor and patient. This can be observed in Figure 7. Overall, this configuration does not seem favorable compared to 
the two previous ones. The ACH value obtained for this case is 4.23, considered good according to Table 3. 
Figure 7. Cut view of the velocity plot 1.2 m above the floor with configuration (d) 
 
5. Conclusion 
By analyzing the velocity profile with four different configurations, we can conclude that the new layouts showed a 
better flow distribution and velocity profile overall and a much better ACH compared to the baseline.  
Comparing all simulation cases for configurations (a), (b), (c), and (d), we can conclude that the use of an air exhaust 
system in a dental clinic is very beneficial from the ACH improvement point of view. The presented case (a) is the 
baseline case.  This original layout was added for the following three simulation configurations.  
Of all four configurations, the most beneficial configuration (c) was observed in Figure 8 since the layout showed a 
better flow distribution between doctor and patient. It delivered a better ACH value than configuration (b).

Abstract 
The question of whether or not gender diversity between board members can contribute to increase company 
performance is one of the key lines of research in the field of diversity within the top management. This study provides 
a critical theoretical justification for businesses. Research into the relationship between ESG reporting and firm 
performance has produced inconclusive results. The purpose of this research is to give a more complete and accurate 
analysis of the effect of ESG reporting on firm performance. This study also investigated how gender diversity 
between board members can help to moderate the effect of ESG reporting and company performance. The performance 
of a corporation is not significantly affected by ESG reporting. according to the findings, but gender diversity on the

Test for Simultaneous Analysis of Significance (F Test) 
The F-test, also known as the Anova test, produced a calculated F value of 4.621 with a significance level of 0.026. 
Regression models can be used to predict dependent variables because the probability of significance is less than 0.05,

Coefficient of Determination 
According to the Adjusted R Square (R^2) value of 0.364, the independent variables ESG (X 1), Gender diversity (X 
2), and X 1*X 2 can explain 36.4 percent of the Y variable. The remainder (100% - 36.40% = 63.6%) is explained by 
factors other than the model. This shows that including moderation variables in the model raises the Adjusted R Square 
value, implying that the model improves. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study's goal is to give a more full and accurate evaluation of how ESG reporting affects firm performance (ROA). 
The role of board gender diversity in moderating the relationship between ESG and firm performance was also 
investigated in this study (ROA). In this study, the findings indicate that ESG reporting does not have a substantial 
impact on the performance of companies, whereas board gender diversity has been confirmed to have significant role 
in moderating the effect of ESG reporting on company performance. In other words, gender diversity on corporate 
boards can help to strengthen the effect of ESG reporting on company performance. The results of this study add to

aiming to improve the makeup of their boards. Because the coefficient of determination (R^2) is only around 36.4 
percent, additional research into variables other than ESG reporting and board gender diversity is recommended. As 
a result, other factors outside of this study can account for the remaining 63.6 percent variation in company 
performance.

Abstract 
 
Design a HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) Profile to help a Diabetes-Type II Patient avoid taking Insulin 
glargine injection. In addition to meal control, Metformin medicine, Insulin shot, diabetes patient should exercise at a 
higher heart rate to burn sugar faster. A Full Factorial DoE of Treadmill Setting (Incline, Speed) was conducted to 
build a Heart Rate RSM model to design the optimal HIIT Profile. Based on RSM model, Interaction effects are all 
very little which may indicate Treadmill Heart Rate model is not Coupling (complicate). Heart Rate is linearly 
proportional to Incline level (Potential Energy when incline angle is small), and in quadratic form with Speed (Kinetic 
Energy). To avoid the injury risk around the knee/foot, ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) injury and jumping patterns 
were studied by 3D-Motion Bio-Mechanics modeling. The fatigued muscles could not hold knee stable and provide 
sufficient knee cushion during the shorter soft landing which could increase the ACL injury risk during the 2nd hard 
landing period. Use the Model Driven SPC to study the injury mechanism to determine the highest speed limit of the 
Treadmill profile for this Diabetes patient.  Through these ACL risk stuiesy, the HIIT profile has been further 
optimized considering these ACL design constraints.  Following the JMP_based HIIT profile, this Diabetic patient 
has significantly reduced the Blood Glucose, Serum reading from over 200 mg/dL to near 75 mg/dL in 4 months 
(Acceptable in 65-99 mg/dL).

Abstract  
 
Actually, in Morocco, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are an important component of the economy 
representing 98% of total enterprises of the country. Today, the competitive industrial environment is 
encouraging these companies to rethink their manufacturing practices. Lean management (LM) has been widely 
implemented in several companies in Morocco and especially in Casablanca showing a positive impact on 
business performance and development, but what about social performance and the well-being of employees? 
This study aims to highlight a benchmark of countries and Moroccan publications about companies using Lean 
management tools. Then we will examine the impact of the implementation of these lean management tools on 
the social performance of small and medium-sized enterprises established in the region of Casablanca by studying 
the degree of stress perception and the workload by these employees, indeed we will highlight the recent progress 
of changing management shown in SMEs of Morocco.

1. Introduction  
small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) assume a huge part in worldwide economies and are a significant part of 
financial development in emerging countries. Thus, SMEs are viewed as one of the main supporters of worldwide 
GDP and business (Saleh and Ndubisi, 2006). SMEs utilize 93 million individuals in Europe and record for 57% 
of all out esteem made. Most of SMEs (93%) are microbusinesses with less than 10 representatives (Muller et 
al., 2017). As indicated by gauges from the Moroccan Confederation of SMEs, SMEs represent 95% of the 
Moroccan economy. For sure, they are viewed as a fundamental type of revenue and work, representing 40% of 
result and 31% of products (CDVM, 2011). 
 
 Be that as it may, because of the hard contest on the lookout, SMEs are today battling to protect their seriousness. 
Thus, they focus their endeavours on cost-cutting and making more specific things in more modest amounts and 
in more limited time spans. Taiichi Ohno created lean management when he concocted the Toyota Production 
System (TPS) during the 1950s. It endeavours to improve esteem creation and diminishing a wide range of waste. 
 Many organizations from different businesses all over the planet have sent off drives and undertakings to execute 
Lean practices (Narayanamurthy et al., 2018; Bajjou and Chafi, 2018a; Bajjou and Chafi, 2018b). For a long time,

Every company running its business is definitely required to be able to carry out its business processes effectively and 
efficiently. Likewise with PT. GMF Aeroasia tbk is an MRO company of the Republic of Indonesia. In its business 
process. The company faces a lot of homework to be done well. Especially in a pandemic situation like today. 
Companies are required to be able to save on purchasing costs both from internal processes and external. This analysis 
is targeted at the purchase budget and material procurement for aircraft maintenance. Because the purchase and 
procurement of parts for aircraft maintenance is considered very crucial. Procurement and purchase of aircraft material 
are still considered inefficient, especially when purchasing aircraft material is mostly imported from abroad and often 
there are many additional costs and burdens that companies have to bear. By analyzing several factors that cause a lot 
of costs including lot determination, transportation costs, setup costs for purchasing materials, purchasing time spans, 
minimum costs, and also the minimum amount of material purchases that can be made by the company. By using the

Abstract  
 
Seeing the growing public awareness of buying local brands during the pandemic is a positive thing. Considering that 
Indonesia is one of the countries experiencing an economic crisis due to the Corona pandemic. But the fact is that in 
this time of crisis, consumers actually feel that local Indonesian brands can compete even with global brands. Online 
shopping and the choice of local brands is very prominent and a very significant increase when compared to before 
the pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to discuss the influence of advertising, brand image, social networking 
service content, brand trust, brand reputation, brand performance, on brand loyalty and word of mouth on increasing 
local brand purchases by Indonesian consumers during the pandemic. The researchers want to underlie the increase in 
purchases of local brands during the COVID-19 pandemic and there also a few researchers who carried out the 
relationship between the variables mentioned above and at the same time wanted to know the extent of Indonesia 
consumer ratings on the quality of local brands.

Abstract 
 
Delays or failures from service users in making payments will greatly affect service providers. Frequently, this incident 
causes many construction service business entities to go bankrupt due to financial disruption to the business entity. A 
contractual agreement between the parties regulates the payment system between service users and providers. 
However, the contract does not reduce the risk of delay or failure of payment. Problems often occur due to the lack of 
competence in human resources at the management level. Management who should play an important role in the 
project often fails to carry out their duties. The next problem arises from service users who do not want to pay service 
providers after the work is completed. Therefore, this research tries to find a solution by improving the payment system 
with an automated and transparent procedure so that all parties can monitor the process. This system will be built 
using a smart contract built on the blockchain’s (Ethereum) platform and integrated with BIM (Building Information 
Modeling) data models and CDE (Common Data Environment) with its review and approval system. With this 
automation system, the payment duration can be accelerated to maintain the financial capabilities of all stakeholders.

Abstract 
 
Along with the times, human desires and demands for quality products and their functions are increasing. SLB 
Negeri Pembina Pekanbaru is a school that handles students with mental, physical, and intellectual limitations or 
also known as disabilities. This research is a follow-up study from previous researchers, which aims to evaluate and 
provide improvements to the prior design. Open-ended questions were conducted to the parties involved, namely the 
SLB Negeri Pembina Pekanbaru employees and staff, which amounted to 3 people. The interview results showed 
that the design of the blind bookshelf from the previous researcher had several shortcomings, such as braille letters 
that were not following the student's anthropometric size and heavy materials that made the product difficult to 
move. The design concept was not yet user-friendly, so students still needed help with these difficulties—the teacher 
picking up books. The ergonomic Function Development method is used in this study to discover and identify 
criteria for the needs and dimensions of the product according to the wishes of consumers. This study describes four 
design concepts, which will be carried out in a screening and concept assessment stage. The screening and 
assessment results provide concept 2 as the chosen concept, which has advantages. It is easier for users to use a 
bookshelf, more structured book preparation, and a minimalist appearance.

1. Introduction 
Human needs are growing in the era of wanting quality products following complex functions. It can make people 
have the latest ideas to create product designs with added functionality and product value for users. Increase the 
added value of a product. It is necessary to redesign the product according to consumer needs. Assess whether 
consumer needs have been met or not. One of them can be seen in how comfortable consumers are in using a 
product using an ergonomic point of view. 
 
According to Marimin (2016), quoted by Prabowo and Zoelangga (2019), design is a dimension that offers many 
emotional aspects in influencing customer satisfaction. User satisfaction also needs to be carried out in schools, 
including Special Schools. Extraordinary Schools have several things that need to be developed, such as library 
bookshelves. Special School students certainly have remarkable cabinets for mental limitations, such as blind, 
physically handicapped, mentally retarded, autistic, and other mental limitations, to facilitate them in the learning 
process. SLB Pembina Pekanbaru is a special education and special service (PK-LK). This school handles students 
who have mental, physical, and intellectual limitations or are called disabilities. SLB Pembina Pekanbaru has library

Figure 5 is the result of the design of the processing carried out, which will be made on the product to be designed. 
In the picture above, there are already sizes that will be used for the product to be designed. The advantages of this 
plan are: 
1. The raw material used is plywood. The raw material is easy to find and lightweight 
2. More efficient because books are separated according to the field of science and are easy to move because they 
use wheels 
3. The size follows the anthropometric size of students and Indonesian standards 
 
6. Conclusion  
From the results of research conducted using the Ergonomic Function Deployment (EFD) method, user needs for 
redesigning bookshelves for the blind can be seen from the level of importance of consumer satisfaction obtained 
from the distribution of closed questionnaires. It was found that a cupboard with wheels became the priority, making 
it easier for users to retrieve and return books in the second priority order position, so changes had to be made.

Abstract 
Currently, XYZ corporate website faces a problem where the increasing number of visitors does not linearly appear 
with conversion rate (CR) to purchase the services. Various marketing and advertising strategies have been carried 
out to overcome this problem but have not found an answer. The present research analyzes the low CR from a User 
Experience (UX) point of view. The research covers the acceptance scale based on the User Experience Questionnaire 
(UEQ) benchmark on the corporate website, finds out the differences for each category of age, gender, and customer 
position, and develops new strategies that can be proposed on the journey in website to improve the quality of customer 
experience based on a theoretical approach. UEQ will be used in this research to see if the product's user experience 
is high enough to meet users' general expectations. Under the UEQ, the questionnaire was designed using a 7-point 
Likert scale. The comparison results of benchmarks against other interactive digital platforms that have gone through 
UEQ testing in previous studies found that only the Novelty factor is at a good level, and the rest is only above average. 
Furthermore, age was the only demographic factor affecting the participants' UEQ acceptance scale. There is no 
significant difference between gender and position in the company.

1. Introduction  
The digital transformation process is currently being intensively carried out by many companies, especially large 
companies to be able to continue to survive. This is due to changes in the behavior of customers and consumers who 
are also switching to digital services. Boston Consulting Group (BCG) research shows that 70% of digital

2063","When observed in Table 5, the factor that has the lowest scale mean is accuracy. From these results, the question items 
cannot be predicted/predicted to have a value of 0.5 which is in the neutral category. 
 
5.5 Benchmark Analysis 
Schrepp (2010) conducted a study to provide comparative data containing data on 163 evaluations of various products 
using the UEQ framework. In the study, there were a total of 4,818 participants. Benchmark classifies a product into 
5 categories, namely Excellent (Very Good), Good (Good), Above Average (Above average), and Below Average 
(Below Average). Comparisons with benchmarks can be the first indicator of whether a new product provides 
sufficient UX to succeed in the marketplace. Comparing the UEQ calculation results with benchmarks allows 
conclusions about the relative strengths and weaknesses of the product. (Table 7) User expectations for UX in a 
platform generally increase over time. Based on benchmarks containing data from existing products, new products 
must achieve at least the good category across all factors (Schrepp, et al., 2017). 
   
Table 6 and Figure 1 show a comparison of the UEQ calculation results with benchmarks against other interactive 
digital platforms that have gone through UEQ testing in previous studies. From the results of this comparison, it is 
found that only the Novelty factor is at the good level and the rest is only at the above average level. 
 
4.3.3. Demographic Comparison (T-Test) 
In this study, researchers looked at differences in user experience based on the demographics of respondents (ME 
users) in the form of age, gender, and job position on the results of data processing of the six factors using T-Test.

2069","This stage is carried out to find out if there are significant differences between the six factors contained in each user 
profile. Based on the T-Test calculation on the UEQ scale, for age categories <30, 30-40, <40 only attractiveness and 
stimulation on the T-Test Calculation of the UEQ Scale Age Category <30 and 30-40 have significant differences. 
There is no significant difference between the scales on the UEQ between men and women. Moreover, based on results 
of the T-Test calculation, there is no significant difference between the scales on the UEQ between participants with 
positions in categories A and B.  
 
6. Conclusion  
• 
ME has a good level of user experience based on the acceptance scale on the attractiveness, efficiency, 
perspicuity, dependability, stimulation, novelty factors on UEQ. This is based on positive evaluation results 
with a threshold of 0.8. 
• 
From the results of benchmark comparisons against other interactive digital platforms that have gone through 
UEQ testing in previous studies, it is found that only the Novelty factor is at the good level and the rest is 
only at the above average level. Based on benchmarks containing data from existing products, new products 
must achieve at least the good category on all factors. 
• 
Only attractiveness and stimulation on the UEQ Scale T-Test calculation for Age Category <30 and 30-40 
have significant differences. There is no difference in acceptance scale on attractiveness, efficiency, 
perspicuity, dependability, stimulation, novelty factors on ME website for each gender category and customer 
position. 
• 
So far, the UI/UX development process in ME has only focused on the function of the web as an ordering 
channel, without paying attention to attractiveness. Therefore, it is also necessary to form a strategy to 
increase the attractiveness of the ME by considering the question items on the UEQ related to attractiveness. 
• 
UI/UX development needs to be done by prioritizing dependability, perspicuity, attractiveness, efficiency, 
and stimulation factors because these factors are still in the category above the average according to the 
benchmark.

1. Introduction  
According to the 2020 Central Statistics Agency (BPS) report, Indonesia is one of the countries experiencing an 
economic crisis due to the Corona pandemic from April to October 2020.  Although the Covid-19 pandemic has had 
a negative impact on various industrial sectors, in fact, in the midst of this pandemic and economic uncertainty, the 
Insurance technology (insurtech) sector or technology-based insurance is actually experiencing rapid growth in 
Indonesia. According to the Head of the Insurtech Department of the Indonesian Life Insurance Association (AAJI), 
the trend of health insurance continues to improve during the pandemic. This is indicated by the increasing number of 
premiums distributed by the industry and the lower number of claims from 2019 until the first half of 2021.  
  
It was explained that the distribution of health insurance premiums in 2020 reached Rp 11.74 trillion, an increase of 
11 percent on an annual basis. Meanwhile, premiums until the first quarter of 2021 have reached Rp 7.39 trillion or 
more than 50 percent from the previous year. Then, the total claim payments are also recorded to decrease every year. 
Payments for group and individual health insurance claims in 2020 were recorded at Rp 9.88 trillion. This amount is 
smaller than the premiums earned and decreased when compared to claims in 2019 which reached Rp 11.71 trillion. 
Meanwhile, the total claim payments until mid-2021 reached Rp 5.41 trillion. 
 
The reason for this increasing trend is that public awareness of the importance of health protection has increased 
during the pandemic. Second, the Indonesian people are starting to adapt to digital services such as the mushrooming 
trendembedded financesuch as retail investment applications to online loan applications that are widely used by the 
public when they start working from home. Apart from that, Indonesia is the third largest country in Asia that has 
internet users, around 212 million people. almost 90% of Indonesians use the internet. So it's not surprising that 
Indonesia is the fastest country to adapt to the shift from conventional culture to digital. 
  
Insurtech(Insurance Technology), basically changing the insurance industry radically and positively through digital 
technology innovation. Insurtech is a combination or collaboration between insurance and technology, where all 
activities from transactions to insurance claims use technology. With the existence of Insurtech (Insurance 
technology), it is expected to encourage increased use of insurance products through the provision of simple micro-
insurance products that are integrated with e-commerce platforms, making it easier for consumers to access insurance 
products. Currently, there are many types of Insurtech businesses growing from insurance management to processing, 
sales, data management, and more. The existence of InsurTech also further boosts the efficiency of the insurance 
business. In addition to reducing the risk of transmission of Covid-19,

Based on the test results shown in Table 5, it shows that Perceived Ease of Use has a positive effect on Perceived 
Usefulness, then Technology Attitude is positively influenced by Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness, 
Internet Knowledge and Product Knowledge. While the Trusting Attitude variable is also positively influenced by 
Internet Knowledge, Product Knowledge and Trusting Beliefs. The last on the Y variable, namely Intention to Use is 
positively influenced by Technology Attitude and Trusting Attitude. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The conclusion is that all the hypotheses that have been tested have a positive effect, with these results showing that 
through the technological advantage, it is hoped that Insurtech will be able to answer the three main problems that 
hinder the insurance industry, namely complicated access, difficult claim processes, and unaffordable premiums. 
Technology will also change the direction of the insurance industry, such as the way services are presented and offered, 
and the way insurance companies and customers interact.

1. Introduction 
Along with the times, business competition is no longer a mystery to the majority of business players; yet, business 
competition is a widespread phenomenon that will likely continue to emerge in the business world. This business 
competition is a result of technical advancements that make business competition between business players more 
intense, particularly for intercity Travel Agent businesses. Each of the many brands of inter-city travel agents will 
be perceived differently and randomly by consumers as a brand image that influences their purchasing decisions. 
This competitive phenomena causes players in the travel industry to compete to give the greatest service for 
prospective passengers; thus, corporate management must be able to develop, enhance, and retain customer 
satisfaction among competitors. In addition to relying on it through products or services with various differences 
and advantages, creating a brand is one of the capitals that enables enterprises to win the competition (Ahmad et 
al., 2021).  
 
According to Moeliono et al. (2020), a brand is an entity that gives meaning associated with value and represented 
in the form of a name, term, sign, symbol, or design, or a combination of both. A brand is intended to identify and 
differentiate the goods and services of a seller or group of sellers from its competitors. Moeliono et al. explain 
that a brand can have a very strong position and become capital/equity. Brands do play an important role for 
producers or consumers, because the brand is a promise from the seller or company to continue to be consistent 
in providing quality assurance for an item or service offered, but the role for a brand is not just a name or 
differentiator from competing brands (Hasbi et al., 2021). The brand is also expected to have strength in its market 
so that it can be accepted by consumers, which in the end the brand will have a level of brand loyalty from 
consumers. If consumers think that certain brands are physically different from competing brands, then the brand 
image will be attached continuously so that they can form loyalty to certain brands (Putri et al., 2021). That way 
the company must create a brand in order to differentiate it from competitors, because if there is an error in making 
the brand it will hinder all value that will enter the company. According to East et al. (2017), brands offer two 
types of benefits: functional and emotional. Functional benefits refer to the capabilities of the product offered. 
While the emotional benefit is the brand's ability to make users feel something during the buying process or during 
consumption.  
 
The marketing of travel services consists of several activities that aim to attract customers by motivating them to 
be interested in using them by holding a program. One of them is using social media. One of the communication 
channels used by several companies is social media platforms. Social media is defined as an online platform site 
or application that facilitates interaction, collaboration, or content sharing between users (Dewi et al., 2021). With 
the role of social media in marketing, companies can communicate more interactively and be innovative to channel

Then Based on the Table 8: 
● 
Hypothesis 1 In the variable SMMA (X) to Brand Awareness (Z1 ), has a T statistic value of 6.267 and 
a P value of 0.000. So it can be concluded that the two variables have a positive and significant effect 
because the acquisition value of these two variables is above 1.96. 
● 
Hypothesis 2, The SMMA variable (X) on Brand Image (Z2), has a T statistic value of 0.671 and a P 
value of 0.503. So it can be concluded that the two variables have a positive but insignificant effect 
because the value acquisition for these two variables is less than 1.96. 
● 
Hypothesis 3, the Brand Awareness (Z1) variable on Brand Image (Z2), has a T statistic value of 10,487 
and a P value of 0.000. So it can be concluded that the two variables have a positive and significant effect 
because the value acquisition for these two variables is above 1.96. 
● 
Hypothesis 4, the Brand Awareness (Z1) variable on Brand Loyalty (Y), has a T statistic value of 3.998 
and a P value of 0.000. So it can be concluded that the two variables have a positive and significant effect 
because the value acquisition for these two variables is above 1.96. 
● 
Hypothesis 5, the Brand Image (Z2) variable on Brand Loyalty (Y), has a T statistic value of 3.998 and 
a P value of 0.000. So it can be concluded that the two variables have a positive and significant effect 
because the value acquisition for these two variables is above 1.96.

5. Conclusion 
The researchers have conclusions in order to provide answers to the research studied as follows: 
1. Social Media Marketing Activities have a positive and significant effect on Consumer Brand Awareness 
of Cititrans Travel vehicle users and the truth is proven because the hypothesis is accepted. 
2. Social Media Marketing Activities have a positive but not significant effect because the value of these 
two variables is less than 1.96 and not proven true, so the hypothesis is rejected. 
3. Brand Awareness has a positive and significant effect on brand image and is proven true because the 
hypothesis can be accepted. 
4. Brand Awareness has a positive and significant effect on Brand Loyalty and is proven true because the 
hypothesis is acceptable. 
5. Brand Image has a positive and significant effect on Brand Loyalty and is proven true because the 
hypothesis can be accepted. 
 
The results of this study are inseparable from limitations, one of which is the difficulty of selecting respondents 
who know correctly about the Cititrans Travel company, because respondents are disseminated through social 
media or indirectly. However, this can be overcome by the way researchers explain in detail and well to 
respondents about the Cititrans company in the statements that have been made.

Abstract 
 
Indonesia is experiencing very rapid development in the field of technology, especially in the field of e-commerce. 
Many Indonesian people prefer to do activities online, one of which is online shopping. Therefore, the development 
of e-commerce in online shopping is growing very rapidly compared to the previous year due to the interest of the 
Indonesian people in using the internet as an activity that is considered easy and flexible. Through this research, we 
want to know how influential beliefs and attitudes towards online shopping behavior are to create consumer  
satisfaction in online shopping activities. Respondents in this study were people who had experience in online 
shopping. There are 100 respondents with data collection distributing questionnaires through social media such as 
whatsapp, instagram, line and data analysis using SMART PLS. The results of the research that have been analyzed 
show that there is an influence between beliefs, attitudes, consumer behavior, and customer satisfaction in online 
shopping activities. 
 
Keywords: Trust, Attitude, Online shopping behavior, Customer Satisfaction, Consumer Behavior 
 
1. Introduction 
The development of technology and information is much more rapid than in previous years. Technology and 
information are now increasingly sophisticated and modern. Information and communication can be obtained online 
via the internet. With the development of the internet, internet users are increasing, especially in Indonesia. Internet 
users in Indonesia increased by 27 million (+16%) between 2020 and 2021. (www.datareptal.com). In addition, the 
internet is also used for online trading media, providing a great opportunity for people to start and build a planned 
business. Trading via the internet online is often referred to as e-commerce (electronic commerce), by selling and 
buying the goods needed online. This e-commerce activity includes all physical buying and selling activities such as 
shipping goods, processing payments, marketing, and ordering products (Wigand, 1997). The growth of e-commerce 
provides many advantages for e-commerce users, namely convenience, time efficiency, and a variety of product 
choices (Kang & Namkung, 2019). 
 
E-commerce has altered the shopping habits of consumers, particularly online. E-commerce promotes value and 
quality to raise the attractiveness and satisfaction of users of online purchasing services in order to attract more 
customers. Due to this, online shopping continues to expand and become more convenient for consumers. More 
people are drawn to online buying due to the efficacy and efficiency of the time spent purchasing (Sari et al., 2021). 
Viewing or selecting products on multiple e-commerce websites can aid buyers in deciding to purchase the desired 
item. The purchase decisions of consumers are influenced by product descriptions and reviews of goods purchased 
by other consumers. E-commerce enables buyers to compare the lowest costs offered by different retailers for the 
same goods.  
 
Currently, online shopping services have established a variety of payment methods, including bank transfers, digital 
wallets, and even COD (cash on delivery), all of which can facilitate the purchasing process for consumers. 
However, online shopping services can pose risks for consumers, such as products that do not match expectations or 
images, products that do not arrive at their target addresses, and even fraud in the payment process for products to be 
purchased. 
 
Judging from the risk of online shopping in E-commerce, it can affect consumers' trust (Trust) when shopping 
online. Consumer trust is a key to making consumers buy products repeatedly. Building customer trust is one way to

Discussion 
The results of the study show that trust has a positive and significant effect on attitude. This proves that consumer 
trust affects the attitude of activity in online shopping. The higher the level of consumer confidence in online 
shopping on e-commerce or websites, the higher the level of consumer activity for shopping online. Based on 
previous research, trust is very important to increasing consumer confidence in online shopping (Ladhari & 
Michaud, 2015). Trust in online shopping will provide security and comfort in online transactions and activities. The 
results of this study prove that consumer trust is an important thing that must be maintained to create a positive 
attitude in online shopping. Consumers get satisfaction from online shopping and will make impulse buying. 
 
The research that has been done proves that the second hypothesis is the influence of attitude on online shopping 
behavior, this hypothesis proves that consumer attitudes have a positive and significant effect on online shopping 
behavior. Supporting the first hypothesis, namely trust has a positive and significant effect on attitude, then the trust 
that arises from consumers has an impact on attitudes made by consumers in online shopping, as well as attitudes if 
a significant attitude towards online shopping affects online shopping behavior.  
 
The results of the third hypothesis are that trust has a positive and significant effect on online shopping behavior. 
This supports the first hypothesis, that with the emergence of a sense of trust and comfort in online shopping, it will 
increase consumer behavior in shopping online and consumers will make impulse buying online because there is 
satisfaction in online shopping itself with a sense of trust given to e-commerce (Putri et al., 2021). 
 
The results of the fourth hypothesis that trust has a positive and significant effect on online shopping behavior 
through attitude. Trust is closely related to consumer attitudes and attitudes towards online purchasing behavior. 
Consumers in Indonesia prove that trust has an impact on attitudes and behavior in online shopping. The results of 
the study prove that trust has a positive and significant effect on online shopping behavior through the attitudes of 
consumers. 
 
5. Conclusion 
From the research that has occurred, it is explained that the trust variable has a positive and significant influence on 
consumer attitudes in shopping online and makes consumer behavior in online shopping increase positively because 
with increased trust built by online sellers to ensure that online shopping is more effective and easy to do anywhere. 
Therefore, a purchase attitude can be formed from the sense of trust that has been built from the online shop. From 
this research, it is known that trust is an important thing in business, especially online business, online sellers should 
focus on the trust that is built for consumers because active communication can improve the brand image of the 
online store itself. And managing the online store system itself is one of the capital for online sellers to build 
consumer trust in Indonesia.

1. Introduction 
Nowadays, taking care of the body and beautifying themselves is a must for some women. This phenomenon makes 
entrepreneurs in the beauty industry increasingly innovate in presenting various types of beauty and body care products 
according to market demand (Rodríguez Jasso et al., 2022). Judging from the many types of beauty treatments and 
new brands emerging, the Ministry of Industry targets the growth of the cosmetic industry in Indonesia to grow by 
more than 9% during 2019. The Ministry of Industry is also focused on improving Indonesia's beauty industry by 
transforming it towards digital technology. The use of digital technology is considered very appropriate to be used in 
the current era. The development of digital technology today greatly affects various aspects of life, one of which is 
running a business (Hasbi et al., 2021). With digital technology, it can expand market reach and can provide 
information about these products quickly and efficiently so that these products can be widely known. Purchases of 
beauty and body care products can not only be done directly at traditional stores but can also be purchased online 
through various kinds of e-commerce (Electronic Commerce). Purchasing products online can make it easier for 
consumers who do not have enough time to come directly to shop at the store. 
 
E-commerce can be interpreted simply as selling or buying a product online so that consumers do not need to come to 
the store to get the desired product (Sari et al., 2021). The increase in the number of e-commerce users in Indonesia 
based on the results of the We Are Social survey in April 2021, as many as 88.1% of internet users in Indonesia use 
e-commerce services to buy the products they need. This is the highest percentage rate in the world for e-commerce. 
In e-commerce, beauty products are ranked as the third most sold product. This is because most e-commerce users are 
women. 
 
March 2015 began the establishment of the Sociolla e-commerce company in Indonesia. Sociolla e-commerce was 
founded by Christanti Indiana, Christopher Madian, and John Rasjid. The purpose of the establishment of Sociolla is 
to make it easier for potential consumers to buy beauty products that are safe and already BPOM. Sociolla e-commerce 
also has categories for the products they sell, such as makeup, skincare, hair care, bath and body, accessories,

Abstract 
This study aims to determine the impact of customer satisfaction on customer behavior in purchase intention in the 
local brand products (Urban Traffic Distro). The rapid expansion of the Indonesian fashion industry, particularly the 
local goods supplied by a number of distribution stores (Distribution Stores), of which Urban Traffic Distro is one, 
is a significant factor. Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises' potential to contribute to improving the community's 
welfare must be continuously bolstered and strengthened by attempting to reduce the hurdles they confront. 
Depending on the quality of the product, the commodities offered in distribution are intended to satisfy the needs of 
both adolescents and adults. This study's sample consists of Urban Traffic Distro clients who have made purchases 
there. One hundred respondents comprised the sample, which was evaluated using path analysis and the third 
version of the SmartPLS application. All variables had a favorable and statistically significant impact on purchasing 
decisions at Urban Traffic Distro.

1. Intoduction 
The creative economy is a new way of thinking about business that puts knowledge, innovation, and Human 
Resources (HR) at the center of production. Products in the creative economy are different, stand out, and have 
qualities. The goods made by the creative economy may also be a new version of existing products. The expansion 
of Indonesia's creative economy is significantly driven by the fashion industry, which accounts for 18.01 percent of 
the country's gross domestic product, or Rp. 116 trillion. The fashion subsector represents 18.15 percent of the 
economic GDP, second only to the culinary subsector (41.69%). This shows that the fashion industry significantly 
impacts how people perceive the Indonesian economy. The fashion industry has transitioned from a biological to a 
sociocultural function, becoming a sign of socioeconomic strata, lifestyle, self-image, and taste. The fast growth of 
the fashion industry in Indonesia, especially for local goods sold by several distribution stores (Distribution Stores), 
one of which is Urban Traffic Distro. Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) potential to contribute to 
improving the community's welfare must be continuously bolstered and strengthened by attempting to reduce the 
hurdles they confront (Pradana et al., 2021). Depending on the product's quality, the goods sold through distribution 
are made to meet the needs of both young people and adults. Customers like things that are unique and popular. 
Customers' buying decisions are affected not only by how complete the product is but also by its location and price 
(Elisa et al., 2022). 
 
Furthermore, SMEs must be able to adjust marketing content to client specific preferences or community interests. 
As a result, Small and Medium Enterprises must select the appropriate marketing material to foster strong 
relationships, resulting in consumer behavior and long-term performance for the organization. Consumer behavior 
studies how individuals, groups, and organizations choose, purchase, use, and interact with goods, services, ideas, 
and experiences to meet their needs and desires (Yeo et al., 2017). Meanwhile, customer experience research has 
been conducted in various industries, including weblogs, travel agencies, and social media marketing (Kumar et al., 
2021; Yeo et al., 2017). As a result, this study presents a framework that incorporates client experience to address 
the limitations of earlier research. This study aims to analyze the effect of customer experience on customer 
engagement, as represented by the relationship quality construct, as well as purchase intention. Moreover, efforts are 
made to provide Small and Medium Enterprises with insight and direction in order for them to achieve their 
marketing objectives and provide sustainable performance for their Small and Medium Enterprises.

2121","5. Conclusion 
Some of the conclusions that should help answer the questions raised in this study are as follows: 
 
As a whole, respondents and customers think that factors like customer behavior and customer experience are quite 
good and important. This shows that the Customer Behavior Activity factor has a lot to do with the Buying 
Decision. Therefore, this is one of the factors that local brand products (Urban Traffic Distro) must consider in order 
to increase sales: they must pay attention to customer habits and create a positive shopping experience (Urban 
Traffic Distro). Overall, customer behavior factors affect the customer experience and the buying decision. Also, 
there is the Customer Experience factor, which, according to the respondents and customers, is very good and has a 
big effect. These results show that the Customer Experience factor is very important to the Buying Decision. So this 
is also one of the things that local brand products (Urban Traffic Distros) need to consider if they want to attract 
customers and make them more likely to shop at local brand products (Urban Traffic Distros). So, customer 
behavior and customer experience become important in deciding whether or not they buy local brand products 
(Urban Traffic Distro). Therefore, local brands like Urban Traffic Distro need to pay attention to and keep up their 
customers' shopping experience in stores to make customers more likely to buy.

1. Introduction 
Social Media nowadays is a place to disseminate various information and a place to connect with many people 
everywhere. Reality shows that knowing the needs and wants of consumers is not easy. Internet users in Indonesia in 
early 2021 reached 202.6 million people. This number increased by 15.5 percent or 27 million people when compared 
to January 2020. The current population of Indonesia is 274.9 million people. Social media users in Indonesia in early 
2021 reached 170 million people. This number increased by 6.3 percent, or 10 million people compared to 2020. The 
number of social media users in Indonesia was equivalent to 61.8% of the total population in January 2021. 
 
Elzatta, one of the Muslim fashion brands, has seriously started working on digital marketing strategies since last year. 
Actually, the digital marketing strategy has been started for 2-3 years ago, it's just that at that time it wasn't serious. 
Then, the return of the second generation, which is now involved in building this brand, decided to build a special 
team to strengthen the brand in digital channels further. This includes collaborating with marketplaces, one of which 
is Shopee in selling their products by building a virtual store there. For the past year we have focused again with a 
special team to manage digital marketing strategies in an integrated manner, and Elzatta Hijab started a collaboration 
with Shopee in April 2019. For the first time seriously, Elzatta said a special event with several influencers at Eastern 
Apulance, South Jakarta, in conjunction with the launch of the seasonal ""Gayatri"" collection, a collection of batik 
hijabs that elevates the cultural richness of the archipelago. Several well-known influencers who attended this event 
were Citra Kirana, Chacha Frederica, Annisa Azizah, Nina Septiani, Natasha Rizky, Ryana Dea and Host Ben 
Kasyafani as well as dozens of other influencers. 
 
Reporting from the Elzatta Hijab website to make it easier for customers to get Elzatta collections without having to 
go to the store, since 2015, Elzatta has provided online purchasing services at www.elzatta.com. On this site, customers 
can find Elzatta collections in a variety of models, colors, sizes and the best prices. In 2018, elzatta.com comes with 
a better system and display, making it easier for customers. In the midst of a pandemic like this, many stores are 
making various efforts to survive during the pandemic. At present, many stores are turning to online stores, such as 
using E-Commerce and activating the website store at the store, it is also caused by pandemic conditions that limit 
everyone's movement (Sari et al., 2021). And during a pandemic like this, so that Elzatta Hijab continues to run 
through its marketing on Instagram social media. 
 
On the other side of Elzatta's strategy to rise from the pandemic, Elzatta is also actively using social media for sales. 
With the development of technology and the current era of globalization on social media which has created various 
types and business opportunities through all forms of buying and selling transactions using electronics and the internet

Table 4. Multiple Linear Regression 
 
 
Based on the result of multiple linear regression in Table 4, the following equation can be formulated : Y = 0.256 
+ 0.954X 
Based on these equations can be described as follows: 
a. Constant (a) = 0.256 That is, if the Social Media Marketing Consumption, Curation, Creation, and 
collaboration values are 0, then the Sales Volume is 0.256. 
b. Consumption (X1) = -0.177, meaning that each increase in consumption by 1 unit will reduce the amount 
of buying interest by 0.177. 
c. Curation (X2) = 0.280, meaning that every 1 unit increase in curation will increase the amount of buying 
interest by 0.280. 
d. Creation (X3) = -0.059, meaning that every 1 unit increase in creation will reduce the amount of buying 
interest by 0.059. 
e. Collaboration (X4) = 0.910, meaning that every 1 unit increase in Collaboration will increase the number 
of buying interests by 0.910. 
 
The Influence of X1, X2, X3, and X4 Through Y 
Variable Consumption (X1), Curation (X2), Creation (X3), and Collaboration (X4) have a significant effect on the 
dependent variable, namely Purchase Interest (Y). This shows that the Consumption, Curation, Creation, and 
Collaboration that have been implemented on Elzatta Hijab have succeeded in showing consumer buying interest in 
Elzatta Hijab. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research and discussion on Social Media Marketing Consumption, Curation, Creation, and 
Collaboration on Consumer Buying Interest of Elzatta Hijab which has been stated in the previous chapter, several 
conclusions can be drawn that the researcher hopes to be able to provide answers to the problems formulated in this 
study. Here is the conclusion: 
a. Variable (X1) Consumption based on respondent Elzatta Hijab's response, overall, belongs to the good category. 
b. Variable (X2) Curation based on respondent Elzatta Hijab's response, overall, it belongs to the good category. 
c. Variable (X3) Creation based on respondent Elzatta Hijab's response, overall, it belongs to the good category. 
d. Variable (X4) Collaboration based on respondent Elzatta Hijab's response is included in the good category. 
e. Referring to the results of the Descriptive Analysis, the variable (Y) Buying Interest, based on the respondents' 
responses, as a whole belongs to the Very Good Category. 
Variable Consumption Curation, creation, and Collaboration have an effect on consumer buying interest indicated by 
the coefficient of determination (R2), which is 93% while the remaining 7% is the influence of other factors that the 
researcher did not use in this study.

Abstract  
 
After a successful launch and deployment of the first Paraguayan satellite, a CubeSat style, the GuaraniSat, public 
attention on how the New Space era is reaching this country was evidenced. This historical event helped inspire 
students to be involved in STEM. This was the motivation to design a workshop on nanosatellite system integration. 
With this, we expected improvements in teaching engineering fundamentals to college students. Space-related 
educational programs have grown in popularity as a motivating way to teach STEM subjects. Past CanSat (Can-
Satellite) training program for teachers was proven to be effective in motivating students into STEM. In this work, a 
similar teaching approach was conducted. This time, a CubeSat-style prototype for educational purposes was used. 
Students were trained under this platform on subsystem integration and operations. This workshop was intended to 
teach engineering fundamentals such as sensor principles, signal conditioning systems, data acquisition fundamentals, 
and graphical user interface theory to a senior-level engineering student. This study aims to measure students learning 
performance as they learn on each satellite subsystem working principles and how all of this is integrated and operated 
from a friendly graphical user interface. Indicators such as the following will be used to assess the impact on learning 
effectiveness: Experimentation and Iteration, Trial and Debugging, Reusing and Remixing, Abstraction and 
Modularization and will be scored as low, medium, or high. In addition, problem-solving abilities based on the Polya

2130","In this Figure 5 on the process of abstraction and modularization, 100% moderately concluded ""They decide what 
objects are needed in their project and when they should go."" In addition, 100% concluded that they have a high degree 
to ""decide what programs are needed in their project and what they should do."" In the same vein, 100% concluded 
that they have a high degree to ""Organize programs so that they make sense both for themselves and for others."" 
In the latter criterion, it was possible to observe a better understanding and a high level in the decision of which 
programs are needed in their project and what they should improve, in addition to the organization of the programs so 
that they make sense for them and others; and in an intermediate degree when deciding what objects, they need in 
their projects and where they should go. 
Measurement of the usability of the GUI created to interact with the CubeSats module and electronic 
measuring devices. 
According to ISO 25010, the usefulness of the software product is its ability to be understood, learned, used and 
become attractive to the user when used under certain conditions. 
In this sense, a brief questionnaire was applied to measure this capacity in reference to the Graphical User Interface 
(GUI) created to interact with the CubeSats module. 
The premise that the student ""operates from a friendly graphical user interface"" was carried out by applying a 6-point 
Likert-type questionnaire (0, Nothing; 1, Little; 2, Something-going; 3, Quite; 4, Much; 5, Much). 9 (nine) participated 
in the sample voluntarily after a call made by the teacher in charge of the experimental class. 
The following results were obtained: 11.1% said the GUI was not understandable and 88.9% said it was 
understandable. Regarding the ability to be learned, used and attractive to the user, 100% of the participants agreed 
that the GUI had such capabilities. 
4. Conclusion  
With this work, it has been possible to conclude that students, when introducing a challenge in the classroom, with a 
prototype of a didactic module such as CubeSat, are able to develop skills to much or less extent when it is intended 
to focus on STEAM areas. It must be combined with methodologies that promote active participation. 
In this same context, when testing and debugging the students showed that they are highly able to describe the 
challenge, but a weak ability to observe, review, look for other ways to solve the challenge was observed. This could 
be because it is necessary to change the focus of how to teach STEAM and use innovative methodologies that 
encourage problem-solving thinking. 
In summary, all the students concluded that it was more satisfying for them to develop abstraction and modularization, 
which means that it was not difficult for them to make decisions and know how to self-organize. 
In short, the teacher must be prepared to serve as a guide in the process and, as such, he/she must handle the 
methodology necessary to succeed in the implementation of didactic modules in the classroom. The repetition of the 
experiment addresses in greater depth the combination of innovative teaching methodologies that develop problem-
solving thinking skills in areas yet to be studied. 
A suggestion for the improvement of the understanding and motivating of the students on the points not achieved is 
the incorporation of various methodologies of problem-solving, as well as the promotion of the participation of the 
students in the didactic strategy and the active feedback in the process.

Abstract  
 
This study aimed to determine the effect of Intellectual Capital and Technology Strategy on the Innovation Strategy. 
The innovation strategy is a strategy to create added value and serve customers as needed. Quantitative and associative 
research methods are used to determine the effect between variables Questionnaires were delivered to 48 logistics 
service provider employees from June to August 2021, composed of staff, managers, senior managers, and directors). 
This study uses four dimensions for the innovation strategy: innovation expenditures, internal research and 
development, innovation cooperation, and emphasis. The intellectual capital variable uses two dimensions: Internal 
Intellectual Capital and External Intellectual Capital. Meanwhile, the technology strategy variable uses six 
dimensions: pioneering, product portfolio breadth, process portfolio breadth, external technology sources, foresight, 
and organizational mechanism—this study uses SPSS 26 to analyze the data with the regression method. The study 
found that the Intellectual Capital and Technology Strategy positively and significantly influenced the Innovation 
Strategy.

1. Introduction 
The term outsourcing itself has a close relationship with the process of supply chain management, and this is because 
companies generally delegate or transfer to third parties the process of taking goods from suppliers and delivering 
goods to consumers (Newswire, 2017). This outsourcing trend can also be seen in the number of companies that 
provide logistics services locally and globally, commonly referred to as Logistics Service Providers (LPS). LPS is a 
business that provides one or more logistics-related services used by consumers that can facilitate the movement of 
parts and materials from suppliers to manufacturers, end products from manufacturing, and finished goods from 
manufacturing to delivery. Distribution to retail stores (Gurcan et al., 2016). It can be concluded that these LPS 
companies are third-party companies that accept the delegation of responsibility from a company to carry out part or 
all of the logistics activities of a company by transferring the logistics activities to the LPS company. There are many 
benefits that companies can gain, such as focusing on the company's core competencies, reducing risk, and making 
the company's logistics process more effective and efficient. LPS provides ordinary and various logistics services, 
including transportation, warehousing, distribution, and consolidation (Batarliene & Jarasuniene, 2017).  
 
According to Negara and Kristinae (2018), innovation is a process of creating, sharing, and using the knowledge that 
develops organizational performance and learning, modifies, uses, and accesses knowledge. The innovation strategy 
is an LPS company strategy to create added value and serve customers as needed. This condition is due to client 
companies competing to implement strategies by making all business processes work efficiently, focusing more on 
the company's core competencies.

2139","5.3 Proposed Improvements  
In this study, several issues require attention based on the data processing results recapitulated from the respondents' 
answers. It was found that the question with the highest average value of the variable Intellectual Capital (X1) in the 
questionnaire was the indicator X1. 1, namely ""I feel I have mastered enough knowledge about the company I work 
for,"" indicating that the majority of respondents agree that LPS company is always trying to find out about the 
company. Seeing this, it is perfect that the company consistently maintains and does something that can make the 
activities of the employees in the company more efficient. Of course, this can improve the innovation strategy with 
company-owned indicators. On the other hand, it was also found that the question with the lowest average value was 
indicator X1.I3, namely ""I feel that the company's relationship with its customers and suppliers is quite good,"" which 
means that the respondents in the company they pay more attention to employee relations compared to competitors. 
Furthermore, in the questionnaire, the Technological Strategy variable (X2) was the indicator X2.2, namely ""Is your 
company leading the development of technology in your industry?"" indicating that most respondents agree that LPS 
company is a leader in deep technology development. Seeing this, it is perfect that the company always performs 
maintenance to maintain communication services. On the other hand, the question with the lowest average score is 
indicator X2.11, namely ""Is it your company's policy to wait for other companies to introduce new technology and 
copy it quickly?"" which means that Respondents tend to assume that the latest technology strategy is not used, so in 
this case, the company should pay better attention. 
 
5.4 Validation 
The validity test is a step to test the accuracy level of an instrument in a specific concept  (Uma Sekaran & Roger 
Bougie, 2016:220). By performing a validity test, the researchers can verify that the measurement instrument is indeed 
adequate. In this study, the results of the validity test of the instrument for the variables Intellectual Capital (X1), 
Technological Strategy (X2), and Innovation Strategy (Y) show the appropriate level of precision, namely r count > r 
table 0.15. When using the statistical analysis software SPSS version 26.0, the results of the reliability test of the 
Innovation Strategy variable are 0.906; Intellectual Capital is 0.856; Technology Strategy is 0.825 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the research and data processing that has been carried out, that is, to see the influence of 
intellectual capital and the technological strategy on the innovation strategy, it can be concluded that: intellectual 
capital has a positive and significant influence on the innovation strategy. It shows that the better the intellectual 
capital the company implements, the better the innovation strategy. The technological strategy positively and 
significantly influences the innovation strategy. It shows that the better the technological strategy implemented by the 
company, the better the innovation strategy.

Abstract 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic took the world by surprise, affecting millions of people and families in Paraguay and 
worldwide. We analyze the country's situation after the arrival of batches of anti-Covid-19 vaccines to formulate a 
mathematical model that allows efficient distribution of vaccines to citizens of the central department. Even more, 
maximizing the number of citizens in high-risk situations vaccinated with the help of a third-party company willing 
to lend its logistics fleet of trucks and drivers. We propose a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP-type) 
mathematical model to find the optimal travel routes for fair distribution at the lowest possible cost. To solve the 
model, different parameters must be considered, such as the opening time of the vaccination centers, the drivers' 
working hours, and the vehicles' capacity, among others. In addition, in the case study, certain assumptions are 
considered to limit the initial situation before solving the model. One supposition is the demand, considered from July 
to September, when the country received the most significant number of vaccines. In this work, only the distribution 
of the Pfizer vaccine and all the care it requires was considered since it is the most widely available vaccine in the 
country. The proposed methodology is valid as a first instance to solve the distribution problem in the central 
department. It applies to other departments and vaccines for other diseases by changing the appropriate parameters.

1. Introduction 
Diseases are inherent to the human being, they have always been present over time, but technology has advanced with 
them, what nobody expected was that a pandemic would take the world by surprise and completely paralyze a disease 
that little is known about. 
 
Technology is advancing rapidly again, and vaccines against COVID-19 are already available in producing and 
importing countries. As for Paraguay, it has companies dedicated to logistics distribution willing to lend their logistics 
infrastructure for the distribution of vaccines. 
 
Based on these detected problems and opportunities, the research question was formulated to obtain a fair and 
equitable distribution management scheme for citizens, and that is useful for the outsourced company, using 
mathematical modeling as a support technique for decision-making. of decisions.  
 
2. Vehicle Routing Problem 
The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is one of the most studied combinatorial optimization problems and deals with 
the optimal design of routes to be used by a fleet of vehicles to serve a set of customers. 
 
The literature abounds with solution approaches for TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) and VRP (Vehicle Routing 
Problem). These can be classified as follows:

10.1 Conclusions 
It was possible to design a Linear Programming model, for the correct and fair distribution of vaccines against COVID 
- 19 to minimize total costs and distribute equitably to each city. The best solution is obtained using 2 trucks with a 
capacity of 65,000 vaccines and 3 drivers with a final total cost of 768,059 ₲. 
 
The results are positive due to the speed with which the entire area can be supplied as well as the minimum costs that 
were achieved by using resources efficiently and complying with the limitations presented by the third company, which 
provides its distribution services. and logistics, to support the MSPyBS vaccine distribution management. 
 
It is worth mentioning that currently the situation of Paraguayan citizens in the country to which the investigation is 
limited in terms of the need to distribute vaccines against COVID-19 is not in a state of emergency. However, this 
mathematical model could be used by the MSPyBS soon for the distribution of vaccines against other diseases, 
previously modifying the parameters to adapt the model to the new case study and obtain the resolution. 
 
10.2 Recommendations 
For the efficient distribution of vaccines, in a fair and equal manner, as well as at the lowest possible cost, we 
recommend weekly distribution in two trucks with a capacity of 65,000 vaccines each. 
 
The model is detailed and given the future need for a massive distribution of vaccines, whether for COVID-19, its 
variations, or other diseases, we suggest pilot testing and application by the institutions that consider the proposed study 
and mathematical model necessary. 
 
In order to obtain plans that adjust to the reality of the moment in which the implementation of the mathematical model 
is carried out, it is necessary that they have: the definition of the geographical scope of the distribution, the distribution 
requirements of the vaccine to be transported, definition of updated transportation costs, registration of historical data 
that may be relevant (population of the area, number of people affected by the disease, among others). 
 
For future work that could be developed from the results obtained, it is recommended: Regarding the programming of 
the mathematical model, analyze the possibility of including in the design all the activities and costs associated with 
distribution without the collaboration of a third party company, extend the period of time to be considered, as well as 
the geographical area of study due to the differences that may be found (route conditions, number of vaccinations 
available) between the central department and the other departments of the country.

1. Introduction 
To face the increasing competition in the global market, the need for higher production efficiency, and lower operating 
costs to achieve good performance and competitiveness, companies must seek innovative business methods. Due to 
technological advances, environmental and social issues that are being considered today, companies are forced to 
focus on the sustainability of operations management. (Magon et al., 2018). Sustainability is directly related to three 
pillars: environment, social, and economy (Cherrafi et al., 2017). One of the most complex problems facing 
organizations today is how to achieve success through strategies in support of environmental and social sustainability, 
but efforts to improve this have been seen as an obstacle to economic sustainability in organizations (Zhong & Wu, 
2015). However, recently many businesses have found that these efforts result in reduced operating costs and increased 
employee satisfaction (Resta, Dotti, Gaiardelli & Boffelli, 2016).  
 
The use of management systems to solve global sustainability challenges has now been explored (Tasdemir & Gazo, 
2018). Sustainability has been implemented through various systems related to environmental management, health 
and safety management, and social responsibility management (Nunhes, Motta & Oliveira, 2016). In this context, 
Lean Six Sigma as a management system that can achieve the expected results for organizational sustainability through 
continuous improvement methodologies. (Antony, Gupta, Sunder & Gijo, 2018). Lean Six Sigma is a business strategy 
and methodology that improves performance processes by having the skills, techniques and tools to find sustainable 
solutions to reduce waste, optimize resources, and increase process efficiency (Lu, Laux & Antony, 2017). The success 
of Lean Six Sigma as one of the most popular methods of continuous improvement has led many companies around 
the world to implement it, to tackle their operations and become more competitive (Antony, Snee & Hoerl, 2017). The 
methodology used by Lean Six Sigma to solve a problem includes five phases called the DMAIC cycle (Define, 
Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) (Patel et al., 2019). Many studies have explored the relation between Lean 
Six Sigma and Sustainability, but there is an inconsistency in these studies regarding the relation between Lean Six 
Sigma and Sustainability from different industrial sectors, also the approaches and tools used to apply the Lean Six 
Sigma methodology. Therefore, due to the lack of knowledge of the relation between Lean Six Sigma and 
Sustainability, the authors conducted a Systematic Literature Review to determine this relation, then presented various 
approaches and tools that have been used to apply the Lean Six Sigma methodology. This research relies on journal 
references for the past 13 years from 2008 to 2020, with the reason that this topic just appeared and discussed in 2008, 
then further research has been conducted to date.

5. Conclusion  
Based on the results of the Systematic Literature Review of 16 articles about the Relation between Lean Six Sigma 
and Sustainability, it can be concluded that the relation between Lean Six Sigma and Sustainability in different sectors 
of the Service Industry and Manufacturing Industry has a positive impact. These various industrial sectors, which is 
the Service Industry on Governance, Construction, Healthcare, and KPO / BPO (Knowledge Process Outsourcing / 
Business Process Outsourcing) sectors and the Manufacturing Industry on Automotive, Food, Packing, Hard-Disc 
Drive, and Electric Component sectors. 
 
In addition, three approaches are used, which is DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control), DMAIC 
+ Transparency and Accountability (DMAIC Modify), and VSM-DMAIC. DMAIC is applied in the Service industry 
on Construction, Healthcare, and KPO / BPO sectors, and is also applied in the Manufacturing industry on Automotive, 
Hard-disc Drive, Packing and Electric Component sectors. Then, the DMAIC + Transparency and Accountability 
(DMAIC Modify) approach is applied in the Service industry on Governance sector, and the VSM-DMAIC approach

2171","is applied in the Manufacturing industry on Food sector. Meanwhile, the tools used depend on each phase and the 
industry. 
 
The suggestion for businesspeople is the need to apply the Lean Six Sigma method through the DMAIC approach in 
the Service and Manufacturing industries, DMAIC + Transparency and Accountability (DMAIC Modify) in the 
Service industry on Governance sector, and VSM-DMAIC in the Manufacturing industry on Food sector. 
Furthermore, using the recommended tools to conduct rigorous evaluation on process of planning, development, 
project team management, measurement system analysis, organizational leadership, and communication strategies for 
achieving sustainability in the company. In this way, companies can identify areas that need improvement and result 
in cost savings, increased efficiency, improved quality, and better customer service.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this research is to determine the challenges that hinder the Humanitarian Logistics (HL) process of 
natural disasters, the causes of the challenges that often arise from natural disasters, and the methods applied to solve 
these problems. The methods used in this research are a Systematic Literature Review, Publish or Perish 7 application 
(data analysis method), and the Scopus Search option. The researchers found that the challenges hindering the process 
of HL are location, network, waste management, and financial funds. Causes of these challenges are generally 
uncertainty, constraints and immobility, limited resources, and failure of minor problems (such as lack of appropriate 
responses, delay times, personnel shortages, injustice, and conflict/competition). Methods that are applied to these 
challenges mostly consist of mathematical models, the articles that don't use mathematical models usually focus on 
potential solutions, or already have clear solutions.

1. Introduction 
Since the 1950s, both the number affected and the magnitude of disasters have continued to increase, averaging around 
235 million people per year since the 1990s (Boonmee, Arimura, & Asada, 2017). The degree and impact of natural 
disasters have increased dramatically in recent decades due to population growth, global trends in urbanism, land use, 
and ecosystem pressures (Tofighi, Torabi, & Mansouri, 2016). According to Xu, Wang, Shen, Ouyang, & Tu (2016) 
it is explained that a natural disaster is a catastrophic event with an atmosphere, with geological and hydrological 
origins such as drought, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, landslides that can cause death, property damage and social 
environment disturbance. Furthermore, according to Cozzolino, Wankowicz, & Massaroni (2017), the sudden trend 
of natural disasters can be considered as the reason for the increasing interest in humanitarian logistics among 
academics and professionals. 
 
In the world of logistics, a disaster condition is known as humanitarian logistics. The definition of humanitarian 
logistics is the process of evacuating people whose area of living is hit by a disaster by implementing and controlling 
the flow of goods and materials that are efficient, cost-effective, and collect information from the point of origin to 
the point of consumption for the purpose of alleviating people's suffering (Boonmee, Arimura, M., & Asada, 2017). 
In situations of natural disasters, it can be categorized according to the types of disasters as described by Harrison & 
Johnson (2016), namely the pre-disaster period with the mitigation and preparedness phase, and a post-disaster period 
with the response and recovery phase. From a review of the literature, it has been observed that there is still much to 
learn about effective relief operations, especially in post-disaster situations. According to Banomyong, 
Varadejsatitwong and Oloruntoba (2019) it was found that generally, literature reviews focus mainly on the mitigation 
and preparedness phases, however only eight papers specifically discuss the recovery phase in post-disaster. They 
explained that this topic was still lacking, due to the lack of post-disaster links with humanitarian logistics. 
Ransikarbum & Mason (2016) argues that, although research on humanitarian logistics has recently increased, those 
examining the response and recovery phases in post-disaster operations are few and far between.

information technology, monitoring, transparency, security, and communication. 
 
Overall, the methods used to solve the challenges in HL-PD are mathematical models that are uniquely generated 
based on each problem/challenge that is focused on by the articles. Although almost all articles produce mathematical 
models for solving focus challenges, some articles do not require a mathematical model to solve the challenges. These 
articles are those whose topic proposes solutions to focus on as their main challenge (e.g., hybrid cargo drones). 
 
4. Conclusion  
Based on the research articles selected to be analyzed to answer the 3 research questions (challenges, causes, and 
methods), it can be concluded that the challenges that hinder humanitarian logistics after natural disasters consist of 4 
main challenges, namely (1) location, (2) waste management, (3) networks and (4) financial funds. The challenges 
most often faced in the topic of HL-PD in natural disasters are location, which is divided into sub-challenges: 
allocation or distribution, other potential solutions (eg. drones), location of facilities, route problems, and procurement. 
Causes of challenges hindering the post-disaster humanitarian logistics process are (1) uncertainty, (2) constraints and 
immobility, (3) limited availability of resources, (4) failure of humanitarian issues: lack of appropriate responses, (5) 
time delays, (6) lack of personnel, (7) injustice, and (8) conflict/competition. The methods applied to help solve 
problems that occur after natural disasters mostly use mathematical modelling methods. However, the authors also 
found that there are certain articles that don't use mathematical modelling (an example is a research article that focuses 
on a potential solution in drones). 
 
The authors’ suggestion for future research prospects is to focus on a natural disaster. This is because this study found 
that there are currently too many articles that discuss and focuses on earthquakes and natural disasters in general, 
while there are still many examples of other natural disasters, such as landslides, drought, abrasion (coastal erosion) 
and so on, and their application to further develop in using mathematical modelling methods to solve problems. Then 
it can be seen based on the causes of the research, which are network problems, waste management, financial funds, 
and location distribution, that businesses should avoid the main causes that incite these problems so that they can 
handle and resolve them more quickly and effectively to help victims of natural disasters. By doing this, businesses 
can identify the causes of disasters that must be avoided and produce good and quality handling in humanitarian 
logistics when helping victims of natural disasters.

Abstract 
 
One big problem on rockets is the roll control, encountering that issue on the rocket control system. It is relegating 
the issue to the stabilizer system of electronic canard, which has some problems such as the time that takes to develop 
the algorithm responsible for the correction. Therefore, it is intended to aid the rocket with a passive system very well-
known and researched which is in use on the AIM-9 missiles. By this, it focusses to reduce man-time hours of software 
development relegating all the stabilization to a mechanical device cheaper and easy to make that the electronic 
alternative. Intending to design the rolleron device to operate with the friction of the relative air affecting the device, 
making spin the assembly and creating a gyroscopic effect that keeps the rocket stray. Not least it will be comparing 
the stabilization rate with the normal fins and the fins changed with the rolleron integrated and compare the 
stabilization rate and accuracy at the moment of keeping the whole rocket stray. Last, there is hoped to make a better 
system to control the rocket making it more stable at longitudinal axis and roll, the use of mechanical devices makes 
it simpler reducing the complexity and with it reducing the number of components and things that can fail so the 
rolleron can make the rocket more reliability, and maybe it will be cheaper and easy to build. For this project, there is 
the hope to build an alternative stabilization system for rockets.

Abstract  
 
One mandatory requirement for validating new electronic devices and machines is electromagnetic compatibility 
(EMC) tests because any new design can emit or receive unwanted electrical interference, affecting the operation 
of other systems or devices in their environment. This requirement becomes critical in the case of real-time control 
systems, electromedical devices, and outer space operations. The Gigahertz Transverse Electromagnetic Cell 
(GTEM) is a tool for performing preliminary electromagnetic compatibility tests on new products. It generates a 
standardized and uniform electromagnetic field in a shielded environment, integrating pyramidal electromagnetic 
absorbers with large bandwidth. Compared to other environments, such as an anechoic chamber, its reduced 
dimensions and cost make it a suitable test laboratory environment for EMC measurements. This article describes 
the steps to design and build a Radio frequency isolated chamber (GTEM) with dimensions 4 m long, 2.2 m wide, 
and 1.5 m high. A literature review of the recommendations is summarized. The design of the mechanical parts 
and construction techniques are described to generate a construction guide for future interested parties. Its critical 
dimension was analyzed with simulations using finite elements method to match the characteristic impedance of 
the exciter impedance and guarantee to minimize reflections.

1. Introduction  
A GTEM cell is a chamber that acts like a coaxial transmission line whose dimensions gradually increases until 
it ends in a flat base. It has a pyramidal form, more like a wedge from a sphere with a solid angle. This is to 
generate a flat and uniform electromagnetic field wave inside the cell in order to perform electromagnetic 
compatibility and immunity tests. GTEM cells are reciprocal devices that can detect or receive from a source or 
establish an EM field for testing. This cell contains the EM field inside the transmission line and avoids the 
radiated energy into the surrounding space that may interfere with other equipment. 
 
Instead of a circular, centered copper conductor, it has a rectangular section and a flat wide conductor with tapered 
ends with a series of matching loads in parallel resistors to get a characteristic impedance of 50 Ω. To absorb the 
high-frequency electromagnetic field, 700 mm height polyurethane foam pyramidal microwave absorbers are 
used to match the impedance of the source.

3. Results and Experimental Measurements 
The GTEM’s DC termination, as well as the performance of the mounted absorber, are tested with the use of a 
Vector Network Analyzer (NanoVNA). Figure 9 presents the measured Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) 
and S11 the return loss from 50Mhz to 900Mhz, respectively.  The VSWR and S11 are almost flat along the 
tested spectrum, which is a good characteristic. However, the VSWR values are higher than 2 and the S11 is 
larger than -10dB, which indicates that the impedance matching, and the shielding of the door can be improved.

Remains to be done the verification of its field uniformity which is the most important factor in a GTEM cell. 
For this test, the GTEM cell should be excited with a Vector Signal Generator, and the Electric field is 
measured with a probe set inside the GTEM.   
 
4. Conclusion 
In this paper, we describe the design and fabrication of a GTEM cell for EMC testing small EUT. The design 
and fabrication pose several multi-disciplinary engineering challenges. In order to simplify the full-wave 
simulation of the cell, a 2d simulation with open-source finite element software has been presented to match the 
impedance of 50 Ohms. All the fabrications process and assumptions were detailed and described to share the 
knowledge with other researchers from developing countries who are developing new products. Preliminary 
measurements indicate the fabricated GTEM presents good characteristics for the EMC test of small size 
(230x300x700 mm) according to (Icheln 1995) criteria. However, a detailed characterization remains to be 
reported in future works.

Abstract 
 
The ventilation of machines from industrial processes allows to control among others, heat and toxicity of the 
environments. Dirty or bad environment is also detrimental to productivity. 
Trafopar S.A., is the first Paraguayan factory dedicated to the manufacture and commercialization of Distribution 
Transformers. The main use of wood in the construction of transformers is as separating pieces between windings, 
sections or between these and the core. 
 
The proposed system combines local exhaust ventilation and impulse ventilation. The impulsion ventilation system 
will be through an axial fan and will be in charge of guaranteeing the renewal of the air that will be sucked from the 
workshop by the localized extraction ventilation system. A localized extraction system with ducts and aerial 
installation is proposed, with a cyclone as a particle separator, it will be located between the outlet of the main duct 
section and the fan. 
 
Using CFD it was possible to validate the functionality of the proposed system. The simulation was carried out in two 
stages, the first consisted of representing the conditions of the carpentry sector before the implementation of the 
extraction system, and the second stage consisted of modeling the proposed system. 
The results of the CFD showed a discrepancy maximum the 12.59% between the values obtained by the CFD and the 
calculations performed analytically. As the value obtained is less than 15% the analytically obtained results were taken 
as valid, thus guaranteeing the correct functioning of the system.

6. Conclusion 
A combined extraction system combined with a delivery system was chosen. The impulsion system will be through 
an axial fan and will be in charge of guaranteeing the renewal of the air that will be sucked from the sector by the 
localized extraction system. A localized extraction system is proposed with circular section ducts and aerial 
installation, with a high efficiency cyclone of the Stairmand type as a particle separator, it will be located between the 
outlet of the main duct section and the fan. In order to save the fan blades of the localized extraction system, a 
G2/MERV 4 type filter will be used in it. 
 
The sizing of the components of the localized extraction system was by the dynamic pressure method, for which a 
total flow of 3182 m3/h and a velocity inside the duct of 18 m/s were used, resulting in a pressure drop of 2080 Pa, 
which led to the selection of a 5.5 HP centrifugal fan. With the flow requirement of the localized extraction system, 
the minimum renewal flow of the sector will be limited, values that, once added together, indicate the total air flow 
that the impulsion system must be capable of injecting. The impulsion system is capable of injecting a flow rate of 
3,285 m3/h with a pressure drop of 52 Pa, by means of a 0.25 HP tubular type axial fan. 
The simulation resulted in a discrepancy of 6.7% between the values obtained by the simulation and the calculations 
carried out analytically with respect to the total pressure drop of the extraction system; and a discrepancy of 12.59% 
referred to the flow inside the duct. Due to the fact that both lower values are the maximum established as allowed 
(15%), the results obtained analytically are taken as valid, thus guaranteeing the correct functioning of the system.

Abstract  
 
Short-term electricity demand forecasting represents a fundamental tool for decision-making by entities engaged in 
electricity management since it allows the development of strategies to meet variations in electricity demand in short 
periods. The accuracy of predictive models is an important factor for energy operations and the scheduling of energy 
generation sources to meet the demand at each instant. Intelligent models based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) 
require hyperparameter adjustment. These models have several hyperparameters that substantially affect their 
performance. Our paper implements a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model and four search methods to adjust 
its hyperparameters. First, we select the length of historical window and the hidden state size of LSTM cells for 
optimization. Second, we draw comparisons between the grid search, random search, a Bayesian scheme, and a genetic 
algorithm. The data set used for training and validation of the model includes hourly electricity consumption and 
meteorological variables recorded in Paraguay from 2015 to 2021. The proposed model was evaluated through 
numerical experiments with classical error measures such as the root mean square error (RMSE), the correlation, the 
runtime, and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Our comparative study shows that grid search and genetic 
algorithm give the optimal hyperparameters with high validation accuracy on the test dataset. However, it is important 
to note that grid search may require much more evaluations and computational resources.

1. Introduction  
Electricity demand forecasting is a widely studied topic of great interest for electric companies in any country. It is an 
important element for making strategic decisions, such as the scheduling of generating units and the planning of 
operations to meet the demand of the electric system. If the demand forecast is very different from the one that finally 
occurs, the need for additional contingency generation or the flexibility to reduce generation can increase costs. 
Electric companies plan on different time scales (annual, monthly, weekly, daily, and hourly). Although the demand 
is separated into components: trend, cyclical or periodic movements, seasonal variation, and finally irregular 
movement, it is still difficult to make accurate forecasts in the short term (hourly) (Seo, 2012) . This is because 
electricity demand depends on consumer behavior and the same can be affected by weather factors or daily routines. 
 
Forecasting methods based on machine learning are commonly used for this type of scenario (Gallardo, 2021). When 
the problem is centered on the provision of several units, it is normal to perform a clustering first to reduce the models 
to be used (Morales, 2022). However, models based on deep learning have shown better performance for more 
complex problems (Bouktif, 2018) (Bogado, Stalder, Gómez, & Schaerer, 2020) (Bogado, Stalder, Schaerer, & 
Gómez-Guerrero, 2021). These algorithms have several hyperparameters whose optimal settings determine even better

6. Conclusion  
In this work, a model based on LSTM neural networks has been developed and characterized to provide a robust 24-
hour forecast of the hourly electricity demand for the next day. The influence of exogenous variables with respect to 
the electricity consumption has been analyzed, resulting that temperature and calendar variables allow an extra 
contribution to the forecasting problem. The proposed model is constituted for a historical window that allows 
collecting information from past records. In turn, the dimension of the hidden state and the number of neurons in the 
hidden layer are determinants for its performance. The choice of these hyperparameters was determined using 
optimization methods. The methods considered were grid search, random search, genetic algorithm and a Bayesian 
scheme, called tree of Parzen estimator.  Our results indicate that grid search and genetic algorithms can obtain the 
optimal hyperparameters. However, grid search requires much more evaluations and computational resources to obtain 
good results. The RMSE and MAPE can vary between 155.3±5.5, and 5.61±0.29 % respectively. The Covid19 
pandemic affected the demand dynamics and prediction performance of the model. This model will help power utilities 
to schedule hourly generation sources for the next day.

Abstract 
 
Interhospital transfers of patients arise when there is a large volume of patients, and the reference hospital does not 
have an available bed to care for them. The network of hospitals in the Metropolitan Area of Asunción (AMA) from 
Paraguay include 14 referral hospitals with intensive care services for adults, whose utilization rate is generally high. 
This research aims to program the efficient assignment of patients to ICU beds (Intensive Care Unit) in health centers 
according to their priority of care and the level of congestion in a network of hospitals and considering as a case study 
a period of time during the Covid-19 pandemic. We developed a research framework based on the transport model to 
reduce the therapy service's saturation. For the computational programming of the model, we will use the Gurobi 8.1.1 
optimization software with the Python programming language. Through these resources, it is expected to have an 
analysis of the current situation and one or several optimal solutions to support decision-making for efficiently 
allocating patients to ICU beds in the AMA from Paraguay.

1. Introducción 
En los hospitales el conjunto de recursos materiales, tecnológicos, humanos y financieros asignados para la 
disponibilidad de un servicio de terapia intensiva suelen ser escasos y costosos. 
  
En un centro asistencial los pacientes que van ingresando pueden requerir el uso de estos recursos debido a eventos 
epidémicos pronosticables, como por ejemplo en las temporadas de dengue, influenza, etc., o no pronosticables como 
la reciente pandemia del COVID-19 o los accidentes de tránsito. 
 
Un problema que ha tomado mayor notoriedad a nivel mundial y nacional durante la pandemia de COVID-19 es la 
escasez de recursos en los hospitales para la atención a pacientes con este problema de salud, debido al aumento de la 
demanda en ciertos periodos como por ejemplo son las camas, medicamentos, enfermeros, médicos, etc.  
Además, otro tema muy sensible es la congestión de los hospitales, y sobre todo el orden de prioridad que tendrán los 
pacientes que van quedando en lista de espera para acceder a una cama de internación, o bien, para ser derivados a 
otros hospitales con capacidad disponible. 
 
En este sentido, se pueden utilizar herramientas cuantitativas que permitan apoyar la toma de decisiones para la 
programación de esta asignación de pacientes que quedan en lista de espera, para la utilización de camas UTI.

Abstract  
 
This research has carried out the analysis of the efficiency of natural light as an interior lighting system through fiber 
optic transmission in Paraguay as a pioneering alternative to energy demand. 
 
For its analysis, the construction of a flat concentrator in the shape of a truncated pyramid was carried out, with a 
metal support equipped with rotational movements both in the x and y planes in such a way as to manually track the 
sun. At the light concentration point, a support was placed for the 6mm diameter and 10-meter-long optical fiber that 
transports the concentrated light from one end to the other. This light transmission was measured with a luxmeter to 
determine the amount of illumination from the concentration point to the end of the fiber. 
 
It has been observed that, for an illuminance of 109,200 lux coming from the source (sun) with an orientation of 40º 
North and with an inclination of 27º with respect to the normal, the illuminance obtained at the end of the fiber located 
in a totally isolated room of the source was 21,600 lux at the surface of the optical fiber. In addition, the light beam 
projected by the optical fiber has an opening angle of 60º. 
 
Given that the room to be illuminated with the natural light source has artificial light that projects an illuminance of 
80,800 lux on the surface of the lamp, it is estimated that 8 (eight) points of natural light will be necessary for said 
room for adequate lighting.

It would be good to increase the amount of light that can be captured with a magnifying glass-type concentrator system, 
where the intensity of light captured would be improved. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Solar light could be concentrated by means of a flat mirror concentrator in the shape of a truncated pyramid, although 
it was observed that greater concentration can be achieved with covalent mirrors. 
 
⦁ With this concentrator, only 62% of the sunlight from the source (sun) is concentrated, 38% are beams of light 
that are reflected back to the medium. 
 
⦁ The existing loss in the hub-fiber system is 68% and only 32% is used as a lighting source. 
 
⦁ 8 (eight) points of natural light would be needed to be able to replace the artificial light source, but a mixed 
system would be needed to be able to provide the system with reliability.

The study deals with a two-speed parachute for military use, taking into account that at the time of launch one must 
go down as quickly as possible to be out of range of enemy fire, the descent must be somewhat fast but after 400m 
they must land. as slow as possible for the safety of the skydiver, implementing a dual-state parachute system to 
achieve this, starting with a quick fall, and ending with a slow and safe descent. The system consists of the parachute 
initially having a reduced diameter by winding the part of the external diameter, once descended to a safer height; the

Abstract 
In recent decades, the world has experienced a health crisis due to increased infectious disease cases such as COVID-
19, Dengue, Zika, etc. Dengue is a neglected tropical disease transmitted by mosquito vectors, mainly by the Aedes 
Aegypti. This work is focused on Paraguay, where the virus has surpassed 16,000 notifications so far, this 2022. This 
disease has an incidence throughout the country, which results in a large amount of available data. The time series 
clustering can find a subjacent structure within a large amount of data, simplifying analysis and interpretation of it. 
This article contrasts two different clustering methods (Shape-based and Feature-based), followed by a feature 
selection procedure. Initially, both methods are tested, getting the highest Silhouettes scores with the feature-based 
approach. Subsequently, one feature is removed in each experiment and the results are ranked, getting higher silhouette 
scores by eliminating the least important feature. Results show that better clustering is obtained by performing an 
adequate feature selection through the ranking procedure.

1. Introduction 
Technological advances allow us to collect and store data at a very large scale, using remote sensors, satellites, 
cameras, and telescopes. The epidemiological data allows us to map the incidence of diseases (COVID-19, Influenza, 
Dengue, Zika, etc.) and combine them with the mobility of people. Combining and recognizing groups and similarities 
in the data is a challenge for engineers and scientists who need to develop new algorithms and methods of analysis. 
Much of the available data is stored as a time series 𝑋𝑋= ( 𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡: 𝑡𝑡 = 1, . . . , 𝑁𝑁)  collected over a period, usually at regular 
intervals, where 𝑁𝑁 is the number of observations and 𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡 is the time-varying value measured at an instant 𝑡𝑡. The analysis 
of these time series requires the implementation of filtering, noise reduction, anomaly identification, pattern 
identification, and clustering algorithms. 
Clustering of time series identifies time series with similar characteristics (Aghabozorgi et al. 2015). Similar instances 
are organized in clusters or groups. The time series clusters can provide relevant information for identifying

Figure 6. Clusters visualization with PCA shows the separation of the clusters.  
 
6. Conclusion 
In the first experiment, it can be observed that using a feature-based representation; better results have been achieved 
in all three clustering algorithms, standing out the Euclidean distance and DTW metrics. In the second experiment, by 
eliminating features, such as Cpoints and Mean, higher Silhouette Scores were obtained. When DBScan was tested, 
the more features were considered, the more the silhouette score deteriorated. These results indicate that feature 
selection can improve or worsen Feature-based clustering. So, feature selection is important to improve clustering. 
Hence, at this moment, motivated by the results, the authors are working to improve the DBScan to be more 
competitive.

Abstract 
 
A multi-thematic document is composed of many subjects in a continuous text. In this context, a meeting minute 
concentrates very important information such as guidelines and decisions. Therefore, it is often used as information 
source. Most information retrieval techniques do not deal well with multi-thematic documents, once it has non-
structured data, lack of metadata and little subject delimitation. Furthermore, it is hard to assign them the main subject 
or point to a specific snippet. Here we had two main challenges. First, knowing where a subject goes to another, and 
second, how to identify them. To solve these needs we used text segmentation and topic extraction methods. The text 
segmentation technique splits a document into segments where each part contains a coherent subject, while topic 
extraction methods aim to group and describe them. Many researchers evaluate these methods using long texts such 
as concatenation of documents or transcriptions of discourse and multipart meetings written exclusively in English. 
In this work, we collected a corpus of meeting minutes written in Brazilian Portuguese which besides being the 
language less studied, has a more formal and succinct style. As a result, it generates a structure formed by segments

Abstract  
Before putting a satellite into orbit, different types of tests must be performed to increase the probability of success of 
the mission. One of these tests is the thermal vacuum test, for which a thermal vacuum chamber is needed. In this 
project to build a thermal vacuum chamber, part of the project is to verify if the available materials are adequate to 
withstand the imposed conditions, since access to them is difficult. This article presents two methods to verify the 
suitability of a stainless steel tube, corresponding to the maximum diameter and thickness available, presenting the 
results of the study.

1. Introducción 
Dentro de la generalidad de los satélites se encuentran los nano satélites (CubeSats), adoptados como un estándar de 
fabricación denominado 1U con dimensiones de 10x10x11 cm [1]. Este tipo de satélites por sus características además 
de su menor costo relativo, se convierten en la opción más viable y lógica, para el inicio de los emprendimientos 
aeroespaciales. 
Antes del lanzamiento de un nano satélite, mediante ensayos específicos es necesario comprobar, la aptitud de los 
materiales empleados en su construcción, calidad del ensamblaje en su totalidad, el correcto funcionamiento de los 
sistemas, subsistemas y componentes. 
Los ensayos ambientales logran replicar las condiciones presentes en el ciclo de vida de los satélites. Uno de estos es 
el test de Termo-vacío, este permite someter al satélite a presiones extremadamente bajas y temperaturas cíclicas. Para 
poder realizar el ensayo se requiere de una cámara de Termo vacío o vacío térmico, con una estructura adecuada capaz 
de soportar las condiciones mencionadas en su interior. Contar con esta cámara permitirá realizar este ensayo que 
contribuirá a determinar el desempeño de nano satélites, construidos y ensamblados en el país además de otros futuros 
emprendimientos aeroespaciales e industriales. 
1.1 Objetivos  
Diseñar y construir una cámara para ensayos de termo vacío, capaz de soportar estructuralmente replicando en su 
interior, las condiciones de presión y temperaturas en el espacio, a los niveles en los cuales se encuentran expuestos 
los CubeSats. 
1.2 Objetivos Específicos  
• 
Investigar acerca de las tecnologías y métodos existentes para alcanzar los niveles de presión y 
temperaturas requeridas. 
• 
Seleccionar materiales adecuados que soporten las condiciones de presión y temperatura.

Abstract 
The design of a production plan and inventory of silk skeins from the breeding of Bombyx mori worms is contemplated 
for the company Seda y Fibra S.R.L. which separates its activities into three main processes, mulberry planting and 
harvesting, worm rearing and silk cocoon harvesting, and raw silk production and inventory. The purpose of the 
investigation is to satisfy the demand raised for the 9 periods that the 1st year contemplates, for them the process 3 is 
raised with the model of Capacitated Lot Sizing Problem - CLSP with multiple products, it is elaborated for 
programming with an initial inventory zero and a variable with resulting initial inventory for a proposed demand, 
taking into account that the initial inventory will not always be zero. The process gives as a final product three types 
of threads: raw silk, schappe thread and waste, inventory for each period, and as the main product the volume in kg of 
raw material necessary to satisfy the demand for each type of thread in each period. It is concluded that the model 
with the proposed CLSP covers the operating restrictions of the process with all types of inventories.

Abstract 
 
The geomagnetic field is the earth's natural defense that protects us from the cosmic rays coming in the solar 
wind. These energetic particles can damage our technology such as communication satellites, electric networks, 
hydroelectric and GPS navigation systems, especially in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAMA). This work 
presents the design and implementation of a low-cost geomagnetic station to monitor the earth's magnetic field 
variations and their correlations with space weather. The station uses Commercial Off-The-Shelf electronic 
devices such as a Raspberry pi, high-precision analog-digital converters, and triaxial fluxgate sensors. The 
hardware system and the software allow the logging sensor’s data automatically. Preliminary results allowed 
us to measure variations correlated with Brazil's geomagnetic station in Medianeira.

4. Conclusion 
The low-cost geomagnetic station will allow us to start monitoring the impact of solar activity in our country. 
First measurements indicated that we could observe a huge change in both components of the magnetic field, 
exactly at the same time as the closest station of the EMBRACEMag. Although the values of the magnetic 
field must be calibrated in a more conventional way, the data showed that we can measure sudden changes in 
both directions of the magnetic field.

Abstract 
 
This research will seek the relationship between the effect of COVID-19 and the supply chain's disruption, delimiting 
the target population as the citizens of Metropolitan Lima. We will work with a sample of 100 surveys to workers who 
meet the requirement of 3 years working in the confection sector. The data collected will be processed and examined 
using Minitab Version 20.3, so the reliability and validity of the data obtained will be reviewed. Based on the results, 
a correlation between the dimensions of cost, sales and production in the supply chain and the severity of COVID-19 
was observed, a statement supported numerically. The results of the research show how much a health phenomenon 
can directly impact a supply chain causing a disruption in small and micro confection companies.

1. Introduction  
According to Guan et al., Ivanov, and Sodhi, an incident such as an epidemic or pandemic can have substantial 
negative impacts on companies and supply chains, including reducing their efficiency (as cited in Chowdhury et al., 
2021, p.2). The impact of Covid-19 on the textile and apparel sector has never been seen before in this industry, which 
has negatively affected every company regardless of size (Zhao, 2021). 
 
The fact that the pandemic started in China and then spread to other countries in Asia, Europe, and other continents 
has determined that the effect on the apparel sector has been felt from the beginning, increasing its strength as the 
pandemic progressed, affecting both the supply and demand of these products (Landaburu, 2020, p. 147). Causing 
that, during the peak of the outbreak in China, raw material and input shortages were the main problems faced by 
garment producers (International Labor Organization [ILO], 2020). 
 
Peru's textile and apparel sector is the third-largest contributor to the manufacturing GDP, with a 6.4% share in 2019, 
generating about 400 thousand direct jobs annually and representing 26.2% of the employed manufacturing 
population. In addition, due to its essential linkages with other sectors or industries (agriculture, livestock, 
manufactured fibers, chemicals, and plastics), it generates 900 thousand indirect jobs in the economy, according to 
estimates by the Textile and Apparel Committee of the National Society of Industries [SNI] in 2021.

2263","with suppliers due to the scarcity of inputs. This information is supported by the percentage of agreement and total 
agreement in questions 1 and 2 of dimension 3, since in the first one, 91% (Table 7) of the respondents stated that they 
did not receive any privilege in the price of fabrics despite the current context and 61% that the investment of money 
and time was very demanding in order to obtain a supply from suppliers, which led to an increase in costs in micro 
and small garment manufacturing companies in metropolitan Lima. 
 
It was also confirmed that due to COVID-19 there were problems in production, delays in production and delivery 
times and shortages of available labor, as mentioned by Rehan et al. (2020). Furthermore, according to Orozco-Crespo 
et al. (2021), the low technological development in the confection sector caused COVID-19 to have a severe impact 
on production, this can be confirmed by calculating Spearman's Rho with a value of 0.691 indicating a significant 
correlation (Table 4). 
 
Likewise, with respect to sales, as mentioned by Mohammad et al. (2021) demand and price are the two factors that 
directly affect the supply chain of the apparel industry, in the micro and small business sector a great impact was 
visualized in the correlation of dimension 1 as 79.33% of the respondents of the same category agreed with an inability 
to generate income, sell their main products and maintain high profit margins. (Table 5). 
 
6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, it can be affirmed that both variables are highly correlated. In addition, the COVID-19 phenomenon 
had a significant impact on production since a high correlation was demonstrated through the survey, due to the 
inability to react to the abrupt changes generated by COVID-19 and the escarse technological development of the 
sector. On the other hand, there was a moderate impact on raw material costs and sales volume, as shown in the results 
of the surveys and the calculation of Spearman's Rho.

Abstract 
 
It is forecasted that by 2050, waste generation will increase to 2.2 billion tons per year, this is due to the poor 
management of waste, leaving approximately 33% untreated residues. Along with this, in recent years new energy 
sources have been sought to replace the use of non-renewable energy. The objective of this study is to identify and 
characterize the experiences in using the procedures to convert waste to obtain energy. To achieve this, we followed 
the PRISMA method obtaining a result of 109 selected articles that were reviewed for the collection of information. 
Thus, obtaining as a result that the application of the methodologies provides valorization of agro-industrial waste, 
utilization of animal waste, biogas generation and generation of electric energy from waste.

1. Introduction  
In recent years there has been an increased interest in obtaining energy through different methodologies with the aim 
of replacing fossil fuels, through the recycling of organic waste such as biomass (Caposciutti et al., 2020). 
 
This interest has been worldwide, mainly in countries within Europe and Asia. It should be noted that in Latin America 
there are more and more countries that cover this issue, the recovery of organic waste, the latter, generated in homes, 
restaurants, food industries, among others, have a high potential for contamination (Manzi Tarapués et al., 2020). 
 
There are methodologies that allow the use of large volumes of organic waste to convert them into energy. For this 
there are technological strategies, which are analyzed to comprehensively manage waste, examining the indicators of 
the operations and qualities of the implemented processes and thus give an energy value to this type of waste (Montiel-
Bohórquez et al., 2019). According to Alzate et al. (2019), conversion technologies have great potential to recover 
energy from solid waste. Among them is the biological conversion technology, which allows the exploitation of biogas 
produced from the mass fraction of solid waste, also the thermal conversion technology, being one of the most used 
in developed countries such as China and Japan, using methods such as incineration and gasification, the latter method 
being the least polluting. Consequently, these technologies provide advantages, such as reducing the volume of waste 
generated.

Biogas production from fruit and vegetable waste (Islas-

Generation of electric energy from waste 
Evaluates the economic feasibility of implementing 
technologies for the conversion of waste to biogas in 
rural areas in the face of an energy crisis (Bernardes & 
Camacho, 2019). 
 
Economically evaluates the conversion of organic waste 
to biogas and electricity (Alvarez et al., 2021). 
 
Calculates the amount of bioenergy that can be produced 
from organic waste and whether it meets the demand for 
electricity (Acosta et al., 2018). 
 
 
5. Conclusions 
It is concluded that these experiences are characterized by evaluating and characterizing waste-to-energy conversion 
procedures. It should be noted that not all of them follow the same model; some experiences use large volumes of 
waste, at a macro level, such as agroforestry waste, livestock, etc. Others are at a micro level, such as obtaining energy 
from wastewater from a university campus. Finally, there is the pilot test, which could be based on software, on 
laboratory experiments obtaining small- or large-scale results. 
 
It can be observed that for the implementation of the methodologies regarding the social and economic aspect, the 
impact of the application of technologies in cities with variable population has been seen. It can be observed that for 
the implementation of the methodologies it is necessary to encourage a culture of recycling, since in this way the 
waste is used optimally. 
 
There are various conversion processes, which can be divided into biochemical, thermochemical and others. The most 
outstanding processes in the biochemical section are those of bio digestion, but fermentation and hydrolysis are also 
found. The former being the most used by researchers. On the other hand, there are the thermochemical processes, 
which are: pyrolysis, gasification and combustion, among them, the most outstanding and efficient is the pyrolysis 
process, because it generates energy with a higher yield. Finally, we have other processes such as landfill gas capturing 
gasses from those wastes that have been deposited for many years, generating GHG, so this process captures these 
gasses and converts them into energy. Another important process is densification, which is a physical process based 
on compacting waste to generate briquettes or pellets. 
 
In closing, the contributions provided by the application of these processes are beneficial, since waste, agro-industrial, 
agroforestry, etc., is valorized and used to convert energy and thus reduce the environmental impact. On the other 
hand, it seeks to replace traditional energy sources that generate GHG.

Abstract 
 
In a competitive world with constant changes, it is crucial that manufacturing companies look for new strategies to 
apply in their supply chain in order to generate a competitive advantage and be sustainable over time. The application 
of the agile methodology together with lean in the supply chain, seek to provide a solution to this problem. The purpose 
of this study is to perform a systematic review of the last 5 years on agility and lean in the supply chain in 
manufacturing SMEs. Also, to analyze and identify the main factors to increase agility along with the application of 
lean methodology. Consequently, it was important to review a considerable number of articles and authors specialized 
in these topics, as well as to be updated of the changes that are due to the course of time. Therefore, through the 
PRISMA method, 122 articles were obtained from the Scopus database, between the years 2017 and 2021, for 
subsequent analysis and to achieve the objective of the research. With this study, it is sought that manufacturing 
companies around the world begin to investigate more about this strategy and seek its application, to become highly 
competitive companies.

1. Introduction  
Currently, manufacturing companies worldwide are in a very competitive landscape with respect to other companies, 
so the need arises for the integration of methodologies in the supply chain, in order to achieve a competitive advantage, 
satisfying customer demand in an efficient and effective way (Lee 2021). Consequently, supply chain management 
practices have to opt for adapting to the requirements of the business environment, with the aim of obtaining greater 
profitability (Tarei et al. 2021). The application of Lean methodology in the supply chain, is optimal for business 
environments that are stable, controllable and predictable, on the other hand, agile methodology is required for the 
company to be able to adapt in an environment with unpredictable changes in the market (Zhang and Cao 2018). These 
two methodologies have been extended towards the need for a company's supply chain to apply it together (Rajesh 
2021). Achieving cost optimization, elimination of waste, facilitation in product customization and a sharing of 
information throughout the supply chain (Song et al. 2021). The purpose is to focus this joint implementation, in SME 
manufacturing companies, where it can be applied and evidenced in a clearer way the results in the supply chain. 
Being a great guide, for many manufacturing companies of any size going forward, and that can opt for this strategy. 
Therefore, the systematic literature review to be carried out will consist of 122 articles in the last 5 years, covering the 
topics of agility, lean, supply chain and manufacturing SMEs. Given the problems raised above, the following research

2286",,"years ago that it was noticed in the research and case studies conducted, until, as of 2019, its growth was exponential. 
That is why, an integration of agile and lean methodology, today, would demonstrate a high degree of innovation, 
bringing together the main pillars of each. Therefore, in order to make this possible, it is advisable to start with the 
application in manufacturing SMEs and then move on to large companies. The results will be evidenced by the 
application of the main characteristics of each methodology. For example, companies that are already applying lean 
manufacturing will become more agile by implementing flexibility, technology and adaptability. This will allow the 
manufacturing SME to stand out in the market and generate a competitive advantage over its rivals. Finally, this article 
can be a guide for future research on case studies that seek to apply agility, not leaving aside the application of lean, 
comparing operational results and advantages in its supply chain.

Abstract 
 
Human Resource Management is one of the important assets for companies, because every company wants to avoid 
mistakes from their employees and increase income and performance by having employees with good performance. 
One of the problems in HRM is turnover intention. A high level of turnover intention will have a negative impact on 
the company and is related to the stability of the workforce conditions. Over time, the labor force undergoes 
intergenerational changes, employees from the previous generation continue to the next generation. Based on the 
Population Census conducted by BPS in 2020, it shows where the population of the Millennial generation is 69.90 
million people, Z is 75.49 million and the baby boomer generation is 31.23 million and Generation X is 59.11 million. 
This shows that the future workforce will be dominated by the Millennial Generation and Generation Z. However, the 
current phenomenon shows that Millennials and Generation Z have high turnover intention or low loyalty. Based on 
the problem above, researchers want to find out whether work engagement and work-life balance affect turnover 
intention in workers from the Millennial Generation and Generation Z in Indonesia. In this study, quantitative studies 
were conducted using questionnaires as data collection. The author used a program called Partial Least Square with a 
target of 140 respondents. Based on the results, it was found that Work-Life Balance in Generation Z has a negative 
influence on Turnover Intention, while the relation between Work Engagement and Turnover Intention is negative but 
not significant.

Abstract 
 
Due to the complexity of the internal operations system of reception, internal movements, and distribution of 
merchandise in a distribution center of a supermarket chain, it is necessary to have an integrated Warehouse 
Management System (WMS) that streamlines internal processes and guarantees their traceability. This study aims to 
evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of a WMS for the continuous flow of materials that pass through this 
distribution center from Mariano Roque Alonso, Paraguay, which currently operates with 36 stores and has a 
medium/long-term projection of expansion to 50 stores, with a great diversity of products and suppliers that must be 
trusted for delivery. The methodology included the identification of the products with the highest rotation, the 
schematization of the current operational flow of the DC, and the technical and economic analysis of the proposal. 
One of the main results is the improvement of operating times and a greater volume of units dispatched.

1. Introducción 
El Warehouse Management System (WMS), o Sistema de Gestión de Almacenes (SGA), es una aplicación de software 
que prevé un control sobre cada fase de la operación logística: recepción, almacenamiento, reabastecimiento, 
preparación de pedidos y carga de camiones. El propósito principal de un WMS es controlar el movimiento y 
almacenaje de materiales en la empresa (Mora García, 2011).  
 
Con este estudio se busca evaluar la rentabilidad de la implementación del Sistema de Gestión de Almacenes de SAP  
- 4HANA para un Centro de Distribución (CD), ubicado en la ciudad de Mariano Roque Alonso y la incidencia de 
este en una empresa dedicada al rubro Retail (venta al por menor o comercio minorista). 
 
1. Objetivo General 
Evaluar la factibilidad técnica y económica de la implementación del Sistema Integrado de Gestión de Almacenes 
(SGA) SAP 4HANA para el flujo continuo de artículos de un centro de distribución de una cadena Retail.  
 
1.1 Objetivos Específicos 
1. 
Esquematizar los procesos de flujo continuo de mercancías del Centro de Distribución.  
2. 
Identificar los principales cuellos de botella del proceso a considerar para la implementación del Sistema

2299","7. Análisis de resultados. 
A partir de las evaluaciones técnicas del proyecto para el centro de distribución de la empresa Retail S.A, se puede 
comprobar que la implementación del módulo EWM mejora notoriamente los procesos de recepción, movimientos 
internos y despacho.Los resultados obtenidos con la puesta en productivo del sistema de gestión de almacenes EMW 
de SAP 4/HANA, a los 6 meses de operación son los siguientes. 
1. Tiempo promedio de permanencia Crossdocking:  4,12 horas de permanencia 
2. Tiempo promedio de permanencia Centralizada:  6,5 horas de permanencia 
 
Lo que significa una reducción del 24% de tiempo para el flujo Crossdocking y 18% para la compra centralizada.  
El análisis de los resultados financieros nos muestra un panorama favorable para el proyecto en el corto mediano plazo. 
Se analizó el proyecto con dos enfoques diferentes el caso 1 con financiación externa del 30 % de la inversión total 
fijada en 6.000.000.000 Gs, es decir se toma un préstamo por 1.800.000.000 Gs y la diferencia 4.200.000.000 Gs se 
toman de recursos propios de la empresa.  
Con estos criterios para el Caso 1 se obtiene una tasa interna de retorno del 41%. Considerando que la tasa mínima 
aceptable de retorno para el proyecto es de 20% en este escenario el proyecto es rentable. También se obtuvo un valor 
presente neto (VPN) de 5.140.337.283 Gs, un Valor Presente Neto de los Ingresos de 126.495.660.497 Gs, un Valor 
Presente Neto de los Egresos de 113.116.181.237 arrojando así una relación Costo Beneficio de 1,118.  
En el Caso 2 se analiza el proyecto bajo las mismas condiciones financieras pero esta vez sin financiación externa, es 
decir la inversión total 6.000.000.000 Gs se financia con recursos propios de la compañía. Obteniéndose de este análisis 
una Tasa interna de retorno de 50%, considerando la TMAR de 20 %.  
El caso 2 también es rentable, y en comparación con el caso 1, es más rentable que el mismo ya que 50% > 41%. Se 
obtuvo un valor presente neto (VPN) de 6.760.337.283 Gs, un Valor Presente Neto de los Ingresos de 126.495.660.497 
Gs, un Valor Presente Neto de los Egresos de 111.316.181.237 arrojando así una relación Costo Beneficio de 1,136. 
 
 
7. Conclusiones y recomendaciones  
Con la implementación de un sistema de gestión de almacenes (SGA o WMS), que monitoree los procesos de ingreso, 
movimiento, puesta a disposición y despacho de mercancía del flujo continuo se evidencia una mejora en los tiempos 
operativos. Esto a su vez se traduce en un mayor volumen de unidades despachadas.  
Al tratarse de un flujo continuo de materiales, el factor predominante que se tiene en cuenta tanto para el flujo 
Crossdocking como para la compra centralizada, es el tiempo de permanencia de la mercadería de los proveedores 
locales en el centro de distribución. Mediante la puesta en productivo del sistema EWM de SAP, esta medición se puede 
realizar con el aplicativo, generando reportes con los cuales se puede medir el nivel de productividad de la operación, 
así también se pueden exportar diversos reportes en tiempo real para la toma de decisiones, tales como el rendimiento 
de los empleados, días de coberturas, tránsitos, entre otros. 
En cuanto a los beneficios económicos del proyecto se contempla para el centro de distribución de la compañía un 
aumento del 4% de las ventas, una reducción de los costos operativos del 5%, una reducción de los costos 
administrativos del 3% y una relación costo-beneficio del 1,25, que es consistente en comparación a otros proyectos de 
optimización y automatización de procesos. 
Teniendo en consideración estos resultados, se puede apuntar al objetivo de la compañía pasar de 36 a 50 tiendas con 
cobertura del centro de distribución. Así también lograr el incremento del 20% al 50% de centralización de artículos 
para la venta de las tiendas. Con la automatización de procesos del CD, es factible negociar con más proveedores locales. 
Como recomendación adicional se puede analizar además el funcionamiento de gestión de almacenes EWM de SAP 
para el flujo de almacenamiento, las estrategias de almacenamiento, la sectorización de la bodega por grupo de artículos, 
la secuencia de creación de órdenes de reposición y picking, y sus beneficios operativos/económicos de implementación.

Abstract  
 
Investment in the capital market has its own charm for investors. The share price of each company listed on the 
Indonesia Stock Exchange sometimes changes, either increasing or decreasing the share price. Therefore, investors 
often have difficulty in choosing which stocks have a small risk but can generate a large return. This study aims to 
determine the expected return on stocks of the pharmaceutical and health research sub-sectors based on the use of the 
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) method. The research method used is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) 
to determine the estimated rate of return or expected return and to determine the relevant risk and return on each asset 
when the capital market is in a balanced condition. The population of the study is the shares of companies in the 
pharmaceutical and health research sub-sector 2017-2022. The research sample used a purposive sample method and 
resulted in 8 companies that did not experience delisting and were listed on the IDX during the study period. Efficient 
stocks are stocks with individual returns greater than the expected rate of return. There are 5 stocks with a positive 
average return and are included in the efficient stock group and 3 are included in the inefficient stock group.

1. Introduction  
The Indonesia Stock Exchange is a place for investors to trade every share or securities they own. The capital market 
is a meeting between parties who have excess funds and those who need funds by trading securities. Investment can 
be said as a commitment of a sum of money or other resources made now or now with the hope of getting benefits in 
the future. The basis for investment decisions consists of the level of expected return, the level of risk and the 
relationship between return and risk. 
 
The Capital Asset Pricing Model method describes a method that relates the expected rate of return of a risky asset 
with the risk of the asset in equilibrium or balanced market conditions. The CAPM has two main advantages for 
calculating a company's cost of capital related to shares. The first advantage is that the model is simple and easy to 
understand and implement. The model variables are readily available from public sources and a second advantage is 
that the model does not depend on dividends or any assumptions about growth in dividends. CAPM is very interesting 
logical and rational in its intellectual level.

Based on Table 8 and Table 9 above stocks that are said to be efficient are stocks with an individual rate of return (Ri) 
greater than the expected rate of return [(Ri) > E(Ri)], included in the efficient stock list are DVLA, INAF, KAEF, 
PYFA, SIDO. Meanwhile, the condition of inefficient stock shows that the individual rate of return (Ri) is smaller 
than the expected rate of return [(Ri) < E(Ri)], included in the inefficient stock list are KLBF, MERK, TSPC. 
Investment decisions on stocks included in the stock list are efficient, namely reviewing or considering buying the 
shares, while investment decisions for stocks included in the stock list are inefficient, namely reviewing or considering 
selling the shares. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the analysis and description of the discussion in the previous chapter, the results of the research 
that have been carried out can be concluded as follows: 
 
a. 
The results showed that there were 3 stocks of the pharmaceutical and health research sub-sector with a 
negative average return and 5 stocks of the pharmaceutical and health research sub-sector with a positive 
average return. 
b. Based on the results of the study, there is 1 stock that has > 1, 6 shares that have <1, and there is 1 stock that 
has <0. The average systematic risk of stocks in the pharmaceutical and health research sub-sectors has a 
value of 0.4077, so that in general the 8 shares of companies that are used as research samples have a 
systematic risk that is not too large. 
c. 
Based on the research, there are 8 stocks with positive expected returns. The highest rate of return is 0.0059 
or 0.59%, namely the shares of the company Merck Tbk (MERK). Meanwhile, the lowest rate of return, 
which is 0.0030 or 0.30%, is in the shares of Kimia Farma Tbk (KAEF). 
d. There are 8 company stocks that are used as research samples. There are 5 stocks classified as efficient stock 
criteria and 3 stocks classified as inefficient stock criteria. Efficient stock is when the rate of return on 
individual shares (individual return) is greater than the expected rate of return E(Ri).

Abstract  
 
With the development of increasingly sophisticated technology, it provides very many benefits. Indonesian people 
also take advantage of current technological developments by using the internet to help with their daily activities, 
including digital payment activities, also known as e-wallet or e-money. Electronic money (e-money) or electronic 
money is a means of payment in the form of electronic where the money is stored in a certain electronic media 
application using internet access. One of the digital payments that is now being widely used by the public is 
ShopeePay. 
 
This research was conducted with the aim of knowing how the effect of giving discounts, vouchers, and cashbacks on 
customer interest in using Shopeepay digital payments in Generation Z in the Bandung area. The researcher uses a 
descriptive type of research with aquantitative approach and uses a non-probability sampling data collection method 
with a purposive sampling type. The number of samples used in this study were 400 respondents. The data analysis 
method used is path coefficient analysis, data analysis using SmartPLS software version 3.3.6. 
 
The result of this research is descriptive analysis shows that the variables of discount, voucher, cashback, and interest 
in using are in good category. Meanwhile, the analysis test shows that the discount, voucher and cashback variables 
have a positive and significant effect on the variable interest in using.

1. Introduction  
Shopee pay is a trademark created by PT Airplay International Indonesia which was licensed by Bank Indonesia in 
August 2018. Based on Bank Indonesia Letter No. 20/293/DKSP/Srt/B on August 8, Shopee pay was officially 
launched in November 2018. Shopee pay is a digital money service feature provided on the Shopee application that is 
used as digital payments, offline at Shopee pay merchants, and saves refunds which can be used to pay for the next 
order. 
 
Electronic money (e-money) or electronic money is a means of payment in the form of electronic where the money is 
stored in a certain electronic media application using internet access. E-money can be defined as a means of payment 
if it meets the following elements, namely: issued on the basis of the value of money that was deposited in advance to 
the issuer, the value of money is stored electronically in a medium such as a server or chip, and the value of electronic

Abstract 
Small radio telescopes make it possible to observe the hydrogen emission line of 21 cm at 1420 MHz and to 
demonstrate the presence of dark matter by measuring the galactic rotation curve of the Milky Way. This paper 
presents the design, integration and analysis of data carried out to assemble a radio telescope using (COTS, 
Commercial off-the-shelf). The design uses inexpensive and commercially available materials. The receiver system 
consists of low-noise amplifiers, band-pass filters, and a software-defined radio USB receiver that provides digitized 
samples for spectral processing on a computer. The experimental results obtained through several tests carried out to 
adjust the software settings are presented, to finally estimate the velocity dispersion of the neutral hydrogen of the 
arms of the Milky Way and compare the results with other observations.

1. Introduction  
The industry and the global market create new challenges and requirements for new generations, highly developed 
human resources in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) where critical thinking and 
teamwork skills are required (Zervoudi, 2020; OECD, 2022). STEM outreach programs are used to attract students to 
help them develop new skills with hands-on experiences. In Paraguay, interviews with teachers and students in high 
school and engineering careers point to the fact that there is a general deficit in the training students receive in 
mathematics and basic sciences (Molinas et. al. 2018). A few decades ago, robotics, math, physics, and programming 
olympiads were used as a mechanism to attract high school students to STEM careers (Mauch, 2001; Nugent et. al. 
2016; Kurita et. al. 2020). Low-cost radio telescopes are another alternative to inspire students of all ages to pursue 
(STEM) careers. Technological advances in open hardware and software (COTS, Commercial off-the-shelf) now 
allow radio amateurs and university and college professors to build their low-cost radio telescopes. 
These 1420 MHz photons come from the transition between the two energy levels allowed for the hydrogen atom and 
are emitted randomly and sporadically, but since the Milky Way contains large amounts of hydrogen, this results in 
an observable RF power peak at the indicated frequency. When the antenna points to a hydrogen cloud or to the arms 
of the Milky Way, a peak is observed, which disappears when it points to empty space. In this way, it is also possible 
to measure the rotation speed of our galaxy by observing the frequency shift due to the Doppler effect. 
Small (1-3 m) radio telescopes for 21 cm hydrogen line observations are widely used for education and outreach. 
Ewen and Purcell (1951) used a pyramidal horn to detect the 21 cm line for the first time at Harvard University. 
Pyramidal or conical horn radio telescopes of 1 to 3 meters, or parabolic antennas in amateur radio astronomy, are 
generally used for these observations. These telescopes can be recycled or manufactured with easily available 
materials, which makes their use in the amateur field proliferate. In addition, other necessary components (filters, 
amplifiers, coaxial cables) can be acquired at relatively low prices and the software used is generally open source and 
maintained by the community, thus providing a complete detection system at a reasonable low price.

7. Conclusion 
A complete system for observing the spectral line of the contained hydrogen found in the arms of the Milky Way was 
designed and built with low-cost materials and free software. The results are comparable with other measurements 
made with similar radio telescopes. This system proved to be a very effective tool to verify physics concepts and 
motivate engineering, astronomy, and physics students. 
This work can be extended by building a specialized antenna and a mobile base to keep the antenna pointed at a 
specific known point and thus compare with measurements made by other radio telescopes. Radio astronomy is 
currently advancing with the use of interferometry, especially VLBI (Very-long-baseline interferometry). The next 
step for developing radio astronomy in Paraguay could be the restoration of the old ground station in Areguá to convert 
it into a radio telescope and thus collaborate with research groups in the area.

Abstract 
 
The main objective of this study is to systematically examine research reference trends in sustainable competitive 
advantage management from 2012 to 2022. This research will focus on the development trends of sustainable 
competitive advantage management research on data-driven Scopus. A mixed method approach was used in this 
study, combining bibliometric methods and a literature review. This research utilized 62 data points gathered via 
web scraping and sourced from the Scopus database from international publications with the keywords sustainable 
competitive advantage management from 2012 to 2022. According to the findings of this study, several fields of 
study dominate studies on sustainable competitive advantage management, including management, human capital, 
business, economics, finance, the environment, infrastructure, food security, the public sector, and technology. 
According to the study's findings, at least four major perspectives are dominantly used in discussing this issue. 
Furthermore, this analysis reveals that the most frequently discussed contexts are interdisciplinary or 
multidisciplinary issues. This means that when discussing an issue, a study will usually use more than one point 
of view. The research's limitation is the scope of the articles used, which were sourced from the SCOPUS database. 
It is strongly advised to conduct future research using a broader literature source. Furthermore, the study's findings 
can be used to generate hypotheses, and extensive and systematic follow-up research is being conducted. The 
study's findings are expected to be useful to academics interested in studying sustainable competitive advantage 
management.

1. Introduction 
The concept of sustainable competitive advantage was introduced in 1984 when it was explained how to maintain 
competitive advantage; however, Porter did not create an official definition of sustainable competitive advantage 
until 1985 (Hakkak & Ghodsi, 2015). Barney (1991) defined sustainable competitive advantage as the 
sustainability of benefits and the application of a unique strategic value to compete with that unique value is 
difficult to imitate. The company's efforts to maintain competition over the long term are referred to as sustainable 
competitive advantage. 
 
Competitive advantage is a firm's ability to do business by intelligently using its resources in a meaningful way 
that maximizes value creation and cannot be replicated by competitors (Barney & Hesterly, 2012). A unique 
combination of organizational resources and skills creates a sustainable competitive advantage in an organization 
(Mao & Deng, 2016). Three factors influence long-term competitive advantage: the size of the target market, easy 
access to resources and consumers, and limitations on competitors' strengths. 
 
The ability of the company to use various resources and capabilities as strategic assets can generate an advantage. 
The success of this strategic asset management will determine the company's unique advantages, which can create 
a competitive advantage. If a company's competitive advantage is based on structural characteristics such as 
market power, economies of scale, or product lines, then today's emphasis on a company's ability to consistently 
deliver superior value becomes the focus of its customers. To accomplish this, competitive advantage is 
determined not only by the company's role, but also by the company's ability to change dramatically. As a result,

This study confirms that the visualizations that appear in network analysis are representations of issues that are 
frequently discussed based on the topics that are frequently researched. However, this review does not argue that 
low frequency is a minor issue. On the other hand, perhaps these issues (the outer core) are under-researched areas 
of study or approaches that are rarely used. This cluster may require additional attention in future research. 
This research formulates comprehensively and systematically the cluster of knowledge that is frequently used to 
support studies related to sustainable competitive advantage management, based on the framing context of 
network analysis and supported by various sustainable competitive advantage management literatures. The results 
of the analysis can be seen in the following Table 2.

The review discovered at least four major perspectives that were commonly used in discussing sustainable 
competitive advantage management, as shown in Table 2. This is not to say that no other viewpoints are used in 
addition to these findings. Many unexplored perspectives, of course, remain unexplored because they are not 
dominant perspectives. Furthermore, this analysis reveals that the most frequently discussed contexts are 
interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary issues. This means that when discussing an issue, a study will usually use 
more than one point of view. 
 
5. Conclusion 
According to the findings of this study, the year with the highest growth development in the topic area of 
sustainable competitive advantage management from 2012 to 2022 was 2020, with a total of 13 articles. 
Furthermore, this study demonstrates that journals with backgrounds or scope areas in sustainability, management, 
and business discuss the issue of sustainable competitive advantage management extensively. This study, however, 
discovers that there is no dominant journal or publisher discussing the issue of sustainable competitive advantage 
management. This means that research in this area is still dispersed across different journals or publishers. 
Development maps based on co-occurrence and keywords, on the other hand, are divided into 23 clusters. This 
review also summarizes research trends in sustainable competitive advantage management into four major issues. 
First, based on the research location, it is interesting to note that the majority of the countries studied in the last 
ten years have been developing countries such as Colombia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, and Iraq. 
Although there are developed countries such as China. Second, when it comes to the type of research approach 
used, data analysis reveals that the majority of the research employs a multiple case study approach. This means 
that the study can employ one or more case studies. In this field, descriptive qualitative methods are still the most 
commonly used approach. Although quantitative methods, particularly SEM, causal structural relations, and 
confirmatory factor analysis methods, are still used. Third, in terms of context or research scope, studies related

sector, and technology predominate. Finally, this research concludes that there are at least four major perspectives 
that are commonly used when discussing sustainable competitive advantage management. However, this does not 
imply that no other perspectives are used in addition to these findings. Of course, many unexplored perspectives 
remain unexplored because they are not dominant perspectives. Furthermore, this analysis discovers that the

1. Introduction 
Due to the intense competition in the industrial sector, companies are increasingly selective when selecting human 
resources. Companies prioritize individuals who can work flexibly and in teams as a result of the dynamic nature of 
the workplace; therefore, individuals with capable behavior are required to lighten the workload of other team 
members, be interested in doing more work, avoid conflicts with coworkers, comply with regulations, and have a high 
tolerance for disturbances that may occur in the workplace (Fakhri et al., 2021). 
 
Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) is an output behavior that is influenced by several circumstances. The 
employee will demonstrate organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) when he regards himself as a member of the 
organization and, as a result, views the organization's benefits as his own (Podsakoff et al., 2000). This observation is 
similar to Bass's description (1994), which is that the behavior of individuals can be exposed to Transformational 
leadership. They will be motivated and committed to attaining the organization's goals. According to Jaya (2021), 
transformational leadership also focuses on developing the potential and abilities of followers, who are employees of 
the business, in order to achieve and exceed organizational goals. This is consistent with one of the characteristics that 
influence OCB, conscientiousness. 
 
It is believed that the Work Environment is also capable of launching OCB. Destianti et al. (2021) explained that 
employees who are pleased with their work environment are more likely to engage with the company. A physically 
and psychologically supportive workplace will generate a healthy work atmosphere, immediately impacting work 
motivation. Research reveals that the work environment is a factor that benefits employees and that employees play a 
substantial role in developing this environment (Salsabila et al., 2021). 
 
According to Organ (1997), OCB is also believed to influence a company's turnover rate, as employees with high 
OCB levels are less likely to quit the company, whereas employees with low OCB levels are more likely to leave the 
company. A high turnover rate is the result of personnel leaving an organization. Despite its success, Telkomsigma 
employs many outsourced and contract workers. The community still has negative feelings toward temporary workers.

2347","Table 2 shows that: 
1. The Transformational Leadership (X1) variable has a t value that is greater than the t table value (2,484 > 1.988) 
and the significance value is smaller than the level of accuracy (0.015 < 0.05), then H0 is rejected. Thus, it can 
be concluded that partially there is a significant effect of Transformational Leadership (X1) toward 
Organizational Citizenship Behavior (Y). 
2. The Work Environment Variable (X2) has a t value greater than t table (3.937 > 1.988) and a significance value 
that is smaller than the level of accuracy (0.000 < 0.05), then H0 is rejected. Thus, it can be concluded that 
partially there is a significant effect of the Work Environment (X2) toward Organizational Citizenship Behavior 
(Y). 
 
Coefficient Determination 
The determinant Coefficient Test determines how well a model can explain the dependent variable. The closer the 
value of R2 to one, the better the regression results because it can be said that the independent variable is able to 
explain the dependent variable as a whole. The test results are presented in the form of a Table 3 as follows:

1. Introduction 
The growth of business in modern times is accelerating vastly. There has been a proliferation of both state-owned and 
private businesses. State-owned enterprises have a significant role in the Indonesian economy. State-owned businesses 
must continually develop and innovate in order to generate profits and remain competitive in the global market. PT 
Telekomunikasi Indonesia is a state-owned enterprise focusing on information and digital services in Indonesia. In 
recent years, digitization and technological disruption have led to Indonesia's more developed digital economy. The 
contribution of the digital economy sector to the national economy continues to increase. In 2020, the digital economy 
provided around 4% of the nation's overall GDP, or $44 billion. In 2020, total digital economy revenue climbed by 11 
percent compared to the previous year. The increasing contribution of the digital economy to the nation's gross 
domestic product shows the sector's expansion. Increasing digital demand in Indonesia will allow this sector's 
contribution to national economic growth to be expanded in the future. 
 
Businesses are drawn to the digital market due to its vast potential. PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk contributes to 
developing the company's business by focusing on work in three domains: digital connectivity, digital platforms, and 
digital services. Telkom has developed several digital platforms and services to advance Indonesia's digitization. 
Telkom has developed the following digital products and services with other organizations and stakeholders. PT. 
Telkom always pays attention to increasing its services in every province. Service excellence is the main target to 
accomplish in every organization. Therefore, it requires excellent human resources to create such a situation.  
 
Human resources are the most valuable of company assets. Excellent employee performance is required for a business 
to generate profits, compete in the market, and fulfil its objectives. Employees' performance is achieved by 
accomplishing organization duties and obligations within a specific time frame (Jaya et al., 2021). Work discipline 
and career advancement are characteristics that contribute to improved employee performance (Lyons & Lovelock, 
2016; Nagy et al., 2019). Work discipline is a tool for communicating what has been organized so that all rules and 
guidelines may be communicated by employees, hence enhancing the performance of both employees and the 
organization (Thompson, 2017). Career development also plays an important role in increasing employee performance 
(Gupta et al., 2021). Every organization must focus on improving a person's career plans so that a person's potential 
can increase to fulfil the organization's needs (Destianti et al., 2021). Especially when Telkom is a company that 
prioritizes service to its customers, the role of good human resources is very much needed to achieve this goal. 
 
PT. Telkom Purwokerto is a Telkom company that delivers information-based and digital services to local consumers. 
One of the keys to providing excellent service to consumers is maintaining a high level of work discipline. Work 
discipline is a factor in achieving optimal organizational performance. Every action has repercussions for the

performance of employees (Y) of PT Telkom Purwokerto, while the remaining 10% is influenced by other factors 
outside of this study. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The hypothesis in this study is that career development and employee performance significantly affect each other. 
Therefore, if an organization focuses on their employees' careers, it will affect their work because every employee 
needs assurance for their career path. Meanwhile, work discipline also has a significant effect on employee 
performance, the more discipline of an employee the better the performance for the organization. Moreover, work 
discipline and career development simultaneously affect employee performance. In future research, it is anticipated 
that the knowledge gained will be explored or expanded by utilizing variables not included in this study, broadening 
the scope of the item to be investigated, and employing new objects in order to obtain more diverse results.

1. Introduction 
Every company has a mission, which includes growing the company and making a profit (Asghar et al., 2022). HR is 
the primary function of every company activity (Taylor et al., 2015). Managing human resources is the key to 
achieving company objectives; therefore, competent human resources are required for company activities to comply 
with the defined vision and mission (Hijriatin et al., 2021). PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, Tbk (Telkom) offers 
technology, information, and communication services. PT Telkom Witel Riau Islands undertook a performance 
evaluation. An annual performance evaluation is carried out to determine whether performance results have increased 
or diminished. According to a summary of employee performance data from 2017 to 2019, employee performance 
values changed. According to a review of employee performance data from 2017 to 2019, employee performance 
decreased in 2019, and no employees with special category performance scores or exceptional category performance 
ratings. The category of employees with a performance value of less than 1 percent existed in 2018. 
 
Several factors influence performance, including discipline, leadership, work environment, motivation, work culture, 
communication, position, dedication, training, and compensation (Boselie, 2014). This research focuses on discipline 
and motivation as the primary factors that affect employee performance (Destianti et al., 2021). Managers use 
discipline to raise employee awareness and willingness to obey rules and alter their behavior. According to the results 
of a recapitulation of employee attendance. The level of employee discipline fluctuated monthly from July to 
September 2020. The percentage of employees absent due to leave climbed by 3 percent in August compared to the 
previous month. The percentage of employees absent due to leave declined by 1 percentage point from August to 
September, falling to 3 percent. This number remains pretty high. The company uses attendance as a sort of 
disciplinary oversight. Recording attendance is a crucial aspect of human resource management that can determine an 
employee's factors and performance, salary, productivity, and company advancement. 
 
The next aspect that becomes the primary focus of employee performance research is motivation. Employees must be 
motivated in order to perform successfully on the job (Salsabila et al., 2021). The researchers want to explore the 
Effect of Discipline and Work Motivation on Employee Performance at PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, Tbk Witel 
Riau Islands.

simultaneously the variables of work discipline and work motivation are affecting employee performance. Meanwhile, 
the significance of f value < f table (0.000 < 0.005) shows that both variables significantly affect the employee 
performance variable. According to these results, it can be concluded that work discipline and work motivation have 
had a significant effect against employee performance at PT Telkom Witel Kepri. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research conducted on the effect of discipline and work motivation on the performance of 
employees of PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, Tbk Witel Riau Islands, several conclusions can be drawn as follows: 
The employees' performance, work discipline, and work motivation of PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, Tbk Witel Kepri 
altogether are within very good category. Meanwhile, based on the hypothesis test result, work discipline and work 
work motivation variables have a significant effect on the employees performance of PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia, 
Tbk Witel Kepri either partially or simultaneously.

1. Introduction 
Nowadays, competition in business and industry is very fierce and competitive. Starting from small, medium, to large 
companies in Indonesia cannot avoid this competition, so companies must improve the quality of their employees to 
be able to survive and win the competition (Hijriatin et al., 2021). The increasingly fierce competition makes the 
company have to be able to maintain the survival of its company. One of the factors that can be used as a benchmark 
for companies in determining the good or bad of the company is the role and quality of human resources in it. 
Consequently, companies need to pay attention to human resources as a crucial factor in implementing activities in 
the company. A company has goals and objectives to be achieved, such as obtaining maximum profit and having 
quality human resources, so the role of  Human Resource Management in determining policy will greatly affect the 
company's success in achieving goals and objectives (Asghar et al., 2022). 
 
Performance is an indicator that expresses the results of a job or behaviour of a person or organization within a certain 
period. Ozbilgin (2020) mentioned that performance is a series of positive and negative assessments of work behaviour 
on completing organizational goals. The company's increasing performance will affect its profit. PT Anindya Mitra 
International Yogyakarta received an Organizational Performance Value (NKO) of 85%, while in 2018, it received an 
Organizational Performance Value (NKO) of 86%. Then in 2019, it received an Organizational Performance Value 
(NKO) of 83.5%. From these data, it can be seen that the performance of the organization for the last three years, there 
has been no assessment of organizational performance that meets the target of 90%. The inability of PT Anindya Mitra 
International Yogyakarta to achieve the target means that the organization has not optimized its resources. The 
performance value of the organization itself is closely related to human resources; in other words, the quality of the 
employees in it greatly affects how well the company runs. Thus, it can be concluded that in a company, if employee 
performance is getting better, then company performance will follow. One of the facto that will support the 
organization's objectives is employee training. Training can increase employees' knowledge of how the organization 
wants them to behave like they intended to. Training also gives the employee the knowledge needed to execute the 
duties properly. Hence, the training program is necessary for the employee to accomplish the organization's goals 
(Guan & Frenkel, 2018; Sendawula et al., 2018). 
 
PT. Anindya Mitra International Yogyakarta already has several employee training programs that are implemented 
through training programs that aim to improve the quality of employee performance. PT. Anindya Mitra International 
Yogyakarta realizes that the implementation of training is needed in a company, which is useful for improving skills

The research result indicates that the variable of employee training affects employee performance. The condition of 
employee training within good category. Meanwhile, the employee performance within good category. It shows that 
the company already practices a good program for employee training which will impact employee performance.

Abstract 
 
Human awareness of environmental control is getting bigger due to the increasingly urgent world situation. However, 
the lack of knowledge of sustainability behavior and consistent commitment results in not fully living a sustainable 
lifestyle. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that smart device is only a tool, and does it not always support and 
build sustainable behavior; especially, if the system or tool does not interact much with the user. The aim of this study 
is that to design a mobile-based sustainable lifestyle gamification application which can motivate and build sustainable 
behavior. This study used a design thinking framework for practical and creative solutions by emphasizing a user-side 
approach. Finally, the user interface design with gamification features is considered to be able to improve a unique, 
fun and motivating user experience since it prioritizes user involvement by providing challenges and prizes as well as 
making users aware of the great impact of sustainable behavior. Therefore, from the two final designs, which are 
usability and performance tests, show that applications with light mode and dark mode designs have satisfactory 
scores; besides, they are recommended. However, the value in the light mode design concept is higher than the dark 
mode design.

1. Introduction 
 
The Covid-19 pandemic has severely disrupted community priorities and individual lifestyles with major implications 
for sustainable development (Echegaray 2021). It is in line with research which had conducted by (Bayer et al. 2021) 
which stated that climate change is considered to have a role in the global pandemic. Furthermore, research which had 
conducted by Dr. Simon Evans from Carbon Brief shows that Indonesia is in the fourth rank of emitters in the world. 
Moreover, in the Indonesia.go.id report, Indonesia is in the third rank of the largest plastic waste producer in the world; 
besides, Indonesia is predicted to experience a water crisis since it is at the lowest level of water availability in 
Southeast Asia. According to The Limits to Growth (1972) and Beyond the Limits (1992) Humanity's future is 
determined not by an emergency, such as, war, but it is determined by many separate crises, but they are related to 
and came from ongoing failure. In addition, sustainable lifestyle is an effort which underlies sustainable living 
behavior, not only personal health and lifestyle but also lifestyle related to the process of preserving nature. In recent 
years, sustainable thinking has gradually been recognized and accepted by society, but in daily life, there is a gap 
between the value of pursuing a sustainable lifestyle and people's behavioral habits. 
 
Globalization era has an influence on behavior and lifestyle in aspects of life (Micklethwait 2003). Games and mobile 
based application give opportunities to improve sustainable behavior (Douglas and Mrauer 2020). According to 
Statista.com, Indonesia is in the fourth rank of smartphone users in the world and the number of smartphone users is 
expected to reach 239 million by 2026. Gamification is an informal general term which is used to describe the use of 
game elements in non-gaming systems in order to improve user experience (UX) and user engagement (Sebastian et 
al. 2011). Moreover, gamification can produce habits by increasing the rewards and emotional responses of individuals 
involved in the experience to produce desired behavioral changes. In addition, according to (Robson et al. 2015) 
gamification has broad application prospects in sustainable development.

PSSUQ Survey  
Based on the PSSUQ survey in Figure 13, it can be concluded that the average results of the system use, information 
quality, interface quality, and overall satisfaction scores are lower than the PSSUQ Norms values so that from the 
respondents' satisfaction scores, both designs fall into the satisfactory category, and it can be recommended. However, 
the satisfaction value of light mode is slightly higher than dark mode.

The results of usability testing analysis using performance metrics and the PSSUQ Survey to design the most suitable 
sustainable lifestyle gamification application interface are as follows. 
1. Persona 1 – The student Elisa: Completes all tasks successfully but some errors occur in task 2. In time on task, it 
shows that Persona 1 completes tasks faster in light mode. In the PSSUQ test, the light mode value is also higher 
2. Persona 2 – The Adult Alex: During the testing period, Persona 2 completes all tasks well but there are some errors 
in task 2. In PSSUQ's rating the light mode design is higher. 
3. Persona 3 – The Young Adult Venny : Completes all tasks successfully and without errors. Persona 3 also 
completes tasks faster in the light mode design. In the PSSUQ test, the light mode value is higher. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Research 
 
Human awareness of environmental control is getting bigger, but the lack of knowledge of sustainability behavior and 
consistent commitment has resulted in not fully living a sustainable lifestyle. Recent studies have shown that smart 
device is only a tool, and it does not always support sustainable behavior; especially, if the system does not interact 
much with the user. Through a design thinking approach, a sustainable lifestyle gamification application user interface 
design has been conducted based on user needs to improve sustainability behavior. The gamification features, 
challenges, points, badges, leaderboard, teammates and activity application feature, comments and likes, shares, 
notifications, news/tips, community and total impact are considered to support the application in order to provide a 
pleasant experience in motivating and increasing sustainable behavior so that it becomes a lifestyle. It can be 
concluded that the result of the user interface design of the two types of design modes that are light mode and dark 
mode is categorized as satisfied category and it can be recommended. However, over all the light mode gets a higher 
score than the dark model. This application provides education that there are many activities which can be conducted 
to keep the earth without harm, but it actually has benefit. In addition, when more people adopt a sustainable lifestyle,

the design results and prototype solutions should be evaluated on a scale according to user needs in order to increase 
the value of user experience (UX) and further research can explore gamification by providing more varied options by 
following the times and technology.

Abstract 
 
 Projects as part of an organization’s value delivery system have gone through a challenging time. Some have 
failed, and others have performed despite the turbulent environment. The purpose of this study is to explore factors 
that influence, build or impact project resilience in organizations from various industries.  A systematic review 
and a bibliometric study are conducted on recent research throughout 2019 – 2022. The study will identify factors 
that relate to project resilience in the context of recent turbulent environment, the pandemic and consequent global 
economic slowdown. 
 
 A systematic literature review is conducted on past research, complemented with a bibliometric study to further 
identify emerging or trending keywords that may serve as signals of a potential future study in project resilience, 
or organizational resilience. 
 
 There has been an increasing trend in research in project resilience. Based on the literature review, researchers 
are still far from agreeing to factors that build, affect, and influence resilience. Past empirical studies have shown 
relationship between resilience and project performance, others investigate the impact of numerous factors that 
influence project resilience. A network visualization was performed based on keywords in the articles to show 
ones with significance such as project management, construction management, human resources management, 
against less significant ones such as error mastery, knowledge management. 
  
 The study examines Scopus-indexed articles that relate to project resilience published from 2019 – 2022 to have 
a more focused view of the recent disruption and to see how that has affected research in project resilience.

Abstract 
 
This research was conducted in one of the computer embroidery businesses in Agam, West Sumatera. This business 
produces and markets products such as embroidery logos and clothing. Based on the results of preliminary 
observations, it is known that there is a decrease in sales levels. This is influenced by various marketing factors, 
including the absence of a selling price agreement, the Covid-19 pandemic, limited access to production reviews, 
and the use of social media that is not optimal in promoting. This study aims to obtain alternative strategies that can 
be done in marketing and to obtain marketing priority strategies in computer embroidery businesses. This study used 
the SOAR and QSPM methods. The SOAR method is a method carried out to analyze internal and external factors 
to obtain alternative marketing strategies. While the QSPM method is a method carried out to obtain a marketing 
priority strategy. Based on the results, 11 alternative strategies were obtained. The priority was to improve the 
quality and variety of product offerings and optimize promotions to increase sales, with a TAS score of 7,310.

1. Introduction 
The rapid development of technology and the business world makes business people have to carry out strategic 
planning to compete in the market. One strategy that can be done is to plan a marketing strategy. Marketing is an 
overall system of business activities that plan, determine prices, promote, and distribute goods and services that 
satisfy existing and potential buyers' needs (Fathurrochman, et al., 2021). Marketing has an essential role in doing 
business because it aims to be able to survive and compete in the market. According to Heart et al. (2020), 
marketing strategy is the set of goals, objectives, rules, and rules that guide the company's marketing operations over 
time, at every level, and their references and allocations, especially in reaction to the changing environment and 
circumstances of the company (Hijrah and Derama, 2022). 
 
This research was conducted at one of the computer embroidery businesses in Agam, West Sumatera. This computer 
embroidery business manufactures and markets products like embroidery logos and clothing. Based on the results of 
preliminary observations, it is known that there is a decrease in sales levels. This is influenced by various factors 
that affect marketing, including unfair market competition where there is no selling price agreement between 
producers and similar businesses, the Covid-19 pandemic, limited access to production reviews, and the use of social 
media that is not optimal in promoting. The following is the sales data of the computer embroidery business.(Table

Abstract 
 
Sustainability challenge remain a prevalent issue among the SMEs in South Africa. This implies that the survival of 
SMEs in South Africa after few years of existence is a challenge.  In order to promote the sustainability and operational 
efficiency of SMEs in South Africa, this study aims to develop a conceptual framework for the implementation of 
Quality Management System (QMS). Relevant literature was reviewed to get an insight into the significance and 
challenges faced by the SMEs in South Africa. The literature also indicate the feasibility for process improvement, 
profitability and sustainability if the SMEs imbibe the culture of QMS. This lead to the development of a conceptual 
quality management framework for implementation in SMEs. The framework incorporates the basic quality 
management system requirements with a focus on process efficiency and sustainability. It is simple and could easily 
be adopted or modified by the SMEs. 
  
Keywords: Conceptual framework, Process efficiency, QMS, SMEs, Sustainability 
 
 
1. Introduction  
SMEs in South Africa (SA) are defined as any enterprise that has less than 250 full time paid employees, and a 
maximum annual turnover of R220 million or less according to different sector turnover limits (De Wet, 2019). 
According to Stat ’SA (2019) the entire formal business sector in SA generated R2, 39 trillion in turnover in quarter 
one 2019. Out of this amount, large businesses contributed 61%, followed by small 29% and medium-sized businesses 
10% (Stat ‘SA, 2019). The findings further reflected that the contribution of small businesses to turnover has fluctuated 
over time, increasing from 24% in 2009 quarter one to 32% in 2017 quarter three. Since 2017 quarter three, the 
contribution has moved slightly lower to 29% in 2019 quarter one (Stat ‘SA, 2019). A decline in small businesses' 
turnover contribution is evident in these statistics.  
 
Neo et al. (2020) conducted a study on QMS implementation in the South African SMEs and found that SMEs are 
significant to the development of the South African economy. Jayasundara et al. (2019) opine that hat this is true 
globally. SMEs require little start-up capital and generates revenue for both individuals and the government. SMEs 
are also valuable as an employer of labour in South Africa and other skill acquisition and training programmes aimed 
at human capacity development (Stat ‘SA, 2017).

It is also important to document the process where necessary, for instance the business objectives, who is responsible 
to meet the objective, how often and how will the objective be measured. The third stage is the desired control system 
output stage where the desired output is indicated.  Output of the process is measured and evaluated to identify 
opportunities for improvement. The last stage is to implement the changes for improvement and incorporate them into 
the control system. The presented frame is developed to enhance the adoption of QMS in SMEs. The framework is 
non- complex, and can be modified to any organization, specifically SMEs. 
 
4. Conclusion  
The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for the implementation of Quality Management System 
(QMS) by the SMEs in South Africa. This was achieved with the review of relevant literature, which provided insights 
into the significance and challenges faced by the SMEs in South Africa and the feasibility of solving the identified 
challenges with a properly developed and implemented. This lead to the development of a conceptual quality 
management framework for implementation in SMEs. The framework incorporates basic quality management system 
requirements with a focus on process efficiency and sustainability. The developed framework is simple and is based 
on common fundamentals of the quality management requirements. Thus, it could easily be adopted by the SMEs. It 
is recommended that the SMEs adopt and modify the framework based on the peculiarities and business model. Future

Abstract  
PT. PHE ONWJ as one of the national oil and gas mining corporate has changed the work cycle for offshore workers 
from 12:12 (12 working days and 12 days off) to 21:21 during the COVID-19 pandemic era. The enactment of the 
extended days to the point of surpassing 21 working days due to the workers who are unable to work, increasing the 
workload for offshore workers.  To identify the state of physical health of the workers, blood pressure measurements 
are taken every week for the on-duty workers. The record of the blood pressure performed by on-site doctors showed 
that the average worker with a 21-days on duty and an extended day is still in the normal range, which is below 
120mmHg/80mmHg.  The NASA TLX test was performed to identify the level of the workload of offshore workers. 
Out of the 142 respondents in the PHE ONWJ offshore working area, 51% of workers have experienced an extended 
day. The results of the NASA TLX questionnaire show that offshore workers at 21:21 have an average WWL of 80.68 
(high) and workers with an extended day of 84.79 (very high). Therefore, an analysis is needed to determine the 
optimal work cycle during the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of work cycle alternatives using the AHP - Expertise 
Judgment method with 4 criteria: mental workload, operational-accommodation costs, health protocol, and operational 
protocols in the field with 4 alternatives such as 12:12, 14:14, 18:18, and 21:21 by 7 experts. The results acquired that 
the 12:12 cycle became an alternative with a dominant weight of 0.394 or 39.4% and the 14:14 cycle becomes the 
second alternative with a weight of 0.24 or 24%.

1. Introduction 
Corona Virus Disease – 19 or COVID – 19 is a dangerous type of virus that is aerosol and has the potential for 
transmission through the air. COVID-19 quickly spread to every part of the world in a short period. Due to this 
condition, WHO declared COVID – 19 as a pandemic in 2020. The pandemic has brought unprecedented changes in 
our daily lives including the work cycle of an employee.  PT. PHE ONWJ is one of the oil and gas exploration and 
production companies in Indonesia that is experiencing a change in the work cycle for offshore workers. The normal 
work cycle before the pandemic era was 12:12 (12 working days with 12 days off), but during a pandemic, the work 
cycle changed to 21:21 with several health protocols that must be followed by all the workers. 
 
The phenomenon that occurs in the field, workers are allowed to work more than 21 days or extended days if they 
have to replace their co-workers who are unable to carry out their duties due to tested positive for COVID-19. This 
condition was resulting the respective workers who work more than 21 days would have a long and unbalanced work 
cycle. In addition, a study conducted on offshore workers in several locations in the North Sea, United Kingdom, as 
mentioned in the book Offshore working time about performance, health, and safety, University of Oxford (Parkes, 
2010) stated that based on workers perspective, 3 weeks of work (21 working days and 21 days off) is very unprofitable 
when it compared to 2 weeks (14 working days – 14 days off) of work. In the North Sea, offshore rig workers stated 
further “'Three weeks is too long to be far from home"". Other references with the topic of Time-of-day and days-on-
shift predict increased fatigue over two-week offshore dayshifts. Applied Ergonomics (Riethmeister et al., 2019) 
suggests that pre and post-shift fatigue accumulates in various ways over a two-week offshore period. This study 
discovered that the accumulation of post-shift fatigue scores was closely related to the following days in the next shift 
and experiencing chronic sleep deprivation. In addition, it was also stated that extending the offshore period (in this

Table 5 demonstrates the WWL score for workers with 21:21 who were exposed to a high mental workload and the 
workers with extended days reported having a very high mental workload than 21:21 workers. In conclusion, working 
on an offshore platform with more than 21 days of work is considered to have a very high workload in terms of mental 
needs, time requirements, physical needs, performance, effort, and frustration. 
 
5.3 AHP – Expertise Judgement 
In the AHP – Expertise Judgment test, 7 expertises participated in the assessment of weighing and comparing each 
criterion. From each weight given by the experts, a combined matrix will be calculated and the determination of the 
value of the consistency ratio (CR) must be less than 10% to obtain optimal results (saaty, 1990). Table 6 below will 
specify the result of the combined matrix calculation for the 4 criteria

CR :

Based on Table 6 above, the eigenvector (VP) value for the mental workload is 0.309, accommodation and 
transportation costs are 0.147, health protocol is 0.371, and field operations are 0.173. The health protocol factor 
became the dominant criterion with a weight of 0.371 or 37.1% and mental workload became the second dominant 
factor. The CR value was obtained from the consistency index ratio and the random index (RI) value. The RI value is 
obtained from the clause of the Oak Ridge laboratory which required the 4x4 matrix size to be 0.09. The CR value is 
0.0124 which is smaller than 0.1, thus the weight or eigenvector value of the criterion matrix can be assumed to be 
consistent and valid. 
 
For alternative comparisons, the same calculation method is used for each criterion. For workload criteria with a work 
cycle of 12:12, 14:14, 18:18 and 21:21 the eigenvector is determined. So does the calculation of the other 3 criteria to 
obtain the eigenvector value of the alternative combined matrix against the criteria.

2414","of the NASA TLX test, it was discovered that workers with a 21:21 cycle had an average WWL in the high category 
of 80.67, and the average worker who had experienced an extended day with an average WWL of 84.79 or categorized 
as a very high category. 
 
For the analysis of alternative offshore work cycles using the AHP – Expertise Judgment method with 4 criteria and 
4 alternatives, this study discovered that the health protocol is the main criterion with the highest weight value of 
37.1% and followed by workload with a weight of 30.9%. As for the alternative weights based on the existing criteria, 
the 12:12 cycle becomes the main alternative to be re-applied as a work cycle with a weight of 39.4% and followed 
by a cycle of 14:14 with a weight of 24% as a second alternative. Management should discuss further about taking a 
significant step and efforts to change the offshore work cycle in the PHE ONWJ during pandemic to make the workers 
feel safe and most likely will reduce the workload in the field and will increase the safety and avoid accidents due to 
the exhaustion of the workers.
