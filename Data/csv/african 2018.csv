Abstract 
The textile industry generates huge amounts of wastewater which must be treated effectively in a bid to 
prevent water scarcity through re-use. In this chapter, the use of bio adsorbents from agricultural waste 
which included corn stalks, baggase and saw dust were used as bio adsorption carriers for textile water. 
Bio adsorbents with particle size ranging from 200-1000µm and surface area of 500-1100 g/m2 were 
used to determine the effect of bio adsorbent size on textile wastewater treatment focusing on the total 
suspended solids (TSS) and the chemical oxygen demand (COD). Furthermore, the effect of bio 
adsorbent’s mass per unit volume with ranges between 1-5 g/L was also investigated on the impact from 
TSS and COD reduction. TSS and COD reduction by more than 70% were noted for increasing mass 
per unit volume in the textile water. However, an increase in the particle size of the bio adsorbent during 
textile treatment resulted in decreased efficiency of the TSS and COD reduction. Bio adsorbents present 
an attractive option which is easy to adapt for textile wastewater treatment.  
Keywords: Agro waste, bio adsorbents, COD, textile wastewater, TSS 
1. Introduction
The textile industry generates a lot of wastewater during processing and since water is a scarce commodity, there 
is need to preserve this water by adopting sustainable wastewater treatment technologies (Wyman et al., 2005; 
Attaher, 2014). Several wastewater treatment technologies that have been adapted to date include: bio filtration, 
ion exchange, sedimentation, solvent extraction, chemical oxidation, membrane processes, coagulation, oxidation, 
Fenton process, and electro coagulation (Bhatnagar and Minocha, 2006; Qian et al., 2013). The major 
disadvantage of the stated wastewater treatment methods is low efficiency as well as cost effectiveness (Ahmad 
et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012). This calls for the need to adopt technologies like bio adsorption in textile 
wastewater treatment.  
Bio adsorption is an attractive wastewater treatment process due to its low cost and easy to use as well as its wider 
application in different types of wastewaters (Dang et al., 2009; Ansari and Mosayebzadeh, 2010; Rathinam et 
2029","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

3.4.1 Effect on TSS 
Lower bio adsorbents particle size of 200 µm had greater TSS removal capacity as compared to larger particle 
sizes of greater 750 µm (Figure 3). From Figure 3, it is clear that the highest COD removal takes place when the 
particle size of the bio adsorbent is small with removal efficiencies as high as 20%. This behaviour is attributed 
to the increase in surface area available for bio adsorption enhancing the adsorption process.  
Figure 3. Effect of bio adsorbent particle size on TSS change of textile water with bio adsorbent loading of 5g/L 
3.4.2 Effect on COD 
The COD removal efficiency from the textile wastewater was greatest at 200 µm and decreased with increase in 
particle size to 1000 µm for various bio adsorbents with loading of 5 g/L (Figure 4). Bhatti et al. (2015) also 
reported a 79% reduction in COD when bio adsorbents from corncobs, sugarcane baggase, cotton sticks, sunflower 
and peanut husk were used for textile wastewater treatment. From Figure 4, it can be seed that the highest COD 
removal was for all the bio adsorbents with particle size of 200 µm. Lower bio adsorbents particle sizes have 
higher surface area which increases the adsorption properties hence increased COD removal (Dargo et al., 2014).

Application of agricultural waste bio adsorbents in textile wastewater treatment presents an alternative, cheap and 
easy technology. The application of corn stalks, baggase and saw dust bio adsorbents which can easily be obtained 
in abundance in Southern Africa results in effective COD and TSS reduction in textile water. Small bio adsorbent 
particle sizes of 200 µm and high mass per unit volume of 5 g/L are ideal, in textile water treatment. The 
performance of the bio adsorbent during textile water treatment is irrespective of the source of the agricultural 
waste.

Abstract 
Used lubricating oils generated from automotive and process industries pose environmental hazards if not 
properly managed. In this study, the potential to re-refine used lubricants for reuse was investigated. Used oil 
collected from a local garage was dehydrated at 240°C and varying pressure of 4-12bars under vacuum 
distillation. Solvent extraction was employed using Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK) as a solvent with varying ratios 
from 2:1 to 6:1 at a mixing temperature of 60°C. MEK and oils mixture underwent atmospheric distillation at 80 
°C to allow separation of oils and MEK. During the re-refining process, the amount of water removed, ash 
content, sulphur content, viscosity, specific gravity, flash point and pour point were measured. Optimum oil 
yield of 94 (wt %) was achieved at a solvent to oil-ratio of 6:1. Re-refining of used oils resulted in a 73% 
reduction in sulphur content, 76% reduction in ash content and 64% water removal. The re-refined oil’s 
viscosity of 90 cP, flash point of 160 °C, the specific gravity of 0.91 and pour point of -12°C. The re-refined 
used oils properties were almost similar to those of virgin oil using a combination of vacuum distillation and 
solvent extraction with an additive for maximum performance. Re-refined oils employing zinc dialkyl

that are normally responsible for the high viscosity value during the re-refining process. The viscosity values 
obtained in this study related to the values reported by Udonne and Bakare (2013) who got values between 84 
cP and 88 cP when used oils were treated using various methodologies including distillation, acid clay treatment 
and acid treatment. 
 
3.6.3 Specific gravity 
Specific gravity refers to the density of a material in relation to that of water. The specific gravity of the re-
refined oil which was 0.91 was almost the same as that of the virgin oil with a value of 0.90 (Table 4).

Specific gravity 
Virgin oil 
0.91±0.01 
Used lubricating oil 
0.92±0.01 
Re-refined oil 
0.90±0.01 
 
This was a clear indication that the re-refined lubricating oils could be reused since their lubricity was also 
enhanced through the re-refining resulting in the decrease in viscosity. Kannan et al. (2014) reported the same 
results when they observed a specific density of 0.87 for refined lubricating oils in comparison to a value of 0.91 
in the virgin oil. This is an indication that re-refining of used oils using distillation with zinc dialkyl 
dithiosulphate as an additive achieves results with used oil that are comparable to virgin lubricating oils. 
 
3.6.4 Pour point 
This refers to the temperature at which a liquid becomes a semi-solid and loses its flow characteristics and a low 
pour point is always an indication of low-level impurities in the re-refined lubricating oils (Abro et al., 2013). 
The pour point of fresh oil was −10.3 °C, refined lubricating oil was −12.3 °C and the used lubricating oil was 
−28.1 °C (Table 5).  
Table 5.Pour point values for the various oils

Pour point (°C) 
Virgin oil 
-10.3±2.1 
Used lubricating oil 
-28.1±0.15 
Re-refined oil 
-12.3±0.15 
 
The re-refined used oil’s pour point was within 16% of the virgin oil pour point value. The decrease in pour 
point in the re-refined used oil was due to the degradations of additives, which were present in fresh oil as pour 
point depressants. Pour points of oils are usually determined by the viscosity, high viscosity results in high pour 
points (Hamawand et al., 2013).  
 
A summary of properties of re-refined lubrication oils in comparison to the virgin oil and used lubricating oil is 
shown in Table 6.

4. Conclusion 
Re-refining of used lubricating oils is essential for used oils management and recycling. Re-refined used 
lubricating oils exhibit almost the same characteristics of virgin oil in terms of the physicochemical parameters 
such as viscosity, pour point, specific gravity and flash point. This is achievable through vacuum distillation and 
solvent extraction with MEK with zinc dialkyl dithiosulphate being employed as an additive. Though re-refining 
used lubricants proved to be feasible at laboratory scale, the economic viability of the re-refining process needs 
to be investigated for scale up.

been established that a market for charcoal briquettes is available if the torrified material would be of the 
same quality as coal. Making of bio-coal would be an added advantage of this project over the previous 
briquettes which were biomass briquettes. Biomass briquettes face stiff competition even from firewood or 
just use of sawdust using proper stoves. It has been established that charcoal briquette have a better market 
as opposed to biomass briquettes. Urban houses are also becoming more open to usage of charcoal since it 
burns almost as smart as gas but would have an added advantage of heating the house. In areas like Harare, 
charcoal is being imported from Zambia for domestic use and is being sold in our local markets like 
Epworth where electrification is on the low side. Also industry would be more open to usage of bio-coal as 
opposed to biomass briquette because it looks and works almost as well as the traditional coal. Challenges 
would be getting a proper storage facility for the sawdust and its transportation since it is very flammable 
and dangerous. Challenges might emanate from fire hazards as well as Zimbabwean regulators like the 
Environmental Management Act (EMA). 
Although agreements with sawmills are in their preliminary stages in terms of saw dust collection, nothing 
concrete has been agreed upon. The reason for failure is due to the fact that this project is currently in the 
preliminary stages which makes the project team unable to bind to any agreement although sawmills were 
more than eager to do so. Therefore, legal agreements need to be done on supply of the raw-material and its 
price before setting up a big plant. The other option includes setting up mobile charcoal briquetting plants 
since transportation of sawdust might have hazards and would make more locations with heaped sawdust 
accessible. Challenges are mainly on specifying product usage as well as environmental impact of the 
project. Therefore there might be need to educate end users on proper usage of the product. Challenges that 
might arise due to improper usage include carbon monoxide (CO), consistence and timing.  
 
8. Conclusion 
The domestic and industrial use of charcoal briquettes as a solid fuel Zimbabwe constitutes an important 
alternative that should be further developed as it allows for the economic revaluation of biomass waste and 
the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Raw material for charcoal briquettes is locally available in 
abundance and technologies like torrefaction can be adopted for the manufacture of these briquettes. The 
chief raw material was found to be pine saw dust and baggase; however, other biomass feedstock includes 
sorghum spent grains from breweries across the country and charcoal fines from charcoal processing. The 
biomass briquetting technology presents positive results of higher bulk density, similar levels of calorific 
power, less moisture, and low levels of fixed carbon, chlorine and sulphur, promoting a healthier 
environment for the consumer and the environment. The energy content of biomass briquettes is considered 
sufficient for domestic and industrial use.

By making a detailed study of a two unit cold standby system with constant failure rate and two stage 
Erlangian repair time distribution, measures of system performance and its statistical inferential aspects 
are discussed through classical and Bayesian approaches.    
Keywords  
Bayes estimator, confidence limits, Slustky theorem, standby system, steady state availability. 
1. Introduction
Reliability theory is concerned with statistical description of a system and has been studied in detail using the 
failure time and repair time density functions. The failures and repairs in any system are influenced by several 
factors such as system configuration, the environmental conditions under which the system operates and the 
varying failures (minor and major) and so on, which cannot be controlled or assessed well in advance. For a 
detailed study of systems operating in random environments, see Chandrasekhar and Natarjan (2001) and 
Chandrasekhar et al. (2005). In real life situations with problems involving system configurations, it is essential 
to carry out an analysis of measures of system performance. These problems often require the applications of 
statistical tools such as point estimation, interval estimation, hypotheses testing and Bayesian inference. Most of 
the times, it is possible that some statistical information pertaining to the parameters of both lifetime and repair 
time distributions is available. In such a scenario, Bayesian approach provides statistical methodology to 
incorporate the prior information with the data at hand. Analysis of systems using the above mentioned 
statistical tools is scarce in literature.

The performance of the Bayes estimate of MTBF i.e., MTBF* is illustrated in this section through simulated data. 
The estimates are obtained using (3.5). Monte Carlo integration method is used to evaluate the integrals in (3.5)

Abstract 
South Africa is well endowed with mineral resources which is estimated to be worth approximately 
US$2.5 trillion and is a leading producer of gold, platinum group metals, chromium, coal, iron ore, 
diamonds and vanadium.  Junior mining companies or “Junior Mining” as it is known today are 
exploration companies that search for new mineral deposits that are believed to have significant potential 
for finding larger mineral deposits. The junior mining sector however faces a number of challenges. 
These include access to finance for capital intensive prospective green and brown field mining projects 
and also the very high economic and technical risks.  With the changing political climate within the 
country and global trends in the supply and demand of minerals and metals, it is foreseen that Junior 
Mining has a major role to play in the future as there are many potential undiscovered deposits.  It is 
hence a space where both Innovation and Entrepreneurship are critical in order for these Junior mining 
companies to not only achieve their medium to long terms goals but to also help attract much needed 
foreign investment into the country. This paper looks at the current status of Junior Mining in South 
Africa, the challenges/gaps faced by the sector, opportunities for development and the role of both 
Innovation and Entrepreneurship in order to succeed in this difficult industry which is dictated by 
fluctuating commodity prices. Recommendations will also be made on how this sector could be further 
improved and supported into the future.

1. Introduction
1.1 The Status of the Mining and Minerals Sector in South Africa 
Mining and minerals is the backbone of the South African economy. South Africa is a leading producer of gold, 
platinum group metals, chromium and vanadium. It is also a leading producer of aluminium, diamonds, iron ore, 
manganese, coal, titanium, and zirconium. South Africa’s mineral resources are estimated at a value of 
approximately US$2.5 trillion (Citi Bank, 2011). In the mining sector the term beneficiation is defined as the 
different processes used to extract valuable minerals from mined ore and separate it into mineral and gangue 
(waste), the former suitable for further processing or direct use (CTI Reviews, 2015). The term beneficiation is used 
very often in conjunction with the term value-addition. Based on the definition described above, the term 
beneficiation has been used within a context of economic development and corporate social responsibility (CSR) to 
describe the amount of value derived from the exploitation of mineral assets which remain in the country and 
benefits locals including communities (Citi Bank, 2011).

According to (Bryant, 2015) some of the innovative approaches taken for optimising existing or new mining 
operations include: 
 
• 
Use of continuous rather than batch operations 
• 
Use of automation and increase in instrumentation to reduce labor costs 
• 
Mine/Plant scalability 
• 
Reduction of waste (to zero) and increasing energy efficiency 
• 
Ability to mine lower grade mineral resources and a reduced cost 
 
It must however be noted that the use of innovative approaches poses a much greater degree of risk to the junior 
mining companies but these companies can put “knowledge-based” strategies and plans in place to mitigate the risk. 
The use of technology to assist in improving the knowledge of junior miners and providing them with a platform to 
improve their mine planning and operational strategy cannot be underestimated. They need to make use of this 
available technology to acquire better knowledge of the mineral deposits to be explored which will assist in 
modelling and maximizing the mine design for better resource extraction (Bryant, 2015).  This will inherently help 
in reducing the risk during the exploration phase of junior mining projects.  One tool that can be used is a risk 
assessment chart (heat map) or matrix for the envisaged project.  In many cases this is required by investors and an 
example is shown in Table 1 below. 
 
Table 1: Example of typical risk categories used to identify problems in new mining projects (Source: Exploration 
Insights) 
 
 
 
 
The risks associated with junior mining projects come with the territory and can rarely be completely avoided. It is 
up to the management team to be innovative and utilise their entrepreneurial abilities to develop viable strategies to 
mitigate the risks which amongst others are technical, geopolitical and financial 
 
5. Conclusion 
   
With the country starting a “new dawn” there is much optimism within the mining sector even though there has been 
a decline over the last number of years. This however is seen as an opportunity of junior mining companies to play a 
major role in the identification of new mineral deposits. These companies however experience challenges. Lack of 
finance and investment is just one of them.  They are also required to improve then technical and financial skills in 
order to stay ahead of the competition.   
 
Support systems and frameworks are required by both government and private sector in order to provide the 
assistance required and to help streamline processes and also reduce the risk involved in these type of project 
investments.  If these areas that are identified are developed and assistance is provided by both government and 
private sector junior mining could be seen as the savior of the mining industry going forward with South Africa.  
 
The junior miner in order to succeed has to be innovative and must possess entrepreneurial qualities. Both 
innovation and entrepreneurship however involve risk. The use of innovative approaches poses a much greater

mitigate the risk and attract investor confidence.

Abstract
The objective of this study is to evaluate the crucial barriers to the successful implementation of social
sustainability initiatives. We have used two distinctive modelling approaches to investigate the contextual
relationship between the key barriers and to rank them concerning their importance. We identified
barriers through literature review and data collected from senior managers from four manufacturing
industries. Interpretative structural modelling (ISM) approach is used to develop a hierarchical structure
for analyzing the interactions among the key barriers. MICMAC (Matriced' Impacts Croise's
Multiplication Appliquée a UN Classement) method is then used to examine the driving and the
dependence power of key barriers. ISM model highlights that lack of involvement of operational staff in
planning and lack of supportive institutional policies are the key barriers. These barriers that lead to lack
of understanding customer needs and exchange of information and lack of managerial capabilities for
implementation and adaptation to new heath and safety practices. Whereas, MICMAC analysis revealed
lack of knowledge on resource management and lack of trained people drive the other barriers. This
suggests that firm make social sustainable development performance by addressing these linkages barriers
and driving barriers in manufacturing firms. Production managers, supply chain designers and
policymakers can utilise the findings of the present study.

1. Introduction
In recent years, issues related to global climate change conditions due to pollution emission for
sustainable developmen have become more complex(Awan & Abbasi, 2013).Social sustainability
performance has attracted attention among the academicians and practitioners of the supply chain. Many
previous studies have focussed on the concept of ‘social sustainability’ (Anisul Huq et al., 2014; Hutchins
and Sutherland, 2008; Mani et al., 2015). Some current studies have identified and analysis of barriers in
“green supply chain management practices” (Govindan et al., 2016; Mathiyazhagan et al., 2013). Social
sustainability is a prominent part of the many global initiatives in the field of supply chain management
(Husgafvel et al., 2015). Government regulations have increased pressure from the suppliers is a
significant determinant of awareness and effectively integrating sustainability concerns into their
operational practices(Awan, 2017; Sarkis et al., 2010).The social sustainability issues gaining attention in
developing countries industries to integrate sustainability concerns into their strategic agenda. For
example, on  12th September 2012, the Ali Enterprises factory in Karachi Pakistan was solely producing
jeans for German-based low-cost retailer KiK, least 254 workers killed in a fire at the factory because of
inadequate safety procedures (BBC, 2012). The recent event of fire broke out in the manufacturing
facility of Pakistani supplier that supply garments to German base store, led to pay $5.15 million in
compensation to the victims of one of the worst industrial accident (ECCHR, 2016).

Abstract 
This paper briefly describes big data generated by physical activity trackers (or wearables) and its 
application in sport, with a focus on individual sports of running and cycling which are easily accessible 
to the lifestyle athlete. It describes the potential for paradigm shifts in training monitoring, rehabilitation, 
talent acquisition and even urban planning that data mining can provide. Furthermore, it highlights some 
risk concerns pertaining to big data in sport such as user privacy, data accuracy, interpretation of 
information and athlete autonomy. The paper concludes by contrasting the possible advances in sport and 
physical activity research with the ethical considerations that might slow down the progress.

1. Introduction
This paper seeks to address two, perhaps somewhat opposing, avenues in sport analytics: the possible research 
advances that can be made based on sports tracking data and the ethical considerations that accompany data mining 
in sport. Sports analytics is the examination and modeling of sporting performance using scientific techniques 
(Morgulev et al., 2017). It is an emerging discipline which combines a wide domain of specialties from human 
physiology and kinetics, sport science, big data, data science, data mining, mathematics, and statistical analyses 
(Passfield et al., 2016). This paper explores some of the recent uses of big data (that are generated by personal 
fitness trackers or sporting websites) both within sport as well as in other application fields. It describes sports 
tracking data in terms of the three “V’s” of big data and provide an analog for the transition from tracking data to 
wisdom.  
Sports data can be both quantitative and qualitative and can be collected on a large scale from a variety of sources 
such as biometric data, films or videos, historical medical reports, on-field or on-route positional tracking data, 
weather and crowd behavioural data to name but a few. Wearable microelectronicmechanical (MEM) systems can 
collect a range of biometric (physiological, kinematic and kinetic data) and geo-spatial tracking data as athletes 
physically move through space during sporting activities (Wilkerson et al., 2016). Wearable devices (from hence on 
21","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Pretoria / Johannesburg, South Africa, October 29 – November 1, 2018 
 
© IEOM Society International 
should remain an adjunct tool in the athlete’s quest for sporting excellence and career longevity, it should not 
become the driver of performance. Athletes risk loosing their autonomy and intuition when they completely rely on 
their biometric data to govern their performance efforts and race or game tactics. When an athlete is reduced to an 
entity basically consisting of only numbers and visualisations the enjoyment of the sport will be diminished, which 
is contradictory to the desired effect of sport participation in the first place for both the recreational and elite athlete. 
Sport fulfills the human body’s inherent design to move at will, and not to be a marionette who plays by numbers. 
 
The ethical dilemma: advances in research versus protection of human subjects 
The World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki ensures that where research involves human subjects, the 
study be subjected to ethical clearance by endorsed ethical committees. The ethical considerations as mentioned are 
a double-edged sword: though aimed to protect the athlete and preserve their privacy, it may also halt progress 
towards methods that can improve their physical health and access to infrastructure that support a healthy, active 
lifestyle. The ethical clearance process itself may be tedious and costly, prolonging the time it takes to execute 
experiments or other studies. This slows down the rate of progress in research fields with discoveries that could be 
advantageous to athletes, but at the same time prevent any suggested research where subjects may suffer 
unrepairable physical or psychological harm. Researchers in sport science and data science who make use of 
tracking data from wearables have an inherit responsibility to protect their subjects or participants from potential 
harm as well as preserving the integrity and quality of their research output. Advances in research in these fields 
must therefore be made in a responsible manner, even if it means a temporary decrease in momentum towards new 
discoveries or extension of the body of knowledge.  
 
Trade-off decisions to advance or disprove of research suggestions are both complex and complicated, and can 
perhaps be compared to the complexities of traffic regulation: promote flow of transportation vessels, but also 
protect road users from accidents and harm by installing rules that limit continuous traffic flow. Not only must the 
ethical committee decide on the potential physical or psychological harm to participants caused by poorly executed 
research, but also take into consideration the protection of their personal data, online security, privacy and autonomy. 
Sport science research occurs in a multi-faceted environment, with big data extending this environment to include 
more variables and on a much larger scale. This union results in an intricate network of possibilities and/or problems 
that require advanced multi-disciplinary skills to solve, while keeping within ethical boundaries to protect the 
research subjects. Not all disciplines involved in data science have been exposed to the strict ethical considerations 
as have sport science or other medical research, so the collaboration efforts might face intrinsic challenges in how to 
work towards the common goal. 
 
The risk of big data in sport therefor extends well beyond the damage that can be caused by cyber-attacks and data 
leaks. Data sets from wearables must be subjected to rigorous testing of integrity and preferably validated against 
known golden standards before adoption as tools to monitor physical performance. Researchers must present the 
true form of the data as it emerged as clear as possible, and disclose the veracity of the data together with the 
possible weaknesses of their models or other discoveries. Ethical committees are now faced with a new challenge, 
namely the trade-off between the acceleration of research made possible by big data and the protection of human 
participants in order to avoid costly mistakes made in the past. 
5. Conclusion 
The literature has shown that it is possible for not only sports disciplines to capitalise on new found knowledge 
hidden in the extensively large data sets generated by wearables, but also parallel research to advance physical 
activity within the population. The data from wearable tracking devices are representative of the real world and are 
not limited to a laboratory or clinical setting nor experimental time constraints. When used correctly this knowledge 
lends decision support to athletes, coaches, management teams and even urban planners that was not previously 
possible with the use of questionnaires, surveys and self-reported training loads. The discipline of data science 
28","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

provides analysts with rigorous and scientific techniques to organise and transform the raw data into mathematical 
and statistical models. These models can be used for innovative approaches to training, tactics and urban 
infrastructure with the focus of improving physical activity by its inhabitants. However, the risks associated with big 
data must be considered in deciding which metrics are important and the extent of trust placed in the data. The 
wisdom gained from mining tracking data from wearables should provide athletes with a tool to make informed 
decisions, it should not govern the athlete. Researchers in the field must act responsibly with the data from 
wearables and respect the ethical considerations that accompany big data in sport science.

The Bleeding Edge of IT Project Methodology

Abstract  
 
There is abundant theory concerning the tailoring of project management methodologies, specifically as it 
pertains to ‘what’ tailoring is and ‘what’ the outcomes of tailoring ought to be. There are works that describe 
the process at a high level and there are also a sizable amount of papers reporting on the successful fusion 
of disparate project management methodologies. Whereas the ‘what’ of selection, tailoring and fusion is 
well described, it is argued that tools, methods and theory supporting, guiding and describing ‘how’ to 
conduct tailoring presents an opportunity for the delivery of unique and valuable contributions to the 
profession. In the proposed presentation, a holistic approach to addressing these concerns are introduced, 
from which unique and valuable theories, methods and tools stem.  
 
A multi-level model of project management for large, complex projects is proposed following an 
investigation into 29 main project management methodologies. Agile methodologies, in particular, describe 
the project as a defined initiative that can be viewed and interpreted from one level – the project’s level. 
Some traditional methodologies allow for sub-projects and master projects, but it is argued that these 
approaches still fall short of providing the possibility of optimal customization. As an example in summary: 
A large, complex project may deliver defined functions at various levels within the organization – 
infrastructure and software development by the IT team; marketing and training by the project sponsor’s 
business unit; and compliance by the company’s legal arm. Furthermore, ‘above’ the organization, certain 
functions may be required to adhere to processes defined by the regulator. Third party suppliers, ‘below’ 
the organization, may benefit from clear guidance as to how their unique process will be required to adhere 
to the methodology of the organization’s IT team. The multi-level model allows for freedom of process at 
each level, while specifying the project governance needs between the levels. This produces seamless 
integration and reduced risk, while providing more freedom to the delivery of each function. 
 
In aid of the selection, tailoring and fusion of customized project management methodologies, a 
methodology comparison tool, or framework, and a hands-on guide to tailoring is proposed. The tool 
contains the defining characteristics of each of the 29 main project management methodologies. A 
methodology can be selected for analysis, at the requested level of detail. Multiple methodologies can be 
compared for mutually inclusive and exclusive characteristics. Furthermore, through a process of 
compression, methodologies can be compared by viewing only their differentiating characteristics. This 
advises the selection of a base, or master, methodology. The selected methodology can then be reinforced 
with the mutually inclusive characteristics of other methodologies. The guide to tailoring describes these 
steps and the requisite knowledge that stakeholders are expected to provide to the process in order to 
produce a methodology that caters for the perceived complexity and risk of projects, while being as lean as 
possible. Using this tool and guide, a customized methodology can be created for the organization, for a 
business unit, for a portfolio, for a program’s projects, for each individual project or even for each function 
delivered at a specific level, as per the multi-level model. 
 
Finally. In response to the need to progress beyond the design and development of solutions and to also 
provide for the implementation and take-up of solutions, the development of a guide to the implementation 
of enhancements into the IT project management landscape, specifically, is proposed. This is done by 
building on the methods and lessons learned from ITIL implementations. This proposition and its benefits 
promises improved implementation success and take up, and reduced change fatigue endured in an",,,african 2018

Abstract 
Business process reengineering (BPR) aims to challenge and assist organisations to break away 
from old ways of conducting business processes and embrace new ways to execute business 
processes. The implementation of new technology allows organisations to improve and simplify 
methods of executing business processes. Despite this, the possible benefits provided by new 
technology are not achieved when ineffective and outdated business processes are reapplied to 
execute business operational activities even though technology provides alternative ways of 
executing business processes. 
The purpose of this research is to confirm why the benefits provided by new technology are not 
achieved when technology is implemented without correctly reengineering existing business 
processes. The research investigates if there are any gaps in the BPR methods applied in power 
plants during new technology implementation. The research also establishes which BPR success 
factors are not successfully incorporated when new technology is implemented. 
The research uses two case studies within the same organisation to evaluate how BPR is 
conducted during new technology implementation. The research found that if business processes 
are not reengineered according to best practices and all success factors are not successfully 
incorporated during new technology, the benefits that the technology provides are not achieved.

1. Introduction
The South African State Owned Entity (SOE), Eskom Ltd, has embarked on a capacity expansion program to 
increase the capacity of the installed power generation units (Koko & Singh, 2016). The capacity increase program 
also entails the introduction of new technology to improve plant performance and reliability, extend operational life 
expectancy, increase performance, implement a condition monitoring system, incorporate energy efficiency systems 
and improve system efficiency and compliance with the latest standards and specifications (Moodley, 2008; Volk, 
2012; Eskom Integrated Report, 2015; Masango, 2015). 
Technology implementation often requires changes in organisational structures, policies and human resource 
requirements (Davenport & Stoddard, 1994). Organisational changes in relation to introduction of new technology 
often results in employee resistance, which can drastically influence project success and subsequently inhibit 
redesigned processes and prevent them from being effective (Bovey & Hede, 2001).

The research findings provide knowledge and insight regarding the requirements to successfully reengineer business 
processes during technology implementation. The findings are applicable to power plants introducing new 
technology to improve performance and effectiveness of business process activities.  
 
Future research is suggested to improve BPR success by prioritising technology impact evaluation on organisational 
culture, people, performance, and final establishing how performance of identified processes will be measured and 
evaluated during technology implementation.

Abstract 
 
The application of GIS enhanced modelling techniques in biomass and solid waste supply chain problems 
is hinged on a common denominator for both systems: the scattered nature of supply points and variability 
of resource quantities. Since the sustainability of bioenergy or waste-to-energy projects around these 
resources will be affected significantly by the cost of supplying them, it is important to optimize decisions 
around facility location, size and transport routes. GIS is an important tool that can be used to capture the 
spatial and temporal dynamics of the biomass and waste. It can then be used alone or integrated with other 
software tools, for strategic and tactical level optimization of biomass and solid waste supply chains. In as 
much as a lot of progress has been made globally in research and application of GIS enhanced modelling 
techniques in biomass and solid waste supply chains, developing nations have trailed behind. This explains 
why spatial and temporal waste or biomass statistics are not readily available in these areas. This paper 
reviews recent developments in the application of GIS in biomass and solid waste supply chain models, 
with the ultimate objective of identifying the gaps and opportunities that exist. It is especially biased 
towards the use of the biomass and waste in renewable or waste to energy schemes- a fast growing field 
within the green economy.

1. Introduction 
1.1 General background: Waste to energy and bioenergy systems 
Waste to energy (WtE) and biomass to bioenergy (BtB) are both significant highlights within global green economy 
schemes, representing the use of ‘renewable’ waste and biomass (Kennes, Abubackar, Diaz, Veiga, & Kennes, 2016; 
Vlachos, Iakovou, Karagiannidis, & Toka, 2008). Recent green initiatives are hinged on the fact that these two 
resources can be an invaluable substitution for fossil based fuels both in the power and fuels industries since both can 
be converted into fuels, heat and power using various technologies (Batidzirai, Smeets, & Faaij, 2012; Nkosi & 
Muzenda, 2014; Pantaleo & Shah, 2013; Pilusa & Muzenda, 2014; Sobrino, Monroy, & Pérez, 2011). Biomass can 
be thermally or biochemically converted into renewable biofuels, while selected fractions of Municipal Solid Waste 
(MSW) like tyres, rubber and plastics can also be thermo chemically converted into heavy oils and fuels (Pilusa & 
Muzenda, 2014; Pradhan & Mbohwa, 2014). Due to the rising awareness and advocacy for a green economy, both 
fields have registered a significant growth in the past decade. The global Waste to Energy (WtE) market was valued 
at US$25.32 billion in 2013, having grown by 5.5% from 2012. It has then been projected to grow by a Compound 
Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of over 5.5% from 2016, reaching a value of US$40 billion by 2023 (World Energy 
Council, 2016). The BtB industry is also growing with the follow segmented CAGR projections: 44% for advanced 
biofuels from 2017-2021; 9.6% for all biofuels (2013-2019); 7% and 8.1% for biomass power generation and biodiesel 
respectively in 2018 (Sapp, 2014a, 2014b, 2017).  The main, common drivers for both are the global lookout to 
increase Renewable energy sources (RES), rising environmental consciousness, the advent of circular economies, 
government policies and support through grants, tax credits, incentives and special loans (Sapp, 2017; World Energy 
Council, 2016).",,,african 2018

Abstract 
 
Green public procurement (GPP) in South African local government is still at its infancy stage. The municipalities of 
City of Johannesburg (CoJ), Cape Town, eThekwini, Ekurhuleni, Nelson Mandela Bay and Tshwane (all members of 
International Council for Local Government Initiatives (ICLEI) committed in 2002 at the World Conference on 
Sustainable Development (WSSD) to pursue some form of GPP, however none of these municipalities has developed 
a fully-fledged policy on GPP. GPP is one of the new strategies that are being adopted globally to assist local 
governments in providing solutions for sustainable development and to embrace the green economy through the 
implementation of long-term sustainable policies and strategies. The incorporation of green procurement elements 
into current supply chain policies of municipalities can be the first and most inexpensive step in achieving a successful 
green procurement programs. Municipalities spend a large portion of their budget on procurement and if they use their 
purchasing power by choosing to procure environmentally friendly goods and services, they can make an important 
contribution to sustainable consumption and production. The integration of green criteria in local government 
procurement would provide opportunities for: improved efficiency, reduced resource use, reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, cost savings and enhanced environmental and social outcomes. The aim of the research was to determine 
factors that affect implementation of GPP practices in local government and it concludes that there is a need to confront 
lack of knowledge and training as critical in driving the implementation of GPP. 
 
Key words 
Green Public Procurement, Bid specification, Cost of green products, Training and awareness and Management 
practices 
 
I.  Introduction  
The term “Green public procurement” is still an emerging concept and it has been explained in different ways, one 
definition is that it is “a process whereby public authorities seek to procure goods, services and works with a reduced 
environmental impact throughout their life cycle when compared to goods, services and works with the same primary 
function that would otherwise be procured” (European Commission, 2011) Municipalities spend a large portion of 
their budget on procurement and if they use their purchasing power by choosing to procure environmentally friendly 
goods and services, they can make an important contribution to sustainable consumption and production, or what is 
called Green Public Procurement (GPP) or green purchasing. The integration of green criteria in local government 
procurement thus would provide opportunities for: improved efficiency, reduced resource use, reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, cost savings and enhanced environmental and social outcomes. (Green Procurement by Local Government: 
A Review of Sustainability CriteriaHeather Zeppel).GPP is one of the new strategies that are being adopted globally 
to assist local governments in providing solutions for sustainable development and to embrace the green economy 
through the implementation of long-term sustainable policies and strategies. The incorporation of green procurement 
elements into current supply chain policies of municipalities can be the first and most inexpensive step in achieving a 
successful green procurement programs. There are numerous factors that are affecting implementation of GPP in many 
local authorities in South Africa such as price, availability, and insufficient knowledge, lack of political commitment, 
purchasing habits, no acceptable alternative to current product and no ‘green’ specifications provided by supplier 
amongst other challenges.","Proceedings of the 1st IEOM African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management in Pretoria / Johannesburg, South Africa.  October 29 – November 1, 2018. 
Implementation was highly related with a value of 0.8325, Management Practices and Green Implementation was 
0.20, Training and Awareness and Green Implementation was 0.4587, Bid Specification and Green Implementation 
was 0.086. These results show that the first three of the four canonical correlations are statistically significant at 5% 
level of significance. The results of the regression analysis indicated that the Cost of green products, Management 
Practices and Training and Awareness are significant factors of green implementation in the city of Johannesburg at 
5% level of significance. Thus awareness campaigns on green procurement initiatives and tools would be highly 
significant in deciding to implement green procurement (Testa, Iraldo, Frey & Daddi, 2012). 
 
6. Recommendations  
The findings of this study recommends that the city of Johannesburg municipality to consider following the Supplier 
approach whereby the suppliers will be encouraged to evaluate their environmental performance and thereby being 
awarded a Green Certificate. Suppliers should be encouraged to promote their green products to demonstrate their 
quality and performance in comparison with conventional products. We also recommend the city to consider 
developing a programme of knowledge sharing for all employees to promote and raise awareness on green 
procurement, its benefits and external drivers, to increase interest. Have specific training for employees with 
responsibility for choosing goods, and for employees who vet contracts. Lack of awareness and information may be 
the cause of resistance to change, therefore ensuring that there are open and effective channels of communication may 
reduce the possibilities of resistance to change (Boohene & Williams, 2012).Develop a series of educational 
programmes to continually improve market awareness and keep up with the latest developments in green products and 
services. Build research and keeping up to date with new products into employees’ training requirements through 
appraisal systems and Continuing Professional Development. Investigate joint tendering with other organisations to 
gain better prices for green products and services. Develop a formal green procurement policy, either as a stand-alone 
document or as part of the main procurement policy that is adopted at the organisation level and a regular review of 
the policy. This is one of the key ways to overcome barriers to green procurement, as it will provide clear aims and 
objectives for the organisation. 
 
Buying Green (2004), a handbook on environmental public procurement, for the EU advises the following steps are 
required to implement green procurement:  
1. Consider which products, services or works are the most suitable on the basis both of their environmental impact 
and of other factors, such as the information you have, what is on the market, the technologies available, costs and 
visibility.  
2. Identify your needs and express them appropriately.   
3. Draw up clear and precise technical specifications, using environmental factors where possible (pass/fail 
conditions).  
4. Consider environmental performances, such as the use of raw materials, sustainable production methods (where 
relevant for the end product or service), energy efficiency, renewable energies, emissions, waste, ‘recyclability’ and 
dangerous chemicals.  
5. Establish selection criteria on the basis of the exhaustive list of criteria mentioned in the public procurement 
directives. Where appropriate include environmental criteria to prove technical capacity to perform the contract.  
6. Inform potential suppliers, service providers or contractors that they can use environmental management schemes 
and declarations to prove compliance with the criteria.  
7. Establish award criteria: where the criteria of the ‘economically most advantageous tender’ is chosen, insert relevant 
environmental criteria either as a benchmark to compare green offers with each other (in the case where the technical 
specifications define the contract as being green) or as a way of introducing an environmental element (in the case 
where the technical specifications define the contract in a ‘neutral’ way) and giving it a certain weighting. Included in 
this step is the consideration of life-cycle costing.  
8. Use contract performance clauses as a way of setting relevant extra environmental conditions in addition to the 
green contract. 
 
7. Conclusions  
The research aimed to determine the factors that affect the implementation of green procurement practices in local 
government in the City of Johannesburg and provide the recommendations to the council. The gap analysis conducted 
on Environmental Management System development indicates that the City of Johannesburg must reduce on its 
unsustainable consumption patterns. A survey instrument was used to collect opinions, perceptions and attitudes from 
100 targeted procurement personnel, management and executives. The literature review section discussed initiatives,","Proceedings of the 1st IEOM African International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Management in Pretoria / Johannesburg, South Africa.  October 29 – November 1, 2018. 
activities, plans and projects that have been undertaken by different government authorities globally to implement 
green public procurement. The government is well positioned to promote environmentally-friendly products and 
business activities through GPP policies or strategies that would encourage development and diffusion of 
environmentally sound goods and services in the procurement process. The results of the regression analysis indicated 
that the Cost of green products, Management Practices and Training and Awareness are significant factors of green 
implementation in the city of Johannesburg at 5% level of significance. The research also concludes that although the 
city of Johannesburg has made significant progress in adapting to green transition through various initiatives, green 
policy documents has to be developed and adopted at organizational level.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study was to understand the factors which contribute to organisational change 
resistance by engineers in a civil engineering consulting organisation in order to better manage them in 
future. A questionnaire was sent out to employees and documents on the change were analysed to 
establish what these factors were and how they compared to literature. A number of steps the organisation 
should take during future organisational changes were put forth to assist in reducing employee resistance.

Change management; employee resistance 
1. Introduction
“Living and coping with change is a fact of life for organisations and the individuals within them (Daly, et al., 
2003).” Approximately 70% of organisational change initiatives fail (Daly, et al., 2003) (Judge & Thomas, 2009). 
There are however different ways in which individuals deal with organisational change. Some individuals may 
support change and accept it easily; others may support change but find it difficult to accept as it requires changes in 
their habits; others may simply have no decided feeling about the change; and others just do not support change, 
cannot accept it and thus resist it. It is human nature to resist change as it brings insecurity (Yang, 2014). The 
reasons for resistance are difficult to overcome as it deals with human characteristics such as perceptions, 
personalities and needs (Agboola & Salawu, 2011). The manner in which organisational change is implemented and 
managed can affect employees’ resistance to the change (Folger & Skarlicki, 1999). However, there are ways to help 
minimise these cases of resistance (Yue, 2008). Organisations should accept that resistance is part of change as 
employees will in most cases defend their current security if they feel it is threatened (Folger & Skarlicki, 1999). 
Engineering is a process of constant change (Du Toit, 2014) therefore engineers by nature are constantly thinking of 
ways to do things better. However, organisational change that is implemented which employees do not think will 
improve their way of working will cause resistance (Mutihac, 2010). Change managers and change agents should 
anticipate employee resistance and should manage it from planning and through implementation. 
The case organisation is a South African civil engineering consulting firm with a staff complement just over 600 
(80% engineering departments, 16% support services departments and 4% environmental department). The change 
initiative implemented focused on improving the systems within the organisation to improve efficiencies, reduce 
time and costs, but not compromising on quality. 
A problem identified within the case organisation was the low response rate to change readiness surveys by 
employees of the engineering departments (21.6 % response rate). As engineering employees make up 80 % of the 
employees, it was recognised that this was a problem. The neglect to respond to the surveys may have meant that 
these employees were resisting the change. If the rest of the engineering department employees responded, scores 
could have been lower than the positive scores and could have affected the change readiness results. A need to 
identify the factors which cause resistance and how to manage them was identified. The objective of this research 
was to identify and understand the main reasons that contribute to resistance of organisational change by 
engineering employees. Knowing the factors would assist management in reducing resistance during future changes.

Table 4 gives the steps or gaps in some of the steps that the case organisation should ensure is carried out during 
future changes. 
Table 4: Steps to Carry out During Future Changes 
Literature Findings 
Case Organisation Steps 
The need for change is 
identified and understood 
This needs to be better communicated to employees 
Awareness of the change 
should be created 
This should be done regularly to create a sense of urgency 
A change manager is 
selected and a change team 
is created 
The change team should consist of more middle or junior employees 
Create a clear vision and 
common direction 
- 
Create an implementation 
plan 
Develop a plan to guide employees on what, when and how to reach the change 
goals. The plan should assist to manage factors likely to affect the success of the 
change 
Develop enabling structures 
A rewarding system was put in place to reward employees who perform well 
under the change. Training programs and workshops should be held regularly to 
provide employees with knowledge and ability for their new responsibilities. 
Obstacles that may undermine the vision should be identified and eliminated or 
managed appropriately (such as employee resistance). 
Communicate effectively 
throughout the change 
process 
Communicate openly, more regularly and honestly. Communication should not be 
done in a top-down fashion. 
Encourage participation 
Involve employees in the change process to assist in building trust between 
management and employees and to create a desire to change. 
Handle emotional and power 
issues 
Employee resistance should be identified and managed. Trust between employees 
and managers should also be managed. 
Reinforce the change 
Reinforce the new change culture by incorporating it into the daily activities of 
the organisation. 
Monitoring and feedback 
More feedback should be given to employees 
 
Resistance, although perceived as a negative force, has a positive purpose as it forces managers to assess the 
proposed change or the way in which it is being managed (Coetsee, Summer, 1999). Understanding the factors that 
cause resistance can assist in the creation of a set of change management steps to assist employees in accepting the 
change (Yue, 2008). Successful organisational change is not only due to strategic planning and implementation but 
also due to employees accepting and being committed to the new change (Zakaria & Yusof, 2001). When employees 
trust management, change initiatives tend to be more successful (Rousseau & Tijoriwala, 1999). Change 
management focused on employees can assist organisations in implementing successful change initiatives (Chawla 
& Kelloway, 2004). Some managers may completely ignore the fact that there is resistance or simply label employee 
concerns about the change as resistance in an attempt to dismiss the concerns as potentially valid (Piderit, 2000). 
Resistance to organisational change will always remain a challenging issue due to the diversity of employees. 
Therefore, similar studies should be carried out in various organisations implementing different organisational 
changes to identify these unique factors and to find appropriate change management steps to manage them.

Abstract 
 
Objective: This study research analyses the challenges faced by the Burundian economy from 
entrepreneurial perspective and proposed a way forward to deal with the above challenges.  
 
Design/methodology/approach: In order to conduct the research, a qualitative and 
quantitative study was conducted. It consists of a thorough literature review focusing on 
entrepreneurship in Burundi and economic performance of the country. Further, a survey of 
25 of individuals acquainted with the issues of economic empowerment and entrepreneurship 
in Burundi was conducted. 
 
Findings: The results show that  the usual economic factors determining growth in Burundi 
are endogenous to political objectives, suggesting that politics explains the dismal 
performance of the Burundian economy. This finding limits the relevance of textbook models 
of growth relying on the assumption of a competitive resource allocation environment in a 
country or region.  
 
Originality: Previous researches were focusing lonely on the failure of the economic 
performance and entrepreneurship of Burundi.  Rather, this study links both variables, and 
look at the importance of the development of sustainable entrepreneurship through reverse 
economic policies.   
 
Recommendations: The study recommends that qualified managers rather than politicians’ 
cronies must run the economy, with priority being given to investment projects in the country. 
The study also recommends that the economic performance will not improve unless the 
political system is modernised from a more open and accountable regime. Finally, the study 
highlights that the Burundian economic growth failure can be reversed if some structural 
problems are adjusted and bottom of the pyramid strategies are identifies and implemented.

Abstract 
 
In this paper sawmill dust bonded with polystyrene waste as the binder are being considered in producing 
wall panels that would exhibit improved physical and mechanical properties. A measured volume of 
polystyrene waste binder was mixed with a known quantity of sawmill dust to produce sawmill-dust-
polystyrene composite. Test specimens were then produced from the various composites which were used 
to perform flexural, tensile and water absorption tests. The samples were left to cure in room temperature 
for 12 days and 28 days. The results obtained showed that the composition of 60% sawdust 40% polystyrene 
slurry was the optimum composition yielding the highest tensile and flexural strength, with desirable water 
absorption properties when compared to some of the manufactured wood samples (particle Board and 
Plywood). It was also noted that the strength of the composite increased with curing time. Therefore, the 
use of Sawmill dust bonded with polystyrene waste adhesive introduces a sustainable approach on reducing 
pollution caused by sawdust and polystyrene wastes.",,,african 2018

Abstract 
The performance of the South African construction industry is a major cause of concern in the country. 
This study investigates the factors influencing the performance of the construction industry. Primary data 
was obtained through the questionnaire survey which was distributed to professionals in the construction 
industry. Quantitative method was adopted whereby a total of 50 survey questionnaires were distributed, 
however only 35 questionnaires were returned which gave a response rate of 70%. To analyse Statistical 
Packages of Social Sciences was used for the study. The value for the internal consistency and reliability 
of the research instrument was 0.866.  The study revealed significant factors affecting the performance of 
the construction industry as; Instability/escalation of construction material prices, project cost overruns, 
backlogs of payment to contractors, material and equipment and inefficient funding of construction projects. 
The study contributes to the body of knowledge in relation to what influences the performance of the 
construction industry. It is evident that economic growth, regulatory bodies, skills and training programs 
influences the performance of the construction industry in South Africa. Therefore, an increase in 
infrastructure investment and firm regulatory implementation measures by CIDB can accelerate the 
economic growth and improve the performance of the construction industry.

1. Introduction
The construction industry renders a vital role in the economic growth of developing countries. This is seen through 
the production of much needed infrastructure that is required for development and growth of the economy, 
construction productivity as well as the wellbeing of the citizens (Dlamini, 2012:1). Ramachandra, Olabode and 
Rotimi (2009:1) similarly shares that the construction industry contributes significantly in the growth of the South 
African economy, as it produces  infrastructure that is required for the development of other productive activities in 
the country. The growth of any economy is measured by the rate of physical infrastructure development such as roads, 
bridges, harbours and buildings 
Therefore the construction industry has a potential to bridge inequality in the country by generating employment and 
opportunities for jobs to skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled work force. Stats SA (2014) states that, the construction 
industry creates employment to more than 1.4 million people all over the country, it helps the formal and informal 
sectors to generate income and contribute to the growth of the economy by creating employment. The driving force 
behind the government investing more in infrastructure development is to help eradicate poverty in the country, reduce 
unemployment and to achieve high economic growth (Mosenogi, 2011:1).

Development of an Entrepreneurial Small Business’ Strategic Plan by 
Shortened Systematic Strategic Planning (SSP) – Case Study

Abstract 
 
As many sources exhort managers to “think strategically,” only a few addresses how to make this happen. Where strategic 
analysis tools are explained, this is most frequently done conceptually rather than their actual application in strategic 
planning. Shortened systematic strategic planning (SSP) consists of a pattern of step-wise procedure for straight-forward 
planning, and the fundamentals involved in any strategic planning project. The use of shortened SSP is more suitable for 
the development of strategic plans for small- and medium-size businesses (SMEs). The intention here is to provide a new 
perspective and benefit for the strategic planners by introducing this new systematic methodology and demonstrating its 
implementation on an entrepreneurial and new business called CGA Tech. Accordingly, let shortened version of SSP easily 
understood and universally applied to any small- and medium-size businesses. The data that are used in this case are 
fictitious and only help for this study. Though, the given case does not cover all the sections of a typical strategic plan and 
use all the recommended techniques, it still reflects the basics.

Abstract 
This research study was undertaken to implement and adjudge the efficacy of Total Productive 
Maintenance at case study organization which is public utility oil firm. The study utilized both 
quantitative and qualitative methodologies, periodic plant visits and a Maintenance Department 
Analysis (MDA) tool for benchmarking and reviewing the company’s maintenance status at one 
of their major depot facility major. The average score from the MDA obtained was 2.3 and 
showed potential areas to be improved when formulating the TPM strategy for the company. 
Other methods such as the ABC analysis for critical equipment identification were also used in 
this study, and key performance indicators data for calculating Availability Performance (AP) 
and Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) were identified as well. The OEE was found to be 
77% and a people focused model for TPM formulated with the purpose of increasing the OEE 
value to the target world class level of 85% as well as achieving the desired state.  
1. Introduction
Effective maintenance and asset management are a high leverage contributor to business profitability, through it 
impact on critical areas such as; safety, product quality, equipment capacity, health and the environment, and also 
the cost of production (Bentley, 2016). Maintenance is defined as all actions appropriate for retaining equipment in, 
or restoring it to, a given condition (Dhillon, 2002). The company has for been using two main maintenance 
strategies - breakdown maintenance  and preventive maintenance, which however have not been effective enough as 
equipment failures are rapid and instantaneous leading to a much lower productivity than expected. TPM is not only 
a modern maintenance practice but also a system (culture) that takes advantage of the abilities and skills of 
individuals in an organization in order to attain maintenance effectiveness thus keeping costs as low as possible 
while improving equipment and machine efficiency. Currently, most of the plant equipment failures are attended by 
external vendors which are proving to be very costly. TPM is a modern maintenance technique which suits well an 
environment with automation and technological advancements, and since its pillar approach includes employee 
training, this calls for multi-skilled and revitalized employees who will not only be involved in plant maintenance 
but also have knowledge as to why they are doing so. If TPM is well implemented, equipment operates without 
breakdowns, everyone’s work is easier, and the company is more profitable, and working conditions are improved. 
2. Justification
In today’s world of vast technological advancements, a great number of companies regardless of how much 
productivity and profits made in previous years, there is still need to be better and to reach maximum potential, as 
their survival depends on how they rapidly innovate and improve. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) is part of 
the benchmarking efforts seen or identified as the best in class manufacturing improvement process and is defined

staff needs to further develop their knowledge of Autonomous maintenance and the maintenance staff must be 
offered the opportunity to develop greater expertise that might be expected of them. Education and knowledge is a 
basis in order to perform continuous improvement programs. Train leaders together and have them share 
information with group members. For machine reliability; for the same value of t (time since last failure) which is a 
fixed value, a decrease in downtime means MTBF is increased, this in turn will reduce the failure rate (λ)as they are 
inversely related, thus an increase in machine reliability. The critical equipment will now perform for a much longer 
time without failing. Machine reliability is however very low and it averages 44% for the critical equipment at fuel 
depot i.e. there is a 44% chance that every critical equipment will function as intended without failing .The average 
values are presented as follows: 
MTBF (hours/week) 
 
 
156.25 
Machine Downtime (hours/year) 
 
35.55 
Machine Reliability 
 
 
44% 
Machine Availability 
 
 
99.39% 
Plant Downtime (hours/week) 
 
15.36 
Plant OEE 
 
 
 
77.62% 
Hence the case study firm has an acceptable OEE value of range 75-85% but can be upped through adoption of  
TPM. The study carried out at the depot showed that a decrease of 50% in the average downtime increases the plant 
OEE values by approximately 10% i.e. to world class level. By implementing TPM, all above areas are targeted and 
improved hence downtime is largely reduced. The expected results are compared to the existing results obtained 
through research (case study). 
 
8. Conclusion 
The purpose for this research was to formulate a TPM strategy which best suits the petroleum handling case study 
firm, and then adjudge its efficacy by considering one of its branches (depots) as a working station representing the 
company as a whole. By lowering the scope on one depot instead of five, the idea was to minimize the timeframe 
and the workload on the research part. A case study was carried out and the maintenance system analyzed through 
an MDA questionnaire obtained from other TPM studies on similar industries across the globe. The MDA score was 
found to be 2.3 on scale of 1-4, which when compared with other companies such it is a fair score (Gustav 
Fredriksson, Hanna Larsson, 2012). After analyzing the maintenance department at the case study firm, the weak 
and strong areas which showed that the company has a great potential for improvement were identified especially in 
the areas such as Reliability engineering, Maintenance Work orders, Operator maintenance, CMMS and Financial 
Planning. The critical equipment was also identified through the use of the ABC classification model and analyzed 
for Availability Performance and Overall Equipment Effectiveness of which the results were as follows. 
 
Figure 6.Plant Status (Before and After TPM) 
This analysis will help in the detailed formulation of the TPM strategy in future for setting goals and targets aimed 
at improving the maintenance organization for the company, since this research only introduced a typical framework 
of how the TPM strategy should be.

The underlying factor in drawing a conclusion towards the achieving of world class level (85% - 90%) is that; the 
current OEE value of 77% means there is room for improvement through application of modern techniques such as 
TPM as shown through case studies done by experts such as Mr. Nakajima in the field of maintenance. The 
proposed strategy and timeframe for project implementation can be improved once the management staff discusses 
the strategy in detail as this was just a guideline as to how the implementation process can be carried out.

Abstract 
Small scale rural community engagement projects which are conducted by engineers fail on occasions as 
a result of a range of factors such as poor management, a lack of monitoring and evaluation and most 
importantly, not taking into account social elements. A structured approach on conducting small scale 
rural community engagement projects is hypothesized in this paper as a solution to improve the success of 
small scale rural community engagement projects. The paper shows the design of a Systems Engineering 
framework for the conducting of small scale rural community engagement projects, incorporating social 
elements and verification procedures to assess the strengths and weaknesses of such projects which could 
assist in ensuring project success. The framework was applied to a case study and validated on an 
applicable rural community - based project. An impact assessment was conducted and data analyzed 
statistically, proved the validity of the framework through means of measuring indicators. The impact 
assessment revealed that further work was required in the area of maintenance and knowledge transfer but 
was successful in meeting the needs of the community and dealing with social issues while the framework 
was being applied to the community-based project, Gwakwani.

1. Introduction
Community engagement is said to be an effective tool in realising projects that appeal to a specific group of people 
whom are either affiliated by geographic proximity, special interest or are affected by similar issues affecting the 
well-being of those people [1]. Through participation with communities, community engagement provides a 
platform for on-going discussions between community members regarding their concerns. Different groups of 
people with different cultural backgrounds are provided a chance to feel empowered through integrating knowledge 
and opinions with each other in order to address a common concern. Research shows that community engagement 
allows for the creation of local networks of community members as well as external stakeholders through 
broadening the base of support in order to put various stakeholders in touch with each other [2][3].  
Engineers are increasingly being encouraged to serve the public and consider the societal implications of their work 
[4][5]. However, the standard “hard” engineering approaches to problem-solving frequently ignore the social aspects 
of engineering as engineers are said to be intensely uncomfortable of undertaking social projects [6][7]. Such 
processes tend to transfer process control from the engineer to the layperson. Social gaps may have negative effects 
on this community engagement projects and therefore lead to failure [8]. Not involving communities in project 
development can have serious long-term negative impacts on a community’s economic, environmental and social 
outcomes [9]. Establishing dialogue and building strong and genuine relationships with local communities and other 
stakeholders is recognised as a vital part of any project [10]. Incorporating social aspects and community 
participation into a community engagement project management model may bridge this gap of social inexperience 
of many engineers and project managers of today.

second strongest indicator was the “installation and social issues”. This indicator looked at the method of installation 
and the manner in which social activities were conducted, such as community meetings and negotiations. The 
community was satisfied with the method of installation from the planning to the performing of the implementation. 
The community also expressed satisfaction in the manner in which community issues were dealt with, from the 
engaging with cultural customs to the community being informed of each stage of the project within the project 
process. The negative result in this indicator was that one of the community members felt uninformed of intentions 
of the project and this may have been attributed to perhaps the absence of the community member during the 
implementation phase or the community member may have been new to the village.  
 
The third strongest indicator was the “system technical evaluation”. This indicator assessed the technical 
performance of the system. The community expressed that since the installation there had been no technical issues 
however, the community felt the system did not function any time after 23h00 if used from 18h00 the same evening. 
Results found here could be attributed to poor communication from the project team to the community in stating that 
the system was not capable of providing continuous electricity due to the system’s specifications and that the back-
up unit can only last for a few hours. The system had been designed to use solar energy during the day and the 
battery back-up unit in the evening. The weakest category was the “Maintenance and knowledge transfer category”. 
This indicator revealed the community lacked the knowledge of whom to contact in the cases of technical issues, 
how to maintain the system itself and were not aware of the safety risks associated with the system. The community 
lacking knowledge regarding maintenance was attributed to an insufficient knowledge transfer from the project team 
to the community, which may have been due to the lack of multiple translators for communicating to each 
household, during the short duration of the implementation and that this was not accounted for during planning.  
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The developed framework aimed to aid in developing solutions to solve social issues between engineers and 
communities and in so doing achieve project success. A Systems Engineering framework was designed to ensure the 
social requirements were met during a typical small scale community engagement project (approached by engineers) 
and at the same time integrating the necessary stages of the engineering project life cycle. Together with the 
implementation of the framework into the community and a verification and validation stage of the case study, an 
accurate solution could be deduced. The framework covered a number of community engagements which allowed 
the project team to continuously interact with the community, encouraging the community to be a part of the 
development. The framework incorporated a standard technology design methodology but included a number of 
community processes. Social processes allowed the project team to feel a sense of responsibility and gain a better 
understanding of the community’s needs and the future plans intended. The work presented shows the design and 
implementation of a community engagement framework capable of increasing the chances of project success for 
engineers conducting community engagement projects, through the integration of multiple social processes into a 
common engineering life cycle process. Based on the findings from the case study, a number of recommendations 
could be made namely, project teams can conduct thorough community assessments in order to determine accurate 
user requirements and to also inform the community around maintenance and safety of the systems installed.

Abstract 
This article summarises some of the major findings and developments on global 2G biofuels’ research in a 
non-chronological order. This was done in order to give a highlight on some of the potential implications 
these findings could have on Southern Africa’s decision making processes, given its abundant 
lignocellulosic biomass resources and residues. Before specific feasibility studies can be made on a country-
to country basis, this overview can give a glimpse into some potential opportunities and hurdles for such 
waste-to-biofuels systems from a socio-economic perspective. The findings indicate that biofuels demand 
is increasing around the globe, and it is envisaged that 2nd generation (2G) biofuels will gain a larger market 
share compared to 1st generation (1G) due to their vast availability, limited interference with food security 
and ecological benefits. Southern Africa will have to take advantage of the abundance of biomass, 
especially lignocellulosic residues from forestry and agriculture and create room for the transfer of some 
promising, demonstrated or commercialised technologies. The largest opportunity for the 2G biofuels will 
be from waste feedstocks like crop and forest residues, organic fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW), 
black liquor and other wood process wastes. Issues of limited supply and associated conversion costs will 
have to be considered along with the supplementary options to determine the socio-economic sustainability 
of such waste-to-biofuels ventures. Lessons will have to be drawn from socio-economic shortcomings of 
2G biodiesel Jatropha projects to ascertain the viability of feedstock supply chains, right choice of 
conversion technologies and proper projection of potential socio-economic impacts.

1. Introduction
The global biofuels for the transport industry were projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 
44% from 2017-2021. This projected growth is driven by global oil insecurities, supportive government policies, a 
drive towards cleaner fuels and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and potential to drive regional economic 
growth and new jobs [1]. One distinct attractive feature about bio-fuels is that they can allay the dependence on 
politically and socially unstable international energy transactions from crude oil. As a result, bio-fuel policies are 
increasingly becoming popular; for instance, the US  and EU have recently adopted ambitious bio-fuel support 
policies, namely 60bn litres of 2G bio-fuel by 2022 and 10% renewable energy in the transport sector by 2020 
respectively. As biofuels demand increases, experts argue that 2G technologies for lignocellulosic biomass will

Vast availability of lignocellulosic biomass 
resources in Africa; with a greater percentage 
(>70%, except in RSA) being used in 
traditional cooking and heating schemes that 
are inefficient and pose a health hazard. 
Literature advocating for a shift from 
traditional to modern technologies- where the 
latter replace traditional as the case of 
conversion of biomass to ethanol gel which is 
at least 5 times cleaner & more efficient 
Technology transfer, as UNFCCC stamps, will be key; from 
developed nations to developing. There are likely to be FDI’s as 
was the case with Jatropha, especially where the feedstocks are 
sustainably available. A wider promotion of the use of ethanol 
gel in some nations will be required for mass uptake; more robust 
stoves and systems required. Means more ethanol production 
alternatives are required, especially where 1Gfeedstocks are 
already limited. 
Demonstrating viable feedstock supply 
chains will be critical to operate plants at 
required scales. [6] 
There is need for research to quantify feedstocks and develop 
viable, optimal supply chain models so that when companies are 
ready to transfer technology, there is groundwork information for 
the research. 
Demonstrating potential value chains and 
socio-economic impacts will be critical to 
avoid presumptions as in the case of Jatropha 
Since Africa was on the receiving end in the Jatropha cases, 
greater caution will be taken when accepting proposals for 2G 
lignocellulosic biomass. 
Potential competition of CHP with Biofuels 
initiatives for, especially, woody 
lignocellulosics 
There is a significant amount of energy poverty in southern 
Africa; therefore a proper cost-benefit comparative analysis 
should be carried out to evaluate which alternative could offer 
the most socio-economic and ecological benefits. 
Consuming waste residues and making use of 
abandoned land (especially for energy crops) 
has considerable potential to ‘promote rural 
development and improve economic 
conditions in emerging and developing 
regions’[1] 
This strong hypothesis still has to be proven in these regions. 
Emerging and developing nations have not participated much in 
the high profile technical R&D around the 2G technologies, due 
to the intensive financial requirements. However, feasibility 
studies can still be done to demonstrate supply and value chain 
viability and project socio-economic impacts. 
Insufficient policy landscape for southern 
African nations as most biofuel policies have 
not been finalised 
Since this field is capital intensive, investors have to be confident 
that the policies will be supportive. A clear, robust, supportive 
framework would liberate all stakeholder - including farmers, 
timber industry, fuel gel industry- to plan and invest at various 
points of the biofuel supply chain 
 
Conclusion 
Research and development in 2G biofuels is steadily gathering momentum; more recent forecasts already predict that 
they should occupy at least 18% of all biofuels by 2035 [6]. Older forecasts had predicted that first and second 
generation biofuels would have a 50/50 share by 2022 [41], however supply chain viability and technological setbacks 
slowed down the pace for demonstrating the sustainability of 2G biofuel production.  The past 5 years, however, have 
shown fast rising interest in this research area (Fig 1), supported by the rate at which demonstration and 
commercialization projects have sprung up. Cellulosic ethanol commercial production tripled between 2009-2012, 
while HVO quickly clinched 2.4% of biofuels production since its launch in 2008 [6]. Companies like Lanza Tech 
and Ineos Bio have launched demonstration plants for the fermentation of syngas using a mixture of residues and 
industrial waste gases as feedstock, with promising results [8]. Although Jatropha disappointed in some cases, the 
energy and momentum has encouraged further research and helped characterize what should form a part of feasibility 
studies for 2G biofuel ventures [33]. Given all such developments, the landscape for 2G biofuels development is 
becoming brighter and the R&D output can now better guide policies and decision making going into the future.

Abstract 
Total quality management principles stress the role of supplier evaluation as a pivotal component of 
ensuring product or service quality. It is the task of the procurement function to evaluate different suppliers 
and to select the supplier that will provide good quality product/service at a reasonable price. In the public 
sector, the supplier selection process is more complicated as there are regulations and legislative 
frameworks that need to be adhered to. In the South African public procurement system, multiple sourcing 
through the tendering system, is utilised. Potential suppliers are invited to bid for contracts and get evaluated 
based on set criteria. The Preferential Procurement Policy Framework provides guidelines for the criteria 
to be used in adjudicating public tenders. Quality/Functionality is part of the set criteria. There are various 
methodologies used to assess functionality in public tenders and all those methodologies have their own 
advantages and disadvantages. Using document analysis, this paper will assess how functionality is utilised 
and assessed in the South African public procurement regime to determine winning bids. Public tender 
notice documents were reviewed, and thematic analyses of the data carried out and presented. The results 
of the study can be used to determine the effectiveness of these methodologies in the management of quality 
in South African public institutions

1. Introduction
Supplier selection forms an integral part of total quality management in organisations based on the concept of what 
you put in is what you get out. High quality process inputs produce high quality results/outputs. This makes the 
procurement function a vital cog in the management of quality within organisations. The statement is also true for 
public/state entities. Public entities must purchase goods/services that would ensure that the integrity of the services 
that they must deliver to the country is not compromised. Ambe and Weiss, (2012) define public procurement as the 
function whereby public sector organisations purchase goods and services from suppliers, subject to the general 
principles of fairness, equitability, transparency, competitiveness and cost-effectiveness. In many countries, public 
procurement is also utilised to support government’s social and political programs. To this effect, government policies 
therefore formulates frameworks on how public procurement should be conducted. This adds another dimension to 
the already complex nature of supplier selection in procurement. Liu and Hai, (2005) promulgate that supplier 
selection is difficult to manage because the performances of suppliers are varied based on each criterion and in the 
public sector, regulations on the criteria to be followed when evaluating suppliers is determined by government 
policies. To address the general principles mentioned above, the public procurement system of South Africa utilises 
the tendering system. Bids are solicited from potential suppliers and those bids are scored using a set criterion to 
determine the winning bid. Preferential Procurement Policy Framework Act (PPPFA) managed by Supply Chain 
Management (SCM) maps out the criteria for the adjudication of public tenders.

highest score through the preferential points system, demonstrates a superior ability to provide the relevant goods or 
services. The ambiguous nature of the regulations made it difficult judge whether the third category found in literature 
(Using quality at the awarding stage) should be created. The PPPF Act, before the Rainbow Civils court challenge, 
had made it mandatory to assess quality at the prequalification stage effectively eliminating the last category from 
those found in literature. This provides the explanation why the majority of tenders evaluated score quality at the 
prequalification stage. 
 
The specification of applicable standards is also a form of prequalification as a tenderer either has to produce the 
required certification or prove, through documentation, compliance to the applicable standards. The major difference 
is that certification or compliance to the specified standard is assessed together with the rest of the requested 
documents. Not satisfying those requirements does not lead to the bid not being assessed but contribute to overall 
score. The methods of using bids can only indicate that the suppliers can deliver the required product or service but 
cannot ensure that the final product or service is of the required quality or standard. TQM principles require more 
stringent supplier selection methods. This coupled with the ambiguity in the framework necessitates the need for a 
better system of evaluating suppliers and managing quality in public procurement.  One major criticism of using 
prequalification methods to evaluate bids, is that it leads to gate-keeping (van Blerk, 2012) especially when the factors 
evaluated at prequalification stage play no further role in adjudicating the bid. The evaluation of bids through 
prequalification gives larger corporates an advantage over smaller or start up companies which goes against the 
principle of fairness stated in the regulations.

Abstract 
Boiler tube failures occur in steam generation boilers due to subcritical Short Term Overheating (STO). In 
general, sub-critical STO occurs when design parameters are often marginally and critically discounted. 
This leads to frequent failures of the boiler tubes that affect the sustainability of power generation. A 
commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software, ANSYS Fluent 19.0® (Multiphase flow), 
was used to successfully analyze the locations where the phase boundary of energy transfer on the tube 
material occurs. A number of heat transfer velocity parameter changes were numerically analyzed to

1. Introduction
Tube failures occur in new and old units; in units that cycle and those that operate under baseload conditions; in 
supercritical, once-through, and drum units; and in units burning every sort of combustible material (Martin, 2009). 
In conventional and combined-cycle plants, boiler tube failures (BTFs) have been the main cause of plants 
unavailability for as long as reliable statistics have been kept for each generating source. Tube failures emanate from 
poor initial design, poor operation and maintenance, harsh fireside and cycle chemistry environments, and lack of 
management support for comprehensive reduction programs. Most BTFs are repeat failures, indicating that return to 
service of a unit has historically been more important than understanding the failure (Martin, 2009). 
If there are no breakdowns from the original design conditions, water-touched tubes (such as waterwalls and 
economizers in conventional boilers) are designed for, and should have, essentially infinite life. The case for steam-
touched tubes, such as in the superheater (SH) and reheater (RH) sections of modern boilers, is somewhat different 
because of the inevitability of creep-limited lifetime, although lifetimes well in excess of 200,000 operating hours are 
achievable (Dooly & McNaughton, 2007). 
In almost all cases of serious unavailability or performance losses, the problems are usually repetitive in nature and 
result in multiple forced outages. A repeat tube failure is defined as multiple failures in the same boiler circuit from 
the same mechanism and root cause. Without a proper understanding of the mechanism of failure, the root cause, the

increases at the upper peripheral. There is a sharp spike in temperature, and the position’s vapor fraction indicates a 
small complete dry-out position. 
 
To conserve the boiler tubing and increase the service life thereof, it is obvious that a higher bulk flow velocity would 
be recommended through the horizontal sections of the boiler tubing. The average wall temperature at the upper wall 
is much lower than that noted of the 3m/s and 5m/s flow velocities. These tubes are still riser tubes within the furnace, 
and due to the saturated steam and water separation with the aid of cyclone separators/scrubbers within the steam 
drum, it is thus only a small portion of the riser tubing bulk mass which would be entering the steam drum at a lower 
temperature. For the case study boiler, these hanger tubes with horizontal sections above the furnace, account for 3.7% 
of the total riser volume. 
 
By further material sensitivity analysis, remaining useful life studies were performed. At 943K immediate failure 
would occur if the tube was new. This is based on the assumption that for the thin tube wall thickness, the mean tube 
temperature would be very close to the domains wall temperature. At 3m/s, tube failure would occur around 40000 
hours. At 5m/s failure would occur at just below 10000 hours. 10m/s flow will result in failure well below 10000 
hours operation. All failures occur below the A1 line as per Figure 1, and would thus be categorized as sub-critical 
Short Term Overheating failures.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
With an increase in fluid temperature within the flow domain, it is clear that heat transfer increases within the fluid as 
velocity increases. It would be clear that point of low to no water (liquid) fraction would result in heat not being taken 
away from the tube wall directly related to the domain position, as water has a higher heat transfer capacity compared 
to that of water (vapor) with most points being at superheat. With lower heat flux input, longer lengths of tube can be 
utilized in applications without the risk of short tube life. Analysis is fairly comparable with published literature, and 
previous works, but would require additional tests at various heat fluxes and velocities to be able to scrutinize critical 
velocities against certain temperatures. The flow maps noted are similar in nature to that of works published by LiLi 
et al (2012) and Yu et al (2013) indicating bubble generation moving to the upper wall of the tube, with the bulk mass 
flow being moved to the bottom of the tube, with a near-perfect turbulent flow regime. This analysis indicates how 
critical maximum flow velocities have effect on the heat transfer coefficients with a flow domain, with turbulent flow 
instability having great effect on the material wall temperatures. Horizontal boiler tubing are at higher risk that vertical 
tubing for steam blanketing/ departure from nucleate boiling, due to the effects of buoyancy on the steam bubble 
generation. A higher degree of tube temperature and internal flow dynamics is required to ensure safe operation of the 
boiler tubing. Installation of thermocouples on the horizontal boiler tubing will indicate real-time tube wall 
temperatures, which in turn would provide data to accurately predict remaining useful life of the tubing during 
excursions. This can be linked to a master fuel trip, or boiler de-loading logic when or if tube wall temperatures are 
increasing out of its reliable operating window. This will allow for root cause analysis to be performed for system 
upsets, without further exposing the tubes to this out-of-design operating temperatures. Tubing should also be fitted 
with orifices specifically sized to give the most optimal fluid velocities across the wide range of flow requirements 
for the boiler outputs as required by the turbine. The higher the steam demand at the turbine, the higher the heat input 
and flow rate requirements within the boiler. Heat input can be drastically optimized to ensure that only the required 
amount for the steam generation is required. Soot cleaning within the furnace allows for higher heat intake within the 
lower furnace regions at the vertical walls, which would in turn, reduce the amount of heat the horizontal tubes above 
the furnace are exposed to. Burner alignment should also be optimized to decrease the likelihood of direct flame 
impingement on tubing which could reduce the cooling abilities of a specific section of tubing within the flow loop.

Abstract 
Within the past 12 years in Ondo State, Nigeria, three different percentages (60%, 50% and 30%) of 
the contract sum have been adopted as advance payment (AP) for construction contractors. This paper 
therefore investigated the sustainability of AP to construction project based on the survey of 127 
respondents. The data used were collected via questionnaire with high reliability values of 0.830 and 
0.780. The results of the study revealed that advance payment had positive and significant effects on 
the contractors’ net cash flows including cost and time performance of projects thereby implying AP’s 
sustainability. It is hereby recommended that the clients and consultants should continue the usage of 
advance payment on construction projects as it has solved the financial problem of contractors while 
the current government policy of 30 percent of the contract sum as AP should be maintained because 
majority of the contractors have cash surplus at an average of 28 percent of the contract sum. Also 
advance repayment deduction should be made to span through the contract duration or when the 
actual performance on site reaches 85% as against the contractual provision for four equal installment 
repayments of 25%. Lastly, the contractors should be made to stock-pile materials that are susceptible 
to price fluctuation immediately the contract is signed and AP granted.

1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Construction projects are classically defined by the need to complete a task on time, to budget, and with 
appropriate technical performance (Williams, 2001). According to Oyetunji and Anderson (2006), project 
delivery systems also define the roles and responsibilities of the parties in a project and establish an execution 
framework in terms of sequencing of design, procurement, and construction. From stakeholders’ perspective, 
construction projects require functional and effective payment systems for them to be accomplished. Payment 
therefore should be seen as a vehicle for achieving good financial performance of construction projects as well 
as their completion to time. When prompt payment fails to take place the project would experience delay. A 
number of payment methods associated with construction projects such as the open-book accounting, stage 
payments, incentive contracting, direct payment, trust accounts/funds, mobilisation advance payment and the 
mechanic’s lien have been shown to be versatile and useful in different project situations (Motawa and Kaka, 
2008). Some of the commonly used payment methods in construction projects in Nigeria include stage payment, 
direct payment, interim payment and advance payment (AP), however each of the payment methods have some 
inherent importance and usefulness. 
According to Potts (1988) and Cheetham, Lewis and Jones (1995), a stage payment system reduces 
administrative time and cost to prepare interim payments and allows the responsible project personnel to be 
engaged in more productive project activities. Incentive payments are often employed with disincentives so as to 
instil efficient contract arrangement and to reward the successful contractors who are fully motivated so as to 
achieve the client objectives with high performance standards (Arditi and Yasamis, 1998; and Bubshait, 2003). 
Clough and Sears (1994) stated that a direct payment method allows subcontractors and suppliers to be paid 
promptly and in full which should result in lower prices, better performance and faster completion. Trust 
accounts and mechanic liens could be set up to protect and compensate the project participants who have 
invested in the project against a client or main contractor going out of business and/or not fulfilling their 
payment commitment (Clough and Sears, 1994; and Latham, 1994). Abeysekera (2002) explained that projects’

CONCLUSIONS 
The study has been able to identify the most important reasons justifying the sustainability of the use of advance 
payment in construction projects. The results provided information to clients, consultants and contractors on the 
effects of advance payment on the contractor’s cash flow; particularly in terms of AP’s positive and significant 
effects on the contractors’ net cash flows thereby solving the financial problem of the contractor. It has also 
established that advance payment impacts significantly on the cost and time performance of construction projects in 
Ondo State.  
 
Construction clients and consultants involved in project planning and execution should ensure that relevant 
needs/uses for advance payment as discovered through this study are considered in the implementation of advance 
payment policy and included in the contract while the contractors should also be made to comply with the 
needs/uses so stated in their contracts.  
 
It was discovered that the need to assist the contractor in stock-piling materials required for the project is the second 
most important factor supporting the need/use for advance payment, the client and consultant should endeavour to 
ascertain the relevant materials that are susceptible to price fluctuation which would be handed over to the contractor 
as part of the utilization of the advance payment immediately the contract is signed. This would assist in monitoring 
the use of the fund. 
 
The study further revealed that advance payment has positive impact on the contractor’s cash flow, and cost and 
time performance of construction projects; thereby corroborating the fact that advance payment solves the financial 
problem of contractors. Therefore, clients and consultants should continue to use advance payment in their 
construction projects. 
 
The study showed that majority of the contractors have cash surplus (positive cash flow) at an average of 28 percent 
of the contract sum granted them as advance payment which is a confirmation of the adequacy, sufficiency and 
sustainability of the current government policy of 30 percent of the contract sum as advance payment in the state. 
This policy should be continued and maintained in all public construction projects in the state. 
 
The study revealed that advance repayment (APR) has significant relationship with the contractor’s net cash flow. 
Therefore, advance repayment deduction should be made much more convenient by allowing it to span the contract 
duration or at best to be concluded when actual performance on site reaches 85% as against the contractual provision 
for deduction by four equal times of 25%. This would enhance the net cash flow of contractors; thereby assisting in 
solving the financial problem of contractors during construction process.

Abstract 
Having ‘solid ground’ to walk and stand upon is among the most fundamental workplace expectations in 
most environments. With certain notable exceptions, workers do not consciously assess each step to 
ensure that the surface they are walking upon is stable enough to support them. Rather, there is a 
subconscious assurance that workers experience when leaving ‘solid ground’ to walk on stairs, ladders, 
ramps, elevated structures, catwalks, grating, and covers, that the surface is designed and constructed in 
accordance with industry standards. This presentation discusses the removal and reinstallation of a section 
in a grated elevated catwalk, and what can happen when organizations do not recognize and adhere to the 
concept of System Integrity (SI) during routine and unplanned maintenance operations. It is paramount 
for supervisors and managers to have situational awareness during evolutions causing any system to be in 
other than a configuration it was initially designed for. Particular care must be taken to ensure new 
hazards are not introduced into the system inadvertently. These concepts are presented in a case study 
involving a workplace fatality.

Abstract 
Many analysis, correlation and forecast related to sea surface temperature (SST) or air temperature 
have been surveyed by researchers in the past. Temperature can affect many aspects in our daily life. In 
Hokkaido, where fishing industry is the largest among Japan’s fishing industry, SST can affect quantity 
and different types of species of fishes. Therefore, accurately knowing and anticipating the temperature 
can help fishermen to strategize their fishing plans better. 
In this paper, a forecast of monthly average sea surface temperature using seasonal ARIMA 
(Autoregressive Integration Moving Average) models in time series is performed. Many ARIMA models 
are derived and compared before arriving at a final appropriate and adequate model. After thorough 
analysis (i.e. identification, evaluation and validation) of various models, an appropriate and the best 
seasonal ARIMA model, which is ARIMA(2,0,1)(1,1,2)[12], is selected and recommended. 
Subsequently, the chosen seasonal ARIMA model is used to implement the forecast and the result of the 
forecast shows that the prediction is very accurate and the seasonal ARIMA(2,0,1)(1,1,2)[12] model is a 
very good model.

1. Introduction
Many research papers related to SST or air temperature have been published. Moreover, many statistical tools and
techniques are used to perform those analysis, correlation, prediction or forecast. Among those statistics tools and 
techniques, time series seems to be the most commonly used. The authors in [1] use time series to analyze the 
relationship between the temporal and spatial variabilities of SST in Japan Sea to atmosphere forcing. To investigate 
the source of rapid temperature increased in the air of Antarctic Peninsula, the authors use multiple regression and 
time series models [2]. The author in [3] uses a time series forecast method called SARIMA to forecast the monthly 
average air temperature in the Ashanti Region of Ghana. Also, time series is used in [4] to predict trend and 
seasonality of SST in southwest coast of Portugal as well as to observe cross-correlationship between upwelling 
indices and SST. Regression and time series analysis is used in [5] to examine the correlation between SST and wind 
speed in Greenland Sea, and to study how the SST and wind speed relate to NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) 
variability.  
In this paper, a time series forecast model called seasonal ARIMA model is used to forecast the monthly average 
SST of Hokkaido fishery ports along the coastal line of Japan Sea. The SST are collected by Japan Meteorological 
Agency which is the provider of the national weather service in Japan. Section II covers the general theories of the 
related topics and methods used in the forecast in this paper. It then follows by detail analysis of deriving an

Figure 6 below shows the forecast plot of the actual data from Jan 2009 to July 2016 and the test data from July 2013 
to July 2016. The blue solid line represents the forecast values and the black dotted line is the actual values of the time 
series. The shaded areas are the lower and the upper forecast confidence limits. 
It can be observed from Table 5 above that the actual values and the forecast values are very close to each other. 
Moreover, Figure 6 also displays that the two lines represent the actual and forecast values are almost coincide 
together and they are well within the confidence limits (except for the year 2014 where the February and March mean 
monthly temperatures are very much lower than the rest of other years’ February and March temperatures). Therefore, 
it can be concluded that the forecast is very accurate and reliable. Hence, this implies that the seasonal 
ARIMA(2,1,1)(0,1,1)[12] is a very good model.

5. Summary and Conclusion 
 
In summary, forecast of temperatures are common and have been conducted by many researchers in various 
disciplines and applications. Different researchers use different forecast models. To use ARIMA model to perform 
forecast, one must check for stationarity, seasonality and trend of a time series. If it is not stationarity, it has to be 
made stationary by applying some transformation techniques such as differencing, reciprocals or logs functions. If it 
is seasonal and has trend (up or down), it must be de-seasonalized using seasonal differencing and de-trend using

differencing. In this paper, the ACF plot of the time series and the ADF test are used to check for stationarity and 
found that the monthly mean SST time series is stationary. From the seasonal component of the time series 
decomposition plot shows that the series is seasonal and hence it is de-seasonalized using one seasonal differencing. 
The trend component does not show an obvious upward trend, so it is ignored at first place but then being 
reconsidered later. To identify the first appropriate ARIMA model, the ACF and PACF plots are used and the resulted 
in the ARIMA(2,0,2)(0,1,1)[12] model to be used as a guide for further estimation. Under model estimation and 
selection processes, more than 50 models with different combination of parameters (include some models with single 
differencing) are being used for comparison and selection. The model ARIMA(2,1,1)(0,1,1)[12] is selected as best 
overall model based on lowest BIC value and the better forecast accuracy. Then the model diagnostics process on the 
model selected shows that the model satisfies the white noise and normality assumptions, and hence indicates that the 
model is a good fit. Lastly, the model is used to forecast and predict the time series The forecast results shown in 
Table 5 and Figure 6 implies that ARIMA(2,1,1)(0,1,1)[12] is a very good model. 
In conclusion, it is not an easy task to derive a good and accurate model for the forecast. One has to have 
sufficient knowledge in statistics and time series in order to understand many underlying theories, concepts and 
applications in forecasting. Moreover, as the size of data are getting huge (i.e. Big data) nowadays and many 
candidate models need to be considered and compared, manually computations and graphing are near to impossible 
without utilizing software and faster computer. In this paper, R programming language is used in data preparation and 
model computations. Sometimes, there may be a few suitable models to be used for the forecast, but one has to take 
into the consideration of overfitting and the amount of computations needed. For example, if the 
ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q) model uses large values in p, d, q, P, D, Q, the computations will take longer time. Lastly, the 
recommended seasonal ARIMA(2,1,1)(0,1,1)[12] model should be a useful model to help fishing industry in 
Hokkaido to predict the sea surface temperature.

Abstract 
The research study looked at coming up with a cheaper design of a mealie-meal thick porridge agitator 
cooking process which could be used in commercial kitchens. The design was generated to handle the 
effective stirring as the porridge becomes thicker and becomes increasingly difficult to stir around. 
Agitator design concepts were generated and evaluated for suitability and robustness. A detailed design 
was undertaken to come up with a 200 litre capacity thick porridge agitator, which can reduce cooking 
time to 45 minutes after the boiling of the water. It has also to be fabricated and installed at a cost of less 
than USD5000. 
1. Introduction
In today’s modern kitchen different equipment has been designed with the aim to improve the process of cooking 
food (Taylay&Fransials,2004). In the region the preparation of thick mealie meal porridge has remained the same 
over the ages. The popular meal is mostly prepared manually though out a number of countries in Southern Africa. 
This has been observed to be a challenge when it comes to preparing the meal for a large numbers of people. At 
universities, hotels, boarding schools and hospitals in Zimbabwe, large volumes of thick porridge are consumed per 
day since it is the staple food. Regardless of the large consumption, the process is still done manually, and kitchen 
staff use long flat wooden poles to mix when preparing the thickened porridge. This type of work is usually done by 
men rather than women because a lot of upper body strength and stamina is required. As such cooks often take turns 
or use two poles to speed up the process of preparing the porridge. The conventional way of preparing thick porridge 
was found to be long, tedious and laborious and inadequately hygienic. Hence there is need to improve the quality 
and process of preparing thick porridge in an enclosed environment to minimise external contaminating factors for 
bulk food preparation. The design of a mechanical agitator would go a long way in assisting with the mixing and as 
it would reduce human effort required when preparing thick porridge particularly in a commercial set up 
environment. 
2. Justification
The agitator would continuously mix the mealie meal throughout the whole cooking process to achieve improved 
heat transfer and reduce inconsistency of the thick porridge within the container. Other than ensuring uniform 
consistency throughout the large pot, the agitator would create the required convenience in reducing meal 
preparation time for other pressing activities. This would be enabled by improved the heat transfer throughout the 
material contains as heat is evenly distributed from the top to the bottom of the pot. The entire process of preparing 
of thick porridge is done under a closed pot to avoid any contamination while cooking. A number of countries in the 
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region may be interested in using this agitator cooker design if it 
to be commercially available.

The cost of making the portable thick porridge cooker is USD1940. 
 
6. Recommendations 
The slider is used to allow for required mealie meal to be poured into the pot , as it is used as the closing and 
opening mechanism. Once the thick porridge is ready the lid is opened and the impeller is lifted from the kettle using 
a stirring wheel connected to the power screw. The impeller is separated from the muff coupling and is washed 
immediately. The stand which carries the agitator can be pushed to a secure corner or another kettle for cooking 
another pot. Although this design is keen to improve the preparation of thick porridge using a simplified cooker 
which is not necessarily automated, there is room for further development. This can be done on the stability of the 
stand when cooking,  this can be done by installing belts which runs from the back of the stand to the front of the 
kettle .This will ensure that the vibrations are reduced due to damping and also the unit is solid and stable. 
 
7. Conclusion 
The design study was based on the fluid mechanics theory, design principles to available agitators and cooking 
methods already being used in the commercial kitchens. It also took a look at the agitator components, mechanism 
and power sources in the design process. The use of the thick porridge agitator concept can be a valuable design and 
will go a long in savings on labour required and time taken in the preparation of the meal for public entities. Limited 
research has been conducted in improving the method of preparing thick porridge however with the help of this 
design there is hope that other designers can take up this challenge and manufacture a more efficient and cost 
effective thick porridge cooker.

Abstract 
In this work, loose biomass briquettes were produced using cow dung and cactus binders at various 
compaction pressures. Comparison is made of the briquettes produced using these binders with respect to 
their final bulk densities and moisture content. Yellow thatching grass, groundnut shells, sugar cane leaves, 
Mopani leaves and combinations recipe were used for briquetting. The objective was to identify a natural 
binder, which produces the best quality loose biomass briquettes. Results show alternating improvements 
between lower and higher compaction pressures on bulk densities. Briquettes with cow dung binder showed 
a good bulk density increment from low to high compaction pressures. At 6MPa, combined recipe had a 
density of 0.305 kg/m3, 0.333 kg/m3 at 12 MPa and 0.386 kg/m3 at 19 MPa. The lowest bulk density was 
for yellow thatching grass under 6 MPa compaction pressure but with a good increment on bulk density 
ranging from 0.236 kg/m3 at 6 MPa, 0.256 kg/m3 at 12 MPa and 0.285 kg/m3 at 19 MPa. Cactus briquettes 
were found to be insensitive to compaction pressure while pressure was found to be a critical parameter in 
producing quality briquettes when using cow dung binder. Cactus bonded briquettes achieved the highest 
bulk density of 0.375 kg/m3 on combination recipe and a maximum energy content of 16.49 MJ/kg.

Introduction
Briquettes produced from agricultural and forestry residues present a good strategic waste management protocol, 
especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Conversion processes and methods deployed improve the energy supply, they are 
eco-friendly and protect the environment from pollution that result in adverse effect on climate change. Production 
processes do not involve chemicals for achieving good bonding. In many cases, lignin can act as natural binder 
(Khodiyar,1994). During briquetting, certain and process and technologies parameters must be controlled to achieve 
good quality briquettes. The technological parameters include particle size, moisture content, compaction pressure 
and pressing temperatures. In the work of (Krizan,2014), the effect of compaction pressure on briquetting of pine and 
oak sawdust was investigated. By varying pressure from a minimum of 31 MPa to a maximum of 254 MPa, they 
showed that briquette density depended on compaction pressure. Higher pressures resulted in improved briquette 
quality and density. This work highlighted the importance of particle size and compaction pressure on briquette quality 
and density. In this work, lignin in the process material was used as binder hence species type can affect briquetting 
quality (Mitchual, 2013). 
In addition, some natural materials can also be blended with the process material to improve briquetting quality. 
Extensive investigations on blending materials and methods during the briquetting of various materials were 
conducted in India (Rajaseenivasan,2016). Neam powder was one such material that was blended with sawdust dust 
and briquetted at compaction pressures of 7 MPa for low compaction and 33 MPa at high compaction. The blending 
ratios in the range 100:0 to 0:100 by mass were considered. Briquettes with 100:0 blending yielded energy content of

During production, briquettes with cow dung binder were found to have a solid geometry without slump and respond 
to compaction pressures, changes in moisture loss during compaction was noticed. At low moisture content range of 
6 -12 MPa, briquettes weighed slightly higher and at highest compaction pressures of 19 MPa briquettes weighed less 
than the lower compaction pressures. The final surface finish was smooth, solid, does not stick to the mould and does 
not change shape after production or during drying. The samples of produced briquettes are shown by figure 7.

Cactus bonded briquettes were identified to be insensitive to briquetting pressures. Compaction on all pressures of 6, 12 and 19 
MPa briquettes were found to be watery, sticky on moulds and deformed during mould release. An extra caution briquettes realising 
from mould showed a bit of achievement, but briquettes still deformed on releasing and on drying. This is due to a lot of retained 
moisture was extracted, the briquettes are very light in weight with a bit of honey comb characteristics on some briquettes such as 
yellow thatching grass. The final produced briquettes are shown by figure 8

Briquettes binder must be able maintain consistency during moisture and density analysis process. Cow dung 
briquettes were exceptionally able to maintain consistency during density measurement, volume measurement was 
maintained without height or width changes. Geometry forms a critical parameter during density measurement.

Conclusion 
Two types of briquettes produced using cow dung and cactus binders were compared for their performance. Factors 
such as density, moisture content, were monitored and compared. Briquettes made with cow dung binder found to 
perform better in all criteria with longer combustion time compared to cactus binders.  Compaction pressure was found 
to be a key parameter in the performance of cow dung briquettes. When the pressure increased, an improvement with 
respect to bulk density, energy content was achieved. During combustion, briquettes with highest improved bulk 
density and energy content combusted the longest at average of 200 minute with average burn rate of 0.5 g/min. ground 
nut shells, Mopani leaves and combined recipe with cow dung as a binder performed better that cactus bonded 
briquettes. Briquettes with cactus binder exhibited lowest bulk density. Lower bulk density on cactus briquettes might 
have influenced the final lower bulk density and calorific values.

Abstract 
The garment manufacturing industry is reported to be experiencing customer complains of misfit. 
Studies on this problem seem not to have provided solutions that satisfy customers and 
manufacturers of clothing. In this study, Customer Pairwise Fit matrix (CPF) was explored to group a 
given customers population for the purpose of garment sizing. A mathematical fit function expressed 
as Percentage Fit (PF) between pair of customers was developed, CPF matrix for a number of 
customers indicating the degree of fit between any pair of customers was derived. A grouping 
algorithm from literature was adapted with the CPF matrix to divide a given population of customers 
to garment sizes, and demonstrated using garment anthropometric data related to trousers of 100 
male potential customers in Nigeria. The results obtained for the PF between any pair of customers 
indicated 3 possible results of „no fit‟ (PF = 0.0%), „partial fit‟ (0.0% < PF <100%) and „perfect fit‟ 
(PF=100%). The outcome of the adapted algorithm to the 100 potential customers led to 19 set of 
customers but 18 sizes appeared to give the „best‟ possible fit of 99.31%. The procedure 
developed in this work may be useful for sizing of larger customer population and any garment 
type.

1.0 Introduction 
Production of garments in the past had been mainly based on Visit-the-Tailor hand-measurement-and-sew 
tailoring system. The approach is to satisfy the needs of an individual customer in one set-up. In the era of mass-
produced clothing, garment sizing is the method used to create ready-to-wear garments meant to fit a range of 
people in the population (Petrova and Ashdown, 2012). In order to sustain mass production and to assist 
manufacturers to meet customers‟ different sizes; sizing systems were introduced. A „size‟ for a clothing has 
specified measurements along certain dimensions and will fit perfectly a person with measurements equal to 
those on the specified size (Tryfos, 1986) 
Kolawole and Charles-Owaba (2011) observed that the desires of customers to have appropriate fit and the need 
for manufacturers of garment to meet diverse population have led many nations of the world to develop sizing 
system and this has attracted many research works. Some of such studies include (Ashdown, 1998; McCulloch, 
et al 1998; Gupta and Gangadhar, 2004; Hsu and Wang, 2005; Chung et al, 2007; Zheng et al, 2007; 
Bagherzadeh, et al, 2010; Hsiao, 2013; Yang et al, 2015) with different solution approaches.  
However, in spite of these efforts of developing garment sizing in relation to fit, getting a satisfactory sizing 
system has continued to be a challenge to researchers, manufacturers and customers. Hwang (2001) reported 
that most people have a problem with fit in the clothing that was available in the market place in one way or the 
other and argued that diverse and complexity in so many ways of human anthropometric dimensions might be 
responsible. Petrova and Ashdown (2012) suggested that the inadequacy of the sizing standards that is used in 
developing the system may have contributed. Lack of information on precise definition of the concept of 
garment fit may also be a factor. Another reason could be the means of developing garment sizing system which 
have generally relied on one or two control dimensions as the basis for obtaining sizes and use of aggregate loss 
between customers and developed prototype sizes to determine a suitable sizing system.  
Since fit has become an issue in garment sizing and manufacturing, it appears further studies are required. In 
this study, the concept of customers pairwise fit matrix (CPF) is proposed for the grouping of customers for

sizes are shown in Table 4 and for space limitations, results for all the sizes are summarised in Table 5. It may 
be seen that 18 sizes with overall sizing fit of 99.31% appears to be the best possible number of sizes, hence for 
this population, 18 sizes would satisfy the customers better than other number of sizes.

5.0 Conclusions 
In this study, the possibility of solving garment sizing problem through Customer Pairwise Fit (CPF) matrix was 
explored. An attempt was made to identify garment sizing parameters and variables which led to a quantitative 
definition of fit formulated as CPF matrix indicating the degree of fit between any pair of customers in terms of 
the garment sizing parameters. The sizing problem was then defined as that of segregating a given customers 
population with known garment anthropometric data into sub-groups who will use the same size with the goal of 
maximizing fit. To test the feasibility of this approach, a sizing system for 100 potential customers population in 
Nigeria was developed. The results gave 99.31% fit which appears reasonable enough. The proposed method 
could be applied to larger customers population and different clothing.

Abstract 
Among the various factors that predispose TEB projects to cost and time overruns, consultant related 
factors have been fingered as one to be recognized. Others include contractor related, owner related and 
external factors. In order to achieve the aim of this study, which is to determine the order of influence of 
the consultants related factors on the performance of selected TEB projects, mean item score and student 
T-test were used for the analysis. The perceptions of key construction stakeholders from 4 selected
tertiary institutions, chosen consequent upon the record indicating a huge allocation received by these
institutions from the federal government for capital projects, in the Southwestern part of Nigeria were
sought. The reliability analysis carried out on the constructs show values of 0.862 and 0.946. It was found
that delayed supervision & slowness in making decisions coupled with the absence of consultant’s site
staff are the top two consultants related factors that predisposed TEB projects to cost and time overruns.
The factors cut across the TEB projects procured under both open and selective competitive tendering
methods. Timely supervision with quick and prompt decision making therefore enhances building
projects performance.

INTRODUCTION 
In terms of age, the construction industry is as old as nature itself and it is mostly concerned with one-off project 
unlike manufacturing sector (Oyewobi and Ogunsemi, 2010). The construction industry, where tertiary educational 
building projects are domiciled, is very important in the economic development of any nation especially with 
recourse to an expanding economy like Nigeria (Ibironke, 2003). Niazi and Painting (2017) noted that the backbone 
of the social and economic development of developing countries is the construction industry with 10% contribution 
to GDP in Afghanistan. The lingering problem being faced during the execution of any tertiary educational building 
(TEB) projects like other building projects in the Nigerian construction industry today can be broadly categorized as 
time overrun and cost overrun (Aibinu and Jagboro, 2002; Garry, 2005; Niazi and Painting, 2017; Ogunsemi, 2002) 
as well as lack of good quality of its end product that hardly stand the test of time in meeting client’s requirements 
(Niazi and Painting, 2017; Oyewobi and Ogunsemi, 2010; Oyegoke, 2006). The production of the Nigerian 
procurement assessment report in the year 2000 by the World Bank was necessitated by lack of genuine competition 
and transparency (Olaniyan, 2010). Olaniyan (2010) observed that there were gaps between budget and actual 
releases, which usually resulted in underfunding, price escalating and abandonment of construction projects. Efforts

projects should be accorded high importance by the consultants while ensuring quick and prompt decision making. 
Lastly, the client should demand for performance bond from his consultants in order to curb these excesses while 
ensuring commitment.

Abstract 
This article examines tribology. More emphasis is on the effect of wear on engineering materials as it is 
an important and costly aspect of engineering industries. Wear degradation is one of the most failure 
mode incurring millions of funds by maintenance and replacement in modern industries. Apart from 
lubricants, thin film deposition technologies are well established for the improvement of wear resistance 
in high friction operations. There have been a widespread of hard coatings such as diamond and diamond-
like carbon coatings for tribological applications in the last decades. However, the limitation of such 
coatings is that plastic deformation of such hard coatings begins from the substrate material. This is 
because the wear mechanisms of the material will depend on the mechanical properties such as hardness 
and ductility of the substrate and the coating.  In depth knowledge of the macro-mechanical mechanisms 
dominating the tribological process are discussed. Different wear mechanisms are briefly reviewed with 
respect to their effect on substrate-film system and hardness. The influence of the thin film deposition 
method employed and the surface treatment used on the tribological properties of the coated materials are 
discussed.

1. Introduction
1.1  Background 
The term tribology refers to the science and technology of interacting surfaces in relative motion and the particles 
related thereto, this science covers friction, wear and lubrication for interacting machine elements(Dowson, 1993) 
(Menezes et al., 2013)(Bhushan, 2013). This science has been applied since the ancient times from the creation of 
wheels or rollers to the implementation of lubricants to avoid friction when pyramids where being built. Tribological 
principles were also applied during and after Roman Empire for war machinery and fortification methods (Bhushan, 
2013). Many other developments followed particularly in the use of steel bearing materials instead of wood in 1500, 
later the understandings of lubricants by Sir Isaac Newton sans so forth. Wear however is a much younger subject 
than friction and lubricants, studies on wear became substantial after the use of steam power, development of 
railway, automobiles and the aircraft(Bhushan, 2013).In modern industries, tribology is applied for reliability, 
improved performance, cost saving and durability of moving parts in various industries all over the world. 
Generally, in a tribological contact, the harder material scratches the softer material, as such soft and the hard 
coating may be used to reduce friction and or wear. When using soft coatings, friction losses are confined to a thin 
film of low shear strength and will persist as long as the film remains. However, this effect can be achieved better 
through the use of liquid lubricants, the best thin coating contribution in tribology can, therefore, be achieved

4. Conclusion 
Application and implementation of good tribological practices provide high economic benefits by reducing energy 
losses due to friction, loss due to the depreciation of machines and breakdowns. Surface modification methods are 
amongst other methods of improving materials against wear degradation. These methods influence the properties 
and applicability of the thin film depending on the environment of operation. A wide range of thin film deposition 
methods is available also selected depending on the desired final properties. Wear mechanisms failure modes, 
susceptible environmental operations and factors affecting the tribological behavior of the films have to be taken 
into considerate during thin film deposition of coatings.

Abstract 
We considered a situation in which some projects should be chosen in a limited budget. Without any 
defending project, the loss is dependent on the specific site and the type and intensity of undesirable 
event.  Each project which needs a certain amount of investment to implement is suitable for a subset of 
sites and has specific impact on loss depending on the event. It is supposed that for a specific site and 
project, the value of loss is a decreasing function in amount of investment. First, the probabilistic and 
strategic risk is considered separately then in final model, both of them are considered simultaneously. As 
there are many common projects which can support two kinds of risks, the problem is selecting projects to 
minimize the total expected loss from two different kinds of risks. These three problems are formulated as 
integer linear programming. An example has been solved and sensitivity analysis has been done. The 
results show that facing strategic risk, the weakest site has the highest priority to reinforce in order to 
decrease total loss but in order to reduce the loss originated from probabilistic risks, it should be 
strengthened the sites found by solving a knapsack problem.

Abstract 
The civil construction industry is diverse as it includes various clients like property builders, property engineers, 
material providers, and contractual workers. The construction industry brings cost-viable building improvements 
wherein every one of these clients has a dynamic role to make the contract and project a success. The 
construction industry plays an important role in the infrastructure and economy of a country as well as the 
livelihood of people. Most infrastructure projects throughout the civil engineering industry, are struggling with 
cost and schedule overrun which can be caused by various internal and external factors.  
This paper aims to determine the possibilities of using agile methodologies in the design phase of a civil 
engineering project to mitigate cost and schedule overrun and to improve the delivery of the design phase. A 
systematic literature review was conducted using nine electronic databases, which produced 2440 articles. After 
conducting the systematic literature review, 22 articles were used for synthesis and analysis. The results of the 
research identified four challenges faced in the design phase, which included schedule and cost overrun; 
construction waste management; design performance; and project management. The results obtained indicated 
that agile methodologies can improve delivery in the design stage of a project.

1. Introduction
The infrastructure industry is an important industry for a developing country, for improving the economy and 
providing better infrastructure for the improvement of people livelihood [1]. Civil engineering projects are 
responsible for the design, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure projects varying from roads, 
hospitals, airports, treatment plants, power plants, stadiums, dams, and bridges just to name a few [2]. 
Infrastructure development faces a host of problems where the loss of investments has become a contingency 
which is factored into the building of the infrastructure projects [1]. Civil construction industries worldwide 
struggle to deliver projects to the client at the contracted time within the contractual budget, due to the increase 
in complexity of projects and the rapidly evolving, innovative technologies and requirements from the client [1], 
[2]. Civil engineering consultants and contractors who do not keep up with the pace of technology will most 
likely find themselves losing capital to their competitors. 
In South Africa, almost 13% of the nation’s budget in 2017 was allocated to infrastructure development [3]. As 
civil engineering projects continue to run into cost and schedule overrun, the delivery of optimum infrastructure 
within the allocated budget becomes a serious issue [4]. Civil engineering projects need to improve due to the 
amount of investment that is entrusted to the industry. As the design phase plays an important role in improving 
the challenges faced by the civil construction industry, more attention should be paid to the design process as a 
way of optimisation. Agile methodologies focused on people, client and the final product can assist the 
improvement of efficiency in the design phase of a construction project which in turn can improve delivery.

an obstruction and might impede viably performing teams (S14). As per Ezzat (S16), a project manager is liked 
to be a jack of all trades over a specialist in their profession, yet one must have a strong specialized learning 
(S30). The project manager should know enough to comprehend what is occurring in an abnormal state. A 
performing manager is consequently, in the design stage, required to incorporate the diverse disciplines that are 
associated with a project (S24). 
 
Agile methodologies are versatile in nature; they were made at the most for the ever-rapid evolving world. With 
innovation rapidly changing and the projects ending up more perplexing, it is one of the Agile Methodologies 
crucial requirements to be more adaptable and to be less entangled and create faster outcomes, and thus the 
name ""agile"" (S1). As indicated by Han (S1), the agile techniques can work under uncertain objectives and 
methodologies and can enable the customer to reach towards making clearer objectives (S1). Its capacity to be 
more versatile to any conditions causes the client to be more responsible for moulding the results of the project, 
as opposed to enabling conditions to manage the outcomes of the project (S1). An agile approach takes into 
consideration project managers and design teams need to adjust to evolving conditions, rather than compelling 
unbending and straight control as in the conventional method (S28). An ever-increasing number of projects 
today are led in more eccentric environments as the manager tries to adjust to evolving innovation, industry and 
market. How the manager manages the project must change to be better arranged and prepared for these kinds of 
environments (S30). The agile system has a procedure for enhancing the learning of the project circumstance by 
coordinating efforts with every significant partner (S1). 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The civil construction industry is an imperative industry in the economy of a developing nation because civil 
construction projects are the principal drivers of expanding infrastructure and helps with enhancing social 
environments for the general population. As said that infrastructure contributes on a very basic level toward the 
South African financial improvement; creating work both directly and indirectly and improves individuals' 
personal satisfaction through the arrangement of essential financial infrastructure buildings. In any case, this is 
tended with infrastructure projects pausing and losing a measure of money because of cost and schedule 
overrun. The design stage was distinguished as the stage at which the greater part of the cost and schedule 
overrun begins, it was along these lines with reason that it is the stage at which mitigation measures can be 
connected. Systematic literature review gathers existing information from an extensive variety of sources and 
tries to deplete the accessible information to find un-bias conclusions.  
 
The main limitation of the systematic literature review is the inclination in the selection of the publication and 
mistake in data extraction. However, to guarantee that the procedure of selection was unbiased, the research 
adopted a research protocol in advance that deﬁned the research questions. Utilizing the questions as a premise, 
search terms and identiﬁed catchphrases and key terms that would be relevant in the literature. It is important to 
note that the search terms were not standardised due to the uniqueness of each electronic database. Therefore, as 
much as the research has endeavoured with the best capabilities to combine the search phrases to extract 
relevant studies, there is a risk of omitting some publications due to the key terms were chosen by the research. 
 
To conclude the execution of agile methodology in the design period of construction projects can enhance this 
stage by limiting the weakness or vulnerability and help in managing the unanticipated risks and having the 
capacity to adjust to evolving conditions. It can enable structure and aid with the design stage by expanding 
transparency and enhancing the project, using time management and expanding both the customer's commitment 
and the camaraderie's.

Abstract 
Electromagnetic wave propagating in dust storms is susceptible to attenuation and phase rotation by 
suspended charged particles. Considerable attention has therefore been paid to the development in the recent 
past by researchers. This paper presents a theoretical approach for predicting the attenuation and the phase 
rotation of an electromagnetic wave propagation in dust storms environment with charged particles. 
Mathematical model based on forward scattering amplitude Rayleigh theory is given in terms of 
monodisperse medium (equal sized distribution) and polydisperse medium (exponential size distribution). 
The attenuation and the phase rotation are calculated, and the results are analysed. The effect caused by the 
charged particles is notably significant. It is found that the attenuation and the phase rotation with charged 
dust particles are greater than where there is no charge. The coefficients of attenuation and phase rotation 
increase with the magnitude of charges carried by the dust particles depicted by the ratio of charge-to-mass. 
The results also show the variation of both attenuation and phase rotation with the charge distribution angles 
under different charge-to-mass ratios.

Electromagnetic waves; attenuation; phase rotation; charged particles; dust storm. 
1. Introduction
Propagation of electromagnetic waves in sand and dust storms has attracted much attention in the literature because the 
propagation is affected by means of signal attenuation and phase rotation. The mechanisms of absorption and scattering 
of dust or sand particles usually cause attenuation (Klačka et al., 2015). Studies have been conducted to investigate the 
impacts of dust storms on satellite communication (Harb et al., 2014) and predict attenuation and phase rotation in sand 
dust storms (Elabdin et al, 2009 and Musa & Bashir, 2013). In separate reviews carried out by Bashir & McEwan (1986) 
and Musa et al. (2014), Ryde was found to be one of the earliest researchers to pay attention to sand and dust storms 
effects on radar albedo. It was pointed out that at low frequency and in sand and dust storms with low visibility, radar 
signal is usually not significantly influenced. Thereafter, investigations (Musa et al., 2014a; Musa et al., 2014b; Dong 
et al., 2013 and Chiou & Kiang, 2016) showed that the physical characteristics of dust particles, such as permittivity, 
incident waves, particle sizes and particle shapes among others, have significant effects on electromagnetic wave 
propagation. Some measurements and theoretical works (Zheng et al., 2003) have also shown that sand and dust 
particles have charges that usually affect saltation of the particles. For a single spherical or ellipsoidal particle carrying 
charges, there is the forward scattering amplitude function of the charged dust or sand particle. 
For this purpose, effect of charged dust particles on propagation of electromagnetic waves is investigated, and 
mathematical models to predict attenuation and phase rotation based on Rayleigh approximation approach by 
considering the charged particles are given in this paper. The models consider monodisperse and polydisperse media as 
well as variables which include charge distribution angle, charge-to-mass ratio and visibility during sand and dust 
storms. The models are suitable for calculation and analysis of microwave attenuation and phase rotation caused by 
charged dust particles of both spherical and ellipsoidal shapes in either monodisperse and polydisperse media. 
After the introduction as contained in this section, other parts of this paper are arranged such that Section 2 presents a 
brief on the solutions of electromagnetic wave scattering. In Section 3, the electromagnetic wave attenuation and phase 
rotation models are developed, and the principle of chosen parameters are presented. Results prediction and discussions

rotation component. The coefficients of attenuation and phase rotation increase as the magnitude of charges carried by 
the dust particles, given in terms of ratio of the charge and mass, increases. The higher the concentration of the charges 
carried by the dust particles, the higher the effect of electromagnetic wave attenuation. Whenever the angle of charge 
distribution, 𝜃0 = 0, it means that the particle is with no electric charge on its surface. Conversely, when 𝜃0 = 𝜋, it 
implies that the electric charges are distributed over the whole surface of the dust particles. 
 
From the formulated models, it can be concluded that the attenuation decreases as the intensity of the incident electric 
ﬁeld and the visibility increase. Also, attenuation increases as the particles sizes increases. Finally, it is found that the 
effect of the ellipsoidal charged particles on electromagnetic wave attenuation and phase rotation is obviously higher 
than a situation where the particles are without charges. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, theoretical models to predict attenuation and phase rotation due to charged dust particles have been 
developed and proposed. Different scenarios and conditions have been assumed. The mathematical models as expressed 
in (7) and (8) – spherical shape of mono-dispersive charged dusty medium, (9) and (10) - spherical shape of poly-
dispersive charged dusty medium, (13) and (14) - ellipsoidal shape of mono-dispersive charged dusty medium, (15) and 
(16) - ellipsoidal shape of poly-dispersive charged dusty medium, were developed to predict and evaluate 
electromagnetic wave attenuation and phase rotation. 
 
Predictions consistent with the experimental result of scattering wave attenuation in reference (Zheng et al., 2003) are 
made with the assumption that charges are partially and uniformly distributed on the dust particle’s surface. The results 
show the importance of the influence of dust with charges on the attenuation and the phase rotation of electromagnetic 
waves. The rules of microwave attenuation and phase rotation varying with the distribution area of charges, incident 
electric wave intensity, charge-to-mass ratio, frequency, radius of dust particles and visibility are given. 
 
Finally, for a simplification of the description of the influence of charges on electromagnetic wave attenuation and 
phase rotation in charged dust particles, a new parameter, 𝐶𝑓, involving charge distribution angle, intensity of incident 
waves and charge to mass ratio, is introduced. This allows for prediction and discussion of electromagnetic waves 
attenuation and phase rotation by charged dust particles.

Microwave Attenuation along Earth-Satellite Link During 
Dust Storms

Abstract 
Microwave propagation during sand and dust storms has received appreciable attention of researchers in 
the recent past due to the increase in the number of terrestrial and satellite links being deployed in the 
regions where dust storms are predominant. Dust storms cause signal attenuation on an earth-satellite link 
for a substantial percentage of time which may affect quality and reliability of telecommunication services. 
This paper investigates the attenuation due to dust storms along the earth-satellite link. A mathematical 
model, expressed as a function of visibility, wavelength, elevation angle and storms’ reference height, is 
developed to predict dust storms’ attenuation along propagation path. Variation of the dust storm’s visibility 
with height for different reference visibility conditions is also given. The mathematical model for 
attenuation in earth-satellite link was developed by applying visibility variation to the expression of 
attenuation constant in terrestrial link. This was then integrated with respect to dust storms’ height. The 
results obtained are depicted in graphs and discussed. It is found that attenuation increases when visibility 
during dust storms gets severe. Lastly, the results obtained show that attenuation in earth-satellite link 
operating at X band, especially, during dust storms may be said to be insignificant except when visibility is 
extremely bad. 
Keywords 
Attenuation; earth-satellite link; dust storms; microwave propagation; visibility. 
1. Introduction
Dust storm may be referred to as a severe weather condition characterized by very strong wind and air filled with dust 
and sand over a large area. It is observed in many areas around the world, including Africa, arid parts of Asia, the 
Middle East and the North America. The effects of dust storms are enormous in aviation and telecommunications 
operations as they accumulate and transport dust in the atmosphere (Zhong, 2006). Dust storms pose dangers to 
communication systems’ reliability in the affected regions. The particles from dust storms may rise high enough above 
the earth's surface to lie within the radio path, thereby causing signal loss and resulting in system outage or service 
interruptions. The suspended particles cause attenuation in microwave propagation. Thus, dust particles are very 
important consideration in the attenuation calculations from a radar point of view, even though particles with a diameter 
of more than 50 μm cannot be elevated beyond 2m to 5 m (NRL, 2013). 
Microwave propagation during dust storms has received considerable attention due to an increase in the number of 
terrestrial and satellite links established in world regions that encounter dust storms as well as many other radar 
applications especially at high frequencies (Goldhirsh, 2001; Bashir & McEwan, 1985; Ghobrial & Sharif, 1987; Ruike 
et al., 2003; Ansari & Evans, 2008; and Sharif, 2011). Investigators (Goldhirsh, 2001; Bashir & McEwan, 1985; 
Ghobrial & Sharif, 1987) and (Sharif, 2011; Musa & Bashir, 2013 and Elsheikh et al., 2010) have proposed different 
models focusing on dust storms and its effects on signal propagation especially on terrestrial links. However, the effects 
of dust storms on earth-satellite links or slant paths have received little attention even though it is becoming very difficult 
to efficiently manage earth-satellite dependent systems that suffer attenuation due to dust storms. The objective of this 
paper, therefore, is to investigate the attenuation along earth–satellite links (also known as earth-space or slant paths) 
during dust storms by developing a model in terms of visibility, elevation angle and reference height to estimate the 
magnitude of the attenuation. The variation of visibility with height is also considered. The attenuation model is based

5. Conclusion 
 
A method, using mathematical model, for estimating microwave attenuation during dust storm in earth-satellite link has 
been developed. The model was premised on 10 GHz dielectric constant values and that density of dust storm along the 
wave propagation path in earth-satellite link is not the same. It is observed that the performance of satellite systems 
operating at the X band is not very sensitive to the propagation characteristics of the transmission medium. However, 
at a frequency above the X band such as the Ku and the Ka bands, dust storms could be very sensitive and cause 
degradation on earth-satellite paths. This may be experienced for a substantial percentage of time especially with severe 
and prolonged storms. In such scenario, reduction in both the quality and the availability of communication services is 
not unexpected.

Abstract 
The quality of the relationship between critical stakeholders (client, consultant and contractor), in a 
typical construction project, influences the progress on the project. If this relationship is impaired, it may 
lead to disputes of varied degrees; which usually culminate in litigation. The objective of a typical 
construction project is to strive to improve on the relationship between the stakeholders through effective 
communication, cordial information sharing and timely response to enquiries. When this is done, the 
stakeholders at variance with others are politely educated and re-aligned towards achieving the project’s 
objectives. The effective management of relationships in a construction project can be achieved through 
the contextual use of the Johari’s model. The action research approach was adopted, examining the 
actions of each stakeholder for a longitudinal period of twelve months in the life of a construction project. 
The findings revealed that the contractor’s actions, in many instances, displayed acts of ignorance, while 
the consultants were seen to be economical with details; these are referred to, in the Johari’s model, as 
acting in the blind area and façade respectively. The use of the Johari’s model has helped in ameliorating 
disputes between stakeholders; improved on in their relationship and facilitating progress in the 
construction project.

1. Introduction
The relationship between the different stakeholders in the construction project, the quality and mode of 
communication, response to enquiries and the general leadership style are some latent causes of disaffection which 
eventually leads to disputes of different magnitude. The method(s) of resolving the disputes influences the effect on 
the relationship between the different stakeholders and the progress of the construction project. The disputes may be 
simple, which can be resolved through normal site procedures or complex, requiring arbitration or litigation (Lloyd-

Abstract 
Surface hardness plays an important role in lifetime of a mechanical part subjected to friction 
and wear. Indeed, the hardness can be improved by processes of superficial plastic 
deformation (DPS), such as the mechanical surface treatment ""MST"", in particular the 
ball burnishing. However, the result of treatment is conditioned by mastery of operation thus 
ensuring treated parts good mechanical and geometric properties. Experimental work was 
carried out by applying ball burnishing process on steel tensile specimens S355JR, in order 
to observe the influence of  parameters of  treatment regime on surface hardness 'Hv' and 
the effect of  latter on  tensile behavior of this steel. Two parameters of regime were 
considered namely:  burnishing force ""Py"" and number of passes ""i"". The relationship 
between these parameters and microhardness measured at ""Hv"" surface has been highlighting 
using factorial plans 22. Moreover a mathematical model has been obtained allowing 
prediction of response (Hv) as well as optimization of parameters of treatment regime. The 
experimental results showed that for surface hardness Hv it is possible to reach a 45% 
improvement rate for a burnishing force py = 20 Kgf and a number of passages i = 3 for this 
material. Regarding behavior of material during tensile test, it was noted that for a weaker 
burnishing force (py = 10N) and a large number of passes   (i = 5), the section weakens 
further (S = 4.14), proof than the ductility of material has decreased.

Abstract 
Being able to predict the future demand of electricity constitutes part of the issues utilities companies, 
policy makers and private investors willing to invest in developing countries are facing. The use of 
efficient, reliable electricity demand predictor would improve significantly the infrastructure planning and 
the expansion of power transmission. In this paper, the national demand for electricity at a macro level, 
based on data relating to macro level economic and demographic indicators was predicted using Artificial 
Neural Network (ANN). Forecasted values for five electricity sectors namely agricultural, transport, 
mining, domestic and commerce/manufacturing sectors were obtained using ANN. Four growth scenarios 
have been considered for the forecasting namely low, moderate, high (less energy intensive) and high 
(same sectors) scenarios. These inputs values for the period of 2014 to 2050, from the Council for 
Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), were used to test data and validate the use of this new approach 
for the prediction of electricity demand. The deviations between the predicted values using ANN and the 
recommended values by CSIR were well within an acceptable range. This study demonstrates that the use 
of ANN would improve significantly the decision making within the energy sector.

1. Introduction
The understanding of future patterns of electricity usage is crucial in various planning context, especially in 
developing countries such as South Africa. Electricity providers are interested in future national demand in order to 
plan and secure electricity supply (Imtiaz et al., 2006). Any plan to invest in electricity generation depends largely 
on the anticipation of the long-term need for electricity (Doriana et al., 2006). The growing population of country 
such as South Africa would have to take into account the implications on future electricity needs. This is necessary 
in order to ascertain that the electricity supply capacity is sufficient to support future plans. 
In order to forecast future electricity demands, several factors external to the energy policies are generally 
considered. These factors includes the growth of the population, the performance of the economy, the advancement 
of the technology and the prevailing weather conditions. This could be a source of uncertainties because of the lack 
of reliable data in most developing countries due to the macroeconomic and political instability (Steinbuks, 2017). 
Hence, in order to illustrate the predictive approach proposed in this study, potential “drivers” of electricity, 
historical data were obtained from the South African Reserve Bank, Chamber of Mines and Statistics SA as 
documented in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research report (CSIR) (2016). The Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP), the Final Consumption Expenditure of Households (FCEH), the Index for Manufacturing production 
volumes, the Index for Mining production volumes, the population, the number of households and average 
household size and the gold ore milled and gold ore treated, related to South Africa, are the drivers data considered 
in this study. Table 1 provides the details of the sources of the details used for the forecasting results reported in this 
paper.

Conclusion 
 
Reasonable knowledge of past, present and likely future demands would make useful contributions to planning and 
policy formulation. This work explores the use of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in creating a model of 
electricity forecast. The system model for the proposed forecast of electricity demands is a multilayer ANN, where 
the network is trained for optimized value using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The minimum R2-value, 
which measures of the quality of fit, was 0.98204. This means that more than 98.204% of the electricity demands 
variability are explained by linear regression. In addition, the responses obtained from ANN for any new inputs data 
within the range considered are relatively acceptable. In order to measure the ability of ANN to predict the 
electricity demands, the comparison between the results recommended by CSIR and the results predicted using 
ANN has been done per scenario. A maximum deviation of ±9% have been observed. Although the results reported 
in this paper are restricted to the year 2014 to 2050, based on the available data, this study demonstrate the 
possibility to understand future patterns of electricity usage in various planning context.

Abstract 
Decentralised energy systems are crucial migrating towards cleaner systems. The main advantage is the 
adjustability to energy demand and supply. A key aspect to promote decentralised energy systems is the integration 
of flexible technologies in terms of scale and capability to process a wide range of materials including Municipal 
Solid Waste (MSW). The Waste-to-Energy (WtE) technologies are a strategic factor for planning decentralised 
energy systems. Among thermochemical WtE technologies, incineration appears to be the most mature. On the 
other hand, gasification is an emerging technology with the potential to convert a broad range of wastes into useful 
energy products. The purpose of the study is to provide insights for the planning of decentralised WTE energy 
systems from MSW. Incineration and gasification are compared by a multidimensional analysis through a 
systematic review. Findings indicate that decentralised WtE energy systems could meet part of energy demand 
reducing environmental impacts. Although incineration delivers steady energy production, its feasibility depends 
on the scale. Gasification offers pliability in the scaling-up process and energy storage. Gasification requires being 
tested on a commercial scale. Decentralised WtE energy systems provide a platform for emerging technologies 
through public-private partnerships. Critical success factors include adaptability of technologies and business 
models.

Abstract 
In the first part of this paper we present the command MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) that we 
have programmed to extract the maximum power at the terminal of the photovoltaic generators in spite of 
the change of climate (Temperature and Illumination). While the second part shows the injection of solar 
energy to the electrical grid with a well-adapted system with the filters that we have made to improve in 
order to minimize the harmonics to the electrical grid. In fact, solar photovoltaic energy offers us the 
possibility of producing a green, clean and non-polluting energy, this energy is built by converting the 
light’s rays coming from the sun into an electric current through the photovoltaic effect principle. The 
electricity produced is of a continuous nature. In case we want to inject this current into the distribution 
grid, it must be converted into a sinusoidal current of 50 Hz, this transformation will be done through a 
converter called: “Inverter”. The latter must have an adequate command and judiciously chosen to have a 
compatible voltage with the grid   in the minimum of harmonic. For that, we did this work with intelligent 
commands to have a well-adapted system for injecting this clean energy to the electrical grid.

Abstract 
The application of statistical methods for process control monitoring has become an essential activity to 
ensure process stability. The main objective of statistical process control is to recognize and identify the 
presence of abnormal control charts patterns that are disrupting the natural behavior of processes. Most 
studies on the subject are aimed at recognizing a single abnormal pattern at a time. However, in many 
industry processes is fairly common the existence of concurrent control chart patterns, which means, the 
occurrence of more than one abnormal control chart pattern at the same time. As a result, the following 
article organizes and analyzes existing information regarding concurrent control chart pattern recognition 
with the hope of providing a concise summary of the contributions to date and a useful guide to orientate 
further research. The methodological analysis follows a comprehensive classification framework whose 
categories were designed to assure an in-depth analysis of the most critical topics.

The Impact of Breakdown Reduction through Lean-TPM 
Methodologies and Energy Consumption in a 
Manufacturing Industry 
Daniel Arusei and Bernard Maiyo 
Moi University 
Kenya 
Abstract 
At Company X, Nairobi an effort was made to implement Total Productive Maintenance. It is a 
Production management method and company’s ultimate goal in introducing TPM was a means to 
achieve leaner production and a calming of the material flow. In Total Productive Maintenance, reliability 
and availability are the ultimate goals and the way to accomplish the goals is through elimination of major 
losses. These losses are only due to mechanical nature and visualized by the key figure; Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness. The main Key performance indicators for this research were; Mean Time 
Before Failure (MTBF), Mean Time To Repair (MTTR), Breakdown Percentage and Energy Usage. 
Through literature studies, a training workshop with TPM consultancy firm EfesoTM and a visit to an 
exemplary TPM implementing company Unilever, the tasks to be performed were set and a master plan of 
execution developed. In order to visualize production losses, a sheet for recording production progress in 
a timely manner was developed, a database for data storage was set up, together with a computer aided 
analysis, and the a program to compute reports written. This research accomplished a reduction in 
breakdowns from 12.5% to 5.5% on PK machine. In doing so, OEE increased, and subsequently energy 
consumption per unit SSU reduced from 0.021KWH/SSU to 0.012KWH/SSU. The gains in productivity 
or effectiveness were achieved only through measures in TPM, mainly the Preventive Maintenance (PM) 
pillar, and not harder labor. The tools used in achieving these goals included; Autonomous maintenance, 
Continuous improvement, Root cause analysis for failure, Preventive maintenance among others.

Abstract 
Apart from its health benefits and coagulant properties, Moringa Oleifera has the possibility to be a 
sustainable and green alternative to chlorine water disinfection, however, there are limited scientific 
documented research findings on the disinfection properties of Moringa Oleifera, The objective of this 
study was to prove that Moringa Oleifera leaf powder has the ability to disinfect sewerage. The Moringa 
Oleifera used in the study was collected from Kgobokwane village in Mpumalanga province (South Africa). 
The study was conducted experimentally by dosing a sewerage analogue with Moringa Oleifera leaf powder 
at 600rpm for one minute, then allowing it and the sludge to settle and the change in Chemical Oxygen 
Demand (COD) of the samples was then analyzed. A decrease of 40% COD attributed to bacteria was 
measured and a bone charcoal filter removed 37% of the organic colloids left in the water due to Moringa 
Oleifera treatment. Based on the pre-mentioned result in traditional water treatment Moringa Oleifera can 
be implemented to subsidise alum as well as chlorine dosage up to 40% in industrial scale water treatment 
as a pretreatment with no known negative effects. The limitation of the study is that bacteria was not 
explicitly tested. In rural areas on a private scale, Moringa Oleifera has the opportunity to pretreat river 
water before consumption and combined with other technology disinfect household effluent.

1. Introduction
During disinfection by means of chlorine has the potential byproduct of trihalomethane which may be carcinogenic. 
By using Moringa Oleifera leaf as a means of disinfection it is possible to negate this, furthermore as Moringa Oleifera 
is a plant it has the potential to be sustainable (Adejumo et al., 2012). It is commercially sold as spice and tea with 
natural immune boosting benefits. Moreover, it is sold commercially in additives as pills and energy drinks (Dischem, 
2018). The use of Moringa Oleifera by rural communities is unrefined and an empirical trial and error process. This 
is why a more scientific study and implementation plan is carried out in this study in an effort to standardize and 
disseminate information about how it can effectively be used. 
2. Literature review
Benefits to using Moringa Oleifera as a nutritional supplement the leaf and seed powder is a natural alternative to 
supplemental pills. Furthermore, Moringa Oleifera is almost fifty per cent fibre, over twenty per cent protein (with all 
the needed amino acids) and very low in calorific value (Gopalakrishnan et al. 2016; Oyeyinka & Oyeyinka, 2016). 
Moringa Oleifera has been shown to be beneficial as poultry feed in terms of economics as well as overall poultry 
health (Paguia et al. 2014). Lastly, Moringa Oleifera has been found to be a terrific source of antioxidants (Conde et 
al. 2013; Jayawardana et al. 2015). Apart from the nutrients include blood sugar control, cancer control and prevention, 
aiding in digestive issues in both humans and animals. Finally, Moringa Oleifera assists in maintaining healthy sperm 
and sperm count (Gopalakrishnan et al. 2016). 
Moringa Oleifera has been observed to cure both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in rats using Moringa Oleifera seed oil. 
Additionally, Moringa Oleifera has been observed to contain natural anti-cancer chemicals which have been proven 
safe and reliable. This chemical acts as not only a prevention measure to cancer but also slows and in some cases stop 
cancer growth entirely. Moringa Oleifera has shown properties of being a disinfectant and reduce inflammation when

ideal adsorbent will yield greater rates of mass transfer and would be more efficient. The bone charcoal’s intended use 
is to counteract the effect Moringa Oleifera has on the overall water COD and to prove that the effect is easily 
reversible in conventional water treatment. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis was also done and supported the SEM 
results. The elementary carbon filter removed 37% of the organic colloids in the sample in continuous recycle flow 
17hour treatment.

Table 1 and Table 2 show the summery of the ANOVA analysis done on the raw data obtained for the control and 
study respectively between Trials. Analysis of variance (AN-O-VA) is a tool used to confirm that the data points 
between the trials differ to an accepted degree (i.e. with the F-Value lower than the F-Crit Value and P-Value bigger 
than 0.05 the null-hypothesis is accepted). The resulting conclusion is that the three Trials can be used as one single 
data set. ANOVA would have statistically shown if there was an uncontrolled variable interfering with the results. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Highest reduction in COD donated to bacteria was found to be 40%, representing a 40% reduction in bacteria count. 
An elementary carbon filter resulted in a COD reduction of 37% representing a 37% reduction in the organic colloids 
left by Moringa Oleifera. Therefore Moringa Oleifera leaf powder has the capability of disinfecting sewerage and the 
side effect resulting from said treatment can be negated with an elementary carbon filter. This technology has the 
possibility to be implemented to subsidies alum and chlorine in the industrial sector and be implemented in rural areas 
on a personal scale. With optimization, this technology has the possibility to be implemented full industrial scale.

Abstract 
Heat transfer is an integral part of most processes and machines, whether it’s cooling a machine or 
heating a solution. Naturally, heat flows from the highest temperature to the lowest. This driving force is 
defined as the temperature gradient. Heat will dissipate as it flows through the medium into the 
surrounding air. This study was conducted using an Extended Heat Transfer Unit. In this study, a brass 
rod was heated and the temperature profile observed. The experiment was simulated using COMSOL and 
this was compared to experimental data. The objective of this study was to compare the experimental 
results of an extended heat transfer pilot unit to the simulated results. The error between the simulation 
and the experimental results grew larger the higher the current output. There is no formal documented 
work on simulation of the extended heat transfer phenomenon, with an accurate simulation of extended 
heat transfer the model obtained could be implemented in more complex models such as fuel cells and 
furnaces.

1. Introduction 
Heat transfer is an important aspect of all energy and science, especially in mechanical and thermodynamic 
processes. This driving force is defined as the temperature gradient. Heat conduct through the medium and dissipate 
through radiation and convection. Having a complete understanding of how heat is conducted through different 
mediums is a very important aspect of engineering design (Luo & Yang, 2017).  
 
This study focusses on an extended heat transfer unit with the main objective the comparison of simulated results 
against the actual results. This was conducted by means of three trials where the brass rod is heated from the one end 
with four different power settings and allowed to reach a state as close to steady state as possible. The temperature 
along the rod was then observed. The system was simulated using COMSOL and results compared. 
 
2. Literature Review 
The estimation of the total heat exchange factor plays an important role while obtaining the reference trajectories on 
steady-state furnace operation for the reheating furnace control system in the metal industry, the metal must undergo 
several thermal, mechanical, or thermomechanical process before it is suitable for industrial applications. In the 
process chain, continuous reheating furnaces are often used for reheating or heat treatment of metal products before 
and after the rolling mill, as illustrated in Figure 1 (Luo & Yang, 2017).

perspective, the current simulation model requires greater accuracy before it can be used. Errors of 25% and a mean 
error of 15.4% are too great for industrial application. This may be resultant from the extended heat transfer plant 
being different from the input variables obtained from the equipment manual. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The simulation places had up to 26% error. The simulation initial temperatures were too high and the temperature 
profile declined to quickly. This shows that in simulation the brass rod would rather dissipate its heat into the 
atmosphere than conducting it through the length, which was not the case in experimental trials. This may be due to 
an insulation of some kind present which was not taken into account. The objectives of the study have been met with 
some consideration, while the extended heat transfer phenomenon was successfully simulated and compared with 
the actual experimental results the models have too great an error to be utilized at this stage. Future research will be 
directed at lowering the error between simulated and experimental results and testing the simulated model in more 
complex systems, an accurate model can be utilized in the simulation of heat transfer in fuel cells; nuclear reactor 
control rods and metal casting equipment to name a few. This research will be to investigate the extended heat 
transfer pilot plant further to validate the input variables of the brass rod obtained from the equipment manual is 
accurate. Then the study will be repeated using other substances like iron.

Abstract 
The ability to determine the concentration of an unknown sample is highly important in every scientific 
research. This work focuses on the construction of a calibration curve for the analysis of siloxanes 
concentration in an anaerobic digester. The siloxanes of interest were the octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane 
(D4) which has a negative effect on the conversion of biogas into energy and is harmful to mechanical 
equipment. 
For 
this 
purpose, 
fourteen 
samples 
having 
methanol 
as 
solvent 
and 
octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D4) as solute, with concentrations ranging between 0.01 %V/V and 1 
%V/V, were prepared and analyzed through gas chromatography. The resulting percentage areas helped 
to the construction of a calibration curve. Only samples in the range 0.031 %V/V – 0.115 %V/V followed 
a linear trend as expected.

1. Introduction
Due to the depletion and price increase of fossil fuels as well as their harmful effects on the environment, current 
waste management policies favor the development of renewable energies (Mckendry, 2002). The world is going to 
undergo a revolution due to the forecasted ability of the gas industry to produce bioenergy from biomass. The 
production of biomethane – a green substitute of natural gas – is growing in Europe and the United-States of 
America (Hilaire et al., 2017).  
Biogas originated from landfills and sewage treatment plants is an attractive renewable fuel that can be used as a 
feedstock for cogeneration plants, internal combustion engines and fuel cells. However, due to various biomass 
inputs (e.g. agricultural wastes, sludges from sewage treatment plants, etc.), production processes (e.g. anaerobic 
digestion, municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills), seasonal effects and purification processes (e.g. gas scrubbers, 
pressure swing adsorption, membranes for biogas upgrading), the composition and quality of biogas and biomethane 
produced is difficult to assess. The exploitation of biogas is therefore usually limited by the harmful trace 
constituents, such as H2S, mercaptans and siloxanes. Among these pollutants, volatile methyl siloxanes (VMSs) 
have the most detrimental effect on biogas utilization for energy production (Li et al., 2014). 
As the material in a landfill or digester decomposes and generates biogas, the siloxane molecules enter the biogas 
stream as a vapor. During combustion these siloxanes undergo a phase change from a vapor to a solid silicon 
dioxide powder. This abrasive powder adheres to all surfaces downstream of the point of combustion, reducing heat 
transfer, blocking flow and increasing wear. Frequent overhaul is often required to prevent total equipment failure. 
The increased equipment maintenance and parts failures can significantly increases project costs while the downtime 
and reduced efficiency significantly decreases revenue (Energy, 2015). 
The reduction of siloxane vapors prior to combustion to eliminate siloxane powder build up may be critical to the 
profitability of your biogas to energy project. In projects requiring the use of post combustion catalysts, siloxane 
vapor reduction is an absolute necessity.

Figure 9: Interpreted D4 data using calibration curve to find volumetric concentration 
Fig. 8 shows the measured D4 data from a study conducted in percentage area from the gas chromatograph and Fig. 
9 shows the interpreted results using the calibration curve to find volumetric. Several days of data from Fig. 8 was 
averaged and interpreted using Fig. 7 to generate Fig. 9. Referring to Fig. 9 the left hand axis denotes a scale for the 
lower curve and the right hand axis for the upper curve. As shows in Fig. 8 and 9 one can use a calibration curve as 
depicted in Fig. 7 to determine volumetric fractions when using a Gas Chromatograph. This is applicable when there 
is not access to a Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer which does this automatically; though the latter is more 
accurate it is also much more expensive. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The objective of this study was to build a calibration curve to analyze siloxanes through Gas Chromatography. The 
selected concentration range was 0.01 %V/V – 1 %V/V. However, after analyzing the fourteen samples specially 
prepared for calibration, the resulting data points didn’t all follow a linear trend as expected. The reasons behind this 
deviation were the contamination of samples and human error while preparing the samples. Nevertheless, the data 
followed a linear trend in the percentage area range 0.029 % - 0.124 % corresponding to concentration values 
ranging between 0.031 %V/V – 0.115 %V/V.

Abstract 
Facility location, route selection and load consolidation are integrated distribution planning problems. 
These three decisions are of long, medium and short terms respectively. In all these three decision 
areas, there could be economy or diseconomy of scale involved. Of particular interests are models 
with single and multiple price breaks. This paper studies a heuristic based on Linear Programming 
(LP) relaxation for solving this integrated distribution problem. The solution approach utilizes simple 
transportation problems which other known heuristics in literature have also employed. However, the 
solution approach ensures that a reduced number of transportation problems are solved. A numerical 
example is presented to ensure the comprehension of the workings of the solution method. Results 
obtained for the first set of computational problems show little or no statistical difference in means 
while the second set of problems had the modified u-v method final solution better than the other 
methods considered. Although computation studies on a small scale was done to compare the 
performance of the heuristic with  the solution provided by standard optimization environment of Java 
Eclipse and CPLEX, large problem sizes still proof necessary to compare the runtime and objective 
value of each solution method.

1. Introduction
The classical transportation model and the solution tableau have been used to model and solve many real life 
distribution problems. In the classic transportation problem, it is assumed that there are no fixed charges and 
there is no economy (or diseconomy) of scale. The limitation of this assumption is well understood and many 
models relaxing these two assumptions have been published by diverse authors. This has resulted in other sub-
classes of the transportation model such as the Fixed Charge Transportation Problem (FCTP), in which only the 
“no fixed charge” assumption is relaxed, and the Step-Fixed Charge Transportation Problem (SFCTP) where 
both assumptions are relaxed.  
The FCTP and SFCTP, are integrated distribution problems of  the simple transportation tableau problem with 
fixed charges and  has attracted a lot of research interests. Models and solutions presented by  Gray (1971) , 
Sandrock (1988), Adlakha and Kowalski (2003), Kowalski and Lev (2008), Adlakha et al. (2007) show that the 
fixed charges could occur either at the source or along the routes. Adlakha and Kowalski (2003), described the 
FCTP as one in which there is a variable cost and a fixed cost incurred for opening a transportation route with a 
shipment greater than zero. The SFCTP however, has more than one fixed charge being incurred along the route 
as described by Sanei et al. (2017). Research in the field of the SFCTP is growing as indicated by Altassan et al.

Finally, the numerical problem considered showed the possibility of having near solutions to the CPLEX values 
when a minimum value among the NWC, LC and Modi is used for the final load distribution of the LP based 
heuristic. 
 
 
7. 
 Conclusion And Future Directions  
 
In this paper, we considered the Facility Location (FL) and Step-Fixed Charge Transportation Problem 
(SFCTP). A Linear Programming (LP) based heuristic was developed which was decomposed into two major 
transportation problems. The relaxed objective function of the first transportation problem in equation (25) was 
used in selecting the combinations of locations to be considered for the final transportation problem. In addition, 
solving the first transportation problem could help in generating a good lower bound for other computation 
methods such as Lagrange relaxations. A Numerical solution was presented to show the workings of the 
heuristic while a small scale pilot computation study was done to gain a little insight into the heuristic 
performance as regards the objective value obtained. Two sets of problem sizes were considered. The first set of 
problem sizes was solved using the NWC method as a solution method for the final transportation problem. The 
statistical results obtained showed a little or no significant differences in the mean values of the CPLEX solution 
and the LP based heuristic with increase in problem size. However, the NWC method lagged behind the LC and 
Modi methods for the second set of problem sizes. The Modi method for the final transportation problem was 
superior in all the problem instances of the second set of problems. The optimal distribution pattern of the Modi 
method (minimum cost) seemed to have a strong link to the good results obtained.  
Conclusively, large scale computation study still have to be conducted to gain proper insight into the 
performance of the heuristic under different parameter ranges and also due to the reason that exact methods 
which may obtainable using the solution methods present in the CPLEX optimization studio could become 
inefficient as the problem size increases. Also, comparing the runtimes of the different solution methods would 
also need to be considered for an efficient study. Finally a comparative study between this LP based heuristic 
and solution methods such as the lagrangian relaxation heuristic, metaheuristics such as genetic algorithm , tabu 
search  and hybrid solutions which uses both LP based relaxation and metaheuristics would be possible areas for 
exploring.

Abstract 
Just-in-Time (JIT) is an inventory management approach of having the exact amount of inventory 
goods arriving at the exact time when needed. This paper investigates the impact of this approach 
on South African Inventory Management systems and the organization as a whole, by comparing 
two companies producing same products (bed mattress), with different suppliers, and with 
different inventory management system. Company X has not implemented the Just-in-time 
approach, while, Company Y has implemented the JIT approach. This paper will provide insight 
knowledge on the benefits and challenges of this approach, how it can be implemented to improve 
the performance of a company. Mixed-methods research design has been utilized as a part of this 
investigation, and descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data collection. From the study 
conducted it may be concluded that not implementing the JIT system is the causes of lower 
performance rates, compared to the performance of the company that has. The JIT approach has 
methods or guidelines on how the company can improve its inventory management system and 
improve the performance of the company. It is then recommended that organizations in the 
manufacturing industry implement the Just-In-Time method in their inventory management 
systems.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background of the Topic
Inventory also known to as the goods and materials that a business stores and uses to achieving its production goals. 
Inventory management is a discipline primarily about specifying placement of stocked goods (Mwangi, 2013). Stock 
management includes diverse capacities inside an organization specifically; giving merchandise to meet the client 
requests and separate from vacillations in that request, to decouple different parts of the creation procedure, to exploit 
amount rebates, and to support against swellings and value changes (Heizer and Render, 2014). It is a costly resource 
in the organization, in this way it is basic that it is overseen accurately for the organization to be viable, to build its 
efficiency levels, and to kill exercise in futility and materials and have low generation costs. Inventory management 
is important because organizations will ensure assets and stock are well managed and demand forecasting is greatly 
enhanced to avoid unplanned procurement.

Figure 6 (above) indicates that Company X (which has not implemented JIT system) has been negatively affected by 
the inventory levels around the production space. Having stored inventory increases production costs, as the company 
should pay for the space and ensuring its safety, while also taking a risk of having that inventory being damaged. 
Company Y indicates less negative effects, as they have already implemented the JIT system in their organizations, 
but the results do show a need for improvement in how they have implemented they methods, so they could have 
lesser negative effects.  
)  
 
Figure 7. Survey results in terms of percentages Company’s performance (Employee’s response 
 
The results indicate that having inventory around the manufacturing space can affect your production cycle, as it is 
seen with Company X’s results. Employees are required to fetch materials when they are needed in the production 
cycle, which increases the time taken to finish the process of producing that particular product, in this case being a 
bed mattress. Company Y indicated that employee’s movement is not as negatively affected as in Company X, that is 
because they (Company X) have less inventory in their premises and they have material near the production line, in 
the right quantity needed for that day or production cycle.  
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendations 
 
From the study it may be concluded that companies can have lower performance rates, reason being that it has not 
implemented the Just-In-Time system in the inventory management system. It is also clear that JIT does affect the 
inventory management system and how the company performance in overall. As results indicated that Company Y 
performs better and has less production costs, due to the fact they have implemented the JIT system, their employees 
are aware of this system and have knowledge on the benefits of it. This makes it easier for employees to work with 
management in efficiently implementing this method. With the above-mentioned recommendations, the company can 
improve its inventory management system.  
 
Therefore, it is highly recommended that organizations in the manufacturing industry implement the Just-In-Time 
method in their inventory management systems. This method requires that organizations have a good relationship with 
their customers, as JIT highly depends on the performance of your suppliers. Close and reliable suppliers make the 
implementation of the process much easier and more efficiently.  
 
Management of the manufacturing companies are advised to train employees before the full implementation process, 
as JIT method will require them to change their movements (by eliminating unnecessary movements and non-value 
adding steps), materials will be closer to the working station and the only necessary materials will be around that work 
stage.  Employees need to understand the value of this method and how it will affect their work processes, by 
understanding the benefits, they are likely to adopt to this method trouble-free.

Abstract 
In any aviation facility, safety is the most sensitive issue to consider. This is because any single accident 
can significantly affect the whole airport. In this paper, a successful implementation of Safety 
Management System (SMS) is done at the Kuwait International Airport (KIA). The paper shows an 
implementation of such a system reduces the rate of accidents along with their costs, increases the 
productivity of the place, and meets the legal specifications needed to insure safety at airports. Several 
hazards happening currently at KIA were illustrated in this paper with the suggested preventions to 
control these hazards. The five step DMAIC methodology was used to describe the hazards and how they 
should be improved and controlled. A Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) technique was applied to investigate the 
hazards. At the end, SMS was proved to be an effective system to apply at KIA and which reflects the 
NEWKUWAIT vision towards a better and safer place to live in.

1. Introduction
Occupational safety and health issue is a serious action that is considered by many countries and is taken into 
account from many years ago (Abrey & Smallwood, 2014). Kuwait is one of those countries that consider the 
employees' safety and health as one of the fundamental issues that needs to be upgraded, improved, and developed 
every now and then. In this paper, we chose Kuwait international airport (KIA) as a real case facility related to 
safety and health issues. KIA is opposed to dangerous safety and health issues where both employees and passengers 
are under high risk. The most hazard problems at KIA are musculoskeletal disorders, temperature extremes, noise, 
and being affected due to cleaning materials. Therefore, proper safety and health assessment, preventions, controls, 
and methodology are necessary to be followed in order to avoid these hazards (Müller, Wittmer, & Drax, 2014). 
Many tools, techniques, and approaches such as Failure Tree Analysis (FTA), risk analysis, and safety management 
system (SMS) helped safety and health managers to make further judgment of hazards (Baig, Ruzli, & Buang, 
2013). SMS is an approach that is applied in (KIA) to manage safety risks that are associated with operational 
organization and activities performed by employees. The secret behind SMS implementation in KIA is that the 
International Organizational Civilization (IOC) has mandated (SMS) to be implemented in all sides of all airports in 
order to increase safety awareness and safety communication (Yuling  and Guldenmund, 2018). It is a system that 
manages activities in a clear processed way and documented manner (Thompson & Stephen, 2016). A successful 
implementation of SMS resulted in a significant reduction of risks and the severity of the accidents, as well as their 
cost; thus, reducing the injuries and the lost days away from work resulting from the accidents. (Stolzer & Goglia, 
2008)

5. Conclusion 
To sum up, in this paper a real life problem was studied by using methods and materials related to safety course. 
Many work places often suffer from lack of safety requirements which would cause hazards and would sometimes 
lead to series health problems or even death (Charles, 2003). KIA is one of the important facilities in Kuwait where 
not only local people work in it but it is also visited by global people from all around the world. Therefore, KIA 
needs to insure a safer environment which guarantees a better working place. This paper showed different hazard 
types that happen at KIA. It also described the main causes of these hazards. At the end, a methodology was 
constructed to show the steps of finding the problems and how they were eliminated and controlled. A fault tree 
analysis technique was applied. The results showed that SMS application guaranteed a better and safer environment 
to work at.  (Liou, Yen, Tzeng, 2008)

Abstract 
A Lagrangian Relaxation Heuristic (LRH) to solve the integrated distribution planning problem of 
selecting transportation mediums (conveyances), route selection, load consolidation and location of 
facilities has been studied in this paper.  The problem is known as Facility Location and Fixed charge 
Solid Transportation with real life applications of integrating several planning horizons of small, 
medium and long terms. A numerical example was proposed and solved using two different sets of 
Lagrange multipliers as starting values for the iterations performed and termed the first and second 
trial runs respectively. The CPLEX standard optimization software was used as a base for comparing 
the LRH obtained. A simple infeasibility resolution of the better LRH (second trial) lower bound 
solution was applied to obtain the CPLEX values. Extensive computations of various problem sizes 
and instances will however be required to validate the good performance of LRH (second trial) run 
obtained compared to using standard optimization solvers such as CPLEX. 
Keywords:  Facility location, Solid Transportation problem, Lagrange Relaxation Heuristic, Fixed 
Charge Problem.

Introduction
Distribution problems which involve merging various individual optimization problems have continued to be 
explored by researchers. Supply chain and Integrated distribution issues are clear examples of these. Usually, 
these individual optimization problems have different planning horizons from short, medium to long term. The 
suboptimal solutions obtained when individual solutions are desired amidst the integrated distribution problems 
have resulted in the search for a global solution.  
Facility location problems (FLP) which involve searching for the best locations out of other competing locations 
for distribution of products or services based on the objective criterion under consideration are still being 
explored in literature. The FLP has emerged from the simple plant location problem to various complex variants 
over the years.  Amongst those that developed early models on the FLP were Ray (1966) , Sá (1969) and Akinc 
and Khumawala (1977) . They considered the simple plant location models.  Holmberg and Ling (1996), 
Revelle and Laporte (1996), Agar and Salhi (1998), Hindi and Pieńkosz (1999)  extended the simple plant 
location model with capacitated plant location models of the multi objective, multiproduct type  and large scale 
single source capacitated models. The FLP has been formulated as mixed integer and mostly pure integer 
programming problems as seen in the works mentioned earlier. References could also be made to Krarup and 
Pruzan (1983), Klose and Görtz (2007), Arabani and Farahani (2012)  and Boujelben et al. (2016) on the various 
formulation of  FLP over the years. Recently, facility location models are being integrated into other planning

Discussion of  Solutions Obtained 
 
The Original Problem was coded into IBM CPLEX version 12.8 and solved with the default Mixed Integer 
Linear Programming (MILP) Solver. Table 5 below shows the results obtained for the decision variables under 
the different solution methods. The variables not shown were equal to zero (0) in the solution obtained.  It can 
be well observed in Table 5 below that the LRH for the second trial run gave the lowest value of 263.  The value 
(263) was obtained only due to the violation of one of the constraints used for the Lagrange Relaxation. This is 
constraint (5a) i.e.  𝑥𝑖𝑗𝑟  ≤  𝑀𝑖𝑗𝑟 𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑟 . The violation was at  𝑥 312
∗
= 20  and such that 𝑥 312
∗
 > (𝑀312 = 15). 
This violation was most likely due to the non-inclusion of possible infeasibility contradiction of the term 
𝑥 𝑖𝑗𝑟
∗
  >  𝑀𝑖𝑗𝑟 𝑦𝑖𝑗𝑟   for  𝑥 𝑖𝑗𝑟
∗
 > 0 under Upper bound formulation of FCSTLP of Section 2.4. By the 
infeasibility of constraint (5a), a lower bound was obtained. In addition, the different LRH values of  𝜆𝑖
∗ and 𝛽𝑖𝑗𝑟
∗ 
used as the starting solution for the lagrange multipliers  show how these values could help in the final lower 
bound or optimal solution reached by the heuristic.  
A simple infeasibility resolution of the lower bound solution obtained by LRH (second trial) to satisfy constraint 
(5a ) while  also satisfying demand constraints would result into the value obtained by the CPLEX values.

Conclusion And Future Direction 
 
The use of Lagrangian Relaxation Heuristic (LRH) in solving facility location and fixed charge solid 
transportation problem has been considered in this paper. The lower bound solution obtained for the LRH 
(second trial) was better compared to the value obtained for LRH (First trial) when the respective values 
obtained were compared to the CPLEX values. The results of the LRH could still result in a lower bound as was 
the case of the LRH(second trial) if possible infeasibility contradictions of the upper bound formulations are not 
well captured.  For the LRH (second trial), a careful perturbation to satisfy one of the violated constraints would 
result in the CPLEX values obtained.  In order to further test the performance of the LRH compared to the 
values obtainable from standard optimization software, extensive computations for various problem sizes and 
instances still have to be considered. It is also worth to note that a structured perturbation technique could be 
employed to resolve the possible LRH lower bound infeasibility. Furthermore during the LRH process, 
metaheuristics such as genetic algorithm, simulated annealing could be used to search for a better upper bound 
obtained, in case the solution fails to improve before the terminating conditions are reached.

Abstract 
In order to ascertain and measure supply chains, a wide range of supply chain maturity assessment models 
have been developed. Maturity models represent stages through which processes and organisations 
progress as they are defined, implemented and improved. The purpose of maturity models is to assist 
organisations to compare the maturity of their processes against best practices and further guide in the 
development of an improvement roadmap. Despite the proliferation maturity models, the maturity models 
have been troubled by criticism such as; maturity models lack strong theoretical foundation and empirical 
validity. It is however the primary objective of this study to investigate this claim by performing a 
comparative analysis of supply chain maturity models. The results of this paper are meant to serve as a 
manual for a detailed understanding of the documented supply chain maturity models.

 Introduction and problem statement 
The notion of evolution from an initial state to some more advanced state is called maturity (Fraser, Moultrie and 
Gregory, 2002). Maturity consist of stages that form  a desired path towards a goal (Pöppelbuß and Röglinger, 
2011). In an organisation, process maturity implies that processes are well comprehended, supported, monitored, 
documented and there is continuous training and improvement throughout the organisation (Fraser, Moultrie and 
Gregory, 2002).  
The concept of maturity models represent the stages through which processes and organisations progress as they are 
defined, implemented and improved (Clark and Jones, 1999). This can be achieved through institutionalization, 
policies and corporate culture  (Paulk et al., 1993). Pöppelbuß and Röglinger (2011) pointed out an interesting view 
that maturity models should not only focus on stages of development but should put emphasis on the elements that 
drive the evolution process towards a better state. The purpose of a maturity model is to assist companies to compare 
the maturity of their processes against best practice (Netland and Alfnes, 2008) and further provides a roadmap for 
improvement (Battista, Fumi and Schiraldi, 2012).  
Despite the proliferation maturity models, the maturity models have been troubled by criticism such as; maturity 
models lack strong theoretical foundation and empirical validity (Mettler, 2011). It is also noted that procedures and

assess current supply chain and guide improvements and also highlight best practices (Garcia Reyes and Giachetti, 
2010). 
Battista, Fumi and Schiraldi, (2012) constructed a five level logistics maturity model. Their motivation is that from 
the literature that they searched, there exists no easy to use framework. Therefore they developed a maturity model 
to support an organisation’s understanding of logistics processes that are immature and guide in the implementation 
of improvement initiatives in the logistics processes (Battista, Fumi and Schiraldi, 2012). This logistics maturity 
model was not empirically tested. 
Fischer et al., (2016) also developed a five stage supply chain flexibility maturity model. This maturity model is 
developed because there is no maturity model in the literature searched that measures the maturity of supply chain 
flexibility in different organisations (Fischer et al., 2016). The supply chain flexibility maturity model is tested in a 
toy manufacturing company. 
Ho, Kumar and Shiwakoti, (2016) also argue that there is lack of clear theoretical framework which guides 
organizations in implementing or improving the collaboration maturity level for a supply chain. Therefore, using 
CMM as a reference model, they developed a framework to analyze collaboration practices in organizations and 
develop a roadmap towards advanced collaboration in supply chain (Ho, Kumar and Shiwakoti, 2016). However this 
maturity model is not empirically tested. 
Mendes, Leal and Thome, (2016) developed the only demand driven supply chain maturity model for manufacturing. 
This model can be adapted in manufacturing organizations. The maturity mode was developed because it appears 
like there was no framework that combines dimensions of demand driven supply chain of Ayers (2002) and Lambert 
(2008) supply chain processes. The Frame work is for assessment of organization current DDSC maturity levels and 
helps in the development of a roadmap to set supply chain strategies (Mendes, Leal and Thome, 2016). 
It appears that supply chain related maturity models suggest that maturity starts at a basic level and progresses to a 
higher level of maturity. However, little emphasis is placed on the design of the ready-to-use and adaptable tools for 
maturity assessment and improvement.  Notably, the dimensions of these maturity models can be integrated to 
produce a more consolidated maturity model.  
Only one model proposed a demand driven supply chain maturity model for consumable movable goods.  This 
model adopted the supply chain processes proposed by Lambert (2008) as dimensions. The only weakness is that it 
only focuses on only how manufacturing companies can become demand driven and does not give guidance for 
other industries such as healthcare and retail. Another study by Ayers (2002) outline a maturity model that has 
demand driven supply chain being conceptualised as an enabler to implementation of information technology to 
support supply chain.

Abstract 
The ever increasing demand for energy could be solved by exploring the prospects of the renewability 
and availability of the input raw materials; food and animal wastes coupled with the availability of cost-
effective materials from local sources for development. This work studies the design, fabrication and 
performance evaluation of a smart system for the production of biogas. The plant was designed using 
Autodesk Inventor and fabricated with stainless steel due to its high resistance to biological corrosion. 
An Arduino Uno Microcontroller was also connected to a pressure, pH and temperature sensors to 
monitor the process parameters of the developed biogas plant. Optimization of the process parameters 
was carried out using the central composite design model and response surface methodology. Taking 
the biogas yield as the response of the designed experiment, the data obtained were statistically analysed 
to obtain a suitable model for optimization of biogas yield as a function of the process parameters.  The 
results obtained also show the temperature, pressure, pH and organic loading rate are critical factors 
that influences the yield of biogas production hence the need for proper monitoring. This will 
complement electricity generation for domestic uses and production of organic fertilizers to boost 
agricultural productivity.

Introduction
The ever increasing demand for energy could be solved by exploring the prospects of the renewability 
and availability of the input raw materials; food and animal wastes coupled with the availability of cost-
effective materials for development from local sources. In addition, uncontrolled food and organic 
waste indiscriminate dumping is no longer acceptable in the economy today and even controlled landfill

optimization of the developed biogas plant. The optimum conversion of substrate to methane gas was 
41.5% within 84 days. The percent conversion of the substrate to methane gas was observed to decrease 
with the increase in the number of days and the weight of input waste. Hence, for optimum substrate 
conversion, there is need for periodic loading in between the time interval for conversion.

Abstract 
The photo-catalysis technology has been effective and efficient in the reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) 
in wastewater. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most commonly used photo-catalyst and plays significant a 
major role in reducing COD concentration levels in wastewater. The polyaniline (PANI) was synthesized using an 
in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization method. This work focused on the reduction of COD in distillery 
wastewater using an annular rector under batch mode. The influent was diluted at different concentration levels of 
about 5 ml/l, 10 ml/l and 20 ml/l. The pH condition was adjusted at pH of 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00 and 5.00 in order to 
evaluate its effect on the COD reduction efficiencies. The TiO2/PANI was prepared in different ratios and was 
allowed to mix with the wastewater for a good homogeneity mixture. The experiments were carried out at ambient 
temperature (± 25 ºC), whereby solutions were pumped into the photo reactor (annular) inserted with a 25 UVC 
lamp. The results indicated that the concentrations of all three solutions without the catalyst decreased from 355 
mg/l, 655 mg/l and 837 mg/l to 325 mg/l, 572 mg/l and 820 mg/l, respectively. The solutions containing the catalyst 
also decreased from 325 mg/l, 572 mg/l and 820 mg/l to 344 mg/l, 475 mg/l and 752 mg/l, respectively. The results 
showed an increasing reduction trend of 2%, 2%, 19%, 20% and 26 % when the catalyst was used at pH of 6.0. It 
can be concluded that photo-catalysis can reduce COD in distillery wastewater when running under both 
recirculation and continuous. It can therefore be recommended that higher adjustments of pH can be done, and the 
process can be operated for more than 2 hours to further enhance the COD reduction in distillery wastewater.

1. Introduction
The effluents produced by most of the industries (gaseous or liquid) are harmful to health and the environment in 
general. The presence of undesired substances in liquid effluents can be disastrous as they pose serve threats to the 
immediate recipients. Wastewater from various factories, industries, laboratories, etc. are serious problems to the 
environment(Akpan and Hameed, 2009). 
Different industrial effluents such as agrochemical, Kraft-bleaching, pulp and paper, and distillery wastes contains 
biological organic contaminants which are not easily removed by biological treatment (Susree et al., 2013). 
Distillery wastewater usually contains extremely high traces of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Organic 
Carbon (TOC) and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) which cannot be released into the environment without 
treatment(Selvanathan and Deshpande, 2014).  
The shortage of fresh water has led to the exploration of effective technologies for treatment of wastewater for reuse 
purposes. Conventional wastewater treatment is said to be inefficient when coming to the degradation of 
contaminants such as organic compound, since the micro – organic pollutants have the ability to avoid elimination in 
most wastewater treatment plants(Mecha et al., 2017).  
Amongst the many techniques developed for wastewater treatment, the use of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) 
has be implemented to refinement the effluents of wastewater to the required standards. The AOPs have been

5. Conclusions and Recommendations  
5.1 Conclusions  
The study was conducted to evaluate the reduction of COD in distillery wastewater using the PANI/TiO2 catalyst. 
From the experiments conducted, it can be seen that photo-catalysis of distillery wastewater was an efficient process 
of degrading COD, the results showed the process is effect with and without the addition of a catalyst. However, an 
addition of a catalyst increases the efficiency. Results showed that the reduction of COD in distillery wastewater can 
be done using photo-degradation, however, the process requires more processing time and an addition of a catalyst 
to be efficient.  
 
The results obtained the from the 5 ml/l diluted distillery wastewater, for both the solutions (without and with the 
catalyst) showed no consistence in decrease of the COD concentrations. The results for the 10 ml/l and 20 ml/l 
diluted distillery wastewater showed a decrease in concentration. Therefore, the UV light had an effect on the 
concentration with the assistance of the catalyst. 
 
One can conclude that pH has a great effect on the reduction of COD, as seen from results in figure 3-5. The results 
showed COD reduction of 2%, 2%, 19%, 20% and 26 % when pH was adjusted to 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively, all 
operated under the same conditions (room temperature, stirring speed = 360 rpm, pumping speed = 55 ml/min).  
 
5.2 Recommendations  
Results showed the reduction of COD in distillery wastewater, proving that photo-catalysis is one of the process that 
can be used to treat this type of effluent. However, the study recommends that the process should be conducted for 
more than 2 hours and be conducted under isolation (the beaker containing the solution should be closed) to prevent 
any sort of contamination.  
 
In addition, the hypothesized 50% reduction of COD could have been achieved if the pH was adjusted to be more 
basic (< 7), by observing the obtained results. The result might show a different deviation if the process was 
conducted in both batch and continuous mode. Due to time constraints and lack of distillery wastewater, the process 
was conducted only in batch mode.

Abstract 
The innovation ecosystem perspective and value chain perspective on innovation platforms are well 
established lenses in the literature. This paper reviews three case study research designs techniques namely 
casual process tracing (CPT), congruence analysis (CON) and systematic combining (SC). CPT relies on 
empirical observations to provide a rich description of casual process. CON focus on drawing inferences 
from concrete observations with predictions deduced from theories to relevance of these theories. SC allows 
a continuous evolution of theoretical frameworks, fieldwork, and case analysis to development of new 
theories. A detailed description of each approach is given by highlighting the focus of the approach, theories 
that can be evaluated, case selection criteria, data generation mechanisms, analytical approaches and 
expected generalisations. CON was identified as the most suitable approach to satisfy the objective of the 
research.  The contribution of this article is development of steps to conduct the case study. The steps 
developed are 1) research question generation 2) development of theoretical frameworks 3) selection of 
cases 4) observations 5) analysis and 6) generalisations. The next area of research in this study is the 
development of theoretical frameworks from innovation ecosystems perspective and value chain 
perspective.

1. Introduction
Africa faces major challenges to improve the quality of life of its citizens leading to greater equity,
economic growth and social stability. The disease burden of illnesses such as HIV/AIDS, Malaria and TB
in Africa are devastating to societies and perpetuate economic and social marginalisation of Africa’s people.
Challenges faced towards equitable access to and quality of healthcare include inadequate resources, limited
access to health services and technologies and abject poverty. The role of innovation and its importance to
achieve improved healthcare is widely acknowledged and have also been identified as priorities in the
Sustainable Development Goals through SDG3 (Good Health and wellbeing) (UNDP 2015a) as well as
SDG9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) (UNDP 2015b). South African public healthcare sector is
under resourced, overloaded and often characterized as being inefficient in terms of meeting its mission of
accessible quality health care (Mayosi et al. 2012). On the other end the private sector has been reputed for
its world-class facilities and care provision (Pillay 2009). Public healthcare challenges sector are grouped
into four categories which are 1) strategic challenges, 2) demographics, 3) social determinants and 4)
epidemiological profile of the country.

Development 
of 
theoretical frameworks  
Theoretical frameworks which contains abstract concepts of innovation platforms will 
be developed through the grounded theory method.  
3) Selection of cases  
Selection of relevant case is according to researchers aspirations and the authors will 
select a case in South African healthcare system. 
4) Observations 
Generation of data corresponding to the expectations deduced from abstract theories. 
This will be achieved through semi structured interviews with platform facilitators 
and stakeholders in the identified cases. The expected resultant is a set of 
confirmations and or contradictions for each theoretical framework under 
investigation.  
5) Analysis 
Will identify the differences among the theories in respect to the level of congruence 
between expectations and observations. Account the relative importance of selected 
theories and develop a comprehensive explanation through integration of abstract 
theories. 
6) Conclusion  
Will draw conclusions from the explanatory power of frameworks and their relevance 
to scientific discourse.  
  
The contribution of this study is the selection of an appropriate case study research approach and structuring 
steps to conduct the case study. Proper structuring of the study aids in countering some of criticisms to case 
study approach and gives transparency to the entire exercise. The next research stage for this study is 
development of theoretical frameworks from  the innovations ecosystem perspective and value chain 
perspective.

Abstract 
Adaptive control are often employed to improve the performance of rail car in terms of stability, safety 
and ride comfort. In this study, a PID controlled active suspension system was designed, modelled and 
simulated. The parameters investigated include; the vertical and pitch acceleration as well as the rate of 
rejection of input and output disturbances. The developed model for the linear rail car suspension system 
of two degrees of freedom was formulated using the equation of motion while the simulation was 
performed in the Matlab Simulink 2017 environment. Also, the PID controller was used to fine tune the 
systems performance according to the Ziegler-Nichols tuning rules.  The results obtained show that the 
designed PID controlled active suspension system is highly efficient in minimizing the effect of load 
and rail disturbances as the magnitude of the parameters investigated were kept within the permissible 
limits. This enhances ride comfort, safety and good stability.

Introduction
During the operation of a rail car, there are disturbances that offsets the balance of a rail car which arises 
as a result of irregular rail profile otherwise known as rail disturbances or as a result of load impressed 
upon the rail car during movement. Hence, the dynamic behaviour of a rail car is a major function of 
both the track irregularities or track inputs as well as load inputs which are modelled as deterministic 
and random variables (Sharma and Kumar, 2013). The bogie of a rail car consists of the primary and 
secondary suspensions designed to enhance ride comfort, safe curve negotiation and good dynamic

4. Conclusion 
A PID controlled active suspension system was modelled and simulated in a MATLAB-Simulink 2017 
environment. The goal of the PID control is to increase the rise time, decrease the settling time with 
minimal percent overshoot and zero steady state error. Upon fine tuning, the proportional term was 
observed to improve the rise time, while the integral term sufficiently eliminated the overshoot and the 
derivative term was also observe to reduce the percent overshoot via adequate damping. The control 
system also proved efficient in rejecting the input and output disturbances which could alter the system’s 
performance. Hence, the efficient control of the system via the PID significantly reduced the effect of 
vibrations due to disturbances thereby increasing ride comfort. The use of Fuzzy-PID control system is 
recommended for optimum performance of the system.

and the Impact on the Number of Engineering Metallurgy 
Graduates

Abstract 
Lack of in-service training in the field of engineering metallurgy at local foundries has had a negative 
impact on the number of graduates who are offered an opportunity to complete practical training and to 
graduate. This leads to shortage of skilled foundrymen and foundry-women who can take the industry 
forward and help South Africa compete globally. Universities and foundries need partnerships to establish 
ways in which foundry skills are taught to young technicians. To achieve this, a quantitative study was 
conducted and data were collected and analysed to investigate the participants’ understanding of lack of 
in-service training and its effect on skills development in foundries. Expert review of the collected data 
was conducted to complete triangulation. Descriptive analysis was based on actual data collected from all 
foundries which were randomly selected. Using this information, three types of questions were adopted 
during interviews and document review. Frequency and percentage distribution graphs were employed to 
display the results for easy interpretation of trends. Based on the data collected and resultant analysis, 
three main factors were found to contribute 71% of the problem and recommendations were made based 
on these findings.  These included financial support and budget, lack of government support and lack of 
training awareness.

1. Introduction
Foundries generally melt ferrous and non-ferrous metal charges and / or alloys and reshape them into products 
through the pouring and solidification of the molten metal or alloy into moulds (Juganan and Paterson, 2012).  The 
foundry industry is a complex and very diverse sector. It consists of a wide range of processes from very simple to 
complicated practices. Differences that exist within this industry are based on the type of metal melted, with the 
main distinction being made between ferrous and non-ferrous foundries. Philip (2012) states that, since castings in 
general are semi-finished products, most foundries are situated not far away from customers, where the products are 
often machined, assembled and shipped to end users. 
Ribeiro (2009) reports that the South African manufacturing industry has been in decline for the past ten years due 
to job losses. Local foundries are not an exception and have experienced bigger challenges of late; and history 
indicates that they have declined for more than a decade now. ‘Market research conducted by the South African 
Institute of Foundrymen (SAIF) in 2015 indicated that about 170 foundries melt metals and alloys for a wide variety 
of applications and about 20 produce the bulk of the output, mostly for the mining sector’ (Jardine, 2015). South 
Africa consisted of about 450 foundries in the 1980s and around 200 in 2003. Between 2007 and 2011 another 13%

4.4. Budget 
 
Budget was rated first and 83% of respondents rated between (1-4), indicating that a large majority of the 
respondents believed that budget independently was a highly contributing factor to the lack of in-service training in 
foundries. The finding confirms the report by Dewhurst and McMurtry (2006) that discusses the economic 
challenges facing the manufacturing industry.  In the report Juganan and Paterson (2012) emphasize the importance 
of financial and technical support to the industry to improve skills development and training. 
 
4.5. Lack of Government Support 
 
Lack of government support does not necessarily translate to financial support, but rather to broad factors such as 
operations, process improvement and protection from increasing costs of raw materials and electricity. Most of the 
respondents also related this factor to the government’s failure to introduce a hefty import tax of cast products from 
China and India which are delivered in South Africa significantly cheaper than the local cost of production per ton. 
75% of the respondents strongly believe that this factor was a primary contributor to training challenges.  
Interestingly, 25% of the respondents believe that the foundries share an equal responsibility of ensuring that they 
impart skills through in-service training of young students.  
 
4.6. Lack of Training Awareness 
 
Another factor which needed close attention was a “lack of training awareness” to foundries. This included 
awareness of the role that foundries could play: not only for knowledge improvement but also to assist students to 
complete training and graduation. Referring to Table 5, 75% of respondents rated lack of training awareness high as 
they believed it was a significant contributing factor. The finding contradicted results with earlier questions 
answered by respondents in Figure 1, as 76% of respondents indicated that they understood the importance of in-
service training. It is valid to deduce that, if 76% of respondents understand the importance of in-service training, 
awareness of training at foundries should exist. It may also imply that foundries are aware of the importance of in-
service training, but they do not have the mechanisms or knowledge to execute training.  
 
4.7. Document Review 
 
Document review of training records was conducted to establish whether foundries were in possession of documents 
related to in-service training of students. Only 8% of 52 foundries indicated that there were documents regarding 
training of employees and skills development, thus shedding light on the efforts established by foundries to help 
students with training.  
 
4.8. Expert Review 
 
Expert review was employed as the final research tool to triangulate and validate the collected data. The findings 
were discussed with the former Chief Executive Officer of the South African Institute for Foundrymen for insight in 
the results. The three primary contributors to the lack of in-service training in foundries were confirmed by the 
foundry expert. 
 
5. Conclusions  
 
A quantitative study was conducted to determine the reasons for South African foundries not taking students for in-
service training.  The data analysis collected from 52 foundries presented interesting findings and answers to the 
research questions.  The study revealed that there are three primary factors that respondents believe contribute to 
foundries not giving students opportunities for in-service training, namely budget, lack of government support, and 
lack of training awareness. Respondents indicated that they believe universities, the government and the foundry 
industry are disconnected in purpose and support of one another. The respondents indicated that this division 
influenced and negatively impacted the number of students who are not able to graduate each year due to lack of in-
service training.

The following trends were identified from the data collected. Fifty-two (52) foundries were visited but only four (4) 
indicated that their training documents were up-to-date and made mention of in-service training for undergraduate 
students. From the four foundries, two were owned fully or partially by the Industrial Development Corporation 
(IDC). This indicated that the presence of the IDC ensured that the culture of training students was preserved and 
improvements were made on existing documents. 
 
Large foundries with more than 100 employees and more than 5 000 tons of castings sold per annum, showed that 
most processes were documented, and that training documents were in place. These foundries indicated that they 
had employed students in the past for in-service training. 
 
Ninety percent (90%) of foundries visited were family-owned businesses with between 5 to 300 employees. The 
focus of these foundries is to ensure the survival of the business, thus in-service training was deemed unnecessary 
and resource-consuming. Most of the respondents representing this category showed dissatisfaction regarding 
government institutions. These are the foundries that indicated no confidence in the standard of teaching and 
learning, and were not impressed with students’ commitment and technical abilities. 
 
6. Recommendations 
 
Financial support and budget, and government support, were the highest rated factors contributing to the lack of in-
service training. It is recommended that the Department of Trade and Industry and the Industrial Development 
Corporation, together with the assistance of universities, explore the possibility to establish financial mechanisms to 
assist students to obtain training. Foundries that are proactive in this endeavor should be identified and rewarded for 
their efforts towards student graduation. 
 
Respondents indicated that they are unaware of the need for the mandatory one-year in-service training in order for 
students to complete graduation. Each foundry has the potential to help at least one student at a time and all 
foundries need to understand this process and how they can assist. Universities with the support of relevant 
departments need to approach foundries and explain the process and encourage them to commit to the project. 
 
Only four foundries were in possession of updated documents related to the training of students. Training processes 
should be designed with clear training requirements to ensure that students are exposed to different departments; and 
that they are able to effectively contribute to the goals and business strategy of foundries.

Abstract 
The paper presents case study findings on the effect of poor health and safety performance and the high rate 
of non-compliance by construction stakeholders in South African construction sites. A case study of the 
Tongaat mall collapse, which was caused by a failure of columns, was conducted. The accident was studied 
to assess whether or not stakeholders were compliant with the provisions of health and safety legislation. 
The study also evaluates whether the inquiry that was established to investigate the accident managed to 
hold the stakeholders accountable for their actions or inactions.  The findings from the case study suggest 
that the non-compliance of stakeholders led to an accident that could have been avoided. Furthermore, gaps 
were identified in the legislation in so far the regulating body was responsible for holding non-compliant 
parties accountable.   The research provides select contributing factors to the slow progress in health and 
safety performance in the industry. Understanding and addressing the issues highlighted in the research 
may contribute towards increasing the improvement of health and safety performance in the South African 
Construction Industry.

Stakeholder Accountability, Compliance, Health and Safety 
1. Introduction
The construction industry has been described by different scholars as one of the most dangerous sectors in which to 
work (Okorie, Emuze, Smallwood and van Wyk, 2014; López-Alonso, Ibarrondo-Dávila, Rubio-Gámez and Munoz, 
2013). This observation is supported by the high numbers of incidents and accidents in the South African construction 
industry (CiDB, 2009). In an effort to mitigate poor health and safety performance, South Africa (RSA) has invested 
much effort in the development of construction legislation and policies.  
Despite the efforts that have been invested in legislation to improve health and safety performance, it has been 
acknowledged that non-compliance with the legislation and the related regulations is a major challenge in the industry. 
In the 2015/16 financial year, there was an average of 12 500 construction sites in South Africa, and 40% of these 
sites were non-compliant with the provisions of health and safety legislation (Department of Labour (DoL), 2017). 
Investigations identify deliberate ignorance of the law in the interest of profit maximization (Petterson, 2016). 
Poor performance of health and safety in the South African construction industry presents a significant cost to the 
country (Haupt and Pillay, 2016). The Construction Regulations were introduced to improve health and safety in the 
industry, but cost, quality and time are still considered more important (Smallwood and Haupt, 2007). The issue of 
health and safety in the industry is not only a local problem; the United Kingdom is also recording poor performance 
with minimal documented improvement (Manu, Ankrah, Proverbs and Suresh, 2014). In 2014, the Council for the

Is the focus on the mechanism generating the error than on human error (blame 
searching)? 
Yes 
Does the forum conduct its own investigation to collect evidence and the necessary 
documents before cross-examining the involved parties? (information phase) 
Yes 
Is the incident investigation holistic in its approach? Are all stakeholders directly 
and indirectly involved in the accident consulted? (debating phase) 
Yes 
What are the consequences of the corporate actions or inactions? Imprisonment of 
corporate officials imposed or financial penalties?   
(consequence phase)   
No 
 
Is the regulating body in the construction industry effective in implementing the 
accountability systems?  
No 
 
 
Table 4 demonstrates the use of the pattern matching technique to examine the influence of ineffective Section 32 on 
stakeholders’ compliance in a construction site. Documentary review was employed to test the patterns in the findings 
against the predicted patterns. The pattern that was identified both in the article and DoL reports was that the contractor 
was not following procedure or was non-compliant. The second pattern was the gap that exists in the legislation that 
limits the DoL as the regulating body to enforce compliance. Similarly, in the DoL reports, it was of great concern 
that the department did not have the power to prosecute, and as a result stakeholders do not ensure compliance to 
necessary regulations. It is therefore valid to conclude that the South African regulating body is ineffective in holding 
stakeholders accountable, and as a result stakeholders are not encouraged to be compliant to health and safety   
regulations on construction sites.

5. 
Discussion and Conclusion 
The findings provide important lessons as they unveil the level of non-compliance in the Tongaat mall case. Although 
the findings in this single case study cannot be generalised to the entire construction industry, they do provide informed 
conclusions of the current practice in the industry.   
 
The literature underpins the importance of enforcing compliance in order to minimize incidents in the construction 
industry. The regulating body in South Africa, the DoL, must be empowered to enforce compliance, and to hold 
offenders accountable for their actions or inaction. The Tongaat mall case presents a situation in which compliance 
with statutory requirement was poor. Both the client and the contractor opted to proceed with construction work 
without a permit to work, or at least informing the department as per statutory requirement. The contractor also failed 
to develop a health and safety plan or a risk file; and the client did not ensure that it was implemented in terms of the 
responsibility bestowed on him or her.

The root cause the incident can be attributed to non-compliance of the stakeholders. A competent construction manager 
or an alternate supervisor ought to be appointed by the contractor to manage construction work and to ensure 
occupational health and safety compliance. If a competent supervisor had been present doing the work, they may have 
ensured the construction method complies with the required standards. Further, the concrete test results could have 
offered an indication of an imminent incident. 
 
The findings against the contractor suggest that he was not competent to perform the work. The failure to work from 
drawings and the failure to conduct cube tests were two of the factors highlighted as proof of incompetence. The client 
was expected to appoint a competent contractor and ensure that he executes the work accordingly. The client’s 
involvement in the project was minimal since the majority of the responsibility was surrendered to the contractor. It 
may be argued that this was due to unwillingness of the client to comply with legislation. 
 
The client was involved in only two occasions, namely the appointment of the contractor and halting the work when 
issued with court papers. As discussed in the literature review, the client has an active role to play throughout the 
project lifecycle; in particular, at the beginning of the project where he/she is expected to apply for permit to work. 
Furthermore, he/she was expected to ensure that the contractor had implemented a health and safety plan. The client 
also confirmed to be unaware of the requirements of the Construction regulations. Such a position automatically places 
the client in breach of compliance.  
 
The DoL as the regulating body has a duty to ensure the legislation is upheld and respected by all construction 
stakeholders. Parties failing to comply with the statutory requirements must be held accountable, and key to ensuring 
compliance is the response to non-compliant parties. After a rigorous process of ascertaining accountability, the 
commission failed to punish the non-compliant parties. Instead, the commission recommended an investigation by the 
NPA for possible prosecution. One and a half years since the report was handed over to the NPA, no action 
materialized. The Minister of the DoL conceded to the shortcomings in the legislation, in particular the lack of power 
to prosecute or hand down harsher penalties. As it is, the DoL can issue a fine for non-compliance, which appears to 
be ineffective given that the amount is relatively low for corporate companies.  
 
Another great concern noted on the part of the regulating body is the length of time it took to complete the inquiry. 
Extended inquiry processes exacerbates the pain of the victims. The Sandton bridge collapse is another example of 
delays in the accounting processes; two years since the collapse, the inquiry is yet to commence. 
 
The research conducted in this case study clearly demonstrates how non-compliance by stakeholders contributes to 
the accidents and incidents on a construction site. Furthermore, the study demonstrates how the Section 32 inquiry 
was ineffective in holding stakeholders accountable for non-compliance to necessary and established regulation.

Abstract 
The development of the fourth industrial revolution has provided different inventions for assessing 
real-time locations among them includes RFID (Radio Frequency Identification). Thus, this study 
proposes fusing RFID with mobile technology for easy identification of construction workers on 
site towards enhancing construction safety. The study adopted convenience purposive sampling 
method in obtaining data from selected construction professionals in Gauteng Province South 
Africa. A total of 34 questionnaires were obtained from the construction professionals out of 40 
that was distributed. The data were analyzed with SPSS V 24, using, frequency distribution. The 
result from the analysis shows that the construction professionals are willing to adopt RFID for 
construction safety purpose. The study concludes that fusing RFID with mobile technology will 
decrease occurrence of accident on construction site. The article provides an innovative approach 
towards improving the safety of construction workers as it changes the perception of safety 
personnel from a reactive point of view to a proactive approach. Hence, it is envisaged that 
innovative ideas for ensuring construction workers safety will require an interdisciplinary 
collaboration between computer scientist and safety personnel.

Table 2 showed that almost all (82.4) of the respondents are aware of the possibilities for using 
RFID for monitoring construction safety. These findings coincide with studies done by Vaha, et 
al. (2008) and Yang et al. (2012) as they indicated that construction professionals are aware of the 
potentials of RFID. Table 2 further shows that a cumulative of 61.8% of the respondents are ready 
to adopt RIFD with their mobile phones on their construction site for safety purpose while 14.7% 
are neutral about the adoption of RFID. This confirms that construction professionals are open to 
the use of mobile phones for the reader when using RFID.  
 
Almost all (73.5%) of the respondents agreed with the opinion that RFID has the potentials for 
curbing the health hazards experience on construction site while 8.8% are neutral about the use of 
RFID. 
 
 
5. Conclusion  
Towards the reduction of occupational hazards, this study proposes the combination of RFID with 
mobile technology for enhanced safety of construction project team members. The use of RFID 
became popular after the growth of Industry 4.0. It has been applied to the various field of work 
such as; electronic toll collection, book tracking in the library, animal tracking on farms, E-
passport, supply chain and many others. It will work on construction sites through the fixing of 
wireless sensors (tags) on construction workers safety protective equipment for ease monitoring 
of their activity. The mobile phones will serve as RFID reader with the intention of saving cost 
and changing the way in which information is passed. Also, the use of RFID technology will reduce 
time spent on manual monitoring while taking construction safety from reactive to a more 
proactive approach. 
 
The study revealed that the construction professionals are willing to adopt RFID for construction 
safety purposes. Also, they agree with the opinion that fusing RFID with mobile technology will 
reduce the occupational hazards on construction site. Thus, this study recommends that 
construction professional bodies should create more awareness regarding the use of RFID for 
construction safety. Also, more research should be conducted on the hinderance of fusing mobile 
technology with RFID for construction safety in South Africa construction industry.

Abstract 
It is important for companies to have a quality management system in place to ensure that the products are 
quality certified. This study was conducted in a small engineering company. A needs analysis was 
conducted and areas that needed interventions were identified. The processes and operations were studied 
to understand the process flow and how the processes are interrelated. The company did not have an 
adequate quality control in place and the quality management system needed to be revised and updated. 
Quality documents were developed and implemented to improve quality and processes. PDCA cycle and 
control charts were used to investigate and improve quality control.

In order to get feedback from customers XYZ Engineering needs to send out customer satisfaction surveys. The 
company did not have these documents in place. It was important to develop and implement these documents so that 
the company can have an idea of where they are lacking in terms of their service. The customer survey is a list of 
questionnaires related to quality and delivery times.  
One the important aspect of quality improvement is the development of employees. Training needs were identified 
for all employees and the plan was developed based on the identified training needs. A training development plan 
was developed and put in place. The following documents were developed and implemented for quality 
improvements: 
• 
Non- conformance corrective action plan 
• 
Customer satisfaction survey sheet 
• 
Customer satisfaction analysis sheet 
• 
Human capital development plan. 
5.  Conclusions 
The aim of the study was to develop and implement Juran’s trilogy. During the course of the project, it emerged that 
the quality management system needed to be reviewed and updated. The quality manual was revised and all the 
documentation was updated. The developed documents will significantly improve processes at XYZ Engineering. It 
is recommended that the company instill the culture of quality control by each individual in order to continuously 
improve. The use of correct quality documents must be emphasised to ensure quality assurance and quality control 
at all times. It is also empirical that the revision number on the quality documents be changed each time a document 
changes, which is in line with quality management system control of documents. In order for the company to receive 
feedback on their service from their customers, they need to send customer satisfaction surveys. This will assist 
them to identify areas of improvement.

Abstract
Given any two univariate survival functions, not necessarily from the same class of the corresponding 
probability distributions. We present a new method for construction such bivariate survival functions that 
the two, given in advance, univariates become either the marginal or baseline distributions for it.  
The constructed joint survival functions are given in two equivalent product forms which are universal.  
Each bivariate model can be expressed in either form, one when using baseline distributions, and the other 
when the marginals are initially given. The simple and nice relationship between the two forms is 
expressed as the proven theorem. Both representations are always analytical representations of the same 
bivariate model, and each model possesses both the representations, which in some cases are analytically 
identical.  
The representations yield a powerful tool for construction of new stochastic models with numerous 
applications such as reliability, biomedical problems and econometric.   
The universality of both the representations suggests to be an alternative to the copula methodology.

Abstract 
Petroleum and its products are a major source of energy that plays a vital role in society, powering many 
essential tools that human life depends on. Supply-chain management is very important in the petroleum 
industry. Few continents have petroleum reserves, hence there is a need for efficient methods of managing 
the sourcing, storage and distribution processes across the globe. There have been major improvements in 
safety management practices, during extraction and processing, in transit, and in situ distribution. Bulk 
storage of petroleum plays a crucial role across the world as it eases distribution hassles and can act as 
emergency reserves in the event of disruptions in the supply chain. However, lighter fractions of petroleum 
have a tendency to evaporate during storage as they are highly volatile. Although there are mechanisms 
such as floating roofs that have been invented to effectively reduce evaporative losses of light petroleum 
fractions, the percentage of losses are still high, particularly in some climatic conditions. On average, 
floating roofs allow leeway for loss tolerances of +/- 0.2% of throughput. Unleaded petrol tanks record 
significant losses beyond the acceptable tolerances. The Botswana climate is semi-arid, which makes bulk 
oil storage facility manager cautious about prevailing conditions at their storage reserves. Trends analysed 
show losses well above the stated tolerance range. This article illustrates the analysis conducted to 
comprehend the root cause for losses experienced by bulk oil storage tanks (BOSTs) and decision making 
solution to tackle the problem of excessive evaporative losses in similar climatic conditions.

With regards to relative humidity, no clear correlation can be established with the losses, see Figure 9 above.  
4. Conclusion 
Based on the data analysis in the previous sections, it can be concluded that the root cause for excessive evaporative 
losses from storage tanks comes from high ambient temperatures and associated climate conditions. The floating roof 
method, although it curbs escape of petroleum vapour, the method falls short in semi-arid regions. Regular inspection 
of the floating roofs at the study site proved a proper integrity of the system analysed. A feasible resolve has therefore 
been reached for a robust technical solution. This feasible resolve would suppress the excessive losses to within 
allowable limits. Further endeavours to solve the problem of excessive losses in bulk oil storage tanks will explore 
various methods of recovering the vapour. Thus, enhancing the integrity of current floating roofs, and reviewing results 
oriented innovative methods available in the oil and gas industry. This will go a long way in improving the supply-
chain management system for the oil and gas industry.

Abstract 
The Kingdom of Bahrain, as many other countries suffers from land scarcity, caused by the 
overpopulation. This directed them to substitute city designing, based on fundamentals of sustainability. 
Unfortunately, Government had only one quick solution to accommodate the swift urbanization and that 
was land reclamation upon the surrounding Gulf water. However, buildings off the Seashore as floated or 
within the sea with platform foundation are other solutions for the arising problem. Consequently, it will 
save the marine life and prevent the reclamation of land by constructing sustainable and affordable 
vertical buildings that will have large number of civic activities rather than reclaimed ones. No doubt, that 
constructing such buildings will consider many issues. For instance, social issues and needs in term of 
physiological adaption of new habitat i.e. water and sensitively in walkability and living offshore beside 
safety and privacy, while engineering subjects in term of technical services, structure system that face the 
hazards of earthquakes and fire protection. Finally, the environmental consideration in term of preserving 
fauna, flora, sewer (gray and black water) treatments, and recycling. This research paper covers the 
proposition of the Water city that briefly examines the theoretical roots of the proposal. 
Keywords  
Underwater – global warming – land reclamation – environment – climatic change 
1. Research Philosophy and Inspiration
Water, the crux of existence, figure of clarity, freshness, beauty and nativity, it narrates emotions of calmness and 
peace. Architects have used water as a design element during antiquity, by nature it is utilized both as material and 
as spiritual entity. Human is amalgam of mind, body and soul, just as body nourishes with food, soul and mind 
nourishes with peace. The urban fabric is deduced from modernization with tall structures and auto mobilization. 
Human being is surrounded by layers of rigid concrete and as a refuge to our psyche natural elements of which 
water is one should be incorporated into the domain (Salimi, et. al., 2016). 
The approach for proposing such research idea comes from an integration of the people connection with water and 
the history of Bahrain. It focuses on the phenomenological approach that mainly deals with the essence of human 
experience of the space and place provided with a unique experiencing phenomenon by combining the art, form, 
textures, function, psychology, visual impact, engineering services and time. Tadao Ando’s design approach depicts 
the manipulation of natural sources such as water, light, wind giving a poetic essence along with an unforgettable 
sensory experience (Hsu, et. Al., 2015). Heidigger’s Hermeneutic Phenomenology, focuses on the natural 
experience that unavoidably occurs by simply existing in the world., ""People understand new things through the 
prism of what they know"" this quote by Heidigger's reflects the idea being used in the project of making people 
experience a new yet natural space that is inside out.

5. Conclusion  
The above-mentioned shows that reclaiming of land if at one point shows the modernity of a country and attracts 
tourists but at the same point it deprives the country men from its originality specifically in Bahrain. Water is a 
symbol of survival for living organisms and it serves the same purpose for the currently faced issues. It seems 
strange that after so many provided proofs and facts adding up in favor of the existence of GLOBAL WARMING, 
SEA LEVEL RISE and threats related to them, many still deny its existence. Nevertheless, as human race develops 
and steps into a hopefully more enlightened future, perhaps going to the very roots of our genetic programming is 
just as important as it always has been. Survival and Preservation of the Species. Global Warming and Sea Level 
Rise are paramount issues facing the whole of World's Population and technically sound and Cost-effective 
construction seems to be a prominent solution to these problems which can ensure safety and betterment of the 
Long-term future. 
… So the proposal that is being suggested in this paper is that instead of reclaiming the land why 
not build in/on the water!!!

Abstract 
University campuses meets the different academic disciplines. Such campuses are microcosm of cities 
where it meets academic facilities like colleges, libraries, common areas, sports buildings, roads and 
services, residential multiple students, staff and faculty, and facilities of various services such as business 
services and water purification stations, electricity, sanitation and other support facilities. Also, include 
places and services, recreational activities, education and sports that help to strengthen life. The have 
supported facilities and varied management issues, in a manner to meet the humanitarian needs of most 
users of such university cities.  
Thinking about operation university campus, there is a need for dependency on effective accurate system, 
for university campuses. The expecting system is to treat with the variables of the administration, 
operation and maintenance of complex and interrelated aspects. It was necessary to think and search for 
the perfect way, as part of management plans university campus to start the implementation phase and e-
operation as well, which was concentrated on the employment of technology in solving many problem. 
The research idea depends on the thought that GIS can play positively in managing maintenance phase’s 
obstacle for the formulation of outcomes management university campuses. 
Keywords 
University campus – G.I.S. – e-services and maintenance 
1. Introduction
Technicalities of e-Operation has multi-application in urban planning field. It is an effective technique in the 
management of the academic process of education. It has the possibilities to share in urban spatial management in 
university campus in general and focus to the ability of spatial absorptive available to labs and classrooms, in 
particular. The speed and accuracy overlay the way for decision-makers in making their proper decisions in clear 
and strong processes of maintenance for the university campus in interrelated aspects. Its significant appears within 
the construction phase and extend to the operation simultaneously. It increases the life span of the project 
components of facilities. 
As a pool of information in the hands of the analyst does not come to any other technology in its field. In addition to 
the code made great strides, it is worth mentioning that the techniques of e-services allow the use of different 
approaches and a variety of tools and sophisticated.  
Remote sensing and geographic information systems (G.I.S.) can take care of spatial data for the implementation of 
a project. Also connecting its data is spatial since some time, and became the two flags associated with each other in 
most studies in the present day, especially after the dramatic rise in Computer Science in solidarity to facilitate the 
tasks of e-services 
Research problem 
Regularly, decisions makers face critical problems and difficulty while operating large urban projects. Running 
maintenance program for university campus interrelated aspects especially that most of the buildings that are under 
construction or under ready operation are not simultaneously especially whenever its life span of the components of 
these facilities is different. Moreover, management the services for the academic buildings needs more accuracy.

4. Conclusion of the research 
Preparing Damam University GIS is not just mapping. It will be used in different levels. At a higher level, GIS 
should be a data analysis and decision-making tool for the University authority. With GIS as honest and accurate 
urban advisors tool, we can evaluate a variety of data to graphically assess economic and forcasts, services 
efficiency, space management, infrastructure conditions, energy use, procurement, and more. GIS can also allow the 
University to rationalize predictions and forecasts in different levels, create and to prepare more realistic’ budgets, 
and have the data to justify the University's decisions. 
From the above studies and the model that was design by the researcher, it is concluded the followings: 
1- The Supervision at the university should pursue a renewable energy supply strategy that optimizes long-term 
supply and fuel price stability while preserving an ability to test and take advantage of other potential fuels.  
2- University Planning has to develop an Enterprise GIS system that will be a single, authoritative data source 
for the University and useful in operating Dammam university campuses.  
3- G.I.S. will be the successful tool in e-operating and management university Campuses, which is uultimately, 
will be integrated throughout the large number of users with different skills can manage, share, or use data to 
address a variety of needs including modification, visualization, analysis, and dissemination. 
4- It has taken the initiative to be taking advantage of e- operating through GIS and linking all the departments 
that rely engine maps the GIS.  
5- Through the development of ""GIS Enabled Portal"" and thus it is confident that in using G.I.S. system that the 
university campus will be managed and maintained in appropriate system. With web-based portals, users will 
be able to create their own maps, allowing GIS staff to focus their time maintaining the integrity of the data 
quality as well as mining the data for information. 
6- G.I.S will help decision-makers, official employee of the management and maintenance, and technicians to 
choose the proper decision and complete the work assigned without conflict  
7- Also ensure that no overlap or loss of information at this time or in the near or distant future and coordination 
between the different networks effectively and successfully. 
8- Depending on the type of user accessing the web-based portals, different layers of information will be 
available for viewing and printing based on need, sensitivity of information, and security.

Abstract 
Application of lean manufacturing tools in abattoirs promise great process improvements, despite limited 
sources and literature specific to abattoirs. Due to the inadequacy of research papers in application of lean 
manufacturing tools in abattoir; audits, process efficiency measurements, document analyzing, 
identification of value adding and non-value adding activities, site visits, plant tours, conducting trainings 
and awareness, motion study, work and method study, plant tour and observation were used. Data 
collection, recommendations and improvements were made on the basis of authors’ knowledge, 
observations, audits results, change management responses, feedbacks, process measurements, and abattoir 
staff advice. Lean manufacturing tools, practices and philosophies that  succeeded in  carrying out the 
research in abattoirs are takt, standardization, 5S and waste elimination, value stream mapping. These lean 
manufacturing tools improved business processes, work methods and productivity. This paper reports on 
the introduction of lean manufacturing tools in one of Botswana Private Beef Abattoir. The contribution 
highlights before and after lean implementation in terms cost saving improvements, work method 
improvements, workplace safety awareness, 21-23 % cycle time improvements, 20-22% process efficiency 
improvement and recommendation to waste management practices that the company can absorb.

4. Conclusion 
Based on the results of lean manufacturing tools, philosophies and practices results, responses and challenges, it is 
very challenging to successfully implement lean practices, tools and philosophies in abattoirs. These challenges factors 
are due to the fluctuating supply of cattle from local farmers, structural problems, export monopoly commercial 
potential constraints, declining markets of abattoir industry in Botswana, declining market of the beef industry in 
Botswana’s export to European Union. Lean practices (principally takt-time, standard operations, value stream 
mapping, work study, time study and 5S) have demonstrated potential improvements. These demonstrated improved 
working methods and safety awareness in the facility in comparison with before and after lean implementation results. 
Further work is planned to understand the economic cost-effective saving analysis of utilities compared to installation 
of solar power in Botswana Private Beef Abattoir.

Abstract 
A high number of emerging construction companies in South Africa close down within the first three years 
of establishment.  The construction industry plays a major role in the country’s gross domestic product and 
closure of companies contribute to the increasing risk of high unemployment rate in South Africa. A 
comprehensive literature review identified eight factors which contribute to failure of emerging 
construction companies. Primary data was collected via a questionnaire which was distributed to owners 
and managers of emerging construction companies. The study reveals that a lack of financial management 
by leadership is the most prominent factor that leads to failure or success of companies.

1. Introduction
The construction industry plays a major role in the ability to boost the economy of the country and to create 
employment opportunities unemployed citizens (Abdesamed and Wahab, 2014; Dlamini, 2012; Gordhan, 2012). 
Construction companies always have to find ways to improve and succeed in their business and to avoid failure. 
Emerging construction companies are mostly at risk because the majority of them close down within the first three 
years of establishment (Abor and Quartey, 2010). According to the Construction Industry Development Board of 
South Africa (CIDB), emerging construction companies can be identified as companies with Level 1 - 4 CIDB grading 
and have available capital of up to ZAR 200 000 (CIDB, 2011; Tenderpoint, 2014).  Emerging construction companies 
must endeavor to sustain themselves by managing their projects and remaining within budget (Kirunda, 2005). 
The purpose of the research is to identify factors which contribute to unsustainability of emerging construction 
companies.  The research methodology included a comprehensive literature review, as well as a survey distributed to 
industry personnel who own a company or is in a management position in emerging companies. The paper concludes 
with a discussion on the findings and results.  
2. Literature review
For companies to sustain themselves they have to avoid failure and endeavor to be successful.  Success can be 
described as long term drive for sustainability (Dubazane, 2013) and failure can be described as lack of success 
(Kirunda, 2005).  In order to ensure long-term sustainability, companies need to hire competent workers who are able 
to help the company to grow (Macozoma, 2016).  Hiring of competent individuals in management positions who know 
what they are doing enables a company to deliver quality work and helps companies to keep a positive cash flow.  
Unqualified workers result in poor quality work being delivered and companies finding it difficult to attract new 
customers (Msani, 2016).  Working on a project and not having a proper project plan to monitor the progress results

Invitations were sent to a minimum of 1 250 participants to achieve a required sample size of 375.  A large sample 
was selected to ensure more accuracy of the results in terms of estimating population values (Scheuren, 2004).  
Sampling of the participants was done using the snowballing method (Scheuren, 2004).The survey consisted of eight 
sections ranging from personal questions to the eight factors identified in literature review. A 7-point Likert scale 
(Vagias, 2006) was employed to determine the responses for factors affecting emerging construction companies. The 
data from the questionnaire was exported to Microsoft Excel for analysis. 
 
4. Findings and Discussions 
 
A total of 440 responses were received for the survey of which 390 were from CIDB Grade 1 - 4 companies which 
are identified as emerging.  The remaining responses were from established companies and an average weighted mean 
was calculated for each response.  Each factor discussed in literature had sub-factors, and Table 3 highlights the 
significant trend derived from the finding.

There were a total of 29 sub-factors and they were ranked from highest to lowest by the weighted mean. The top six 
factors are assigned to financial management.  The findings indicate that financial management is the biggest factor 
that causes failure of companies.  The findings also revealed that the last seven sub-factors are assigned to the primary 
factor Resources. 
 
The findings can be interpreted in two ways. It provides an indication that respondents believe that owners are 
responsible for the company finances; and that leaders of companies must ensure that effective management practices 
are implemented.   
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The study set out to determine the factors which contribute to unsustainable emerging construction companies.  
Literature review revealed eight contributing factors which were tested via an online survey. The research revealed 
that the two primary factors that contribute to failing emerging construction companies are ineffective financial 
management and a lack of resources.

Abstract 
The Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme (REIPPPP) was 
developed to encourage private investment to assist the development of the renewable energy sector in 
South Africa. Technologies that fall under the IPP Procurement project include onshore wind, biogas, 
biomass, solar photovoltaic and the landfill gas project. Different Photovoltaic (PV) systems such as 
ground mounted, rooftop and carport systems have shown a significant growth in South Africa and this 
growth is expected to continue over the coming years. In line with the vision of the REIPPPP, the Council 
for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has introduced a programme aimed at making the Pretoria 
campus energy autonomous over the next 5 to 8 years. As a part of this initiative, and to promote the use 
of green energy, the CSIR has installed three PV Systems: 558kWp Single Axis Tracker (ground-
mounted), 203kWp Dual Axis Tracker (ground-mounted) and a Fixed-Tilt Rooftop system of 250kWp 
which is to be integrated onto the campus’ electrical grid. This paper concentrates on the operations and 
maintenance of these three CSIR PV plants in order to maximize the plant performance and optimize 
energy production. The paper will also analyse the operations and maintenance costs associated with the 
plants.

Abstract 
This study is conducted to show the relationship between the techniques used in Inventory Management 
and the Supply Chain Management. Inventory management is a train fundamentally about indicating 
arrangement of supplied merchandise (Mwangi, 2013).  There is a need to examine the implementation of 
effective inventory management system, its impact on the supply chain management of a manufacturing 
company and how it plays a role on the performance levels of the organization. The study was conducted 
at a manufacturing company, which will be referred as Company X. This research paper followed a casual 
design approach, and mixed methodology technique further explored the findings from the literature review 
and the extent of application in practice. A non-random sampling technique was used, containing 34 
employees in total. Questionnaire was developed and distributed amongst all 34 employees from supply 
chain, inventory control and manufacturing line. The study conducted has evidently shown that Inventory 
Management and Supply Chain have an impact on the performance of the organization. It is then 
recommended that management ensures that the two department have and maintain a good working 
relationship.

Introduction 
A vast majority of manufacturing companies have organized themselves as networks of production and distribution 
sites in order to remain competitive in today’s dynamic market. The most uncomplicated network consists of a single 
company that performs both manufacturing and distribution. The complicated networks consist of multiple companies 
scattered around the world these companies would be responsible for distributing inventory to consumers. These 
networks are referred to as supply chains. 
Inventory likewise alluded to the merchandise and materials that a business holds for the accomplishing its generation 
objectives. Inventory management is a train basically about indicating situation of (Mwangi, 2013). The target of 
inventory management is to “strike a balance between inventory investment and customer service” (Heizer & Render, 
2014) Stock management includes diverse capacities inside an organization specifically; giving merchandise to meet 
the client requests and separate from vacillations in that request, to decouple different parts of the creation procedure, 
to exploit amount rebates, and to support against swellings and value changes (Heizer and Render, 2014). It is a costly 
resource in the organization, in this way it is basic that it is overseen accurately for the organization to be viable, to 
build its efficiency levels, and to kill exercise in futility and materials and have low generation costs. Inventory 
management is critical on the grounds that associations will guarantee resources and stock are very much overseen 
and request anticipating is extraordinarily improved to maintain a strategic distance from impromptu acquisition.

Conclusion and Recommendations  
From the study conducted it can be concluded that inventory management and supply chain does have an impact on 
the performance of the Company X. How the two departments work can influence how employees in the 
manufacturing line perform and the type of product they produce.  
It is therefore recommended that management takes the initiative of ensuring that the two departments have a good 
working relationship, and also with the manufacturing line. The inventory management department is recommended 
that they improve their inventory control technique, by implementing the JIT system, ensuring that each manufacturing 
line has just enough of materials needed for the production and provide enough working space in the manufacturing 
line.  The JIT system will also allow the company to avoid a situation of having too much or too little materials in its 
storage facility and also decrease the storage costs.

Abstract. 
This paper aims to highlight how productivity tools can improve employee satisfaction, which in turn should improve 
the customer queuing system of the banking sector. Fifteen questionnaires were distributed to the employees, nine 
where received. Questions answered by employees to display the overall interest of their customers and having a new 
method in improving productivity. After the interest had been gauged, all the data was collected and started using the 
five steps in improving productivity and productivity calculation to eliminate unnecessary task and breaks taken at 
work. The results show that in the previous month that even with more employees, the monthly targets were not 
reached so more employees were not really needed every day only in month ends. Recommendation that were included 
was hiring of two or three migration official that will help with the queues and help customer quicker then customers 
waiting for a consultant.

1. Introduction
1.1 The case 
 The South African banking industry has quite numerous problem that hinder the productivity in the banks, firstly the 
queues are very long, and this makes customers wait in queues for quite some time, when there are alternative ways 
that customers can query or find assistance to their problems. Secondly in most banks there is only one migration 
officer working on the shop floor, so customers must wait for a long time at the door for assistance. This paper 
investigates how employee’s performance can improve customer waiting time in the banking industry.  The paper also 
aims to highlight how productivity tools can improve employee satisfaction which in turn will improve customers 
waiting time.  
2. Literature review
 During the past two decades, the service sector has been one the quickest growing sector and it represents a big part 
in today’s economy. New and innovating systems serve consumers better and creates more opportunities for a win-
win situation in the service sector. Russell, 2009. One of the biggest issues in the review is “how service productivity 
can be measured and implemented. Grönroos & Ojasalo, 2006. Productivity is the percentage of outputs of a 
production unit in comparison to its inputs, considering that quality standards are met. D, Hartigh, 2011.  Profitability 
is for the most part measured by the proportion of yield to include. An expansion in the proportion shows an increment 
in profitability. D, Hartigh, 2011. For instance, work efficiency is commonly measured as a proportion of yield of 
work per into account both the financial esteem (cost) of what is created, and the cost of information sources utilized, 
and furthermore particular from measurements of benefit, Profitability is the connection between generation of a yield 
to at least one or the greater part of the assets inputs utilized as a part of fulfilling the doled out undertaking. It is 
measured as a proportion of yield for every unit of contribution after some time. It is a measure of productivity and is 
time. If not done as such then the target of measuring efficiency is crushed. Biege, et al., 2012. Productivity aims to 
output, by either increasing the work hour or rather benchmark improvements, D, Hartigh, 2011. Productivity is a very

productivity. Meaning that in the month of September there were more customers helped and the queues where 
less in the month August. 
 
5. Recommendation 
The queuing system of the bank was selected as means of investigation, data was shown on an analysis sheet to 
see how the how many customers are serviced. The New “methods” developed was hiring more migration official 
and floor mangers, supervisor must help out when there is a long queue. the manager is advised put at least two 
migration officials at the ATM points, two at the online banking, one at the tellers and three at the queue on month 
ends (24th to the 5th) of every month to reduce the queues size. Result show that this method is working because 
in figure 5.3 it shows that we have less customer waiting and complaining about the queues and we helped all of 
the customer in August/September 
Know your service level target. Try using an “80/20” service level target, meaning that 20% of customer should 
be helped in 80sec. When determining what right service level target should be, the manager would find the right 
balance between the desire to deliver quality service versus the cost willing to bear to achieve it. Performance 
metrics and Queue Management. Now that the manger has the service level targets, the manager can begin 
tracking actual service times using the point-of-sale data and surveillance video. Whichever queue management 
system manager decide to use, management must be sure that it integrates surveillance video since this is the best 
way to investigate what caused delays in service speeds or why a customer abandoned the checkout line. Make 
changes and compare progress over time. Once data have been collected, the manager can look at the banks 
performance over a period of time and find any trends or outliers. Investigating these situations will uncover 
operational bottlenecks or other issues that cause slow service times. 
Encourage open communication. The manager can get insight into what things are important to the employee by 
using surveys. Be open-minded and encourage them to express their ideas and perspectives without criticism. 
This means putting into practice everything you have learned about effective listening. Address their concerns in 
the best way you can. Culture encourage employees to find a personal fit with the company culture. 
Provide constant feedback on the positives. When employees know what the manger is doing well, they’ll keep 
doing it or even better, do more of it. Providing someone with a little recognition on what they’re doing well can 
go a long way toward boosting morale. This is not to say “ignore the weaknesses” the manager must just do not 
make the weaknesses the only focus area of feedback. Do not create accountability, it actually means the opposite  
6. Conclusion 
Productivity is affected by multiple factors. Sometime one or more factors play their role to increase or decrease 
the labour productivity. The factors those affect the performance or productivity are the same. Because when the 
productivity of individual is increased automatically his performance is. The assessment of service productivity 
is not trivial, as services (in contrast to manufacturing) may, to a large extent, be understood as co-creating 
configurations of people, technology, as well as internal and external stakeholders connected by value 
propositions and shared information 
It is important the bank managers should check on the employee’s performances on a regular basis and providing 
feedback to the employees, so they could help move the lines quicker because they would know how to talk the 
customers and help them faster. The five steps in improving productivity helped to see the problems that needs to

The best “experience” can be summed up as customer are able to come in the bank and not wait for hours to see 
a consultant or wait by the queue man system for a ticket. Objective like to improve the queues at the doors and

Abstract  
 
The problems want to be solved in this study is the standardization of traditional boats in Indonesia. 
We described all the characteristics of traditional boat quality in the dimensions of durability, 
performance, reliability, service ability, features, aesthetics, perceived quality, and conformance. We 
also did the normality test of GT size and load capacity based on the sampling and found that they 
were normally distributed with mean 23 GT and 15 ton, respectively. Furthermore, we found that 
there were three types of traditional boat which all have U-shape hull construction. We also provided 
the three types of traditional boat including the real picture and the lines plan. By using these lines 
plan, the new shipbuilding can be re-built in the same size.

1. Introduction 
 
In the ASEAN free trade area, Indonesia could drive economy because we have a huge population for 
more than 240 millions. Domestic products must be competitive to imported products. Ministry of Research, 
Technology, and Higher Education encourages civils to make standardized product to fulfill market demand. 
Surabaya city and Lamongan regency which are determined as a cluster of shipbuilding industry in East Java 
province have a responsibility to make standardized boats. The previous research on shipbuilding industrial 
cluster workshop showed that there were some improvements needed in components standardization, such as: 1) 
there is a need to standardize ship components by government, and 2) there is a less development in Lamongan 
because it lacks of human resources and design center (Asmara et. al., 2016). 
  
In this study, we limit our research object to traditional boats which are made from wooden. Wooden 
boats or traditional boats are used by the most of fishermen in Indonesia. However, the production of traditional 
boats has not been well standardized yet. The technique of traditional shipbuilding is a heritage technique from 
their ancestors (Jokosisworo and Santosa, 2008; Trimulyono et. al., 2015). There are no standardized 
calculations which implied to variations of shape and design of traditional boats in Indonesia. The 
standardization aims to increase local content and reduce imported components. Therefore, the ship production 
cost will be lower. Furthermore, most of the traditional boat workers are graduated from junior high school and 
senior high school. If there is no standardization, it will impact on worker and boat safety. A research to analyze 
factors which influence standardization of traditional boats is needed to improve the performance. This research 
will contribute to find some factors that are critical to the quality of traditional fishing boats and then make",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Abstract 
Power plant steam condensers use cooling water for condensation of exhaust steam from turbines. 
Depending on the concentration of cations in the cooling water, changes in temperature result in the 
precipitation of insoluble metal salts on the tube walls hence impeding heat transfer, leading to fouling, a 
threat on the heat transfer efficiency of the condenser. The research was carried out at a power station in 
Zimbabwe where offline mechanical methods used to clean the tubes were observed to be slow and 
inefficient, hence increasing downtimes. The use of spherical rubber balls was proposed where they were 
injected into the cooling water to scrub off dirt on the tube surfaces as well as creating turbulence to prevent 
the dirt from settling on the tube walls. Ball sizes of diameter less than the tube sizes were preferred in order 
to cater for possible thermal expansion of the rubber material on exposure to elevated temperatures. A 
magnetic water treatment unit was added to facilitate the formation of weak precipitates of the metal salts 
for ease of removal on cleaning. The design and implementation of the research results had the potential of 
saving the company on downtimes during condenser cleaning.

1. Introduction
The case study company, a power plant based in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe uses the shell and tube heat exchangers for 
condensing exhaust steam from the turbines. The cooling water passing at the tube side had a tendency to accumulate 
deposits on flowing through the tubes. These deposits increased with time and in case of natural water, minerals such 
as calcium and magnesium tended to form insoluble salt precipitates in the pipe interior wall. This gave rise to fouling, 
an accumulation of unwanted material on the pipe walls, effectively blocking the smooth functioning of the condensers 
(Bagheri & Mirbagheri, 2018). Fouling can usually be distinguished from other surface-growth challenges, in that it 
occurred on the surface of pipe walls of the heat exchanger tubes which were meant to condense the exhaust steam 
from the turbines but because of the deposits, the function of the heat exchanger was affected. The methods employed 
by the company to clear the deposits were not only manual and time consuming but were also ineffective in that the 
entire plant had to be shut down to accommodate the maintenance and cleaning process.

5. Discussion and Recommendations 
 
Based on the data collected at the power station and considering the startup and shutdown of the processes during the 
cleaning period, the cleaning process usually stretched for a period of 6 working days. Hence the total time lost due 
to cleaning was 144 hours. The average energy generated by the power station was 30 MW which implied that a total 
of 4,320 MWhrs were lost during the 6 day maintenance period. Considering that the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply 
Authority tariffs are currently pegged at 11c per KWh, the total cost due to downtime and maintenance was $475,200 
(4,320 x 103 kWhr X 0.11c per kWhr), an amount that can be saved by employing the proposed cleaning system, less 
the investment cost of $5,283. Further improvements in the proposed system may be necessary in terms of reducing 
ball losses, improving ball distribution on tubes, development of more robust balls resistant to wear as well as 
controlling and monitoring of motion in the tubes to ensure that all tubes are cleaned when they are supposed to. A 
Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP) was also carried out to ensure the identification and eradication of hazards 
associated with the developed cleaning system. Potential hazards that may arise due deviation of the design from its 
expected operational conditions are noted and are listed in Table 1.

Ball blockages 
Wrong ball selection, reduced 
flow rate. 
Impeded water flow, increased 
pressure drops.  
Install tube flow monitors; avoid 
macro foulant to pass through the 
debris filter at the main cooling 
water inlet pipe. 
Reverse flow 
Valve malfunction 
Balls fail to reach expected 
destination in time.     
Install new valves 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
The introduction of an online condenser cleaning system at the power station will be financially beneficial in that 
downtimes due to unexpected and unscheduled shutdown would be reduced during periodical cleaning. Annual 
expenses due to downtime on condenser cleaning can save the power company an estimated $475 200. However, 
installation of such a system requires total investment of $5,283 which can comfortably be paid back within a period 
of 1 year and 2 months. This research was innovative in improving the existing system to meet set objectives in that 
the magnetic water treatment unit used magnetism to alter the super molecules in water such that the calcium cations 
precipitated as weak aragonite sludge with reduced ability to stick. This was an advantage in that when a tube was 
missed by the cleaning balls in some cycles, it would certainly be easier to scrub it in the next cycles hence maintaining 
a continuously running and uninterrupted power station. Increasing the number of balls per cycle also increased the 
probabilities that any tube was cleaned after multiple cycles. The system also has the flexibility to reduce ball sizes in 
order to cover for thermal expansion on the balls when exposed to high temperatures. Recommendation were also 
made for further research to improve the ball outer surfaces, distribution and monitoring of motions within the tubes.

Abstract 
Spare parts stock control is crucial to inventory research. Current practice of spare parts stocking is based 
on individual plant’s equipment. Identical spare parts could be rationalized based on companywide having 
different plants. It requires a dedicated review through drawings and documents of manufacturer’s data 
for interchangeability. Primary objective is to contribute in inventory cost reduction on the basis of 
rationalization of stock levels for identical spare parts. Identical spares rarely require simultaneously for 
maintenance in relevant equipment among different plants. The methodology is based on three stages 
which include gathered opinion through questionnaire for companywide stocking policy from above 
industries in India and Gulf. Subsequently followed by conceptual methodology of companywide 
codification includes reviewing through an adequate Spare parts Interchangeability record (SPIR) 
formatted document. The final stage is validation which is supported with case studies based on 
secondary data collected from one of SABIC affiliate, KSA and other from Fertilizer industry at India. 
The approach of companywide is applicable for Petroleum & fertilizer industries Globally since having 
more than two plants at a business unit like Reliance & KRIBCO at India & SABIC & ADNOC affiliates 
at Saudi Arabia and  UAE respectively. 
Key words-   Companywide codification, Spare parts Descriptive Statistics and Interchangeability 
I. INTRODUCTION
Spare parts are significant resources for continuous equipment availability [1]. Keeping in view the equipment 
availability  inventory management system needs to review  with strategic policy  and to reduce zero stock out 
condition with  continuous production and  minimum  investment on spare parts administrative cost [2]. It is 
envisaged that spare parts inventory need should be treated as different from work in process (WIP) and other finished 
product inventories in stock control approaches. [3]. Handbook of Petroleum Processing indicates that the total cost of 
spare parts should be between 2-3% of project cost of petrochemical plants companywide. [4]. Practically, due to lack 
of systematic review of spare parts  interchangeability and  historic base calculation during first  time order and 
subsequently the stock levels cost of spare parts  is always more and there is scope of using different methods and 
techniques for reducing stock cost of spare parts.

10. Conclusion 
Based on questionnaire survey, hypothesis design and testing , it emphasized that the companywide  
interchangeability strategic policy for  spare parts inventory in the fertilizer and petroleum industries could 
rationalized the stock levels and reduce the duplication, long time inventory holding and  reduces the average yearly 
spares inventory cost respectively. It also further reflected in the above case study and proves that the formulated 
research objectives could be achieved by macro and micro level strategic policy models and procedure to get 
advantage of companywide interchangeability of spare among different plants of same business unit. It has also 
indicated that ERP packages like SAP R/3 materials management module is data based codification tool and could 
not reveal the interchangeability of parts once it is codify in different item codes. Hence companywide codification 
should be generated using structured E SPIR and later these item codes should be recorded in the ERP system. 
11 Future Scope 
The study could be carried out for other items like for electrical as well as instruments spare items for companywide 
interchangeability.

Abstract 
The University of Johannesburg and various stakeholders launched a community engagement project in 
Gwakwani village in the remote area of Limpopo province, South Africa, where a solar powered bakery 
was deployed. To ensure the sustainability of the project, bakery staff was educated and trained in the 
processes of baking and business management processes. One of the biggest challenges around the 
initiative is that the bakery staff has no prior knowledge of how to operate and manage a small business. 
This paper presents the development of a bakery management system to assist the staff in the day-to-day 
management of the bakery. It discusses the human machine interface developed for potential lower 
literacy levels and experience of the bakery staff in mind. This paper presents the development of the user 
interface of the management system as well as results from a preliminary training session on how to use 
the management system.

1. Introduction
The Gwakwani village is located in the remote areas of the Limpopo province in the northern region of South 
Africa. It has a population of between 70 and 100 people and is known for its remoteness and very basic standards 
of living with no grid power or municipal facilities. Most of the villagers in the area rely on subsistence farming or

Future endeavors of similar nature could be packaged alongside the developed HMI and can be put into use in 
multiple communities to aid in the management and operation of these cooperatives bakery start-ups. 
 
Future expansion to match developing business models and functionalities while maintaining the simplicity of the 
system will be a major challenge going forward. Although significant future developments will be needed for large 
scale deployment, the HMI has been designed to accommodate these efforts and hence there exists a very real 
potential for commercial use of the project solution through future community outreach programs. 
 
7. Conclusion 
The purpose of this paper was to present and discuss the development of a bakery management system designed for 
the managing a rural bakery in Gwakwani, South Africa. The system was based on the use of images and icons 
instead of words and numbers and its development was motivated by decolonised methods of communication. It was 
developed in order to assist the bakers who were unfamiliar with technology or uncomfortable with reading or 
writing in the day-to-day management processes of a bakery. The user interface of the system is unique as it does 
not follow the general rules of a management system. The introduction of Information Technology and simultaneous 
education of business management skills, through the use of this software provides the end users with the 
opportunity to learn skills that are vital in the modern day economic environment. The utilisation of similar systems 
can assist the sustainability of small, informal businesses in their daily operations. One of the fundamental pillars of 
engineering is to better the standard of living of the general population and by developing tools to help those in need 
of opportunity, innovations such as these fortify this pillar.

Abstract 
The dynamism in man’s public sphere, with its associated diversity in the socio-cultural and religious 
inclination of people, have over time resulted in variation in the personality psychological traits of people 
in these environments. In most developing countries, the level of integration of Social Interactive Service 
Robots (SISRs) in public sphere has been greatly hampered; owing to the disparity in the psychological 
traits of the people in this region. This to a great extent has impeded the level of acceptance of SISRs in 
most public places. In an effort to remediate this challenge, there is need to understand and characterize 
the psychological trait of the people in this region. This work therefore, seeks to review psychological 
development and traits of the Zulu, Xhosa and Swati tribes of South Africa in a bid to characterize the 
inherent psychological trait variation of the people. It was also aims at establishing in quantitative terms, 
the variation in pro-social traits. Findings from this work, show that Xhosa and Zulu tribe have a higher 
propensity to integrate SISRs more than the Swati tribe, as they have higher positive correlation value in 
terms of pro-social traits: Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Neuroticism with values of 0.45, 0.80 
and 0.40 respectively. Also, result from the analysis show that the mean pro-social traits for the tribe 
combination: Xhosa/Zulu, Swati/Zulu and Swati/Xhosa have correlational values of 0.58, 0.54 and 0.53 
respectively.

1. Introduction
Human personality is constantly evolving over man's lifespan. In a bid to understand the dynamism in individual 
personality, several methods have over time been developed in the field of psychology all in an effort to better 
capture the concept of personality. Overall, personality is seen as a set of characteristics or traits with an overall 
underlying framework which allows for  individual variation. This underlying structure allows for consistency in 
behavior overtime amidst changing environmental conditions and situation[1]–[4]. Several advances have been 
made in the formulation of functional theoretical trait framework for the investigation of this composition [5]. 
Currently, the Five-Factor Model which represent personality in five dimensions: Neuroticism (or Emotional 
Stability), Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Openness (or Intellect) and Extraversion is the most generally 
accepted model for personality [6], [7].  Overall, culture and religion are seen as two external variables which have 
contributed greatly both in the formation and expression of traits of people in most developing countries [5]–[9]. 
Thus, it is necessary to investigate the variations and correspondence in the content and expression of these traits 
and the influence of the environment on these characteristics.

(Openness and Extraversion) trait tendencies for the tribes. The correlation obtained from the descriptive facets for 
the tribes is thus presented: 
 
 
Figure7: Pro-social and anti-social trait tendencies across the tribes 
 
From figure7, it is seen that there is a correlation of about 0.61 between the Xhosa and Zulu tribe while Swazi and 
Xhosa and Swazi and Zulu have 0.58 and 0.45 respectively for the pro-social traits. Similarly, in term of the anti-
social inclination, the Xhosa and Zulu tribe have a correlation of 0.70, while Swazi and Xhosa and Swazi and Zulu 
have a correlation of 0.50 and 0.3. It could be deduced from this correlation that the Xhosa and Zulu tribes have a 
higher propensity to integrate SISRs more, as they have a mean pro-social correlational value of 0.58 relative to 
Swazi/Zulu and Swazi/Xhosa which have mean correlational values of 0.54 and 0.53 respectively as in table 2. 
Table2: Correlational values for Pro-social and Antisocial traits for the tribes 
 
5. 
Conclusion  
Haven established that coherent and consistent pro-social attributes, are key factors required for the speedy 
integration of SISRs in the public sphere of most developing countries, we have been able to identify and 
characterize these distinct psychological traits of the: Zulu, Xhosa and Swazi people of Southern Africa cultural 
groups. Result from the correlational analysis shows that: that the Xhosa and Zulu tribe have a higher propensity to 
integrate SISRs more than the Swati tribe as result in in table1 shows that these tribes have mean pro-social trait 
values of 0.58 and 0.54 respectively. We strongly believe that if these traits variations of the people in developing 
countries are taken into consideration while developing SISRs for public environment, it would help improve both 
the level of SISRs–Human interaction and the extent to which they are integrated in our public sphere.

Abstract 
University of South Africa has acquired a vast experience in Distance Education (DE), and it is the oldest 
DE institution in Africa. In the university’s strategic documents, the need to transition from paper-based 
correspondence to fully online tuition is vividly stipulated. Unisa recognizes the unrelenting and 
increasing demand for education in Africa. Together with the unprecedented explosion in the use of cellular 
phones experienced in South Africa, Mobile Learning (ML) has arguably become a more affordable 
education delivery method for improving access to education. ML presents a practical response to the 
demand for accessibility in education. Statistics in the university and in Africa has placed cellular 
technology as the most common means of communication in the continent. Therefore, ML is a mode of 
learning that could play a critical role in addressing the increasing demand for education, enhance the 
achievement of the strategic goal of the university and ultimately open new opportunities for research in 
the institution. This paper adopts a qualitative research approach to explore, explain and discuss a design 
process flow model developed for ML implementation. Commensurate challenges experienced in the 
development of the model will be critically engaged and finally an implementation structure will be 
discussed.

Abstract 
Online learning has empowered students at traditional contact universities as well as those in distance 
education to transform engineering education. The landscape of higher education, the cultural 
environment and the competitive ecosystem is changing rapidly and disruptively. Recent events at 
universities have illustrated this fact. Higher education is rapidly changing and technology is the catalyst 
for the change. In the new paradigm, students expect to be able to work, learn and study whenever and 
wherever they are. Consequently, the appeal of digital games based learning (DGBL) has become more 
attractive and commonplace in lecture rooms. The appeal of DGBL is derived from the unique nature of 
gaming education and its ability to integrate theory and practice. Gaming has the ability to: 1) capture 
students interest, 2) to motivate students in progressing to higher and more difficult levels of learning, and 
3) to learn from and interact with other students. The research methodology adopted is one of a case study
approach. The paper presents a comprehensive example that illustrates the application of DGBL in
industrial Engineering teaching and learning, in an ODL setting. Results analysis will display how
students benefited from game based learning.

differentiate between the medium and the message, as described by McLuhan (2011), content of the medium is 
another medium. In an attempt to remedy this dilemma, faculty must comprehend the difference between the use and 
integration of the TFC into T&L, (De Grove et al. 2012). Using TFC requires only that the media be present during 
instruction and integrating TFC requires a careful analysis of the SWOT of TFC as well as its alignment to 
instructional strategies, methods and desired learning outcomes (Jisc, 2014), as stipulated by ECSA.

Abstract 
South Africa is an arid country. A “climate independent” solution is desalination. Infinite renewable 
energy sources could address the implementation of these technologies and the environmental impacts. 
Recommendations to increase the water-energy-climate security of South Africa are provided in this 
paper. The main objective was to investigate the requirements and environmental benefits of four energy 
sources for seawater desalination. Secondary data from published literature was analysed with the “Long-
range Energy Alternatives Planning System”, using scenario analysis. This compared the trade-offs 
between water supply, energy demand and climate change mitigation within a South African context. The 
four power sources were solar, wind, wave and geothermal. Geothermal was the least practical source for 
South Africa. The technologies for desalination were reverse osmosis and two thermal technologies 
(Multiple effect distillation and Multiple/Multi-stage flash distillation). It was concluded from both 
analyses that the most suitable alternative for desalination, was probably wave powered seawater reverse 
osmosis. In the Western Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, this could be combined with existing technologies.

1. Introduction and background
Greenhouse gasses and climate change cause temperature changes and reduced rainfall. This results in droughts and 
water deficiencies, which need to be addressed (Kitley, 2011; Ragab and Prudhomme, 2002). Consequently, water 
scarcities are faced by countries worldwide (Gude, 2016b:1053; Karagiannis and Soldatos, 2008:448). The severity 
of water shortages globally is estimated to increase by 60%, primarily in Asia, Africa and Latin America, by 2025 
(Thopil and Pouris, 2016:1107). One of the arid countries is South Africa (SA) (Thopil and Pouris, 2016:1107; 
CSIR; 2010:4), the area selected for this study. 
The aim of the study was to provide recommendations for improving water-energy-climate security in SA. The 
objectives were to establish the opportunities and requirements in energy sources for producing water from 
desalinating seawater. Another objective was to identify trade-offs between climate change mitigation, water use 
and energy efficiency. Contributions were towards opportunities for alternative water purification technologies and 
energy sources in SA for resolving the water crisis without harming the environment and added strains to the grid. 
SA depends on storage and transfer from water catchment areas (Kitley, 2011:14; Thopil and Pouris, 2016:1107) 
since rivers do not provide sufficient water (Thopil and Pouris, 2016:1107). Water irregularities due to erratic supply 
have been reported in SA (Kitley, 2011:14-18). Figure 1 presents the available and required water from the 
catchment areas, 10 years ago and in three years’ time. It is evident that water scarcities have increased since the 
year 2000. Less than the required amount is being supplied from 15 of the 19 catchment areas (Thopil and Pouris, 
2016:1107). Additionally, the country’s average rainfall is far less than the global average rainfall (Thopil and 
Pouris, 2016:1107; Kitley, 2011:14; CSIR, 2010:4). Regions in the Western Cape (WC), Eastern Cape (EC) and 
KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) provinces are arid (Water Research Commision and Department of Water Affairs and 
Forestry, 2014). In particular, coastal regions in the EC and WC (Turner et al., 2015:1), predominantly in Cape 
1767",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Sustainable methods that comply with the updated National Water Resource Strategy (NWRS2) from the 
Department of Water Affairs (2013) can be achieved through these recommendations. The RE alternative approach 
to power the desalination technologies also complies with the Department of Energy's goal of expanding RES due to the energy 
demand and CO2 emission status in SA (Government Communication and Information System, 2015:65). 
Additionally, this also coincides with the National Development Plan
 
(Government Communication and Information System, 2015:65) and 
the National Climate Change Response Policy (Government Communication and Information System, 2015:64). 
These policies primarily recommended solar, wind and hydro sources, however, the findings from this analysis 
indicated that it would be more beneficial to implement wave energy technologies due to the lower costs and energy 
involved for powering desalination technologies, compared to the costlier solar PV, wind and solar CSP sources. 
 
Investments should be considered for implementing these technologies, which are widely available in the arid 
coastal regions, such as in the WC and KZN provinces. It is also recommended that large desalination plants should 
be implemented since the operational costs were lower for large water capacities and wave energy would be able  to
produce these capacities. If geothermal sources were more prominent in SA, then thermal technologies, mainly 
MED, integrated with these sources would be a practical alternative for shared implementation between existing and 
non-existing infrastructure in the WC and KZN provinces. However, it should be noted that these technologies need 
high energy demands. Therefore, more investigations regarding the potential of geothermal sources in SA should be 
considered, which is in accord with Smit (2010). There are also gaps in the current research locally and globally 
regarding the exact energy demands, water production volumes, along with the costs for all types of RE desalination 
integrations. 
 
Further research could include hybrids, such as combing Forward Osmosis (FO) membranes to RO membranes to 
improve RO operations, amongst other alternatives, since some of FO’s advantages outweigh RO’s disadvantages as 
demonstrated by Goh et al. (2016:54). The thermal technologies (MSF or MED) could also be combined with RO to 
add flexibility, as mentioned by van der Vegt et al. (2011:15), to improve the desalination technology in the first 
scenario, as well as the desalination technologies considered in the subsequent two scenarios, allowing the brine 
from the plant to be discharged easier with these integrations, which can resolve post-treatment costs associated with 
RO according to van der Vegt et al. (2011:15). RE hybrids could also be selected for future research to improve the 
efficiency of energy sources in terms of consistency. Alternatively, other sources such as biomass could also be 
considered as a source for powering desalination in KZN as indicated by the Department of Energy (2015). 
 
Additional environmental risks from the desalination technologies could also be evaluated. For instance, MSF and 
MED technologies have high-risk environmental impacts, such as heat, brine, cleaning solvents and energy, while 
RO technologies have an elevated risk in noise environmental impacts (Kitley, 2011:30). The desalination 
technologies selected for the analysis all release brine allowing further research regarding the generated brine and 
heat storage for thermal technologies. The environmental impacts from the energy source used could also be 
assessed in future research for several airborne emissions from various conventional energy sources, such as natural 
gas, coal and oil, as well as hybrids as stated by Raluy, Serra and Uche (2006) and Raluy et al. (2004), since only 
CO2 airborne emissions were considered in this investigation. Further research could also evaluate additional costs 
that were excluded in this study since only operational costs were assessed, as well as the regional energy constraints 
that would influence the implementation of desalination technologies in SA.

Abstract 
The adoption of the green supply chain, reverse logistics, and re-engineering methodologies have paved the 
way for advanced and sustainable thinking and led to the emergence of new technologies which may 
facilitate industrial flow processes in a Supply Chain Cycle (SCC). However, the understanding and full 
application of current evolving techniques are yet to be fully grasped or explored, especially as it pertains 
to different organizations’ operational structure. Cyber-physical systems (CPS), autonomous vehicles, 
robotics, additive technologies, and alternative energy systems, are under draconian scientific 
investigations, leading to incredible achievements, with the promise to replace humans in future supply 
chain operations. Thus, as the technological trend improves into the future, the question is asked, to what 
extent do the tendencies support sustainability and how secure is the current technology, or the decision to 
adopt new ones to improve product delivery, material handling and organize storage conservatively without 
causing havoc in the society. As such, maximize profits while meeting societal satisfaction. In this paper, 
we assess current trends towards achieving Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) and discuss 
viable implementation strategy of emerging technologies for the future, its impacts, challenges, and the 
scope of applicability for increased productivity. In conclusion, we share on how the promulgation and 
proper management of new and developing industrial technologies are essential to maximize time, 
minimize cost, and improve the value of employee commitment, and customer contentment.

1. Introduction
Supply chain management combines events which bring logistics and manufacturing/service operation to a 
coordinated bearing where resources are transformed and utilized to meet specific demands. The concept of 
sustainability soon introduced environmental concerns, followed by the derivation of maximum gains over the most 
optimal utilization of inputs and then, the impact of the whole process on how it affects workers and the end consumers. 
There exist, numerous definition inspired from the thought of sustainable supply chain management but many often 
are buttressed in the same vain. However, few capsuling among them are presented in Ref. (Council of Supply Chain 
Management Professionals, 2015; Gonzalez-Feliu, Jesus. Semet et al., 2014; Trentesaux and Prabhu, 2014). They 
captured critical terminologies in the area and field in question. Sustainable development as regards to economic, 
environmental and social security cannot be disjointed if the clamor for climate protection and social well-being is to 
be emphasized (Fischer, 2017). Hence, Intergovernmental forums, privately concerned conglomerates, Pro-eco 
practitioners and other involved parties set standards to proffer advice and design strategies for manufacturing, 
process, and service companies to meet as laid down requirements. Thereby affect the decision making undertaken by 
industries towards sustainable approaches for increased productivity. In the light of growth and development; 
innovations, technological integration successes, and coupled with standardization frameworks have become 
mechanisms for increasing productivity in today’s industry. (e.g., The Social Responsibility and Accountability 
Standards; ISO 26000, SA 8000 respectively and the Environmental, Quality, Energy, and Risk Management 
Standards; ISO 1400, ISO 9001, ISO 5001, ISO 31000, without failing to mention the Business Community Standard; 
ISO 22301, respectively). The subsequent sections of this article is organized in the following manner. Chapter two

delivery services and order services will be cordinated within click of a button. The logistics at the final tier of the 
SCC process is a crucial part of the very definition of logistics in an all-encompassing and general sense. Delivering 
the right product, at the right time, right place and in the right amount. Hence, in an approach primarily known as the 
Efficient Consumer Response (ECR), the most efficient and reliable technology is required. The use of drones and 
robots or in other cases cloud computing to conduct businesses is changing the playing field for product delivery. 
Mobile telephone devices also play essential roles in today’s business economics. Portable electronic hardware proof 
to be a dynamic technological concept which facilitates tracking, tracing, and real-time reports on products 
information, services availability and event time. 
 
 
3. Challenges and Gains of New Industrial Technology 
 
The desire to execute industrial operations in a fast, flexible and reliable sequence is profitable and required to align 
the economic benefits which accrue when work is organized in a reasonably quick and flexible manner. Thereby 
improving the safety of personals will ameliorate downtime and increase equipment lifetime. The specific outcomes 
of initiating sustainable factors into supply chain management, also, will breed technological competitiveness among 
companies that will directly or indirectly create room for more innovation and new opportunities’ research & 
development, and for job creation. SSCM and the integration of new technologies have open doors to new programmes 
like industry sustainability certification and auditing which may help to stimulate quality, expertise, and to promote 
the business integrity of a company. Despite the benefits and tremendous potentials of developing technologies, there 
are also challenges that pose hindrances to their adoption. Flexibility and objective consideration is a disadvantage to 
implement most of the emerging techniques (Liu et al., 2013). Changing old protocols to adopt new ones and 
operational scale or sizing, and activity execution time are factors to be considered. The quantity of service and the 
durability of the technology in question to operate effectively are also a limitation, and again, the assurance of optimum 
control. For example; the chances that an autonomous control system will reliably run at high speed while handling 
products or delivering services without necessarily undergoing failure? Lack of information and the deficit in know-
how to manage technology and technology transfer on a local and international scale presents another challenge for 
the use of new techniques in the supply chain management process to achieve its full benefits. In other cases, a chief 
executive officers or an operating officers may dwell on the uncertainties due to the return on investment, over the 
high execution cost of embracing a new technology/concept for optimum business operation. The imagination of 
shorting down the old and commissioning of a new, with no guarantee for the time of adjustment to the unused. 
 
Hence, to achieve SSCM, a clear-cut strategy, and reliable legal framework is required, which requires long-term 
planning. Despite a mountain of uncertainties and challenges, the gains supersede the odds, as innovation looks beyond 
pragmatism and evolution in technology will only get better and lead to dynamism. 
 
 
4. Discussions and Conclusion 
 
The rapidly increasing digital dive to conduct business using artificial intelligence seeks more innovation and require 
robust decision-model that will facilitate successful implementation. As digitalization progresses, energy-intensive 
companies; manufacturing and power sectors must metamorphose their supply chain and integrate new ideas that will 
increase productivity through a re-evaluation of their current operational models and strategies, and also adopt new 
path in technological assistance. Hence, allow companies to compete favorably in all facet of their business. Successful 
implementation of innovative technological ideology will create the avenue for an unbroken value chain. Although 
the scope of this research does not cover applicability of technological advancement in any specific industry that aligns 
sustainability in their supply chain based on the business type, or sizes of the sector (small, medium, and large scale). 
The paper establishes that; the need to transcend to a new and advanced method of operations is not contestable in 
other to meet the current inclination to achieve general growth in businesses through sustainable supply chain 
management approach. As such, any business passionate about survival in the future must transform with the new 
paradigm shift; to automate operations processes, implement sustainability standards which call for eco-friendly-
materials, designs, service delivery, energy efficient plants, and operations, among other benefits like fast effective 
and secure delivery of the most convenient methods. Hence, we summarize that the selection of new technology and

its use is an industrial sustainable supply chain should encompass utilization for; (1) Tracking and tracing (2) 
Automation of production line (3) Materials Management (4) Ergonomic reliance, and (5) Energy Savings. 
 
The remaining part of this article reports the outlook of sustainable supply chain management strategy from three 
perspectives; planning and control, organizing, and operations processes as shown in Figure 2. The convergence of 
technology and sustainability implementation practices can lead to optimum coordination between the tiers of the 
supply chain, reached through the decision making and organizing process from upstream to the downstream 
(consumer). I.e., operations upgrade through modern technological inclusion is a decision process concern that ensures 
all the players in all perspectives enjoy equal socioeconomic outcome from the supply chain framework of events 
planned. It is pertinent therefore that the process of organizing must incorporate the latest, and most useful technique 
to achieve maximum outcome which supports aggressive marketing to roll-out sustainable business operations (cost-
effective, protect against environmental degradation and promotes employee behavior to work more diligently in the 
pursuit to meet customer satisfaction). Hence, all the factors expected to drive the sustainable supply chain 
management must be embedded within the organizing process to ensure sustainability and also, to execute specific 
operations along the supply chain.

As the role of customers’ preferences and awareness to patronize economically friendly, ergonomic and highly 
sophisticated designs becomes significant, it invariably affect the resolve to settle for sustainable supply chain 
management. No doubt that as revenue generation flow is toward the entrepreneur, from their prospective consumers. 
Their capacity to control production becomes a tool which influences the companies’ decision to embrace 
environmental protection perspective, as such, become eco-friendly. More so, customers become more loyal overtime 
based on business satiation and soon promotes the organizations’ statuses in the market matrix. In conclusion, the 
adoption and proper management of newly developed industrial technology are consequential to time-saving, cost 
minimization, increased value for the customer, as well, benefit the collective global society.

Abstract 
 Companies like power utilities are confronted by a challenge of ageing of plant systems and 
equipment. The impact of obsolescence in power utilities affects both the availability and reliability of 
the system. This paper is aimed at presenting the result of the research conducted within the South 
African power utility company on the subject of obsolescence management. The study used both 
qualitative and quantitative research to collect and analyse data. The result of the study indicated the 
deficiencies in the management of obsolescence within power utility. The lack of awareness and 
funding was cited as the primary challenge in the management of obsolescence within the power 
utility. The study recommends that obsolescence management should form part of the business 
strategy, reviewed and be audited like other business processes.

1. Introduction
Companies like power utilities in South Africa are facing the challenge to cope with the business demand and 
the frustrations from ageing equipment. Due to the age and the technology used by power utility plants some of 
the systems, are no longer supported by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). The literature [1-3], 
defined the process of asset deterioration without the support from the supplier as obsolescence. There is 
evidence [4, 5] suggesting that obsolescence has both financial and operational impact on the business 
performance. The literature further suggests that technological advancement also influence the process of 
obsolescence [6]. Other publications [7, 8] maintain that obsolesce should form part of the design phase of the 
product and talk about the business strategy.  This research attempts to A) identify the method employed by the 
South African power utility company to manage asset deterioration, B) identify technology management 
strategy suitable for the South African power utility company, C) identify areas of improvement to optimise the 
impact of asset deterioration. 
Furthermore, lack of foresight on obsolete critical power plant components, government and other interested 
groups intervene with lawful regulations and restrictions as a failure in compliance with environmental policies 
can lead to product obsolescence. The cost of repeated obsolescence intervention throughout the power plant 
systems exceeds the incremental cost associated with an obsolescence management strategy. The power industry 
has no control when a certain manufacturer decides to no longer support or fabricate components identical to the 
ones installed in power plants. Power Utilities incur unnecessary cost escalation due to plant shutdowns as a 
result of lack of spares or lack of a suitable replacement for an obsolete component.  
Many Power Utilities systems are manufactured comparatively in low quantities compared to mass-produced 
items in the commercial world [2]. These systems are often very expensive, built with state of the art technology 
for their time, and may be used beyond the original lifespan originally predicted. Design lifetimes in military 
systems are often on the order of 10-20 years, but many systems are now used for 50 years [3] and more. 
Examples of such systems include Boilers and Turbines systems.

Abstract 
This article presents an exhaustive review of the literature relevant to Industry 4.0 (I.4.0) and Smart 
Factories (SFs). In this review, a landscape of I.4.0 principles is plotted in the form of a mind map, 
Definitions explored, background and components investigated, from this a pyramid framework is 
constructed. This pyramid will assist in identifying the major themes of this I.4.0 concept and help provide 
specific gaps for further research. A meta-analytic approach (qualitative literature review method) was 
taken. The paper highlights contradictions and similarities in the form of a table of current research 
presented in the field of SFs. Successful frameworks such as “Aluminium Industry 4.0”,
“SmartFactoryKL” as a model for I.4.0, and game changing case studies such as Exxon Mobil, Proctor and
Gamble and Tata Motors are explored. Finally the paper discusses the gaps in knowledge, specifically into 
the area of what I.4.0 means for developing contexts. The pyramid framework is presented in the 
recommendations section as a tool for analysis and evaluation. Results reveal that a possible scalable 
solution is needed for developing contexts. Implications of the literature survey are that an optimal tool of 
assessment for I.4.0 is needed. This can be along the lines of a matrix, rubric, or checklist for companies to 
measure practically where they stand when measured against the I.4.0 movement. Future research directions 
could focus on a more empirical study such as a future concept facility design with the concepts of I.4.0 
and SFs.

1. Introduction
The topic of Industry 4.0 (I.4.0) is no longer just a buzzword in the field of Industrial Engineering. Although this 
started as a push to increase the productivity in the manufacturing of the German Federal government, Kagermann et 
al. (2013) [1] have now started a chain reaction of events that has set alight the engineering and ICT world forever. 
Recently, researchers and industry from America’s term of the Industrial Internet of Things (Kiel, 2017) [2], to China’s 
“Made in China 2025” goal (Li, 2017) [3], to Smart Malaysia (Bahrin et al., 2016) [4], to Virtual Singapore (NRF,
2018) [5], and even locally to the NDP 2030 in RSA (NPC, 2011) [6], have shown an increased interest. One of the 
most significant current discussions revolves around how we are ushering in this new envisioned Industrial 
Revolution. Change is being planned, created and lived in right this minute and we need to get on this freight train 
before we are steamrolled by it. A substantial amount of literature exists currently on the definition and designation 
of Industry 4.0, considering the term’s short lifespan. The first serious discussions and analyses worldwide of I.4.0
appear to have emerged during the years 2015 and 2016, when many tried to describe, name and clearly quantify by

Abstract 
The last two to three centuries have witnessed humongous technological, socio-economic and 
environmental transformations which have laid precedence to the swift advancements in fields of 
sciences, engineering, medicine, business, and economics. While researchers focus on the 
productivity and economic growth potential and how subsequent industrial revolution paved the 
way for current contemporary lifestyle, very few analogies exist on the relationship between the 
intervention of the technology used and the implications as per energy management concerns 
during that period. The authors of this paper examine the impact of the changes in the industrial 
structure from the first to the third industrial revolution era (Industry 1.0, 2.0, 3.0), premised on 
the campaigns for cost-effective manufacturing and energy conservation throughput within the 
time frame, and how it transitioned to existing technological innovations. The article discusses 
energy issues and performance from the technology utilization perspective since the eighteenth 
century that has led to the present engineering practices or the resolve for change, through new 
means and technological approach. Different industrial practices which ushered the current 
anthropogenic situation are assessed, and critical strategies that are pivotal to drive current reforms, 
innovations and future ideas to see to the unstoppable realization of the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) on a 
large, medium and small scale and the possible transition to Industry 4.0 plus and Society (I4.
+S) 
are presented.

1. Introduction
Global attention towards technological advancements and the trending concept of I4.0 holds lots of potentials to cause 
socio-economic remould. Current evolutionary tendencies toward the adoption of Information Communication 
Technology (ICT) will bridge the gap between the effective interaction of man and machine steered by the Internet of 
Things (IoT), and capable of tackling environmental and work-related risks. Expert knowledge on large data 
management, cloud computing, sensor and actuation technologies, and artificial intelligence is securing the path 
towards breakthrough in advanced communication techniques, smart industry (through the use of cyber-physical 
systems), and energy conservation through power savings, generation technics, and new technologies, thereby 
reducing the atmosphere carbon emission level (Gilchrist, 2016). Past literature had focused on technical issues, such 
as techniques, type of technology, application and the opportunities which future technological development holds. A 
close observation of the industry 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, conventionally known as the first, second and third industrial 
revolution, noticed a shift from one era to the other, through the support of technological innovations. However, we 
may without doubting say that, not all three transitions from the past occurred without ill-effects. This article looks at 
some of the critical issues concerning the fourth industrial revolution development and how its possible achievement 
will impact energy conservation through the technologies proposed to drive the whole concept. Hence, the research is 
a theoretical contribution to the pre-eminent changes that come with the new initiative of I4.0, with focus on industrial 
relevance and social and environmental implications.

4. Discussions and Conclusion 
 
The attainment of optimum energy efficiency and CO2 emission reduction with regards to the implication of 
actualizing industry 4.0, depends on the capability of the aligning technologies (IoT, Cyber-Physical Systems, etc.) 
As such, when incorporated into energy management, enhance energy security, ameliorate fuel scarcity and generate 
beneficial jobs while still promoting competitiveness amongst SMEs’ and conglomerates alike, who are involved in 
the energy market. The I4.
+S which in this paper refers to the stage after successful actualization, and demonstration of 
the I4.0 through all the technologies responsible for unveiling its maximum potential and landing, on a digital society. 
The practical application of the framework to ensure smooth implementation on smart factories, energy, building, 
transport, services (health, sales, delivery, payment) and intelligent monitoring of the environment, will usher new 
economies with new business players and tremendous potentials. The development of unique transport systems, such 
as service companies like Uber and other online hosts business platforms like Amazon and Alibaba to mention a few 
is the beginning of what is yet to come in the future of transport and customer service delivery which utilizes IoT. The 
correlations of energy resources and technologies with current practices, operational competence and the way it is 
being managed or how the result affects the economic cost of living, energy production, consumption, and utilization 
are based on the zeal and commitment to move from ideation to fruition. The envisaged future intervention will replace 
traditional means of cooking and heating, from the domestic point of view, through using biomass and other crude 
methods. The I4.
+S  will feature in its entirety, smart buildings, with conservative energy plans (generation, 
consumption, and savings), smart factories, smart services, smart energy sourcing, smart transport, and smart farming 
to mention a few which in every step integrates sustainable technology that replaces the primitive technique and 
improves wellbeing. 
 
Although arguably that IoT will increase productivity, as well as lower costs through the extensive use of smart 
mechanical technology. Regardless, IoT has its concerns, which may well act as a dire hindrance to its adoption. Skills 
accusation will drastically reduce. As such, there will be a decline in the standard of leaving as a high number of

menial laborers may be phased out upon the full implementation of the fourth industrial revolution, leaving consumers 
oppressed and frustrated not being able to survive the new system. Hence, the promulgation of I4.0 and possibly the 
transition to I4.
+S threatens to leave a society where massive unemployment becomes imminent. The application of 
service robots, the operation of automated factories, and internet market networking, will in all sense necessitate the 
review of employment policies and regulations concerning job quotas. Information dissemination and the training of 
everybody about everything new will become the new interest for government in other to maintain social security. 
Thus, provide the society with the knowledge of how to live and appreciate the modern industrial era. As such, promote 
fair competition and further innovative thinking for the latest resolve.

Abstract 
Efficient stacking strategy in a container terminal is an essential task affecting competitiveness in many 
seaports, especially because this singular action may influence many of the conflicting objectives, like 
minimizing the reshuffles (unproductive moves) and number of future relocations of containers in storage 
yard and maximizing the yard density and stacking area capacity utilisation. Any delay or deficiency in 
the synchronization and sequencing of daily operations and activities between seaside and landside of 
terminal will affect the stacking process in the container yard and may lead to the interference of terminal 
operations and lack of control in the scheduling of concurrent operations and activities during the 
management of inbound and outbound containers. 
In this paper, we model a seaport container terminal as a queuing system to obtain the service level 
parameters. A multi-server queue in tandem consisting of two stages was considered, the first stage being 
the relations between handling-off process and transportation process, the second stage being the relations 
between transportation process and stacking process. Also, we consider twenty different scenarios of 
container stacking inside a container terminal to evaluate the performance of the queuing model. These 
scenarios vary from each other in terms of quantities of containers, durations of stay for the vessels in the 
seaport and number of equipments (quay cranes, yard trucks and yard cranes) that are used to perform the 
operations. 
Experimental results were obtained from using the queuing model to evaluate the performance of the 
seaport container terminal operations, and to understand the behavior and characteristics of container 
stacking problem in a container yard. In general, experimental results show how increase in the number of 
service centers (yard trucks in the first stage and yard cranes in the second stage) affect the total waiting 
time of containers in the queue, the total time for containers that are serviced in the system and the 
average utilization of the system. Furthermore, we determined the optimal number of equipments to be 
are used in service to achieve a given service level.

1. Introduction
Most container terminals want to improve and develop the container stacking system and the usage of storage space 
in the yard area, in order to facilitate accessibility to the containers in the stacking area and to minimize the 
reshuffles (unproductive moves) due to inappropriate storage location and stacking orders of containers. In stacking 
area, the containers are stacked within a set of blocks, and they are usually arranged and classified according to a 
number of factors: their destination (inbound, outbound, and transshipped), loading status (FCL, LCL and empty), 
type of goods (reefer, dangerous …etc) and container size (TEU, FEU, non-standards). Many seaports try to manage 
their container terminals efficiently, and they apply different stacking strategies to improve the efficiency 
(minimizing unproductive movements) and to increase the productivity (throughput) of container terminals. The best

Abstract 
This paper explores different forecasting techniques to predict sales data for the automobile, Ford Mustang. 
Companies rely on accurate forecasted data to make the right business decisions and to foresee long-term 
and short-term market performances. Forecasting data like sales data, demand data and market trends helps 
companies better manage their resources like cash flow, project funds, project plans, workforce and 
inventory. Forecasts are usually based on past data, industry-comparisons and market trends. In this project, 
different time-series forecasting models such as moving average, exponential smoothing, Holt’s double 
exponential smoothing method, Winter’s triple exponential smoothing method and the ARIMA were 
utilized. Forecasts were made based on the individual yearly data (non-seasonal) and also on all the yearly 
data combined (seasonal) in the ARIMA model. Minitab was used to generate forecasts for both Winter’s 
triple exponential smoothing method as well as the ARIMA model. Further, on computing the mean 
absolute deviation (MAD), it was found that the best forecasting method for this given set of data was found 
out to be Holt’s double exponential smoothing method. This study may inspire companies to adopt accurate 
forecasting techniques for similar data and may also motivate future studies to develop further precise 
forecasting tools.

1. Introduction
Forecasting is an integral component of any economy. It is the practice of predicting future patterns based on past 
data. Many things are predicted in our day-to-day lives. Predicting data helps an economy to visualize and prepare 
itself to face future situations (SHJ Consulting, 2007). It also helps to establish forecasting techniques that best match 
the actual data already present. Forecasting sales, demand patterns, trends, economic upturns and downturns, etc help 
any business to plan their operations accordingly. Businesses depend on accurate forecasts in order to plan projects, 
workforce, production, sales, profit margins, back-up plans, resources, inventory, funds, performance, business 
locations and to minimize uncertainty (James D. Blocher, 2004).  
Forecasting methods are mainly classified as qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative methods are used when the data 
available is insufficient or there is no historic data available at all. These forecasts are based on judgements, beliefs, 
instincts, perceptions and are often subjective (Mechanical, 2014). For example, in order to study a new product’s 
demand in the market, it might be required to carry out a survey with the correct set of participants suited to use the 
product. There are many qualitative methods that can be used in forecasting, such as: a) An expert opinion, b) Simple 
survey, c) Approximate estimation, d) Delphi method (Mechanical, 2014).  
Quantitative methods, on the other hand are developed on actual mathematical models and are objective in nature. 
They forecast data as a function of past or historic data. For example, common commodities consumption trends can

From the above table, it can be seen that the least observed MAD is 1165, as a result of forecasts made using the 
double exponential smoothing method (Holt’s method). The next best models in this scenario were found to be the 
simple exponential smoothing and ARIMA (1,1,0) using the non-seasonal model to forecast data from 2014 to 2017. 
The method with the highest MAD is the ARIMA (1,1,0), which had forecasted data from 2016 to 2017. One more 
interesting observation in Table 4 can be the forecasted values using MA (3). It is seen that for periods 2 and 9, the 
MAD was found to be the least with 12 and 81 respectively. However, it has to be noted that the MADs for the 
consecutive periods were found to be very deviant.  This shows one of the disadvantages of the moving average 
method, as it does not consider data outside of its specified period. Furthermore, it can be seen from Table 4 that the 
MAD for SES and DES seems to fluctuate in the beginning of the data series, but the forecasts stabilize in the later 
periods (i.e. 9-12). It can be seen from Figure 2 that most of the models have their peak MADs in the middle of the 
year. It should also be noted that the MAD’s for non-seasonal ARIMA and Winter’s model, predicting data from 2016 
have drastically increased after period 7. 
 
 
Figure 2. Comparison of MAD for all forecasting models 
Note: SA-1, SA-2 and SA-3 refer to the three scenarios of the seasonal ARIMA model used. 
7. Proposed Improvement 
Accurate forecasts are a challenging task. However, they can be achieved by trial and error, or by seeking an expert 
advice on model parameters.  
The ARIMA model was run with limited parameter changes. The AR, I and the MA (p,d,q) terms have been chosen 
in the combinations of 1 and 0. There could have been several other combinations to choose the p,d,q terms, both in 
the non-seasonal and seasonal scenarios, to achieve more accurate results. 
Similarly, by changing the period length, alpha, beta, gamma values for the other models like moving average and 
exponential smoothing methods, there could have been better forecasted values.  Future research can exhaust the 
various combinations of contributing factors to provide more accurate forecasts.  
8. Conclusion 
Various time-series forecasting models like moving average, simple, double and triple exponential smoothing, and the 
ARIMA model were applied to data series of automotive sales from 2010 – 2016 and were analyzed for accuracy 
using mean absolute deviation. Microsoft Excel and Minitab were used to forecast sales. Double exponential

smoothing model, followed by the simple exponential smoothing was found to be the best fit for the data collected, 
considering the forecasting parameters used.  
There is no single best method for forecasting any data, as accuracy of forecasts can be optimized in all models, given 
the right parameters. All models have their advantages and dis-advantages in forecasting data. Hence the right model 
to fit any given data has to be cautiously chosen.  
Forecasting is a very tricky, yet interesting task. It might take long to arrive at the correct model for any given data 
set, but once the model is the best fit, it can help predict accurate data. Accurate forecasts immensely help businesses 
plan their operations accordingly.

Abstract 
Supply chain performance can be determined by few factors like operating capital, inventory and time. 
However, one of the fundamental factors considered while optimizing a supply chain is the transportation 
cost. In this study, supply chain distribution network of two cable manufacturers were analyzed with the 
help of a linear programming mathematical model. The framework developed can be broadly categorized 
into three different stages in the life cycle of a product, namely a) Pre-production Phase b) Post-production 
Phase c) Distribution Phase. Transportation costs were estimated for each of these phases. Additional 
scenarios like increasing and decreasing the number of distributors were considered and analyzed for any 
reduction in the overall transportation costs of the supply chains. The findings show that varying the number 
of distributors may not necessarily result in a reduction in transportation cost. This study conveys that 
organizations need to strategically position their distributors to optimize the distribution costs. The 
developed framework is applicable to any supply chain network with multiple suppliers, single 
manufacturer, multiple distributors and multiple customers.  This study may inspire future study on 
developing and solving models with a diverse range of scenarios.

1. Introduction
Supply chains always delve into strategies to optimize the key metrics that define the success of a supply chain. 
Transportation cost is one such metric that constantly motivates enhancement and optimization of supply chains in 
order for it to be profitable (Russell, Coyle, Ruamsook, & Thomchick, 2018).  Transportation costs are greatly affected 
by distribution networks (Li, Lim, Miao, & Rodrigues, 2006). Distribution refers to transfer of goods between any of 
the two consecutive stages involved in a supply chain. Distribution is one of the prime factors that requires heavy 
weightage in a supply chain as it not only determines the overall cost of the supply chain, but it also directly affects 
the consumer experience (Chopra & Meindl, Supply Chain Management - Strategy, Planning and Operation, 2007). 
Organizations can choose their distribution network designs; but a poor distribution network design can cause supply 
chains to result in non-profitability and can greatly affect its performance.  Distribution networks can directly affect 
the overall supply chain profitability and responsiveness (Rajgopal, 2016). Chopra, 2003 states that there are two 
factors that must be considered while assessing the performance of a distribution network: a) Customer requirements 
met and b) Cost of meeting customer requirements.   An organization must understand its requirements and 
numerically analyze the locations suitable for its distribution centers. Thorough analysis of affecting factors must be 
done to decide on the locations, capacities, modes of transport and transportation costs involved.  
There are many factors that affect the distribution network design of a supply chain. Few of them as stated by Chopra 
& Meindl, 2007 are a) response time, b) product variety, c) product availability, d) customer experience, e) time to 
market, f) order visibility and g) returnability. Response time refers to the total time in which an order is received by 
a consumer. Product variety refers to the diverse collection of products present in the distribution network. Product 
availability is the availability of a specific product in stock at the time of arrival of the customer. Customer experience

6. Results and Discussion 
 
It has been noticed that decreasing or increasing the number of distributors does not necessarily affect the distribution 
costs in a supply chain network. Below is a summary of all the cases considered for a comparative analysis in the form 
of a table provided for both manufacturers.  
It is seen that increasing the number of distribution centers for the design network of Arabian Cable Industry proved 
to result in reducing the transportation costs, with three distribution centers resulting in optimum cost among the 
scenarios.  
It is observed that the transportation cost is reduced when General Cables varies its distribution centers to three and 
one. However, optimum results are obtained in the three-distribution center network.

7. Conclusion 
 
Supply chain distribution network designs play a major role in deciding the performance and profitability of an 
organization. Along with reduction in distribution costs, a good distribution network also results in satisfactory 
customer service and experience. An effective network topology helps to address all factors that define the success of 
a supply chain.   
As every organization is free to design its own distribution network, a detailed analysis of all network options along 
with modes of transport and all constraints that may be involved has to be conducted. Organizations have to understand 
and estimate their requirements, potential customer locations and demand, uncertainty in demand, capacities, etc 
before setting up a network.  
In conclusion, it has been seen that altering the patterns of distributors in a network may not always result in reduced 
distribution costs. Hence, all the possibilities and combinations have to be analyzed through a reliable and accurate 
approach before implementing the design. Future study may be conducted on complex detailed supply chain 
distribution network designs with more accurate models to arrive at optimal solutions.

Abstract 
This project aims to address non-compliances in 3D feature based Computer Aided Design (CAD) models 
and drawings that are delivered to the customers under agreed Technical Data Packages (TDP’s), at the 
various conceptual, developmental and production levels of a company. It has been found that over 20% of 
all models in the TDP has shown evidence of non-compliance. This results in profit losses, lost time and 
morale of employees. The DMAIC Six-Sigma approach was used to define the problem, measure the extent 
of the problem, analyze the problem, attempt to identify root causes, find solutions to reduce the effects of 
the problem, and finally, sustain the improvements made. Various six-sigma tools like project charter, 
operational definition, control charts, fish-bone analysis, etc. have been used to improve the non-
compliance situation. After implementing the improvements discussed in this project, there has been a 
significant reduction in the number of non-compliances, validated through statistical quality control tools. 
On the whole, this project has helped acquire a deeper insight of the application of six-sigma DMAIC 
approach.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background 
This project is the actual case study of a concern in a company based in Michigan – USA. The company manufactures 
certain components for the defense industry and also produces 3D feature based Computer Aided Design (CAD) 
models and drawings under agreed Technical Data Packages (TDP’s) for the components manufactured. These models 
are generated by personnel at many facilities remote to the main office, and a lot of detail and effort goes into making 
a CAD model. This increases the chance of errors in the model. Therefore, sometimes, some models develop few non-
compliances with the customer’s requirements. This situation may not be completely eliminated; however, the fraction 
of models non-complaint can be significantly reduced.  
Currently, about 20% of the total models in a TDP are being rejected due to evidence of non-compliance. After 
evaluating the TDP and the costs involved, it has been found that the resultant cost incurred is about $231K based on 
the combination of part, assembly and installation files. In addition to the above mentioned Non-compliance the 
company’s reputation is also vulnerable. The wasted effort to correct the TDP models also has an impact on profits. 
1.2 DMAIC Approach 
This project uses the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control) Six-Sigma approach to improve the 
condition of this problem. The DMAIC improvement cycle comprises of 5 stages. Each of these stages is described 
below:

Figure 13: P-chart of rejected parts post improvement 
Figure 14 illustrates the Pareto analysis of rejected parts. There is only one root cause resulting in the 2 defects, 
which is layers. It is noticed that the rest of the root causes are eliminated post improvement and no resultant defects 
are found.  
Figure 14: Pareto Analysis of rejected parts 
Another validation technique used to measure the improvement is hypothesis testing. For this scenario, proportion 
hypothesis testing method was used. Test was conducted to observe if the proportion of defects had improved. Since 
it is conducted on the same number of samples, proportion testing is conducted to show the statistical significance. 
𝐻0: 𝑃<= 0.2 
𝐻𝑎: 𝑃> 0.2
𝑥= 2, 𝑛= 758 
Since 𝑥< 𝑛𝑝0 i.e. 2 < 758*0.3 = 151.6
𝑍0 =
(𝑥+ 0.5) −𝑛𝑝0
√𝑛𝑝0(1 −𝑝0)
= 2.5 −151.6
√151.6 ∗0.8
= −13.53
𝑃(𝑍> −13.53) = 1 −𝑃 (𝑍< 13.53) ≅1 = 𝑝𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒
Assuming 𝛼= 0.05 
Since 𝑝𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒> 𝛼, we do not have evidence to reject the null hypothesis. Hence, the new proportion or the number 
of defects are lesser than the previous number of defects.  
8. Conclusion
This project successfully applies the concept of DMAIC to a real situation and effectively helps to mitigate the 
problem. Various six sigma tools were discussed and understood in detail in the course of this project. Although the 
DMAIC processes were implemented, the true tool of success was communication.  
Upon developing an SOP and supporting Guidelines for various modeling techniques that were posted in the 
company’s intranet, it was the physical SOP introduction sessions that brought awareness and understanding of the 
need to improve modeling quality. The directive was also supported by upper management in companywide webinars.

It was also recognized that the formal documentation that would govern compliance be processed as official company 
documents and additional training be available. The SOP’s would also become mandatory on-boarding material for 
all direct hires and contractors that would be model generators. 
The Compliance Team was a necessary action to act as a go-no-go gage. In the initial stages the reviews were manual 
with the assistance of Model Check, but future efforts would be coordinated with the Information Technology (IT) for 
automated processing and retention. It is important that critical metrics be identified and made available for progress 
review and future training for items that continue to be non-compliant.

Abstract 
This paper compares combustion behaviour and energy content of cow dung and cactus bonded briquettes. 
Briquettes were produced using yellow thatching grass, groundnut shells, sugarcane leaves, Mopani leaves 
and combination recipe (composed of all loose samples) collected from a location in the north eastern part 
of the Limpopo province. The aim was to identify loose biomass feedstock available in that location to 
sustainably produce good quality briquettes with the highest energy content and good combustion 
behaviour. Cow dung and cactus were selected as binders during the briquetting process. Briquettes 
produced with cow dung binder exhibited good performance with regards to improved energy content. The 
briquettes were produced for varying compaction pressures of 6, 12 and 19 MPa. Cow dung bonded 
briquettes were found to have the highest energy content across all pressures. At 6 MPa, Mopani leaves 
briquettes had 21.53 MJ/kg, groundnut shells 16.85 MJ/kg at 12 MPa and sugarcane 19.11 MJ/kg at 19MPa. 
The lowest energy content for cow dung was reported with yellow thatching grass at minimum average of 
14.84 MJ/kg across all pressures. Cow dung bonded briquettes were found to have the highest combustion 
rates across all pressures with groundnut shells recording 209.67 g/min at 19 MPa, 104.71 g/min at 12 MPa 
and 83.16 g/min at 6 MPa. The lowest performance was recorded for sugarcane leaves at 38.13 g/min. 
Cactus bonded briquettes were found be very low on both energy content and combustion rates due to its 
pressure insensitivity and higher moisture content. The highest energy content for cactus bound briquettes 
was found to be at 16.49 MJ/kg for Mopani leaves followed by groundnut at 15.5 MJ/kg with the lowest at 
12.6 MJ.kg for yellow thatching grass. The highest combustion rate was found at combination recipe with 
59.48 g/min followed by Mopani leaves at 53.91 g/min. The lowest was 3.36 g/min for yellow thatching 
grass. Overall, cow dung bound briquettes performed better than cactus briquettes for all compaction 
pressures.

Burn rate was analysed during combustion. Results of all combusted briquettes showed cow dung bonded 
briquette to combust much slower with Mopani leaves briquettes burning at a rate of 0.0126 g/min 
compared to cactus bonded Mopani leaves briquettes which combusted at 0.0288 g/min. 
 
4. 
CONCLUSION  
Briquettes produced using cow dung and cactus binders were compared for their energy content 
and combustion behaviour. Cow dung bonded Mopani leaves briquettes showed a good 
performance on both lower and high compaction pressures. For cow dung binder, groundnut shell, 
Mopani leaves and combination recipe briquettes exhibited good performance and are good 
candidates for future briquetting with average burn rate of 0.0233 g/min. The highest energy 
content on cow dung bonded briquettes was at 21 MJ/kg and for cactus was at 16 MJ/kg. Thus, 
cow dung with 75: 25 mixing ratios performed better with 5 MJ/kg more energy content compared 
to cactus briquettes. During combustion, cow dung bonded briquettes combusted for the maximum 
of 209 minutes and cactus bind briquettes lasted for 59 minutes. This is less than half of cow dung 
briquette performance. Cactus bonded briquettes require blending. Combination recipe briquettes 
showed improved bulk density with slower burn rate of 0.0288 g/min. Slow burn rate is required 
for better energy extraction with longer cooking cycles.

Abstract 
Service delivery deficit remains an overwhelming predicament in South Africa. With ageing 
infrastructure, prolonged decision-making times in government, and the way in which municipal councils 
deliver electricity, water, sanitation services and domestic/industrial waste removals, public unrests, 
triggered by these factors are set to continue. Although these induce a lot of worries, the main concern is, 
if nothing is done urgently, the situation would soon degenerate into a fully-fledged revolt of the masses. 
While there are some diagnostic tools developed to assess service delivery health with the aim of 
improving service delivery performance, the tools, with their qualifying criteria need to be evaluated for 
fitness within the South African context. 
This paper investigates and validates, through focus group driven evaluation, what performance criteria 
should be used to select an existing service delivery diagnostic tool to measure the performance of service 
delivery in South Africa. A tool must thus sufficiently satisfy the criteria, to be considered adequate, 
appropriate and effective in South Africa.

The suggested hierarchy provides a structured framework to enable practical pairwise comparison that would lead to 
optimal decisions on choosing the best solution. A future exercise is thereby required to engage relevant 
stakeholders to validate the practicality of the sub-criteria and for decision makers to complete the pairwise 
comparisons and come up with a lasting solution for South Africa in respect of diagnostic capabilities to assess the 
performance of our service delivery in a way that can enable evidence driven policy making that would ultimately 
close service delivery deficits in the country. 
5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
According to the World Bank (Report, 2011), one of the major reasons for Service Delivery issues in South 
Africa is inadequate assessment (including monitoring and feedback) of the health of Service Delivery. 
Although a plethora of assessment tools exist all over the world (and few in South Africa) for the same purpose, 
civil unrests, fueled by service delivery deficits continue to hunt South Africa (Tirivangasi, 2016) as they often 
lead to damage to public properties, disruption of civic activities, police brutality and sometimes loss of life. 
Concerted efforts by government and its organs to stem these discontent and civic uprisings have not yielded 
much result, prompting  several authors, including Makanyeza (2013), Sibanda (2012), just to mention a few, to 
suggest, in agreement with the World Bank, that a diagnostic assessment of the performance of service delivery 
is needed. In response to that requirement, we posit in this paper that a scientific approach with proper 
theoretical grounding is necessary in the design, development, and application of such a tool.   
 
We therefore explored, using the focus group discussion approach (and the AHP, for decision hierarchy 
suggestion), what criteria, service delivery assessment tools need to satisfy to deal with the inadequacy 
identified by the World Bank report and other authors. The study sets out by validating first, via the highly 
diversified, purposively recruited focus group participants, whether a need exists for a service delivery 
assessment tool. The response was in the affirmative: one is needed, and urgently too! The response satisfies the 
first study objective.  
 
Afterwards, the necessary criteria that such tools must satisfy to be considered relevant, adequate and 
appropriate within the South African context were defined and validated by the FGPs, fulfilling the second 
objective of this study. The third study objective is met by providing a decision-criteria hierarchy, premised on 
the AHP approach, to select the most appropriate tool from what is currently available. Given that South Africa 
national government, local government, the general public, an international agency, non-governmental 
organizations, the academia and industry were represented in the FGD, we took liberty to understand their 
perception of performance of service delivery and we reported on their feedback. Their feedback indicates that 
much still needs to be done in the area of service delivery. For instance, notwithstanding the availability of 
electricity, the group thinks it doesn’t get value for money and that electricity is too costly in South Africa. The 
group passed a vote of no confidence on the quality of water while reiterating lack of value for money: This 
group is generally urban, indicating the situation will be worse with South African rural dwellers. Affordable 
housing was rated low on cost and value for money, meaning housing is generally not affordable in South 
Africa. On a positive note, the group is happy with wastes removal and sanitation. This is not unexpected given 
the group’s geo-location in urban South Africa. 
 
To reach a final conclusion and strategic solution pathway for South Africa, it is recommended that a further 
study be commissioned to subject the defined goals and criteria to pairwise comparisons by relevant 
stakeholders and decision makers.

Application of Supply Chains in Land Registration

Abstract 
Land is the most crucial resource in any nation especially due to its scarcity in wake of unlimited needs 
and wants by mankind. Land has been a major resource of conflict due to the need for countries to expand 
their territories. Even, nowadays land disputes still exist between traditional leaders and municipalities, 
individuals and cooperations. This is because land is viewed as a social, cultural and economic resource. 
The registration of land is thus of importance so that rights to land are well defined and are protected. 
These rights give information on who owns what land and the type of land ownership that exists. This is 
referred to as land tenure security that is achieved through secure land rights. These secure land rights are 
then used as a basis financing land related projects by financial institutions where land and other real 
property and mostly immovable property are used as collateral. In communal areas, land registration can 
in principle, improve agricultural productivity as farmers can seek funding from banks to make their land 
more productive due to possessing title to land. Eventually land registration creates land markets which 
involves the buying and selling of real or immovable property meaning land and buildings which is a 
major contributor to public funds collected by governments to support service delivery as land and 
property transactions contribute substantially to the gross domestic product of a country. While land 
registration is of immense importance, developing countries face challenges in managing land registration 
processes and in organizing the related land information in a systematic and easy to access manner so that 
timeous land transactions can be done. In some cases the land registration process is too long and 
inefficient while it is costly to the buyer of real property or the individual or cooperation wishing to 
register title. This results in insecure land transactions and a failing of the property market in a country. 
This affect government revenue acquired though through land and property tax and this brings the need of 
a well-functioning land registration system in the nation. Land registration systems have been modelled 
using unified modeling language in previous research. This paper employs supply chain management to 
model land registration process in an urban environment. This paper argues that supply chain 
management can be used to model and manage the land registration process. In this study, the land 
registration process is considered to be a supply chain comprising of a land owner, surveyor, surveyor 
general’s office, notary and the deeds offices as the supply chain partners.

principle result in a one stop shop for the land registration system (Chimhamhiwa, 2002), in which the person or 
corporate body requiring registration only has to visit one office in order to receive the total service, which often 
results in increased customer satisfaction. 
 
5. Conclusions 
Supply chain mapping can be utilized in modelling and visualising land registration systems. The processes involved 
in land registration have been mapped successfully including the connectivity between the supply chain partners. 
The supply chain mapping revealed that there are several actors who participate in the land registration processes 
towards the delivery of the final legal documents which confirm land title to the applicant. The processes relate to an 
analogue procedure which needs to be embedded with information technology as demonstrated for the document 
access system. Information technology improves supply chain success due to improved communication between 
supply chain partners and quicker turnaround times in production processes. Thus, adoption of information and 
communication technologies will in principle improve the overall effectiveness of the land registration supply chain. 
There is still need to test the suitability of supply chain management as a management tool for land registration 
systems. Future work entails the adoption of the supply chain operations reference model (SCOR) in the 
management of the land registration process. The SCOR model uses basic processes namely Plan, Source, Make, 
Deliver and Return in managing supply chain activities.

Abstract 
The twentieth and twenty-first centuries have dawned with their unique problems that have been brewing 
for many decades and slowly consuming the environment, causing it to deteriorate at a very rapid rate. In 
recent years’ energy, efficiency has significantly gained research interest in stature, it is necessary to alter 
the way that energy is utilized. Energy-intensive sector such as manufacturing industry in South Africa 
can provide a competitive advantage on a national scale and could gain cost advantage against global 
competitors, if the energy productivity demand improves across the economy through lean energy-
efficient opportunity in manufacturing operations and fourth industrial revolution. The need for energy 
efficient manufacturing industries requires the understanding of different customer’s energy demand and 
ability to fulfill these demands while maintaining the economies of scale at the same time. These can be 
achieve by segmenting manufacturing into various sectors to focus on high intensive energy users, and 
then gradually give attention to the others. The paper identified and investigated the existing gap in the 
train manufacturing plant equipment lists through determination of equipment energy demand profile and 
presents an analysis of the proposed energy efficiency initiative using 80-20 Pareto analysis principle to 
analyze the equipment lists.

1. Introduction
The changes among manufacturers in the industry, in the quest for meeting customised product and the variability in 
customer’s demand requires process technology diffusion. These aspects are associated with the new programming 
language development and the network complexity. The increasingly mature and complex market has gradually 
shifted from a sellers’ market to a buyers’ market, which in turn creates a tendency that forces a transformation on 
production philosophy from mass production to intelligent production (Brettel et al., 2014). Industrial energy 
efficiency can be influence by changes in industrial processes and by changes in capacity utilisation (Ren21 GSR, 
2016). The social, environmental and economic aims of sustainable development need to be supported and energy 
efficiency (EE) is regarded as one of the most cost effective ways of meeting the varying demands of sustainability 
(Oyedepo, 2012). The benefits of energy efficiency to the environment are self-evident, only three decades ago did 
the issue of environmental safety and energy shortage crisis became publically known (Newman et al. 2012).  
These benefits are of particular relevance, furthermore Eskom (the national power supply authority in South Africa) 
stated that in 2002 the use of coal as the primary fuel in electricity generation, accounted for 36% of the world’s 
electricity production and is going to remain so until 2028 (Statistic South Africa, 2005). South Africa remains one 
of the highest emitters of the greenhouse gas CO2 per capita in the world (Burck et al. 2014). Hu et al. (2012), states 
that the energy being consume is attracting much attention due to its environmental impact and with this being one 
of the reasons that the Eco-design bill was promulgated into law according to Motenbroek et al. (2012). Green 
manufacturing also has the potential for economic benefit as a byproduct of its implementation (Newman et al. 
2012), for example reducing the energy consumption and reduces the overheads of that specific machine. All 
machines can be included in the energy saving strategy as alluded to the above improvement in energy efficient 
methods to reduce the operating cost of the machine and therefore indirectly reduces the emissions produced during 
the generation of electricity.

Abstract 
Fossil fuels have been the main source of energy for many years hence the depletion of resource. There is 
therefore a need for alternative cleaner energy sources of fuel to be explored. The use of these conventional 
fuels led to land degradation global warming and air pollution. A wood gasifier machine which produces 
combustible gas from solid fuels like charcoal, wood and agriculture residue was designed. The combustible 
gas can be used for heating purposes or to produce mechanical or electrical energy. There was a great 
literature search for the technology currently being used for gasification processes which led to the design 
and manufacture of the gasifier prototype which was tested and came out successfully. An internal 
combustion engine was run on the combustible gas. Gasification bi-products that came out were tar and ash 
which could be used for water proofing and fertilizer respectively. Biofuels are renewable energy sources 
and are carbon neutral as they do not increase the total amount carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The test 
also revealed some shortcomings in the design. The air which was used to allow for combustion to take 
place was inadequate, hence there is a need for further research.

1. Introduction
The demand for alternative energy sources is on a gradual increase in order to avoid the usage of fossil fuels which 
have various negative environmental impacts. Water and Air pollution, climate change and the need of independent 
power supply are the major driving factors making renewable energy grow in popularity as it is cleaner and cheaper 
(Jacobson, 2010). The other reasons for the search for alternative energy sources is due to the increase in consumption 
of fossil fuels and the depletion of the reserves (Sharma, 2016). A gasifier is a machine that uses biomass as fuel to 
produce electrical or mechanical power. In the gasifier, the biomass is converted into combustible gas called syngas 
or producer gas. Syngas can be used for heating or to produce mechanical or electrical power. The combustion of 
syngas can be used to provide heat for boilers, and or the syngas can be used as the combustible fluid for an internal 
combustion engine. The gasification bi-products are tar, which can be used for water proofing, and ash which can be 
used as fertilizer. The syngas is composed of the combustible gases hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane, 
produced as a result of incomplete combustion of the carbon containing fuel. The most common biomass fuels for 
gasifiers are charcoal and wood. Agricultural residues like maize cobs and rice husks, can also be used as fuel for the 
gasifier. Gasifiers can be employed for small scale renewable energy power generation for rural areas, small industries 
or in agriculture for irrigation (Nanthavong & Xayalath, 2008). Gasifier machines for large scale applications can 
produce more than 500kW of power (FAO, 1986).

6. Conclusions 
 
Internal combustion engines require syngas with tar content below 15mg/Nm3, too much tar above this threshold can 
cause problems during engine operation and pipe blockages. For the starved bed gasifier tests are required to be 
conducted to test the effectiveness of the gas cleaning system. Improvements on the packed bed filter may be required, 
as well as adding some materials like pressure and temperature sensors. During the scrubbing operation, the condensed 
tar may block the filter perforations hence it is of necessity to be able to measure the pressure drop across the filter. 
With such a system, the gasifier would be allowed to operate within a specified range of pressure drop. If the pressure 
drop exceeds a specified maximum, then cleaning or replacement of the filter material would be required. To build an 
effective heat exchanger the gas temperature at the cooler inlet should be determined. Temperature sensors are required 
to be installed in the gasifier reactor, these will serve to notify an operator if the gasifier is operating at normal 
conditions.

Abstract 
Non-destructive testing (NDT) is one aspect of the Quality Control (QC) function and is complementary to 
other long well-known QC methods. The purpose of the study is to alert the mass population about the need 
for safety measures for end users of products and those working with this plant productions through 
forecasting and evaluation of the use and operation of the lifespan of a part of a system at different 
production and operational phases. Descriptive Research Design was designed during the study. A survey 
research design was used to collect quantitative unprocessed information from the sample of interest. 
Statistical analysis was used to summarize the data. SPSS was used to run the results obtained from the 
survey also for validation and testing of reliability, the Cronbach alpha method was used to test the 
correlation of the data. From the information examination, it is seen that under half of the staff concurred 
that the equipment and were in a decent working condition. That is the one Variable that needs to be 
considered the most and changed with the end goal for development to happen.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background of the Topic
Non-destructive testing (NDT) is one aspect of the Quality Control (QC) function and is complementary to other well-
known QC methods. In recent studies of Rohloff, H. pty (2018) their conclusion implies that an evaluation of materials 
for both internal defaults or material surface for a product or service is regarded as Non-Destructive Testing (NDT). 
This incorporates those test strategies used to look at a question, material or framework without debilitating its future 
handiness before coordinate contact is made with the end client of the item. (Rohloff, H. pty, 2018). Alternative words 
to use for NDT are Non-Destructive Evaluation and Non-Destructive Inspection.  
NDT is in the brackets of applied science and engineering department or field which use techniques such as non-
invasive techniques to identify the integrity and dependability of materials or structures measure their characteristics 
through a quantitative approach without rendering them unfit for a service after application (Bray and Stanley, 1996). 
It is important to indicate that NDT techniques have been used in the industry for more than 30 years to analyze and 
evaluate material, component or system properties without compromising the inspected object’s integrity (Huang and 
Wang, 2016).

Abstract 
Non-dimensional variables are very useful as they reduce the number of variables when analyzing 
physical phenomenon. In this paper, the solutions to the frequency equation of multilink flexible robots 
with elastic constraints is analyzed in a compact form using the dimensional analysis. First, dimensionless 
governing differential equation of motion is presented. Second, dimensionless boundary conditions are 
obtained. Third, the dimensionless frequency equation and the orthogonality conditions among the mode 
shapes are derived. Fourth, some degenerate cases are developed and compared against some existing 
models. Finally, dimensionless wave numbers are plotted for various joint stiffness ratio to show the 
influence of various dimensionless parameters on the natural vibrational behavior of the planar multilink 
flexible robots. 
Keywords  
Dimensionless, planar, mode, vibration, wave. 
1. Introduction
Most studies dealing with the vibrational behavior of planar multilink flexible robots have considered the base of 
each link as clamped to the actuator gearhead shaft. Such approaches however failed to consider the relative 
displacement between link and actuator shaft. Beards (1995) observed that actual connections have always some 
degree of flexibility. Moreover, few previous published studies focus on the dimensional analysis of the multilink 
flexible robots. However, dimensionless analysis reduces the number of relevant variables needed to describe a 
physical phenomenon (Volker, Bernhard & Hassan, 2017). Han, Benaroya and Wei (1999) investigated the 
dynamics of transversely vibrating beams using dimensionless quantities. The aim of this paper is to conduct a 
dimensional analysis of natural vibrations of planar multilink flexible robots with elastic constraints focusing on the 
dimensionless wave numbers. 
1. Equation of motion and boundary conditions
Consider a planar multilink flexible robot with link i connected to the shaft of the gearhead of the ith actuator. The 
link- shaft connection can be modelled as either clamped or elastic. Figure 1 represents the traditional clamped 
model against the elastic constraint model.

Figure 2 shows the effect of the actual mass at the distal end of link 1 on the fundamental wave number of link 1 
(
). It can be observed that for a specific joint stiffness value, when the actual mass at the distal end of link 1 
increases from 2 to 4.5, the wave number decreases. When the joint stiffness is small enough, the effect of actual 
mass at the distal end of link 1 is not significant. However, the effect of the actual mass on the wave number 
becomes more significant when the joint stiffness increases. 
The effect of the actual mass at the distal end of link 1 on the second wave number of link 1 (
) is illustrated in 
Figure 3. It can be observed that when the actual mass decreases from 4.5 to 2, the 
 curve undergoes a parallel 
upward shift up to transition, where there is a steeping twist shift, after which the slope drops to zero. As can be seen 
from Figures 2 and 3, when the joint stiffness varies from 1 to 10000, 
 is almost doubled while 
 does not 
change much. Therefore, 
 is more affected than 
 when the joint stiffness changes. This finding is in 
agreement with Rao and Mirza (1989) who observed that the higher mode frequencies are less sensitive to rotational 
spring constant changes than the lower mode frequencies. 
Figure 4 reveals the effect of the payload on the fundamental wave number of link 2 (
. There are a number of 
similarities between Figures 2 and 4. The effect of the payload on 
 is similar to the one of the mass at the distal 
end of link 1 on 
. 
The effect of the payload on the second dimensionless wave number (
) is plotted in Figure 5. When both the 
actual mass at the distal end and the dimensionless stiffness increase, the 
 curve undergoes a parallel downward 
shift, which implies that the second wave number of link 2 on all joint stiffness values drop by the same amount. 
Figure 6 shows the effect of the actual moment of inertia on 
. When the actual moment at the distal end of link 1 
changes from 0.4 to 1.3, the 
 curve is not significantly affected by the dimensionless stiffness up to transition, 
where there is a steeping twist shift, followed by a region where the slope drops to zero. 
The effect of the actual moment of inertia on 
 is revealed in Figure 7. When the actual moment of inertia 
decreases from 1.3 to 0.96, the 
 curve moves upward without losing its shape. However, as the actual moment 
drops to 0.4 the curve slightly loses its shape in the region of high joint stiffness. 
Figure 8 indicates that when the actual moment of inertia increases from 0.0028 to 0.01, there are no significant 
changes in the 
 curve. Therefore, 
 is not significantly affected when the actual moment of inertia at the end 
of link 2 increases from 0.0028 to 0.01. 
From Figure 9, it is clear that when the actual moment at the end of link 2 changes from 0.0028 to 0.01, the 
 
curve moves downward with a slight change of shape in the region of higher joint stiffness. 
Figure 10 shows that when the contribution of masses non-collocated at the distal end of link 1 decreases from 3 to 
0.5, the 
 curve undergoes a steeping twist shift, which implies that the first wave number of link 1 that is less 
sensitive in the region of low joint stiffness, becomes more sensitive in the region of high joint stiffness. 
As shown in Figure 11, when the contribution of masses of distal link increases from 0.5 to 1.149, the 
 curve 
shifts upward without losing its shape, which implies that the second wave numbers of link 1 on all joint stiffness 
values increase by the same amount. However, as the contribution of masses of distal link reaches 3, the 
 curve 
undergoes a parallel upward shift up to transition, where there is a steeping twist shift, after which the slope drops to 
zero. 
 
Conclusion 
In this paper, a dimensional analysis for planar multilink robot was performed. For this purpose, some physical 
dimensionless parameters and variables were defined to express the system physical parameters in a compact form. 
The general dimensionless frequency equation and boundary conditions were developed. Some degenerate cases 
were derived and compared against the existing models. The general frequency equation was solved for various 
dimensionless stiffness values and the results discussed. The results show that the first and second wave numbers 
decrease when the actual mass and moment at the distal end of flexible links increase. However, when the 
contribution of mass of distal link is increased, the first wave number decreases while the second wave number 
increases. The findings from this analysis contribute towards enhancing our understanding of the effects of different 
physical parameters on the natural vibrations of planar multilink flexible robots.

Abstract 
Clear investigation on mineral rock characterization is essential for establishing solid bridges between the 
mineral resource location and area of application, i.e. rock provenance. Major scientific revolutions in the 
industry was made possible via technologies of characterization (XRD, XRF, SEM etc..,) providing 
improved processing routes that effectively address arising challenges and problems faced by our local 
quarries and mining industries, therefore attempting also to explaining fundamental treatment techniques 
that were adopted anciently. Modern civil engineering activities, mining and construction entail clear 
statistical data on material composition, texture, petrographic and mechanical properties of the source 
material or mineral ore they are handling for clear documentation. Visual inspection was carried out on 
Diorite samples acquired from various locations. Microscopic examination of component were classified 
in order to rationalize unique and recognizable features (mineral type, structure and color patterns), and 
estimations for specific purpose the rock is suited for (i.e., as a sculpting material or fabrication tool). 
Characterization therefore, provided crucial information to the interpretation on quality of stone and 
relevant processing factors relating to energy input and effective processing technique. In this work, In-
situ X – ray powder diffraction analysis was performed at rtp conditions on powdered samples of Diorite 
(a) and (b). Various components were identified which revealed that phase composition is significant in
determining the strength of material and processing parameters.

Introduction 
Since the dawn of civilization powder diffraction (PXRD) has continually been employed as a standard 
analytical tool at both research faculty institutions and the industry (Spectrometer n.d.)(Wills and Finch 
2016). Powder diffraction technology offer reliable estimations about material property information with 
X- ray diffraction scan measurements that are expeditious, information evaluation simultaneously
displaying on a computer monitor for straightforward analysis as well as classification (Spectrometer
n.d.). In-situ x-ray diffraction consider the crystal structure of polycrystalline materials identifying
crystallinity of components, their relative quantity and phase magnitude relative to the whole matrix
(Scanned Powdered Diorite Rock). Diorite rock is an intrusive material intermediate of gabbro and
granite rocks in terms of composition (Austin 1963). It finds location mainly in mountainous landscapes
where it occurs in substantial amounts as batholiths. With rock composition of about 5-50% dark minerals

Petrographic Examination of the Sample (s) 
 
Petrographic examination of the panda rock specimen estimated that the rock is fine-grained structure that 
contain slightly-to-partially altered structures of quartz imbedded within a diorite matrix material (Nidhi 
et al. 2011). The rock comprise mainly plagioclase as the major constituent of the rock and amphibole 
and/ or actinolite complex, with also small quantities of quartz, SiO2, Potassium feldspar with inclusions 
of other trace elements and constituent compounds like chlorite and mica which were simultaneously 
identified via the x-ray analysis device. The amphibole distinguished within the specimen matrix 
dispenses itself to be initiated from clinopyroxene alterations, but the plagioclase resulted mainly due to 
nucleation through the process of argillisation. Trace elements and other members identified within the 
rock were mainly accounted as the clay fraction, sericite, ilmenite and sulphites deposited also as part of 
the petrographic investigation. Therefore, due to this large degree of alteration on phase composition, it is 
suggested that the panda rock material type will be best suited for road construction material rather than 
as an aggregate for concreate constituent. The diorite rock sample obtained from Serowe region display a 
random distribution of phase orientation within the matrix with rather a unique classification of minerals 
composition fraction of hornblende (45 – 55%), Berlinite (18 – 20%), Bazzite (10 – 15%), Quartz (5-
12%) and other minor traces of chlorites mixed with mica mineral as depicted in the diffractogram above, 
information that was theoretically justified. The melanocratic minerals crystallized simultaneously 
together as the dark appearance of the rock texture suggests and this matrix is surrounded but the light 
colored mica trace constituents which only deposited along grain boundaries together with the randomly 
dispersed minor alteration products like sericite, chlorite and calcite compounds (K et al. 2013). The 
overall texture of the magmatic master quarry rock sample show a fine-grained texture which resulted due 
to rapid crystallization of the host mineral during formation together with a mixture of few equigranular 
grain particles of aligned hornblende laths with an ophitic texture. Consequently, due to this random 
orientation of components it is thus difficult to classify mafic igneous rocks with consistent mineralogy 
and texture since there is high variation with a short range of ordered particles. 
 
Conclusion  
From the data acquired by the diffractogram, it was visible that majority of crystalline phases where easy 
to identify with panda quarry rock sample as plagioclase (39.20%), amphibole (31.74%), Quartz (12.26%) 
and minor inclusions of mica mixed with chlorides compounds. For the analyzed scan results clear data 
obtained with less noise levels, N, made classification straightforward, presenting the material to possess 
a high fraction of crystallinity with larger particle components which consequently led to 
recommendation of the material as mainly suitable for road construction activities and infrastructural 
work due to the inherent character of large phase composition. The data analysis for master quarry diorite 
sample as mainly Hornblende (49.9%), Berlinite (18.2%), Bezzite (16.1%) together with traces of other 
complex, displayed less crystallinity of components while showing greater amounts of fine – grained 
distribution of phases thus suggesting a larger contribution to be occupied by clay and minor trace 
constituents of lazurite, mica and silicates. From the diffractogram analysis it can be suggested that the 
master quart stone is much suited to use in infrastructural work like building and also civil industry. Due 
to great domination in phosphates (Al (PO4)) and lesser crystallinity of components, master quarry rock 
would require less amount of breakage energy in comparison to the Francistown’s panda quarry rock 
product with higher crystallinity and a well-defined component field. The signal-to-noise ratio is 
important during analysis and a material with a high noise level remain difficult to classify, from these 
specimen it is clear that for Serowe rocks the signal was two times greater than the noise level, 2:1 while 
for panda quarries the ratio was approximately 3:1, these difference was due to the material’s diffraction 
characteristics and linear absorption coefficient of each specimen.

investing more into mining. Also, I believe our country to be blessed since it affords many opportunities of science 
and technological improvement especially due to high reliance on production of methods and techniques that are old 
(for example: dependence on coal for energy production rather than employment of solar voltaic systems for energy 
production something that can not only reduce carbon emission into the environment but also create jobs and fill our 
large unused fields.) Outside learning I enjoy music and meeting new persons!!! Thanks.

Abstract 
To date there are limitations on commercial practices that aims directly at extracting Iron from
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
chalcopyrite. This is because for years chalcopyrite has mostly been mined for copper and Iron discarded
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with slag. A technique called beneficiation that involves hydrometallurgical and pyro-metallurgical
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
processes is applied on chalcopyrite to recover both Iron, copper and even Sulphur. During the process of
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
beneficiation copper is separated from iron and tapped off as copper matte while iron exit the furnace in
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
the form of Fayalite (Iron [II] silicate). Some new approaches have focused specifically at reducing Iron
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
(II) silicate to element Iron for economic utilization. Such operations are done at temperatures of 1000+
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
O​C. The recovered iron can be used as an alternative feed material to replace scrap steel in the steelmaking
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
processes. This continued invention that aims at utilization of iron from chalcopyrite will be of economic
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
value and at the same time addressing environmental associated with steelmaking using scrap. A Detailed
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
review of techniques for processing chalcopyrite and methods for iron recovery from chalcopyrite were
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
discussed. Methods that are found suitable in Iron recovery from chalcopyrite are the Direct reduction and
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Magnetic separation. A combination of the two methods is effective.

1. Introduction
Chalcopyrite is the name given to the copper iron sulphide mineral. Chalcopyrite is derived from the 2 Greek words
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
“chalkos” and “pyrites” meaning copper and strike fire respectively (Baba et al, 2012). Appearing to be a brassy to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
gold mineral in color it also has distinct chemical, physical and structural properties. These properties includes;
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
variation of valence states, non-magnetic and semi-conductor properties (Caircoss, 2004 & Vaughan et al, 2017).
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Although it contains Sulphur and reasonable to high amount of iron, mostly it has been mined for the world copper.
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Chalcopyrite ore is usually melted and the iron is discarded with the slag as Fayalite (2FeO.SiO​2​) and or in the form
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
of magnetite (Fe​3​O​4​) whereas the Sulphur can be removed as dilute sulfuric acid. It mixes with water solution and
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
discarded as gypsum waste. Even though Sulphur is removed as waste, in hydrometallurgy it plays an indirect role
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
during heap leaching technique as it helps in extraction of copper. In most chalcopyrite mining the main reason why
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Iron is not considered to be a metal of interest is because it’s available in large quantities from its ore(s) ‘giant
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
deposit’ such as the banded iron formation and Kiruna-type ore deposits. Chalcopyrite ore is processed by a
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
beneficiation technique to extract copper as copper matte and Iron removed as iron (II) silicate and processed further
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
by reduction mechanisms. In beneficiation of chalcopyrite two known metallurgical processes can be applied
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
namely pyrometallurgy and hydrometallurgy. In quest to achieve the highest possible concentrates of copper some
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
researchers have concluded that hydrometallurgical processes are preferred over Pyrometallurgy because of low
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cost, high metal concentrate recovery and less environmental effects associated with it (Amstutz, 1961).

In practice during beneficiation of chalcopyrite as reactions come to completions the layer of fayalite (Iron (II)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
silicate) plus other gangue materials containing iron is tapped or drained through a hole of the furnace just above the
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
copper matte layer while matte flows into ladles and carried by cranes to converters. In previous practices iron (II)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
silicate was tapped out together with other gangue materials, solidified and re-melted later for extraction for other
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
elements that might be useful. To avoid re-melting these tapped out products later for iron recovery purpose, at this
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
point when it’s tapped off beneficiation furnaces it can be carried by cranes directly to a direct reduction furnace
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
(RHF-DR) and the process of iron recovery can start. RHF-DR plants can be connected in series as a tap off exit for
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
Iron (II) silicate thus saving future costs for re-melting.  
 
Recovery of copper from chalcopyrite followed by iron extraction from iron (II) silicate seems like a costly
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
technique involving a multiple of furnaces and refinery equipment. However, new developments have been
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conducted on simultaneous recovery of iron and copper in oxygen and chlorine gas media with recovery rates of up
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
to 77.4% and 44.6% respectively (Gosh et al, 2012 and Haver et al, 1971). The recovery rates in this method were
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
found to be greatly dependent on solubility of oxygen during leaching.  
 
4.2 Conclusions  
 
Beneficiation of chalcopyrite is a growing technology (Hyvarinen et al, 1999). Recent investigation has focused on
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
beneficiation chalcopyrite mainly to recover copper. Although iron occurred in the mineral in high content for many
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
years it has been disposed as waste during the beneficiation of chalcopyrite. For the past years its supply was from
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
its major iron ores such as Kiruna-type ore deposits. Research on recovery of iron from chalcopyrite is aimed
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
directly at providing an alternative feed material for steel electrical arc furnaces.  
 
During beneficiation, copper remains as copper matter while iron is tapped off as FeO.SiO2 the furnace and can be
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
carried out to RHF reduction furnaces for iron recover. Reaction mechanisms in the reduction smelter show that the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
fayalite is reduced to Fe upon reaction with carbon or graphite in the direct reduction process. The reaction requires
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
high temperatures of more than 1200​o​C and hence high energy usage at a roasting temperature of 3 hours. CaO as
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
additive has effect on smelting temperature. There is a decrease in smelting temperature with increase in CaO.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Literature suggests that the smelting reduction method has good iron recovery rates up to 90%wt Iron powder but
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
combining the reduction method and magnetic reduction the recovery rate is improved and recovered iron powder
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
can have up to 96.21% iron grade (Li et al, 2013). Iron can also be recovered simultaneously from chalcopyrite
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
through chloride leaching.

Abstract 
Quantity Surveyors are one of the main professionals in the construction industry; they render service to 
construction clients which incorporate Architects, building proprietors, Investors, government 
organizations, Engineers, and contractual workers. They engage in evaluating, cost administration, 
obtainment administration, cost planning, contract organization, plausibility studies, resource monetary 
administration, all exercises identified by making money in the construction industry. Recently, Quantity 
surveying profession in Nigeria has one way or the other influenced by unethical practices display by its 
members. Due to the development, this paper aims to evaluate the measures in improving professionalism 
and ethical behaviours among Quantity Surveyors in Nigerian construction industry with a viable way to 
deal with a moral appraisal of Quantity Surveyors in the Nigerian construction industry in an approach to 
upgrading moral standard among them. It was uncovered in the findings that that transparency & 
accountability in contract administration, leaders serving as role models and constant supervision of ethics 
are the most notable measures to enhance ethical conducts among Quantity Surveyors. The study 
recommends that powerful disciplines like punishments, withdrawal of authentication or even cancellation 
of the permit on dull infringement might be presented by Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors (NIQS) 
to minimized unethical practices among its members.

1. Introduction
Quantity surveyors are specialists who worry with budgetary trustworthiness, authoritative issues, acquirement, 
procurement and conveying an incentive for the clients' resources invested in the construction industry. They play out 
the part of cost administration for the duration of the life of a construction project from start to finish and even 
sometimes after the finish. Quantity Surveyor in the part of cost administrator is a competent and skilled individual 
who will shield the client's interest and deal with the procedure in limiting legally binding cases and unforeseen 
budgetary weights on the financial plan. They add esteem fundamental to the monetary and legally binding 
administration of construction project at the pre-construction, construction and post-construction stages. They add to 
general construction project execution by getting, creating and conveying suitable capabilities (Nkado and Meyer, 
2001). Quantity Surveyors are one of the main professionals in the construction industry; they render service to their 
clients which incorporate Architects, building proprietors, Investors, Designers, government organizations, financial 
specialists, protection assessors, Engineers, and contractual workers. They can be engaged with evaluating, cost 
administration, obtainment administration, cost planning, contract organization, plausibility studies and resource 
monetary administration and all exercises identified with making money related task of the property and construction 
businesses as successful and effective for the different stakeholders. As per (Dada and Jagboro, 2012), the profession 
of quantity surveying is practiced in Nigeria along the same pattern as in the United Kingdom and other 
Commonwealth countries The Regulated and Other Professions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1978 of Nigeria

In any case, it could be demonstrated that transparency and accountability in contract administration; leaders serving 
as role models and constant supervision of ethics is the major to measure and enhance the ethical conducts among 
Nigerian Quantity surveyors in the construction industry. Moreover, the analysis of the respondent’s perceptions 
showed that the identified measures are relevant and will be the best measures for enhancing ethical conduct. These 
measures are relevant because the mean between the highest rank (transparency and accountability in contract 
administration) and lowest rank (verbally promote the ethical environment and relentlessly) is very small. All these 
measures are compatible with Ameh and Odusami (2010), Alutu and Udhawuve (2009), Hassim et al. (2010), Azhar 
et al. (2011), FMI/CMAA (2004), Olusegun et al. (2011), Ehsan et al. (2009) and Moylan (2008) results, as unethical 
issues are widespread all over the sectors in the construction industry, these measures must be taken to reduce this 
behaviour and give rules to follow to improve working in this industry.

5. Conclusions and Recommendations  
Unethical conduct by Quantity Surveyors has one way or the other expedite negative impact on the nature of 
construction. The supposition of construction professionals (Architects, Builders and Civil/Structural engineers) 
concerning the measures in upgrading moral conduct among Quantity Surveyors is high in the area of experience 
Quantity Surveyors serving as a role model. It was additionally uncovered in the findings that that transparency & 
accountability in contract administration and constant supervision of ethics are the most notable measures to enhance 
ethical conducts among Quantity Surveyors. Moreover, to conquer unethical practices among Quantity Surveyors in 
the construction industry, prompt advances must be taken to guarantee that all contract administration must be 
straightforward, accountable and responsible. In like manner pioneers and experienced Quantity Surveyors should fill 
in as a great good example to youthful graduate ones. Most Quantity surveying organizations are led by experienced 
QS who are formally trained in professional ethics, and construction organizations must stress on issues of professional 
ethics and enforce it on all young Quantity Surveyors. It is a clear fact that leadership serves as role model to enhance

professionalism, Leaders should serve as a role model among the young Quantity Surveyors as their conducts will 
influence the whole company because all eyes look no them in day-to-day practice. 
 
The investigation suggested that Pioneers and experienced Quantity Surveyors should fill in as a great good example 
to youthful graduate ones. When codes of ethics have been evolved, and sufficient training has been carried out, it is 
the moral obligation of top experienced Quantity Surveyors to set personal examples in the display of ethical conduct 
at the workplace. They must extend all-out support towards enforcement of codes of ethics across the board. To this 
end, motivating forces and corrective measures can be utilized as apparatuses by the pioneers and experienced 
Quantity surveyors to keep away from, dispose of or alleviate the likelihood and event of unethical practices in their 
quantity surveying firms. Construction professionals in Nigeria should endeavour to carry on with professional 
respectability and sensible care. In the event that everybody in this division has their influence well, unethical conduct 
will be limit and annihilated. Also, powerful disciplines, for example, punishments, withdrawal of authentication or 
even cancellation of the permit on dull infringement might be presented by Nigerian Institute of Quantity Surveyors 
(NIQS). The developed protocol is additionally on the suggestion to the NIQS to proactively use their energy and 
impact over the quantity surveying firms which will empower them to discover techniques for altogether executing 
their Code of Conduct, in an activity to enhance the moral conduct showed by rehearsing Quantity Surveyors. Such 
developed protocol is Continuing Professional Development (CPD), which can be adapted to enhance the professional 
skills and ensure that all registered professionals maintain their competence throughout their period of registration.

Abstract 
In an industrial process for the design and simulation, the phase equilibrium of mixture and 
thermodynamic properties are required. Due to this reason, the flash calculation plays an important 
role to solve the industrial problem. In this research, the Peng-Robinson Equation of the state is 
applied which is widely used to find out the thermodynamic properties at phase equilibrium in the 
critical region for the system of hydrocarbon and related compounds. The behavior of four binary 
mixtures is observed by using mathematical modeling of Peng-Robinson Equation of the state. The 
pressure-volume behavior and pressure mole fraction behavior of both liquid and vapor phase at 
equilibrium are studied by mathematical modeling of isothermal flash calculation. The pressure mole 
fraction behavior is compared with the experimental data taken from literature which states that both 
mathematical modeling’s of isothermal flash calculations flow same behavior with the experimental 
data.

Introduction
In chemical industries for the operation and designing of the chemical process, the thermodynamic properties play an 
important role. For the prediction of the phase behavior of vapor-liquid equilibrium of mixture containing different 
compounds, the equation of state is used because these can be applied to a vast range of pressure and temperature for 
all cases of light gases and heavy liquids and also due to their reliable and robust solution for vapor-liquid equilibrium 
prediction (Voutsas, Magoulas, et al. 2004, Fateen, Khalil et al. 2013, Zivkovic, Bajic, et al. 2014). To calculate the 
density in precise manner by using cubic Equation of state the attribution of two parameters ‘a’ the temperature 
dependent variable and ‘b’ the effective volume pressure is needed that can calculate the density in a very much 
accurate way otherwise the density will be inaccurate in liquid phase over extensive temperature range and on critical 
points (Frey, Modell, et al. 2009, Shen, Liu, et al. 2014).  The cubic equation of states such as Schmidt and Wenzel, 
Soave Redlich Kwong and Peng-Robinson are the modified form of van der Waal equation of state  (Ziabakhsh-Ganji 
and Kooi 2012). This cubic equation of state is distinct from one and other due to pressure volume and temperature 
relationship (Nasrifar 2010). The limitation of a cubic equation of state is that for achieving chemical equilibrium for 
mixture the pressure, chemical potential and temperature for liquid-vapor equilibrium have to be equal for processes

4. Conclusions 
In this research, the mathematical modeling is applied on PR EOS for hydrogen n-propane, methane n-butane, carbon 
dioxide propane, and methane n-decane mixture to study the pressure-volume relationship and phase behavior. The 
hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide have an important role in the chemical industry, so the information related to 
phase equilibrium and thermodynamic properties. The prediction of phase behavior by PR EOS modeling accurately 
describes the experimental results for all these gases but in hydrogen propane mixture the deviation in liquid phase is 
noted due to low pressure and due to presence of lighter gas hydrogen and in carbon dioxide propane mixture the 
presence of carbon dioxide affect the VLE of mixture and it also shows the deviation in limited range of pressure but 
when pressure is moderate it show less deviation and at high pressure it shows almost negligible deviation from 
experimental behavior . The isotherms obtained between pressure and volume shows that when the pressure 
approaches zero the volume start continues to increase and gasses start to behave as ideal gases. In pressure mole 
fraction relationship, the mole fraction of all components of the mixture is obtained vapor-liquid equilibrium by 
iterating pressure in a specific range. The pressure mole fraction of components relationship in both phases obtained 
by model shows that prediction is given by model for the solution of problem accurate as experimental results.

Abstract 
The focus of this paper is about business processes re-engineering in the manufacturing industry, with the 
aim of achieving customer satisfaction and retaining more customers. The benefits of BPR were discussed 
in the indenture of the benefits of total quality management (TQM). Three sets of questionnaires were 
designed to extract data from customers, service agents and suppliers of the organization. This was to 
scrutinize the proficiency of business processes as a vindication assistance to correct customer loss. It was 
then established that customers are inclined to the organization’s processes than service agents and 
suppliers, therefore we recommend that through the practice of business process re-engineering, 
organizational goals must be aligned with the needs of customers

1. Introduction
The study was based on a case scenario of a company that manufactures chemicals and supply equipment, consumables, 
water technology and many specialized products within all major market segments throughout the southern African 
region. Most organizations are currently operating in competitive environment due numerous factors, namely 
advancement in technology, globalization, just to name a few. It is vital of every business to focus on their processes to 
differentiate themselves and improve their processes to positively impact the customer retention and/or customer 
satisfaction.  
The organization painstaking implementation of Total Quality Management (TQM) involving two principles, 
‘’involvement of people’’ and ‘’engagement of people’’ by means of having monthly forums to address business 
process issues and top management part-take in these meetings which the focus is solely on business process 
improvement of the organization so that customer retention target can be fulfilled and high rate of customer satisfaction. 
According to Sungau & Msanjila (2012), business process re-engineering (BPR) is not only vital for delivering high 
quality products but also important for the overall view of organizational efficiency and effectiveness and ultimately 
result in improved business process performance in which customer expectation are fulfilled whilst retaining them.  
Customers are the heart of every organization, there’s no organization which can succeed without customers. It is 
important to attract and retain them. Most service organization are struggling to retain customers and it is not a problem 
affecting only service organization, but most organizations in retaining customers. The business where the research was 
conducted aimed at achieving several aspects which include customer focus, flexibility, quality outputs, innovation and 
productivity. Therefore, the focus of this research is to explore how business processes can be redesigned and managed 
to ensure customer satisfaction and retention.

5. Conclusion, Recommendations and the Way Forward 
 
The results indicate that the accessibility of customers is a challenge to the organization, however with the efforts to 
re-design their processes, they can minimize these challenges and not only be accessible to their customers but also 
be able to retain them. On the other hand, customers are satisfied with the quality of services provided therefore re-
designing the organization’s processes may not be necessary. Service agents are reliable to the organizations, and the 
organizations customers and they make an effort to build a strong relationship between the organization and its 
suppliers. 
 
Another look at the survey results show that customers are more distressed than service agents and suppliers with the 
organization’s processes. It is recommended of the organization to aid customers by ensuring accessibility of their 
products, improve their speed in response to customer queries, decrease their service time, meaning delivering service 
as convenient as possible, and ensure the scope of the service is understood. This can be achieved by means of 
implementing or practicing bureaucratic management, management by rules and procedures. The importance of 
business process has been outlined in the research and it is evident that customer expectations and transcends are 
achieved by putting emphasis and effectively managing the business processes result in cost efficiency, timeous and 
reliable service to customer.  
 
More research in the future can still be conducted on various aspects such as contemporary management approaches, 
tools and techniques of managing processes, to name a few, to achieve significant customer satisfaction and retention 
levels in the manufacturing industry.

Abstract 
This research paper identifies and analyses the most important fundamentals to improve project 
management performance in South Africa. Many important factors were identified in this study such over 
60% of participants have a certificate to none formal project management education, which compromise 
the quality of any project, and increases the number of project failures in the country. Furthermore, project 
managers face many challenges from community participation within the project, project creeps, and 
political influences to getting the right team members for the project on board. Therefore, it is recommended 
that a partnership between Project Management South Africa (PMSA), higher education institution, public 
and private sectors should work together in bringing about standard requirements to practice as project 
managers and standard performance for practicing project managers. This study can be used in the draft of 
policies regulating the project management industry as well as when developing project management 
curriculum at higher education institutions, as it points out the fundamentals to improve project 
management performance in South Africa.

1. Introduction
Over the years Project Management (PM) has industrialized to a profession that is commonly applicable to any 
organization private and public, like other discipline such finance, and other disciplines (Lappe and Spang, 2013, Mir 
and Pinnington, 2014, Schwalbe, 2015). Furthermore, Martens and Carvalho (2016) affirm that there is a growing 
interest in incorporating PM methodologies to the daily organizational functions in multiple organizations all over the 
world. This interest is supplementary with the fact that organizations are investing in tool and the discipline of PM as a 
way to remain competitive in today’s globalized market place (Carvalho et al, 2015). 
In her research, Schwalbe (2015) states that organizations that implement PM in their practices claim to have (1) 
Improved control of financial and human resources, (2) Improved their customer relationships, (3) Shorter cycle – times, 
(4) Lower costs, (5) Higher quality and increased reliability, (6) Greater profit margins, (7) Improved productivity, (8)
Healthier internal coordination and (9) Higher worker morale. However, Conforto et al (2014) indicate that
organizations need to reach a level of agility to adapt to PM in order to leverage in the benefits it offers. In addition,
Golini et al. (2014) state that many practitioners in the world have been working tirelessly to institute concrete practices
of PM within organizations.
Too and Weaver (2013) cover the benefits of PM in organizations. The two authors note that if PM tools and practices 
by design are to manage effectively and to complete projects, and projects are hardly completed in time and within 
budget. Xiong et al (2013) point out that the construction industry’s poor record in delivering projects as an obvious

5. Recommendations, Conclusion and the Way Forward 
 
In conclusion, this paper presents data collected and analyses of practicing project managers from various industries.  
Technical knowledge and experience in fields such as Engineering, Construction, Marketing atc does not necessarly 
guarantees that an individual will be an effective project manager (Rwelamila and Ssegawa, 2014). Though Pollack 
and Adler (2016) argue that there is a link between project management skills and information technology skills in 
organizational performance. PM has a significant contribution in different industries and organizations, whether 
provide or public (Smith, 2000). For project management techniques to be implementation successful does not only 
project managers to be skilled in traditional PM techniques but also to be multi-skilled in areas such as IT to improve 
performance. (Hornstein, 2015). Therefore future study can involve how project management courses remodeled to 
include to include variety of techniques, outside the traditional PM techniques. 
The data has shown that over 35% of participates have a certificate in project management, 36.36% of participates are 
involved in projects that are over 25.1 million and above, 72.72 % have PM work experience that is 5 years and below, 
and 63.64% on completed 1 – 10 projects. Rwelamila and Ssegawa (2014) stated that many practicing project manager 
in South Africa do not adequate knowledge and experience to carry out PM techniques in projects or within 
organizations effectively.  
The deduction from this research work supports continuous learning in the profession of PM. Therefore, it is 
recommended that:  
(1) As a developing country, it is crucial for South African institutions, public and private to collaborate with the 
PMSA in developing world class course content of project management courses which include experiential 
training for newly growing project managers in the country.  
(2) Project managers need to be empowered to act like entrepreneurs by being able to identify and exploit market 
opportunities

Abstract 
Customer satisfaction plays a very significant role in the success of any business. Increased customer satisfaction 
ensures business continuity. Implementing a Quality Management System (QMS) is one of the ways to improve 
processes in an organization therefore improving operations and improving the quality of service. Certification 
through QMS administers the measurement of performance for processes and ensures continuity of the 
improvements.  ISO 13485 is a standard which represents the requirements for a comprehensive quality 
management system for the design and manufacture of medical devices. The standard is in harmony with the ISO 
9001, with additional requirements to guide the medical device industry. A questionnaire was administered to the 
top five customers and employees of small medical devices company.  When questionnaires were analysed, the 
response received had supported the researcher’s idea, that the implementation of a QMS has a positive effect on 
customer satisfaction. Through the findings of the study, several gaps were identified from the current operations, 
and through these gaps, improvement can be implemented utilising QMS principles that have been proven to play a 
major role in continuous improvement and customer satisfaction over the years as indicated in the literature review 
of the study.

1. Introduction
1.1 Introduction and Background 
In basic terms a quality management system is defined as a structured collection of business processes with a 
purpose and aim of ensuring that industries meets and exceed the needs of the customer base that they are targeting 
for their business. Implementing quality management system as the tool to improve company operations thus 
improving customer satisfaction has been used by different organization over the years (Pharm Out, 2016). Thomas 
Foster further states in his book that to be successful; a business must balance the needs of different functional areas 
around a coherent business vision and strategy (Foster, 2010).  In this case then a successful business is defined as a 
business that is profitable, a profitable business is a business that retains its customers by increasing customer 
satisfaction and growing the business.  
Quality management is essential for organisations that want to improve the state of current operation in their 
organisations. Implementation of quality management can be achieved using various tools and principles. What is 
important in the implementation process is ensuring that interrelated processes are defined in each function and 
requirements for each party are clarified (Butler and Dobert, 2012). Quality management system is not just a series 
of variables and relationships but rather an interconnected interdisciplinary network of people, technology, 
procedures, facilities and legal requirements etc. to achieve an end. This means that in order to guarantee that the 
different departments in an organisation are working together to ensure that the vision and mission of the 
organisation is achieved, there has to be defined processes on the different operations of the organisation, personnel

Cronbach alpha Coefficient was used for the measure the reliability of the data and the results obtained were 0.7 for 
customer feedback and 0.80 for employee feedback. Results from data analysis for the questionnaires indicates that 
data obtained was of acceptable correlation and reliable.  
 
6. Conclusion 
 Based on the statistical analysis of the data for this study the results obtained from the customers support the idea 
that implementation of a QMS has a positive effect on Customer satisfaction. This statement is supported by both 
the qualitative and quantitative data obtained from the results of the questionnaires. This is in agreement with the 
conclusions made from the number of literature for this paper. Cronbach alpha also shows that analysis of data from 
this paper shows good correlation indicating that the data is reliable. Also from the information obtained from the 
questionnaires several gaps were identified from the current operations at this company, and through these gaps 
improvement can be implemented through the use of a QMS principles that have been proven over the years. A 
follow up internal audit should be conducted for the company  and the findings should be used to verify the 
information obtained from this research is correct. As a follow up to this study the researcher intends to conduct a 
follow up study comparing different companies in the same industry to measure and establish if a fully functional 
QMS has an impact on customer satisfaction.

Abstract 
South Africa’s Integrated National Electrification Programme provides low-income households with a free 
20-Ampere electricity supply connection. Many of these households persist in using solid and liquid fuels 
like wood, coal and paraffin for heating and to a lesser degree for cooking. It is generally held that the use 
of dirty, less convenient fuels persists because they are less more affordable, but the restricted electricity 
connection also limits the type and number of appliances which can be used simultaneously. The 
implications of these restricted connections are explored in this paper with a mixed integer programming 
optimization model. Household appliances are ranked according to their priority, and scheduled according 
to the lifestyle and needs of the household members. Three scenarios encompassing the range of appliance 
power ratings are considered. It is found that the 20-Ampere electricity supply does indeed restrict the use 
of appliances with medium and high-power ratings in peak evening periods. There is no such restriction for 
energy efficient or small appliances. Increasing the electricity connection to a 40-Ampere supply alleviates 
all restrictions. As low-income households become more affluent, they need to upgrade their electricity 
connection in order to make use of more diverse energy services.

1. Introduction
Access to energy is essential for human development, and electricity is the most desirable energy carrier. In a study 
of over 100 countries, Ferguson et al. (2000) found that there is a stronger correlation between electricity use and 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita than there is between total primary energy use and GDP per capita. At the 
household level, the use of electricity is preferable because it is a cleaner, more convenient energy source than the 
solid and liquid fuels that are used when electricity is either not available or not affordable. Electricity avoids the 
safety hazards of inferior fuels, like risk of burns, poisoning of children drinking paraffin, and injury during fuel 
collection (WHO, 2014). Moreover, electricity is the only domestic energy carrier which releases zero emissions in 
the home, and so is the most effective way to address the approximately 2 500 premature deaths per year in South 
Africa due to indoor air pollution from household fuel burning (Norman et al., 2007).

From a financial point of view, utilizing low-power appliances could reduce the monthly consumption cost to one 
third. However, expanding the electricity supply to 40Amp could increase the cost by around 40%, 20% and 30% if 
the consumer is using low, medium or high-power rate appliances, respectively.  
 
 
5. Conclusion 
A binary linear programming model has been developed and used to investigate the implications of a restricted 20 
Amp electricity supply connection for household appliance use. Three scenarios have considered to encompass the 
range of power ratings of appliances typically used in a low-income household. It is found that if appliances with 
medium and higher power ratings are used, the 20 Amp supply does indeed inhibit appliance use during peak evening 
periods, when it is assumed that all household members are presenting, and the bulk of household chores are done. In 
such cases, trade-offs need to be made by the household, for example switching the heater off in order to boil the 
kettle. If all appliances used have low power rating, appliances can be scheduled to fulfill all needs. Increasing the 
electricity supply connection to a 40 Amp connection alleviates all the restrictions. As households become more 
affluent and want to increase the electricity services they make use of (for example by using desktop computers, 
electric geysers, vacuum cleaners and tumble dryers), they need to upgrade to a 40 Amp connection.  Significant 
savings can be achieved by using appliances with lower power ratings – the monthly electricity cost is roughly three 
times higher for appliances with high power ratings than for appliances with low power ratings.

Abstract 
When a consumer pays for a product through his credit card, he is disclosing his propensity to risk, 
purchase habits and by using it we can figure out his personality traits of the types of MBTI and Big-five 
and the culture of society in which he exist also known as SIP ( Social Information Processing). Hence, 
consumer analytics has moved to predictive or perspective type from earlier descriptive or diagnostic 
analytic type. Hence, we are in a position to predict what consumer do to your product or price offerings 
and his or her implications for Interactive or one on one advertisements.

1. Introduction:
After almost two decades of dot com bust, the exponential progress in data generation is recorded in the present 
time. The complexity of data makes it hard to analyse and categorise it into the form of big data. Stewart (2014) has 
catalyst interactive advertising as the ""paid and unpaid presentation and promotion of products, services and ideas 
by an identified sponsor through mediated means involving mutual action between consumers and producers of the 
product or service"". Big data play a great role in advertising research basically in three general ways. The first way 
is by re-evaluating the fundamental frameworks of advertising with new data sources which helps in developing, 
testing and refining the existing theories. The second way is by enhancing the delivery of ad message by sending the

Porter (1996) states: “Strategy is the creation of a unique and valuable position, involving a different set of 
activities”. Cost leaders caters to a huge segment of population that purchases value for money product ( least cost 
per unit ) and usually use mass production. Differentiators compete not on cost leader offer useful/customer made 
features to the product such that he is willing to shell down more money for it. Niche strategy makers focus on a 
narrow segment of population and focus on all the needs of this segment. 
 
 
4.  Hypothesis Development 
 
Cost leaders organization focuses on the concept of low cost than their competitors and this is the basic reason for 
their survival. Though they have low-cost margin, still it focuses on achieving considerate profitability. They are the 
one whose overall cost of expenditure is low and operational cost also is too low. Due to which they do not like to 
spend on advertisements they focus on mass segments and target all consumers together. For example Newspaper, 
magazine, bulk e-mail etc. They do not believe in customization and even do not have the financial ability of it. 
Therefore such kind of organizations does not need interactive advertisements. 
 
H1: Cost leaders do not need Interactive Advertisement 
 
Differentiator organization is known to provide customized product or service which may be different by design, 
quality, packaging etc. They try to provide something novel to their customers and have high involvement of 
customers. This is the reason that in such organization they try to engage with their customers at high ends. They 
usually try to interact with their customers personally and in a customized way. They try to create a product or 
service for their customers uniquely but do not exactly know the desires or need of their customers. Their aim is 
only to be different targeting their customer. In this case, they can purchase information from other companies and 
try to link their customer’s online/offline. They do take feedback, and their product is directly affected by the 
feedback. Therefore, they are interactive. 
 
H2: Differentiator gives tailor-made messages to both online and offline customers of all its segments. 
 
In such kind organization tend to target higher segments customer with the help of big data in-house. They target the 
customers online after collecting their complete database by which they can understand customer desires, needs, 
behaviour, attitude etc. which help to create advertisements interactive as they are customer-centred and has high 
involvement of customers. For example: in social media, in mobile apps, online search engine marketing etc. The 
basic thing for above examples is to be connected online through internet. They are completely consumer-oriented 
and their every activity affects organizations. In this customer feedback is of prime importance and organization is 
completely affected by it. 
 
H3: For higher segments or highest premium segments advertisement will be one to one interactive dialogue and 
exchanges 
 
5. Conclusion: 
 
Earlier to Big Data and Analytics, we used to administer them psychological tests and now are able to do that more 
accurately by looking at his behavior. For this, three hypothesis were taken and concluded that for cost leader there 
is no need of customisation and they advertise to mass through normal advertisement. For differentiator, they focus 
on high level of customization and through interactive advertisement they give tailor-made messages to both online 
and offline of all segments. For higher segments or highest premium segments, advertisement will be one to one 
interactive dialogue and exchanges based completely upon customer feedback.

Abstract 
Eskom is constantly responsible for the management of capital construction projects in order to sustain 
their assets and increase their generation capacity. Front end planning (FEP) is an important phase before 
the execution of the project, as it determines the scope of the project to be executed. Failure to have well 
defined scope leads, to scope deviations during execution that results in escalated cost and delays in the 
schedule. Eskom adopted PDRI as part of FEP in order to improve the scope definition level. PDRI is a 
tool designed by CII in order to quantify the level of scope definition through the FEP. This research is 
conducted to evaluate the impact of integrating PDRI on FEP for capital coal projects.

1. Introduction
 Eskom (South African state-owned power utility), is Africa’s largest power utility that supplies approximately 95 % 
of South Africa’s electricity (Govendor, 2013). Eskom constantly has to manage Capital Projects to sustain their 
assets (e.g. Power Stations, Transmission lines, Building etc.) and to increase their life extension (Sandelandas, 
2009).  The project scope definition of a project determines the success or failure of the delivery of a project 
(Gibson, Dumont, and Fish, 1997). Poor scope definition of projects, lead to an escalation in the cost of the projects 
and it leads to time delays due inevitable changes to the scope (Syed, Zaheer and Fallows, 2011). Poor scope 
definition may also lead to poor quality of project outputs, as the client's requirements were not set out clearly and 
understood (Moncrief, 2004).  To address the problem of poor scope definition during the Front End Planning 
(FEP), Eskom adopted the Project Definition Readiness Index (PDRI) tool that was designed by Construction 
Industry Institute (CII) of America (Murray, 2011). The PDRI is used to measure project scope definition 
completeness.  
The Project Definition Rating Index (PDRI) is used to measure the completeness of the scope definition in projects 
(CII ,2015) (Sandelandas, 2009). It identifies important elements that should be considered during the process of 
defining scope in a project and weights the element in accordance with their significance towards the completeness 
of the scope (Cho and Gibson, 2001).   The PDRI is used in the Front End Planning (FEP) of the project phase, as an 
additional tool to enhance the phase, it ensures that the risks are identified earlier on in the FEP and addressed 
immediately or during the next phases of FEP before execution phase of the project. It also serves as a checklist for 
the project team to be aware of the issues they must attend too, identify interfaces that may affect the scope and lead 
to potential escalations in cost or delays if not adequately address in the FEP (Staats, 2014). PDRI encourages 
communication and alignment between the user requirements, designers of the solution and the construction 
contractors by highlighting areas that are not defined in the works information (Department of Energy, 2017). It has 
been verified through several studies done by the CII, that a good PDRI score leads to greater chances of project 
success, it has also been noted that in the cases where PDRI is poor, the PDRI gives guidance to participates on the

the new members requires some time to gain knowledge about the project and this reflects in negatively in the PDRI 
score. The candidate’s response also indicated that the quality of engineering deliverables has a big influence on the 
score; contents of the engineering document must address the elements in order to improve the score.  
 
The facilitator: 41% of the candidate responded that the facilitator had a big influence in helping them understand 
the requirements of the PDRI. Candidates also reflected that the scoring of the PDRI can be subjective according to 
the facilitator’s view, scoring differently for the same project on the same phase while producing same evidence, the 
only variable being the facilitator.  Responded also believe that the technical experience of the facilitator, influences 
the quality of the facilitation.  When the facilitator has experience or understanding of the topic, the score becomes 
more reflective of the true quality of the project scope definition readiness. 
 
Experience of the team:  When the team knows what is required to be presented as a body of evidence, this implies 
the more experience in attending the  PDRI assessments the better the performance of the project because the 
candidates know what needs to be presented and the format it should be presented in. 
 
Question 8: How was your experience of been involved in a PDRI assessment? 
Response to question 8 
The candidates reply to this question by reflecting on the benefits and difficulties of using PDRI. 
Benefits: 
 
It highlights what needs to be done to have a well-defined project scope. 
 
It gives an accurate reflection of the readiness of the project to proceed to the next phase 
 
It helps focus the effort on things that need to be done. 
 
It helps if it’s done earlier on in the project. When less effort is put into the concept design phase that 
sometimes leads to poor basic design. 
 
PDRI provides a structured way to define project maturity. 
 
It’s a good monitoring tool for project deliverables 
 
It helps identify risk not foreseen by Project managers and mitigation strategies in place 
 
It is good for record keeping and to documents the decision that were made and the reasons 
 
It gives foreign investors the confidence invest, in the projects that have undergone the PDRI assessment 
Difficulties: 
 
PDRI must be guided by Eskom process, there are minor misalignments. 
 
It can be manipulated to get bare minimum through the system 
 
At times its purpose is not understood, because the designs are not developed in line with the PDRI. 
 
Initial it was difficult when it was facilitated by external facilitators who had no understanding of Eskom 
processes.   
 
Question 9: Do you think the PDRI is a necessary tool for Front End Planning (FEP)? 
 
All candidates interviewed candidates agreed, that the PDRI is a necessary tool for FEP. They definitely recommend 
the use of it on every project. 
 
5.3 Conclusion 
 
From the interviews conducted it does can be concluded that the PDRI tool, is a useful and effective tool for FEP of 
the project. It assists with the development of scope ensuring that it’s well defined. It also assists in risk 
identification and risk can be resolved early or have mitigation strategies put in place when it’s not possible to 
resolve them. 
Over 50 % of the responded indicated that they depend on the facilitator to assist with the explanation of the 
requirements, and some have indicated that the interpretation of the elements it’s not standard depends on the 
facilitator. The PDRI assessment needs to be standardized further, so that it becomes less subjective. The technical 
experience and project management experience place a positive role on the score. The more technical experience the 
better the quality of designs and the project manager’s experience can help the team better prepare for the overall 
PDRI assessment.

6. Conclusion  
 
The projects that had undergone PDRI assessment, performed better than those who did not have PDRI assessment. 
The direct outcome of the PDRI assessment on capital projects, it helped identify deficiencies in the scope definition 
and risks early. The identified risks were address in the subsequent phase during the FEP, those that could not be 
resolved were captured as risks and mitigation strategies put in place. During execution the projects that had done a 
PDRI assessment, they had savings in the actual budget used when compared to the planned budget for the project 
and the also finished early than scheduled.     
The indirect outcome of the PDRI assessment on capital projects, it improves contracting strategies and contract 
negotiations, when the scope is clearly defined. Projects that had PDRI assessment done also improve the 
governance of the project during the execution phase, as the role and responsibilities are outlined clearly. 
From the findings of the interview project team impacts the PDRI score, differently depending on their role in the 
project team. The facilitator’s role is critical in assisting and guiding the project team through the PDRI. The project 
team relied on the facilitator to explain the interpretation of elements they did not understand. It was also noted that 
the Project managers who were familiar with the tool, who had more experience using the tool helped improve the 
PDRI score of their projects as they are able to better guide their teams in preparations for the PDRI assessment and 
for phases in the FEP.  
Engineers with more technical experience help improve the score in terms of their technical preparation of the 
engineering design documents. Engineers who had more experience with PDRI assessments also contributed to the 
improvement of the project score because in their technical documents they also focused on additional information 
required for execution, such as site layouts, client requirements and equipment status etc. Those team members with 
less experience with the tool said at times they did not understand what the elements required and this led to poor 
PDRI scores. Training and awareness for project teams, in capital projects would help teams get more experience in 
the tool and help them with FEP. 
The Capital Project teams are the clients that use the PDRI tool. All the candidates interviewed they expressed their 
satisfaction with the tool, even those who struggled to understand. The common themes that come out from the users 
are that it guides them in what they are required to do for the next phase of a project.  The organization is also 
satisfied with the tool, PDRI assessment has been integrated into the FEP of all Capital projects. The PDRI is part of 
requirements of Investment Committee before the project can be allocated funds for FEP phases up to the execution 
phase. Eskom possesses the characteristic of organizations that implement the tool effectively (CII, 2015). It can be 
concluded that the impact of the PDRI on the capital projects for coal-fired power station has been positive , it 
improves  the FEP , which helps improve the performance of the projects at execution.

Abstract 
Electrical energy storage is one of the promising solutions of the irregular electricity demand issue. 
Pumped-storage plants account for most of the storage capacity worldwide. It is popular for high capacity, 
good responsiveness and high efﬁciency. It can smooth peak loads, therefore plays a vital role in balancing 
the grid loads and enhancing the grid availability. A pumped-storage station can be operated in generation, 
pumping or idle states. In order to obtain an optimal plant schedule, a stochastic optimization model is 
proposed and the sample average approximation method is applied. The proposed model is used to 
determine the number of units to be hourly scheduled in generation or pumping mode. The model aims to 
minimize a supply-demand disparity and shortfall function as a weighted score taking into account the 
hourly grid demand. Furthermore, the model considers the grid demand uncertainty by considering the main 
two different demand scenarios “Winter and Summer”, and many constraints which are limiting the 
operation of a pumped-storage station. The model is solved optimally with a case study derived based on 
the Ingula pumped-storage station in South Africa. Results show that our model proposes pumping-
generating schedules that could eliminate the disparity between demand and supply for both summer and 
winter demand profiles. Furthermore, it could provide a robust schedule that could work for both demand 
scenarios.

1. Introduction
Electrical energy demand is increasing exponentially all over the world and especially in Africa. For example, the 
total electricity consumption for South Africa recorded a growth of 17% from 265,457 GWh in 2013 to 310,410 GWh 
in 2017 (Eskoma). Similarly, the grid peak load follows an increase pattern with growth of 37% from 37,500 MWh in 
2017 to 61,596 MWh in 2030 (Eskoma). 
Due to the fact that electricity demand is not constant, different types of power stations are required to meet this 
fluctuating demand. It is important that the amount of electricity needed at any point in time should be matched by the 
amount generated to provide a balance between supply and demand. Thus, the concept of “peak load stations”, which 
can react swiftly to sudden increases or decreases in demand, is introduced (Eskomb). Obviously, an energy storage

4. Conclusion 
This paper addressed the SPSSSP while incorporating grid demand uncertainty aspect. The objective of this study is 
to generate an optimal PSS schedule that determines the number of units to be hourly scheduled in generation or 
pumping mode. An MILP model based on the sample average approximation method is proposed with the objective 
of minimizing the weighted score of the supply-demand disparity. A case study, based on Ingula pumped-storage 
station in South Africa, showed that the proposed schedule could reduce the weekly supply-demand disparity by about 
88%, 82% and 82% for the Winter, Summer and Robust Scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, the scheduled pumping 
capacity is more in the Summer Scenario than in the Winter and Robust Scenarios. So, for the Summer Scenario, the 
pumped-storage plant pumps and generates more on weekdays in comparison to the other two Scenarios. Also, during 
the summer, it is found that the pumped-storage plant generates for longer hours during the day. This is expected 
because the effect of the flat “Table Mountain” demand profile during the summer.

Abstract 
The nature of work is changing, and so are the elements which are necessary to manage these different 
transformations.  
The focus of this study was to determine which factors were important to Generation Y engineering 
bursar graduates from a particular organisation; in particular those within their first 5 years of work. A 
theoretical framework from the literature was developed, and the Case Study research method was 
applied. 
The results showed that Job satisfaction had the greatest influence as a retention factor. It was found that 
there was a difference between factors which influenced an employee to stay or leave.

1. Introduction
The nature of work is changing, and so are the elements which are necessary to manage the different
transformations - such as workforce demographics, awareness of social and environmental corporate
responsibility which are taking place. Some of the contributing factors to these changes are globalisation,
technology, where and how people work, as well as workforce expectations [1] [2] [3] [4]. As a result of
these transformations taking place in the workplace, the risk of a disengaged workforce is high – hence
the implication for employee retention strategies.
In light of the transformation which is taking place in the workplace arena, it is evident that financial 
incentives and financial security are not sufficient as sole “retention drivers”- there are other factors 
which need to be considered to drive and support organisational sustainability through these changes [5]. 
The research area of spirituality at work is also growing as employees see the workplace as a place to 
explore personal meaning as well [3] [6]. 
1.1. Problem Statement 
The organisation which forms the focus of this study runs a bursary scheme program. This program aims 
to develop young talent, and to provide an opportunity for that talent to be part of the organisation 
through employment. After the completion of the bursary holder’s studies, the expectation is that the 
bursary holder “work back” the period over which they were sponsored.

6. Conclusion 
The design of employee retention strategies as a whole is a complex process; when taking into account 
the intricacies of human nature and the different life paths that people follow (be it out of personal choice 
or personal circumstance).  
 
The results did not show any significant difference between the differently tenured groups. This could 
primarily be because of both populations being Knowledge Workers and generally belonging to the same 
generation (Gen Y). What was evident though is that individuals at different stages in their personal and 
professional lives would have different needs; and that a balance between these segments is of great 
importance.  
 
This has implications for how employees are supported throughout their working career. Although a 
young graduate may have some support during the GDP phase, this can affect the continued growth and 
development of the individual after s/he exits from the GDP. This necessitates that the Talent 
Management (TM) and HR strategy for the greater workforce be adequately structured to ensure the 
continued retention of the internal talent pool, and that leadership/ management is sufficiently equipped to 
enable the employee retention effort. 
 
This need is compounded by a highly dynamic and competitive labour market landscape which is vying 
for the same talent. This requires that organisations reflect (and invest) more deeply into how their 
objectives and operations can be realised through human capital resources. There is a need for current 
employee retention strategies to be more employee-centric; i.e. that they need to respond to the needs of 
the individuals of the workforce. This can be achieved through the development of “highly targeted 
initiatives” which can be approached through more demographic segmentation of the workforce (e.g. 
aspects like age and gender). This will allow for the inclusion of the ‘softer’ elements of employee 
retention. In that way a more holistic framework to employee retention strategies at the organisation can 
be developed. 
 
A difference was also found between the factors which came out of the interviews, but which were not 
indicated in the perused documentation. It is important that the employee retention documentation (as 
well as GDP documents) comprehensively reflect these (possibly) implicit elements; as well as the 
initiatives that the organisation has been place to support the retention of its employees. 
 
The measurement of the effectiveness and success of an employee retention strategy (one that is more 
holistic and more reflective of employee-needs) needs to be considered. This entails developing ways to 
measure the outcomes of the EVP and EB strategies; and includes the investigation the measurement of 
investment on intellectual capital and efforts to attract the talent in the first instance. 
 
Future work would include the measurement of the success of employed retention strategies; as well as 
alternative methods of retaining institutional memory. More research can be conducted on contrasting the 
needs of the Gen Y with those from earlier Generations, so as to more adequately account for these 
differences in the employee retention effort. The feasibility of the expected retention period (i.e. how long 
should employees be retained for; considering the changing nature of work, and the nature of knowledge 
workers) should be explored as well.   
 
This research would also need to be expanded to other companies (multiple-case, embedded i.e. Type 4 
Case study design). 
 
The implications of the study’s overall findings to the organisation’s current employee retention strategies 
were discussed; and the consequent recommendations are summarised below.

Abstract 
The current energy crisis in Ghana has affected significant number of industries which have direct impact 
on the country’s economy.  Amongst the affected industries are palm oil production industries even 
though the impact is less as compared to fully relied national grid industries.  Most of the large and 
medium palm oil production industries are partially grid reliance, however, the unavailability and the high 
cost palm biomass poses huge challenge.  This paper aimed to identify and analyse the energy challenges 
associated with the palm oil production industries in Ghana.  The study was conducted on thirteen largest 
palm oil production plants in Ghana.  Data was obtained by the use of questionnaire and observation. 
Since the study aimed to compare the respective energy challenges associated with the thirteen largest 
palm oil mills under study and establish a benchmark that represents a common problem of all the thirteen 
mills under study, the study uses cross-tabulation analysis and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) as the 
statistical tools to validate the benchmark. The results indicate that, lack of sustainability of palm biomass 
supply chain is the key energy challenge in the palm oil production industries in Ghana. Other problems 
include intermittent power supply from the grid but limited to the medium scale mills.  A baseline was set 
by comparing the boiler capacity and the palm biomass produced by the large scale mills and determined 
the sustaining period of the biomass produced when considered as boiler fuel.  The average value 
obtained from all the large scale mills is considered as the proposed energy challenge benchmark.  The 
one-way ANOVA test revealed that there is statistically significant difference amongst the boiler 
capacity, FFB processing capacity, quantity of biomass produced and the average sustaining period.  The 
Post-Hoc Scheffe test then revealed that there is statistically significant difference between the boiler 
capacity and the biomass produced.  The results also revealed that there are statistically significant 
differences between the boiler capacity and the average sustaining period.  There were no other

A one-way ANOVA was conducted to examine whether there are statistically significant difference between the 
mills in different parameters in relation to their average sustaining period.  The results revealed that there is 
statistically significant difference amongst the boiler capacity, FFB processing capacity, quantity of biomass 
produced and the average sustaining period,  F-Statistic = 7.2436, p value = 0.0028.  The study further conducted 
Post-Hoc Scheffe test revealed that there is statistically significant differences between the boiler capacity and the 
biomass produced, Scheffe T-value = 4.2440; Scheffe p-value = 0.0061036; Scheffe Inferfence = p < 0.01.  The 
results also revealed that there are statistically significant differences between the boiler capacity and the average 
sustaining period, T-value = 3.6869; Scheffe p-value = 0.0175463; Scheffe Inferfence = p < 0.05.  There were no 
other significant differences between the other parameter groups.

4. Conclusion 
 
Most of the large and medium palm oil production industries are partially grid reliance, however, the unavailability 
and the high cost palm biomass poses huge challenge.  To identify the specific common energy problems associated 
with palm oil mills in Ghana, survey was conducted across regions in Ghana.  The survey sample was limited to 
only large and medium scale mills.  The descriptive statistical method adopted for this survey was suitable.  The data 
was obtained through questionnaire with response rate of 86.67 percent.  The cross tabulation analysis was 
performed on several thematic areas.  The response on the issue of biomass sustainability indicated that, the cost of 
biomass supply from local small scale mills in addition to transportation compel the large scale mills to consider 
intermittent operation in a day.  The survey also revealed that the medium scale mills utilise the empty fruit bunch as 
boiler fuel and therefore do not experience any challenge with regard to biomass supply chain. 
The survey also revealed that, the steam boilers used in four of the five large scale mills are over 20 years old. 
However, they are retrofitted to improve their efficiency between 75 and 85 percent.  Amongst the three challenges 
identified by the survey, the inconsistent supply of palm biomass is the key energy challenge associated with the 
large scale mills.  This challenge results in intermittent operation of the steam boiler, reduces the operation period to 
10 hours instead of 20 hours a day.  This subsequently affects the daily production of the mill. 
The energy challenge benchmark has been established by the study based on the aforementioned key challenge.  
This baseline was set by comparing the boiler capacity and the palm biomass produced by the large scale mills and 
determined the sustaining period of the biomass produced when considered as boiler fuel.  The average value 
obtained from the values of all the large scale mills is considered as the proposed energy challenge benchmark.  A 
one-way ANOVA test revealed that there is statistically significant difference amongst the boiler capacity, FFB 
processing capacity, quantity of biomass produced and the average sustaining period.  The Post-Hoc Scheffe test 
then revealed that there is statistically significant difference between the boiler capacity and the biomass produced.    
The results also revealed that there are statistically significant differences between the boiler capacity and the 
average sustaining period.  There were no other significant differences between the other parameter groups.

Abstract 
This paper aims to optimize a manufacturing process through creation of a simulation model that will be 
used to identify bottlenecks, restructure the layout and improve productivity. The paper also highlights the 
significance of process optimization in a manufacturing set up. Process optimizations strive to find the 
best solution for a process within the available constraints. Simulation is a collection of methodologies 
used to mimic the characteristics and behaviour of real system using computer software. Literature review 
was carried out to understand system dynamics and simulation.  A case study was conducted at a 
manufacturing company. An Arena simulation model representing the process under study was developed 
and analysed.  Various models were run and the results compared. The best model was developed that 
improved productivity through restructuring of the layout and minimization of the cycle times on the 
identified bottleneck stations. The simulation results showed that there was a vast difference on the 
amount of material input and the ATMs and Safes produced.  The limitation of this study was that it only 
focused on the production of two products in the case studied company.

Abstract 
Today we are witnessing a new concept that is growing fast: The Internet of Things (IoT). We can see all 
the devices we use in any field, are transformed into a smarter version such as smart homes, smart beds, 
smart coffee machines and smart everything. According to the American Research Firm Gartner there 
will be nearly 50 billion connected devices in 2020. However, the security aspect is still at the top of the 
prioritized tasks in this concept. 
In this paper we present a review about some categories of popular security issues in the IoT and the 
solutions proposed by other researchers to these issues. In addition, we investigated security attacks in 
smart homes and identified some possible security solutions in those environments. 
Keywords 
Internet of Things (IoT), smart home, connected devices, security issues… 
1. Introduction
Smart home is one of the applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) that continue to grow rapidly. It contains smart 
devices that are connected with applications and gateways like for example: smart lights, smart locks, smart TVs, 
smart washing-machines and alarm system. Smart home applications have gained a huge attention recently. By 
using IoT technology, home appliances are able to communicate with each other so the user can have access to all 
the devices in the home anytime and anywhere. However, the entire architecture of smart homes needs some 
security requirements against existing security issues. That’s why, there’s huge need for strong authentication 
mechanism to prevent from attacks. 
The concept of Internet of Things (IoT) was born in 1999 in the United States and especially at the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology Center thanks to Kevin Ashton. It has gained a lot of acceptance in our private life, with the 
access to the Internet, provided by many technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi...etc, aided by network 
gateways. The fact that the devices we use daily serves our needs and simplifies our lives as well by using our data, 
that impose a lot of risks for the privacy of the end user which requires confidentiality, integrity, authentication and 
authorization. 
This paper is divided to four sections. In the first one we present the concept of the smart home, its architecture, the 
concept of Internet of Things (IoT) then the protocols used in the IoT succeeded by the role of the cloud in a smart 
home and finally some applications for it. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows, in the second section, 
we investigate the main security attacks in the smart home and the most important categories of these attacks then 
we categorize the security issues in the IoT and some cloud attacks. For the third section we describe the existing 
solutions proposed by other researchers for IoT as well as the security solutions for smart home. The fourth section 
provides a discussion. Finally, we conclude the paper.

5. Conclusion 
 
In conclusion, a home is a place where our private information needs to be respected. Unlike the traditional houses, 
smart homes can store the user’s sensitive and important data and make his life better and comfortable. Even so, the 
user should apply effective and appropriate security measures to prevent or to secure his data from network attacks. 
In this paper, we have surveyed the most important security issues in a smart home and we have identified the 
security solutions proposed by other researchers. Additionally, we have analyzed the main elements that form the 
smart home and need to be secured. 
In the future, we will propose a strong solution to improve the security in the smart home.

Abstract 
In this study, various methods used in equipment depreciation were used to determine the depreciation of 
a D9 earth moving mechanical plant to determine the best method possible to achieve an effective result. 
For the study, total depreciation, annual depreciation, weekly, daily and hourly depreciation were 
considered and the best method recommended. 
These methods were used to compute the various depreciation of the plant and the results compared, 
analyzed in order to select the best method for determining depreciation. From the study, the capital 
outlay method was chosen to be the best method.

1. Introduction
Any device or machinery that can be used for doing work can be termed a plant. Plant are used on the field of 
engineering and constructional works. According to M. Subash and K. Damian, [1] the highest allocations to 
production and construction process are in the area of plant and equipment. A lot of a company’s capital are spent in 
this area and need to be looked into. 
Plant may be used to increase production, reduce overall construction cost, increase productivity by eliminating 
heavy manual work and therefore reducing fatigue, undertaking activities which cannot be done by the manual 
methods in the context of economics, maintains high standards requirement in the area of structured engineering 
works and also replaces labour in the area where there is shortage of personnel with the required crafts [2]. 
In acquiring a plant there is the need to look at the ease with which it can be maintained, the ability of the plant to be 
user friendly and also the economic factors [3]. The method of plant acquisition can be in the form of cash or 
outright purchase, leasing, hiring and hire purchase. According to Harris et al [4], economic consideration should be 
based upon when taking the decision to purchase an item of plant. Unless it is otherwise proven that the investment 
will lead to a satisfactory rate of return, there should be no purchase at all. 
There is the need to understand all the important factors involved in deciding to purchase a plant or equipment. 
There are a lot of manufacturers of plants and equipment with its attendant specifications. These can be available 
when needed but there is the intangible aspect too which involves such points as after sales service, maintenance, 
delivery and payment arrangement that also need to be looked at when making decision in the purchase of plant [4]. 
There is therefore the need to find a holistic approach towards making decision to purchase a plant and this involves 
a compromise of technical factors, economic factors, scientific, human and social factors to choose an alternative 
from amongst others [5, 6]  
According to Prasertrungruang and Hadikusumo [7,8] the last stage of a machine life cycle is the disposal stage. At 
this stage decision is taken including depreciation cost in order to make the right disposal decision.  
2. The Bulldozer Plant
Plant may consist of a wide range of machinery, installation, equipment and tools used in doing work. [2] classifies 
plants as excavators, hoists, cranes, transport vehicles, rubble chutes and skips, concreting plants etc. depreciation 
takes place in plants with age and usage. Depreciation can be defined as the decrease in value of an asset over time

5. Conclusion  
From the results it was realized that the total depreciation was $ 445,000 for the whole five-year lifespan of 
the plant. The annual depreciation of the plant depended on the depreciation method used. The annual 
depreciation varied from as low as $29,667 using the sum of digits method to a high of $ 162, 445 using the 
declining balance method. Depending on the method used, hourly, daily and weekly depreciation also 
varied. 
For its simplicity and ease of use, the capital Outlay method proved to be reliable and accurate to use.

Abstract 
The current research seeks to develop a framework for selecting and evaluating the appropriate 
Technology for Mass Customisation (MC). A Technology evaluation criterion was proposed. The criteria 
assigns a high weighting to factors that leads to MC capability. The proposed selection criteria of 
Technology is objective and reduce any subjectivity. The benefits of Technology and the objectives of 
MC were identified in the literature review. Under the guidance of the firm’s technical staff, a thorough 
analysis of the benefits of Technology on MC was done. The research was conducted at a Metal Casting 
Company in South Africa. Metal Casting industry produces a high variety of products, which are highly 
customised, which requires extensive investment in Technology to increase flexibility and 
responsiveness. Selection of Advanced Technology is a subjective process influenced by human 
preferences, the proposed selection procedure is objective and it factors in the MC objectives. This 
research has managed to come up with a Technology selection criteria for MC; this research will alert the 
stakeholders in the metal casting industry about importance of Technology in the success of MC and 
encourage objective investment in Technology.

Abstract 
The needs of the people are no longer homogenous but are constantly changing at a rapid rate. These 
changes must be met with a high level of customisation. Customisation is enhanced with advancements in 
flexible technology. This paper will focus on small to medium enterprises (SME’s) and seeks to establish 
how the principles of mass customisation and investment in technology are related to the capability of a 
company to produce customised products. Using three cases in furniture industry, the research evaluated 
the extent to which technology advancement has been employed in the furniture industry SME sector, its 
requirement and the effect on customisation. It was established that Advanced Technological and 
customisation strategies play an important role in achieving customer satisfaction. Technology use can 
have a dramatic effect on the productivity of a company in a competitive environment.

Findings with regard to Case B, the company has a catalogue of modules that customers can select. The customer 
can select form a range of design, fabrics, select type of legs that a chair would have even the type of wheels. The 
company is only producing chairs. 
 
Case C 
 
Company “C” is small company that is located within the Johannesburg Central Business District. The business 
makes all kinds of furniture, ornaments and other house hold items. However their main focus is on making products 
out of sheet metal and wood.  The company is partnership, two owners and five employees. The owners of the 
company are middle aged male and female in their late thirties, they both have, they have formal education in the 
field of design.

Depends on the product design.  
Observations  
The company is well structured in that they follow a set process when 
making products. The company is more than capable of producing 
products at a mass scale. 
 
All the employees at company C where multi skilled. The company produced unfinished furniture and modules to 
individuals and companies who will then customise the furniture to their environment e.g. naked furniture which can 
painted by the customer. They also used the internet to show case some of their work.  
 
4. Conclusion and Recommendations  
 
Case A is still in the craft industry era they have not evolved to embrace technology.  Workers in Case have a low 
level of education which limits the level of innovation. Innovation requires prior knowledge. Case C workers have 
formal education. The level of education gives them an advantage, they have a high level of absorptive capacity, and 
they have embraced technology which is the main element of mass customisation. Customers are able to customise 
their products through the use of information technology and modularisation. Producing unfinished furniture allows 
customers to customise and also resale their furniture after adding value. Managers of SME Companies must possess 
some prior knowledge to enhance their innovativeness. The other observation made is that companies that have 
older employees worker at shop floor level as well as management level tend to be less innovative. In conclusion for 
SMEs to be successful in Mass customisation process they need to consider their ability to give a customer a wide 
options, this can be done by using modular designs and allowing the customer to mix and match the different units. 
The other way that they can achieve the ability to mass customise is by having a wide range of material, finish and 
using quality outsourced assembling parts. A survey can be used to generalise the results obtained in this study.

Abstract 
This paper evaluates the impact of Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) in a railway and mining 
component manufacturing company. Literature suggest that TPM is an approach innovative to 
maintenance and its major goals are no defects, no accidents and no breakdowns. Many authors have 
argued that TPM improves quality, equipment productivity, prevents unexpected breakdowns and reduces 
defects. Reliable manufacturing equipment is considered as a major contributor to the profitability and 
performance of manufacturing systems in today’s extremely evolving environment.  Most organizations 
function effectively today because the equipment is reliable and available thereby maximising production 
throughput and profit.  
A case study was conducted and it involved a mixed method approach where both quantitative and 
qualitative data was gathered and analysed.  The company implemented TPM through the following 
initiatives; autonomous maintenance, employee improvement, planned maintenance, quality maintenance, 
education and training and safety and health. TPM was implemented for eighteen months. This study 
made use of the following maintenance improvement tools, TPM, Failure Mode Effects and Critically 
Analysis (FMECA) and cause and effect diagram. Maintenance performance factor such as Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) was analysed before and after TPM implementation.   
The results of this study showed that TPM implementation contributes to equipment reliability. There was 
an improvement in overall organizational performance. Through FMECA, maintenance tasks were 
prioritized and risk priority numbers (RPN) were calculated for particular equipment. Key performance 
indicators such as productivity and OEE were on an upward trend while there was a reduction in defect 
rates. Communication among workers, workers and management, and among different departments was 
improved.  Worker motivation was improved through autonomous maintenance. However maintenance 
performance in some departments was found to be too low due to unavailability of data and worker 
inconsistency.  This paper contributes to the theory and practice of TPM implementation. Hypotheses 
tests could not be done due to very low levels of respondents.  
Key words: TPM, equipment reliability, manufacturing, productivity and worker involvement.

5.5 OEE results 
OEE of the machine was calculated using the company’s last nine-month data. It can be seen that, OEE vary 
throughout and ranges from 49.86% to 79.24%. Table 5 shows the calculated values of OEE for the equipment after 
implementation of TPM.   Data used to calculate OEE was confirmed by the continuous improvement team and the 
production personnel.  
OEE = (availability) (performance rate) (quality rate)

Table 5 shows that there is a general increase in machine availability and performance rate. However the causal 
effect of TPM on these two key performance indicators could not be tested through some hypotheses due to few 
respondents.  
 
6. Discussion 
A team of Industrial Engineers that was in charge of continuous improvement developed and improved standard 
operating procedures (SOPs). 5S was used to sort components and poka-yoka principles were used in assembling.  
Workers were taught basic maintenance of their machines and how to correctly fill in preventive maintenance check 
sheets. The use of basic tools for quality improvement such as check sheets, pareto and control charts were 
introduced. The company took their employees for training in TPM. This was found to have enhanced their 
competitiveness. Multi skilling was introduced in the company. Basic electrical maintenance was being done. 
Production meetings were held on a weekly basis were workers could suggest possible solutions. At one station 
management agreed to the redesign of jigs that were used. Tangible and intangible factors that were noticed in the 
company were reduced errors, improved quality and improved employee morale. The researchers noticed that  top 
management was strong and supportive in the implementation of TPM, and this kept all the employees motivated to 
achieve better results.  
However, the research could not express, in terms of monetary value, the return on investment made by these 
training efforts.  The research did not focus on quality of training offered and quality of methods and techniques 
applied.  Barriers to job-related training that were identified in this research were; employees were very busy at 
work, courses offered were costly and offered at an inconvenient time and place, and lack of employer support on 
courses offered outside the company. Employees wanted to attend such courses because it had benefits of 
certification. Hypotheses test could not be calculated due to very low levels of respondents received by the 
researchers.  
 
7. Conclusion 
TPM has begun to be a management criterion in all kinds of organisations. TPM concepts can be effectively 
practiced to enhance manufacturing performance in the organisation. An effective TPM program can address the 
organisations maintenance related obstacles with the perspective to optimise equipment performance. The study 
reveals that TPM concepts can assist manufacturing organisations in the search for achieving enhanced 
manufacturing performance. Therefore, it is important for organisations to integrate maintenance related 
performance aspects into the overall organisation performance systematic approach. Quality tools such as the cause 
and effect diagram are appropriate for designing and producing reliable systems. This paper could not test 
hypotheses due to very low levels of respondents and the researchers have agreed to make this testing part of their 
future work. This paper did not calculate the demand rate of the major products manufactured by this company. 
Maintenance efficiency and costs were also not calculated and will be treated as part of future work.

Abstract 
The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of Industry 4.0 adoption and operational performance 
improvement due to apply Total Quality Management (TQM) and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). 
The analyzed sample was collected from 147 Brazilian manufacturers which have been practiced TQM and 
TPM for at least 10 years and during the past few years have started to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. 
Multivariate data analysis was applied into the collected data in order to examine such relationships. Our 
statistical tests indicate that both TQM and TPM practices act as mediators for the relationship between 
Industry 4.0 and operational performance improvement. Hence, we mention that the companies which 
decide to join Industry 4.0 must have properly addressed these practices to entirely benefit from the 
advances in information and communication systems. This study contributes to threefold. First, it provides 
evidence to underpin theoretical indications previously argued but lack empirical validation. Second, the 
identification of relationship in an emerging economy context allows to understand the specific benefits or 
challenges that Industry 4.0 adoption. Third, comprehending how these approaches interact to help 
managers to avoid difficulties and set the suitable expectations along their implementation.

1. Introduction
To emerge as a leading manufacturer for the world market, companies located in emerging economies’ context face a 
tough competition with global players. While the pressure to compete in their domestic market increases, these 
companies also struggle to become a global sourcing base (SETH; TRIPATHI, 2005). Hence, they must spend 
significant efforts to improve operational aspects, such as quality and efficiency performance, compelling them to 
adopt managerial approaches to support such achievement (TAJ; MOROSAN, 2011; TORTORELLA; 
FETTERMANN, 2017A).  
Two major improvement approaches in the field of production and operations management are Total Quality 
Management (TQM) and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) (SHAH; WARD, 2003). TQM is a management 
approach widely deemed for continuously improving the quality of products, services and processes by focusing on 
the customers’ needs and expectations enhancing customer satisfaction and firm performance (WANG et al., 2012; 
DALE, 2015). Throughout the years, TQM has been argued as positively impact an organization, although there are 
mixed results about its relationship with performance (SADIKOGLU; OLCAY, 2014). Similarly, TPM has gained 
further attention during 1990s as an approach that focuses on maximizing resources utilization through maintenance 
and basic stability practices (NAKAJIMA, 1988; AHUJA; KHAMBA, 2008B). Specifically in emerging economies’ 
context, where capital expenditure levels are reduced and new machine acquisition is a greater challenge, the proper 
utilization and maintenance of equipment are vital for an enhanced shop floor efficiency (AHUJA; KHAMBA, 2008A; 
JAIN et al., 2015). Several researchers (e.g. SETH; TRIPATHI, 2005; SETH; TRIPATHI, 2006; KONECNY; THUN, 
2011; KAUR et al., 2012) have examined the effects of association between TQM and TPM on business performance.

Abstract 
Following the remarkable evolution of new technologies, and the computerization of different transactions 
and devices in several areas in recent years, the generation of data in its various forms has become 
increasingly important. Hence the emergence of the new era of Big Data. This new phenomenon of Big 
Data has appeared with several advantages, but in return, it confronts several challenges linked to security. 
This paper highlights the various security issues that may exist throughout the Big Data life cycle. And 
touches some needs necessary to reinforce the security of these data. Thus, the paper presents a solution 
allowing the improvement of the security level offered by systems allowing the management of these data 
during their real time treatment.

Introduction
In the last twenty years, data has been increased. Every day, billions of bytes of digital information have been 
generated. Because of the use of different devices as well as social networks 90 % of all data available today in the 
world has been produced in the last two years (Mehmood et al. 2016). Hence the appearance of the new era of Big 
Data. 
Big data is rapidly being turned into a hot spot that attract the attention of the world. It is a global concept that can be 
defined as a set of voluminous and complex data, characterized by five dimensions: volume, that represents the data 
generated, velocity, or speed describes the frequency with which data is generated, captured and shared; variety,

6. Conclusion 
 
The security is a major factor. Indeed, the key to success ensuring data privacy for organization is effective 
information management and governance. Data privacy applies to  every  internal  and  external  network  user within 
the global business community. However, many people are unaware that there are some measures to protect 
themselves against the most critical risk. 
To conclude, we try  to  clarify  and  explain  the  concept of  the big  data.  We mentioned the different challenges 
of security. Finally we proposed a solution to reinforce the processing and security of big data.

Abstract 
A boiler is one of the critical systems in various industries even in the food industry. The cost of boiler 
maintenance including repair and replacement are very high. Therefore, options such as fitness for service 
are used as cost effective measures to demonstrate the performance characteristic of a component that might 
be operating with a flaw. This option is prone to a number of avoidable human errors like other maintenance 
functions. This paper aims to identify and examine the human factors acting as barriers for successful 
performance of fitness for service assessments in a boiler. It further recommends the possible solutions for 
the reduction and avoidance of reoccurrence of human errors. A single exemplary case study of a boiler in 
an anonymous company was selected. The study adopted a documentation review and observation as data 
collection tools to examine the source of human errors. Human errors such as wrong and insufficient 
measurements, poor work planning, and improper data collection and recording were identified as key 
barriers for successful performance of fitness for service assessments of a boiler system. The study further 
revealed that human factors such as lack of experience and training, poor communication and organizational 
practices are key causal factors.  
Keywords:  
Boiler, fitness for service, flaw, human factor, human error. 
1. Introduction
During the maintenance phase of a boiler system, there are times where decisions such a repair or replacement are to 
be made. However, such decisions are very costly in nature since they also require lengthy shutdowns of the plant 
during the process. Now, a process like fitness for service is one of the methods that are used to analyze the condition 
of a boiler with flaws such as corrosion and cracks to determine the extent to which the boiler can operate without 
undergoing repair or replacement to eliminate the flaw. As much as it is a cost effective method as opposed to

The recommended solutions presented above can be helpful in mitigating human errors however there are factors that 
can prevent the successful implementation of these solutions. Timmons, et al., (2014) indicates that management 
commitment, casual organizational cultures, and organization’s local context are enablers of the perpetual occurrence 
of human error as they prevent successful implementation of training solutions.  
5. Conclusion  
 
The results obtained in this paper are very important to the maintenance personnel focusing on fitness for service of 
boilers and pressure vessel specifically those having interest in dealing with human error. The study analyzed the 
human errors and human factors that are regarded as barriers to the success of fitness for service assessments. It was 
indeed discovered that if enough attention is not paid to human error, the fitness for service assessments will not 
achieve the desired goal. The missing measurements, poor records of data and lack of original documentation to 
support decision making were leading human errors hindering the successful implementation of fitness for service. 
Fitness for service is one of the processes that are data hungry, hence without appropriate data it is impossible to make 
proper and accurate decisions concerning the life of a boiler systems operating with flaws. The lack of knowledge, 
low level of education and insufficient training, organizational practices, poor work planning and poor communication 
were regarded as error causal factors having an impact on the fitness for service assessments. The immediate solutions 
to the issue of human error in fitness for service assessments of boilers were presented. These included the 
development of checklists, training, management commitment, electronic data recording and preparation of sketches 
prior thickness measurements. It is then recommended that as the first step to adoption of fitness for service 
assessments, training must be conducted with an aim of reducing human error, hence improve the performance. The 
adoption of human factors principles in fitness for service assessments process can help the companies to properly 
manage human errors and even eliminate them.  
The following are considered to be eligible for future research focus:  
• 
Analyzing human error in fitness for service assessments to examine the state of the industry practices.   
• 
The development of proper reporting systems that incorporate human factors principles. 
• 
A framework for better managing human error in fitness for service of boiler systems.

Abstract 
High impedance faults due to the high magnitude of impedance in their paths have little fault current. 
Therefore, network security devices are generally unable to identify them. This paper presents a new 
method for identifying high impedance faults. First, the high impedance waveforms that have been 
extracted from actual experiments are de-noising by the wavelet transform. The waveform of other 
transient network conditions is also derived from the simulation of the standard 13-bay IEEE distribution 
system in PSCAD software. Then, by using time-frequency transformation S, extraction of the selected 
features of this waveform is performed by principle components analysis (PCA) of the monitoring sample 
points and entering the neural network. Finally, to distinction between transient states and high impedance 
faults and detection this fault, the multilayer perceptron neural network has been used. The results show 
clearly the effectiveness of this method

1. Introduction
High impedance faults in distribution networks usually occur when part of the network conductors is interrupted and 
placed on the ground or branches of trees or other levels. 5 to 10 percent of distribution network fault is due to this 
type of fault [1]. The high impedance fault has a small, non-linear, random, unsteady, and highly variable current. 
This current is small in size and therefore not detectable by the current over current relays in the distribution 
network [2]. High impedance faults do not have a significant effect on the normal performance of the distribution 
network, but dropped conductors can have serious risks to human life. The resulting arc can cause fire. Also, due to 
the nonlinear nature of these faults, the harmonics created by them can have a negative effect on the quality of the 
delivered electricity to subscribers [3]. 
This paper presents a new method for detecting these types of faults. The proposed method is the simultaneous use 
of wavelet transform, S transformation, principle component analysis and neural network. Information on the high

Conclusion 
In this paper, a new method for detecting high impedance fault using simultaneous application of wavelet transform, 
S-transform, fundamental component analysis and neural network was presented. Because of the high impedance 
fault data obtained from the actual tests and final results shows the acceptable percentage of success, then this 
method can be used as a safe method.

Abstract 
A regret order based clustering heuristic is proposed to create capacitated clusters for spatial datasets with 
equal weighting. This heuristic can be used in a vast number of applications, including the Capacitated P-
Median problem (CPMP) and Capacitated Facility Location Problem (CFLP). The heuristic is scalable and 
therefore also useful to cluster large instances. The heuristic builds on an initial uncapacitated clustering 
solutions the can be generated by various clustering methods and has proven to provide good quality end 
solutions independent of the quality of the initial solution. Different types of regret proximities are tested 
for the Capacitated P-Median problem (CPMP) in particular. The results along with visual plots on a map 
of geometrical data are shown to illustrate the impact of the different proximity rules.

1. Introduction
Most applications do not only need data points to be clustered but also adhere to capacitated constraints. An area 
where capacitated clusters are needed is the design of supply chain network where spatial data need to be clustered 
based on supply and capacity limitations, for example the vehicle routing (VRP), capacitated facility location (CFLP) 
and capacitated location-routing problems (CLRP). The capacitated p-median problem forms a central part of more 
complicated supply chain network problems like the VRP, CFLP and CLRP. It was therefore chosen to measure the 
effectiveness of the proposed regret-order based method.  
Numerous methods have been suggested in the past but few were tested and found to work well for big instances. 
Approximate algorithms (Harks et al., 2013) that take scalability into consideration has only become the focus in 
recent years. Many of the suggested approaches from literature do not have a time complexity that can deal with large 
instances. 
The goal of clustering methods is to group items together to minimize the total dissimilarity between the points in a 
cluster (Everitt et al., 2011, Hartigan, 1975). There are clustering methods that can effectively deal with large datasets, 
for example the hierarchical, iterative partitioning methods like the k-means, nearest neighbor and density-based 
methods. Even though a clustering method can be fine-tuned to create the correct amount of clusters, the capacity per 
cluster are not guaranteed. A technique is needed to create capacitated clusters from the unconstrained clustering 
solutions for single-source problems.

7. Conclusion 
 
When creating capacitated clusters for the single source CPMP with homogenous capacity constraints, traditional 
methods often do not take time complexity into consideration and are too slow to solve instances with a large number 
of data points. Cluster-based approaches are more practical as it is able to create clusters with reasonable time 
complexity. These methods can however not guarantee that capacity constraints are adhered to. 
 
The two-phase PROBUC method is an effective heuristic to create capacitated clusters for converting uncapacitated 
clusters to capacitated clusters. However, certain uncapacitated clustering methods tend to create unbalanced solutions 
where many points need to be re-assigned to create capacitated clusters, for example, the single linkage hierarchical 
clustering method (Bührmann, 2016). In these cases, points are reassigned to neighboring clusters, and these 
neighboring clusters quickly reach capacity. In other work, points are assigned to another cluster with enough capacity 
where the cluster center is not necessarily the closest or second closest one to the point. This causes a “jumping” 
effect, where an under capacitated cluster overlaps a full cluster (Bührmann, 2016). In the PROBUC method, this 
effect is avoided by not allowing points in overcapacity clusters to move to any other cluster than the closest. Instead, 
PROBUC allows the re-assignment of points in clusters that are within a percentage (typically P = 10%) of the capacity 
limit to their next closest cluster center. This makes space for transferal of points from overcapacitated clusters. The 
algorithm is also designed to prevent clusters becoming empty, by not allowing points to move out of clusters with 
only 10% of the capacity limit remaining. 
 
Results from the two instances indicate that solutions producing the best objective function do not necessary result in 
the best visual attractive solution. It is therefore important to also consider visual attractiveness when studying the 
CPMP and other related network problems as suggested by Poot et al. (1999) and Kant et al., (2008).  
 
Starting with balanced unconstrained clustering solutions do provide an advantage when using the PROBUC heuristic. 
Most of the time spend in the PROBUC heuristic method is spent in the improvement phase. If the solutions produced 
by the unconstraint starting solution is of good quality, the number of points that need to be re-assigned are so few 
that the need of the improvement phase becomes less significant. Overall the method was able to effectively create 
capacitated constraint solutions in a very short CPU time of less than 200 seconds for 13509 data points.

Abstract 
Parents are the most qualified persons to look after their toddlers. However, there has been instances where 
the parents were briefly distracted in doing another task and unfortunately, it resulted into the toddlers 
falling in swimming pools and dying from drowning. This study aims at the design and manufacture of a 
toddler surveillance robot to reduce the death by drowning in the country.  The robot reads the RSSI strength 
of a Bluetooth signal to identify when a toddler is alone outside and makes use of Computer Vision to locate 
and track the toddler from a safe distance. Using Deep Neural Network, the robot was trained to recognize 
if the toddler is playing near a swimming pool or has fallen in it. Thus, it will automatically activate its 
alarm buzzers to notify the parents about the dangerous situation. The robot uses the Rocker Bogie 
mechanism to easily move over rough terrain and steps found in a backyard. Moreover, the robot is 
equipped with a GPS chip to locate its position and before tracking the toddler, it will save its initial GPS 
location. This initial GPS location is used when the parent comes close to the robot or when the 
acknowledgement button is pressed, which instructs the robot to return to its initial position.

F. GPS Return home function Test 
The probability of success for the return home function was 50 %. In Mauritius, the GPS service is not as accurate as 
other countries and moreover there are trees and other obstacles that prevent the good reception of the GPS signal. 
The neo M8n GPS module has an accuracy of 0.9 meters. However, in backyards having large trees, it was difficult 
for the robot to find its way back to its initial position. The robot is still light enough for a normal size adult to pick it 
up and drop it at its initial position. 
G. Cooling fan Test 
The cooling fans successfully start when the temperature of the body of the robot reaches 55 0C and help to dissipate 
the internal heat. The fans successfully turn off once the temperature goes below 55 0C. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
The robot satisfied its aim and objectives. It was able to read the Bluetooth signal strength of a toddler’s Bluetooth tag 
and determine whether the toddler was roaming alone, by calculating the difference between the RSSI strength signal 
of the Bluetooth tags and started looking for him/her when the difference was more than 20 dBm which is equivalent 
to a wall blocking the Bluetooth signal of the parent’s Bluetooth tag. The robot was also able to detect a toddler and 
follow him/her within a safe distance (about 2 meters) while being more accurate at the walking speed of the toddler 
compared to the running speed of the toddler. 
The robot is able to accurately estimate the amount of danger in a given situation 8 out of 10 times. The accuracy can 
be improved through further training and testing.  Furthermore, the robot is able to maintain a safe working 
temperature within its body which is 55 0C. This contributes to the good performance of the microcontroller, sensors 
and battery lifespan safety. 
Overall the project was successful and will be able to help reduce the number of death by drowning of toddlers as well 
as providing a safe environment for them. Parents will also be warned by a sound alert of about 120 dB if the toddler 
is in danger.  OpenCV and computer vision in general is still under development, thus the system is not perfect and 
can be enhanced through further testing and training. Dataset are also not easily available which can contribute to the 
enhancement of neural network of the robot. 
Lastly, it has been found that using neural network, the robot can be modified very easily for other vulnerable age 
groups such as monitoring the safety of elder persons and handicapped persons. This can be done by changing the 
dataset used to train the robot and defining other dangers that the latter needs to detect. The price of the prototype is 
high as it is a one-off production. If mass produced, the price will be reduced. Rs 18,182.75 (USD 542.76) is relatively 
cheap compare to other companion robots discussed in the existing model section and they do not offer danger 
detection services.  
For example, Aristotle (Martinko, 2017), which is a fixed camera mounted on a table for real time video streaming 
and lighting control only, costs USD 400 (Rs 13,400), PaPeRo (Partner type Personal Robot) companion robot costs 
USD 600 (Rs 20,100) per month, Kuri robot (Heykuri.com, 2017), costs USD 799 (Rs 26,766.5) Ipal Robot 
(ipalrobot, 2017) cost between USD 1,500 and USD 2,000 (Rs 50,250 to 67,000) and Jibo robot costs USD 900 (Rs 
30,150).

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to establish the extent to which computer aided technologies are applied in the 
clothing and textile sector in Gauteng. The study was empirical, quantitative and non-experimental 
research. Data was collected through a cross-sectional survey that was conducted on one sample of clothing 
and textile companies. The surveyed companies were identified through purposeful sampling. The 
participating companies were a mixture of small, medium and large companies. The data gathering tool 
was a self-administered questionnaire. The computer aided technologies investigated are; computer aided 
design, computer aided manufacturing, computer integrated manufacturing, electronic data interchange, 
electronic point of sale, and internet. Findings from the analysis show that the applications were not equally 
popular. The most popular packages were the internet and computer aided design. Electronic point of sale, 
computer aided manufacturing, and electronic data interchange had a fair number of users. The least popular 
technology was computer integrated manufacture. These computer applications are not only relevant to the 
clothing and textile sector. They are equally useful in other sectors. The technologies help reduce the cycle 
times from design to manufacture and manufacturing companies can accept customer orders closer to due 
dates.

4.2 The level of automation in the manufacturing plant 
 
The study was done to understand the level of automation in the clothing and textile industry in the sample. The results 
showed that 58.7% of the participating companies were not or were slightly automated, while 29.8% were moderately 
automated and 11.6% were mostly or fully automated (see Table 5).

Findings in sections 4.1 to 4.6 show that there is low uptake of computer-aided technologies. This confirms the low 
level of automation found in this section. Similar to technologies in sections 4.1 to 4.6, automation is important to 
both lean and agile supply chains. It has, on one hand, the impact of improving response, and on the other hand, it 
reduces cycle time. In addition, Groover (2010) recognises the following benefits derived from automation: 
• 
low amount of labour; 
• 
low product cost, because cost of fixed equipment is spread over many units; 
• 
high production rate; 
• 
minimal work in progress and production lead time; 
• 
minimal use of factory floor space. 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
This study investigated the application of computer aided technologies in clothing and textile companies in Gauteng, 
South Africa. The technologies analysed are CAD, CAM, CIM, EDI, EPOS and the internet. 
 
The results were generated from 104 clothing and textile companies that were chosen purposefully. Hence the results 
cannot be generalized to the clothing and textile population in Gauteng. 
 
The surveyed companies showed a low uptake of computer aided technologies. This could be a partial explanation to 
the poor competitiveness of the clothing and textile companies in South Africa as observed by Morris & Barnes (2014).  
 
Outputs from this research are of value to academia and policy makers. The results stimulate the academia to do a 
more comprehensive study in order to get a country wide understanding of the computer aided technology usage in 
the sector. To the policy makers the findings point to the intervention that can be introduced to save the sector from 
collapse. Moreover the results help the clothing and textile companies see the need to invest in computer aided 
technologies. Findings from this study have also generated a platform for informative debates within the clothing and 
textile sector with focus on the relationship between computer-aided technologies and performance. 
 
6. Recommendations 
 
1. The results obtained from this study are based on one sample whose elements were selected purposefully. 
Generalisation cannot occur because random selection of elements was not done. To get a general view of the 
usage of computer aided technology in the clothing and textile at district, provincial or national level, it is 
necessary to involve the entire population of clothing and textile companies. This will allow the researcher to 
select the participants randomly, analyse the data and eventually generalise the findings.  
2. There is need to conduct a study that focuses on clothing and textile companies’ understandings of the influence 
of computer aided technologies on company competitiveness. This will aid stakeholders in realising the extent to 
which these companies understand the importance of the technologies and will help render appropriate 
interventions where necessary. 
3. Although this study was conducted in the clothing and textile industry, similar studies could be applied in other 
sectors.

Abstract 
Production Planning is a continuous process that aims to achieve particular products i at the right time in 
the future, which targets the best utilization of the available resources to satisfy the market demand. This 
study focuses on how production planning is to be integrated with quality control and sales. A myriad of 
variants of the problem has been addressed in literature, however this study will focus on two major variants 
observed in a brewing company located in Gauteng, South Africa. The first variant asks for integrating both 
production planning, quality control and sales process to obtain a more accurate and realistic production 
plan, whereas the second variant asks for addressing and analyzing the mutual influence between the three 
processes (production planning, sales and quality control) and the packaging and warehouse in the brewing 
company. To cope with these issues, a research framework is proposed in this paper. The aim of the 
proposed framework is to minimize the disparity between the planned production volume and the actual 
produced volume while considering the integration and the mutual influence between the aforementioned 
processes. The proposed framework is to be used as a starting point in developing a mathematical model 
that will tackle the aforementioned variants.

1. Introduction
In a survey published by Kirin institute of food and Lifestyle (Kirin, 2012) on the global beer production per country, 
the beer production went up to 3.7% from 2010 to 2011. This is its 27th consecutive year of growth. Looking at the 
global statistics, China has been the largest beer producing country in the world for the tenth year in a row, with an 
increased production of 10.9% more beer in 2011 than 2010. The United States is the second largest producer. Brazil 
comes third with a 3.4% growth in 2011 after reporting 18.2% annual increase in the previous year. The increasing 
trend of beer production shows that China, United States and Brazil have efficient and effective production planning 
and control methods. 
Due to consistent failure in production variables such as production operations for the brewing company under study, 
well-defined and effective production management continuous to collapse. The production management has a sole 
objective which is to ensure that quality products are supplied in the required volume at the required time and at 
affordable cost. To achieve this, effective production planning and quality control is required (Cheng et al., 2018). 
Features and characteristics of a product or services, which are relevant to its ability to satisfy a particular need are 
referred to as quality. Such features and characteristics may include physical dimensions, weight, hardness, color 
resistance etc (Cheng et al., 2018). The quality features and characteristics of the brewing company in the study 
include alcohol, real extract, color, CO2, dissolved oxygen, PH and SO2. The satisfaction level of a good quality 
product possesses certain attributes, therefore in order to maintain the defined production goals and objectives, quality 
problems must be solved promptly with maximum attention.

Figure 4. Proposed research framework 
 
Furthermore, the continuous failure in meeting the production requirements have major impacts on the packaging 
department and warehouse. Those two departments will be considered in the proposed mathematical model. First, data 
from all related departments and processes will be collected. The data collection will include historical data from the 
brew-house, racking and packaging. The processing time during conversion of raw-materials to wort, wort to beer 
(fermentation), racking of beer, maturation and filtration will be collected along with the technical constraints 
encountered during all these processes. Second, extensive data analysis will be conducted (i.e. comparison between 
the existing data of planned vs actual volume) in order to get a clear idea of how long the problem has been going on 
for. Third, a mathematical formulation will be developed to model the interrelationships between all the blocks 
presented in figure 3. The main aim of the proposed mathematical model is to generate a more accurate and realistic 
production plan that considers the integration and interrelationships between these blocks and departments. Finally, 
results from the model will be statistically analyzed along with averages from the historical data. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Poor production planning decision making in the brewing company under study triggered a need for the research study 
on the topic. As a result of poor production planning decision, the working hours in the packaging department have 
been cut down which resulted in reduced salaries. The company needs to improve in sales forecasting, delivery and 
also with following the production plan. Quality as one of the major aspects that prevent the brewing department from 
meeting and following the production plan also needs to be looked into. Whilst the company prepares the production 
planning looking at what the market demand and capacity planning, production planning could go wrong due to quality 
and inventory build-up. The proposed frame work will use mathematical modelling to find balance between the 
committed volume and the actual volume and recommendations will come from the findings. The data collection is 
still in progress.

Abstract 
Film companies need to manage and strengthen their operations to produce quality films and create a 
sustainable film industry. In order to achieve higher benefits from filmmaking, it is important to develop a 
good organizational structure and strategic management, and identify roles of film personnel and processes 
as well. This article examines the organizational structure of film industry and strategic management of film 
production. The findings are based on the literature and responses of survey questionnaires distributed to 
filmmakers of Harare, Zimbabwe. The study offers a better understanding of the connection between 
organizational structure and strategic management.

1. Introduction
The Zimbabwean film industry has been described as fragmented by both film practitioners and researchers. Presently, 
the industry is going through a lot of challenges and some of them are attributed to unclear government policies. As a 
result, there is an uncertainty on how the film business shall operate. The industry have been constantly overlooked as 
it is characterized with marginal profit and it is not capable of sustainable development, which is not the case in some 
other countries. The film industry in Zimbabwe requires effective and efficient strategies to be competitive with other 
industries (Soetanto et al., 2007). The industry needs a properly crafted strategy and innovative ideas which will make 
it unique. It is important to note that Zimbabwe is a developing country and cannot afford big budgets for filmmaking, 
therefore, film companies must create their own model of strategies that would enable the industry to be competitive. 
Hao et al. (2012) believe that there is a constant need of changing organizational structures to achieve superior 
performance which will result in quality products and services. Altinay and Altinay (2004) also view organizational 
structure as a first step of achieving business strategic goals as this will help in translating business ideas into realities 
by assigning distinct duties to each personnel.  
The aim of the paper is to discuss the organizational structure and strategies of film companies.  The paper discusses 
the organizational structure and strategic management of film companies using the findings of survey conducted 
among Zimbabwean filmmakers.

suggested that the government should support the film industry and open new avenues for distributing as online income 
is so little  
 
Many film companies have adopted a mechanism of multi-tasking by assigning two or more job description to one 
person as most are independent filmmakers. Some admitted to depend on donor funding and well-wishers but they all 
disclosed that the funds are not enough to produce quality films that can be competitive on global market. Many 
respondents revealed that their company is sustaining through making advertisements, shooting weddings and 
publishing. Hence, one of the solution is to utilize the available equipment and diversify from filmmaking to other 
related moneymaking projects. 
 
It is clear that the film industry in Zimbabwe is struggling financially to create a self-sustaining film industry that can 
compete at a global level. Zimbabwean film industry acknowledge the basic organizational structure but financial 
constraints have been forcing producers to work with small crew and inhibit the implementation strategies planned for 
the success of Zimbabwean film companies. Most respondents suggested that filmmakers should have both short-term 
and long-term plans. The short-term plans have always made the industry stagnant threatening the future of the sector. 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendation  
 
This paper present the findings on the organizational structure of film industries in Harare and strategies that are used 
by filmmakers to operate their organizations. Most Zimbabwean film companies use a basic organizational structure 
and the strategies that they employ are different from each other. Whilst the filmmakers are aware of the importance 
of hierarchy structure, teamwork and different ways of staying competitive, the film companies are still struggling to 
adopt and implement proper strategic management. There are so many external barriers that affect the implementation 
of most of strategic mechanisms; some of those barriers include lack of funding, piracy and lack of exposure to 
international exhibitions.    
 
5.1 Recommendations  
 
1. Zimbabwean filmmakers should take advantage of its beautiful scenic locations, which has not been fully 
exploited, to start co-productions with other well-established film industries. It has also become an international 
hub for competitive production studios to work with global film producers with excellent locations at favorable 
costs, especially when producing films with high computer graphics involved.  
2. Film companies should not only come up with innovative ideas, but should also strive to implement them, re-
invent itself and offer the global market a different mechanism of filmmaking.    
3. Filmmakers should change their mindset of waiting for the government and donors to support them but rather 
seek other ways of fund-raising such as crowdfunding.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to provide insight into the critical success factors (CSFs) of a quasi-public 
institution in the delivery of projects, including the institutional structure of MiDA, processes and 
procedures affecting the successful implementation of the transport project under the MiDA Compact 1. 
In order to identify the critical success factors the study was planned and performed in two stages. The 
first stage of the approach was to subject the set of success factors identified in preliminary evaluation to 
expert group of respondents involved in the MiDA Compact 1 project. The second stage of the process 
was to subject the selected CSFs to full scale evaluation by expanding respondents to determine their 
relative importance. To determine the relative importance of the CSFs based on the expanded survey data, 
two statistical analysis, namely ranking and factor analysis were performed. The results of the study show 
that seven (7) critical success factors affected the N1 highway. These include; clear donor guidelines on 
disbursement of funds, strong national ownership of the project, pre-project design consultation with

The following are some of the key findings of the study: 
• 
Majority of the respondents (61%) use the N1 Highway more than once a day and they mostly comprised 
passengers. The road has been commended for its superior architectural design and the ability to 
accommodate huge traffic flow. 
• 
About 86% of respondents who have used that stretch of road before and after the MiDA Compact 1 road 
project have observed a significant difference whiles admitting a drastic reduction in the time to travel on 
the road. 
• 
Contractors were commended to have done a good job and have largely attributed this success to their 
status of a foreign company who are judged to have the capacity to do a good job. 
• 
The study has identified seven (7) critical success factors. These include; clear donor guidelines on 
disbursement of funds, strong national ownership of the project, pre-project design consultation with 
stakeholders, senior managers understanding of the project, clear understanding of project environment by 
contractors, competencies of project designing and planning team and access/ adequate resources. 
• 
The Pearson’s correlation coefficient revealed a statistically significant strong positive relationship between 
the critical success factors and project performance indicators. 
• 
About 89% of respondents believed that, the institutional arrangements of MiDA was essential for ensuring 
the overall success of the MiDA Compact 1 Road Transport project. 
• 
Finally, both policy makers and the implementation team rated the MiDA Compact 1 Road transport 
Project as highly successful. Albeit the success ranking of the project, respondents have lamented about the 
critical and strict oversight by donor as well as the balance between delivery and perfection of the project.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The results obtained in this study has identified seven critical success factors for effective project delivery. These 
critical success factors have impacted positively on the overall performance of the MiDA Compact 1 road transport 
project. The project exhibited high quality and timely delivery as well as completion within the costs specified. Road 
users have affirmed their preference of the road in terms of its architectural design and its ability to accommodate 
huge traffic flow.  
Beneficiaries of the road has therefore commended the contractors for doing a good job. It was also evident that 
organizational and managerial attributes of MiDA has played a significant role in the efficient and successful 
delivery of the road project. It is therefore imperative to emulate the approach adopted by MiDA on the supervisory 
role it played to ensure the successful completion of the road project. This study has significantly contributed to the 
General body of knowledge in the following dimensions: 
• 
Provision of more information and contribution to the body of knowledge on CSFs for delivery of 
public projects, especially in the context of a quasi-public institution in Ghana;   
• 
Provision of more information to evaluate the notion of relevance of management skills and 
organization structure in the efficient delivery of project, especially in Ghana; and  
• 
Provision of necessary information to policy makers and political leadership in Ghana to make 
informed policy decisions on public project management. 
However, it is the general consensus that the success of the road project stemmed from the fact that the contractors 
were foreigners which by their inherent nature are accustomed to doing a good job. This raises several concerns 
about the ability of local contractors to deliver on large projects. It is therefore important for local contractors to 
build capacity and ensure high quality of projects as well as cost efficiency in order to be able to manage projects of 
huge magnitude. Project managers must therefore identify such critical success factors that promote the effective 
and efficient delivery of projects.

Abstract 
This study proposes an alternative implementation method for ISO 9001:2015 by using knowledge transfer 
best practice as basis for the development of an implementation framework.  ISO 9001 is by far the most 
widely implemented ISO management system with an implementation base of 1.1 million accreditations 
worldwide, and benefits of ISO 9001 accreditation are well researched.  Despite this, implementation of the 
standard is at times superficial.  It has been shown that diagrams assist with learning in preparation for a 
biology test.  Though the environments are very different, organizational learning and therefore the ability 
to implement ISO 9001 requirements, might also be more effective if information is presented in a diagram 
or flowchart form.  This principle was applied in the development of an alternative implementation 
framework in the form of an interactive and editable flow chart.  This approach promotes the sustainable 
integration of requirements into existing operations.  The benefits of certification and barriers to 
implementation of ISO 9001 are well established.  However, there is a gap in literature on implementation 
methods for ISO 9001.  This study will be a valuable contribution to the ISO 9001 body of knowledge. 
Companies seeking or maintaining ISO 9001:2015 accreditations would find this model useful.    
1. Introduction
The International Organization of Standardization (ISO) 9001 management standard is the most widely implemented 
ISO management system with an implementation base of 1.1 million accreditations across the world (Figure 1).  The 
next largest implementation base being ISO 14 001, is standing at a quarter of ISO 9001’s implementation base (The 
ISO Survey of Management System Standard Certifications, 2016).   
Two factors can be attributed for this wide implementation base:  
1)
Increasingly ISO 9001 is becoming a pre-requisite for doing business in both the private and public sector
(McAdam & Canning, 2001).
2)
In addition, ISO 9001 is generic in nature and therefore applicable to all industries.
This is no different for ISO 9001 accreditations within South Africa.  The number of accreditations in South Africa 
(SA) have steadily increased over the years as can be seen in Figure 2.  When last measured in 2016 the number of 
ISO 9001 accreditation was standing at 4761 accreditations across all industries (The ISO Survey of Management 
System Standard Certifications, 2016).   
The advantages of ISO 9001 accreditation are well established (Rusjan & Alič, 2010).  However, researchers have 
also found numerous barriers to implementation, such as senior management’s understanding and attitude towards 
ISO 9001 (Yeung et al. 2003), and cases of superficial implementation (Zeng et al., 2007).   
Although benefits and barriers to implementation are well researched, there exists gaps in the literature as to how to 
address these barriers.  The aim of this research is therefore to put forward an alternative implementation framework 
to promote internalization of ISO 9001:2015 requirements for sustainable implementation.  Knowledge transfer best 
practice will be utilized to assist with the development of this framework.  The framework was developed for a South 
African State Owned Enterprise (SOE), however it is generic in nature and can be applied to any environment.

Figure 6:  Monitoring and measurement flowchart 
ISO 9001:2015 also requires that an organization determines those influencing factors, internal and external to the 
organization, which affects its ability to deliver products and services as planned.  Through the framework, the 
influencing factors are identified by reflecting on what factors affect a department ability to carry out its activities, be 
it positive or negative factors.  Subsequently the positive influencing factors are translated into opportunities whereas 
the negative influencing factors are translated into risks.  The standard then requires that action be taken to realise 
opportunities and to address risk.   
If activities are not achieving their intended outcome, then these activities are ineffective.  In these cases, effort and 
resources may go into the activity, yet little or no value is being realized from it.  To address this issue, the standard 
requires that the current practice with regards to the execution of an activity, be evaluated to determine whether these 
activities are effective.  The framework facilitates this process by leading the compiler to reflect on the current activity 
execution practice and identify areas that are ineffective in achieving planned outcomes.  Once these issues have been 
identified, actions can be put in place to address these issues.   
The implementation framework proposed in this paper, provides a systematic methodology to identify and address the 
aspects covered in this section, namely: 
• 
Monitoring and measuring,  
• 
Related records 
• 
Influencing factors 
• 
Activity effectiveness.   
This is as opposed to the common checklist method where implementers of the standards would as an example, merely 
be required to keep related records.   The requirement in this format is loose standing and does not specifically link to 
the operations of a department.  Because of this it can be difficult to implement if one is not well acquainted with ISO 
9001:2015.  In contrast the methodology provided by the framework leads the compiler on exactly on how keeping 
records relate to the operations of a department and which records need to be kept.  By means of the proposed 
implementation framework, ISO 9001:2015 can be effectively and efficiently implemented.   
5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, ISO 9001 is by far the most widely implemented management system standard from the ISO series.  
Certification has been shown to be advantageous across many industries (Rusjan & Alič 2010).  Despite this, there 
are challenges involved in implementing a sustainable QMS that is well integrated into an organization’s operations.  
This is supported by studies that show that: 
• 
The motivation for seeking accreditation determines the organization’s ability to quantify the benefits gained 
from accreditation (Yeung et al. 2003),  
• 
Superficial implementation of the standard is common among certified companies (Zeng et al., 2007). 
• 
There is evidence of “ceremonial conformity” in the audits of the QMS (Biazzo 2005).    
Despite the barriers being well research, no research could be found on how to address these challenges.  Because of 
the wide implementation base and the lack of a means to address the known challenges pertaining to ISO 9001 
implementation, finding a more effective means of integrating ISO 9001 into the operations of an organization in a 
sustainable way, will have major benefits across many industries.   
From a South African point of view, there is still a lack of literature on ISO 9001 within both the public and private 
sector.  This is despite a growing number of ISO 9001 accreditations.  This study is therefore particularly add value 
to this context. 
This study proposes an alternative implementation method for ISO 9001:2015 by using knowledge transfer best 
practice as basis for the development of an implementation framework.  In addition it promotes internalization by

means of the incorporation of the process approach as the centre point for the framework.  The process approach 
effectively models the operations of a departments.  Subsequently, the framework was then set up to lead the compiler 
through the ISO 9001:2015 requirements, by placing the generic requirements of the standards around the process 
approach in relation to how they pertain to that department’s operations.  In this way, ISO 9001:2015 requirements is 
effectively communicated and can subsequently sustainably be implemented. 
The proposed implementation framework stands to be of benefit to organizations that are seeking ISO 9001 
accreditation or that are already maintaining an accreditation.  In addition it will contribute to the current body of 
knowledge by assisting in closing the gaps in literature on overcoming barriers to sustainable ISO 9001 
implementation.

Abstract 
The 5S technique is a powerful and effective lean improvement tool which can be applied to any 
organization to reduce waste, increase efficiency, and organize the workplace. The purpose of this paper 
is to report on the research work conducted on implementation of 5S technique in a Mechanical 
Engineering workshop at University of Johannesburg with an aim to improve efficiency, quality and 
productivity; reduce abnormalities and wastages; and enhance overall performance. In a case study where 
unorganized arrangement of everything such as improper storage form, misplaced and incorrectly stored 
tools, and haphazard placement of unnecessary equipment and materials, the 5S technique has been 
implemented. A time study and work measurement techniques were used to measure how long it takes to 
look for a single item before and after implementation to evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation. 
This case study makes use of pictures from before and after implementation of the Ss, observations of 
time interval for searching a single tool using time study, as they relate to workplace organization and 
efficiency respectively. Increased efficiency and productivity, organized workplace, and elimination of 
abnormalities resulted as major outcomes of the implementation of 5S in this study.

1. Introduction
In the history and making of 5S; Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro and Taichi Ohno, developed 5S methodology after they 
made several efforts to minimize processing time for ship production (Chang and Chen 2014). The efficiency and 
improved working conditions in any industry or organization can be achieved easily by implementing 5Ss. 5S is a 
methodology of creating and maintaining a well organized clean, effective and efficient working environment 
(Michalska and Szewieczek 2007). The 5S philosophy focuses on simplification of the work environment, effective 
workplace arrangement and reduction of waste while improving productivity, ergonomics and overall efficiency 
(Patel and Thakkar 2014; Chavan et. al 2017). The educational institutions have been isolated on most implemented 
strategies because they are not considered as complex as the manufacturing and production organizations as they are 
given much attention. To bridge that gap, 5S has been implemented to some service organizations such as food and 
beverage companies, hotels, and hospitals of which it was a great success.  
The machines, tools, equipment, instruments and workplace items/accessories sometimes cause chaotic working 
areas if not properly managed. The department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at University of 
Johannesburg has different settings such as offices, laboratories, workshops as well as classes with different setups, 
layouts and arrangements. Such a big setup and layout variation need engineering and scientific techniques for 
pleasant arrangement of the workplace to avoid abnormalities, minimize fatigue and stress, and improve working 
efficiency. It is therefore recognized that the 5S concept and its implementation can be a major resource for the 
department in that direction. The 5S Japanese terms are namely, Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu and Shitsuke (Gapp et

4. Conclusion 
 
This paper reported some important aspects of implementation and effectiveness of 5S technique in a 
mechanical workshop of University of Johannesburg. The successful implementation of 5Ss has minimized the 
department's abnormalities; reduced idle time and waste; enhanced the work place appearance and efficiency. A 
tremendous improvement in efficiency from 61% (before implementation) to 86% (after implementation) has been 
recorded. Implementing the 5S at the department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering is a success and pave the 
way for future work that targets to improve wherever possible in other laboratories, offices, and workspace for the 
mechanical department. Upon success, it is hoped that this work can further be taken to the whole university.

Abstract 
Energy efficiency of furnace should be based on its ability to conserve heat within the combustion chamber. This 
mainly depends on the design and material selection of the furnace. The coal–fired furnace is common amongst the 
rural foundries in Limpopo province. The coal fired furnace is used to melt aluminium scraps for production of 
cooking three legged aluminium pots commonly used as cooking utensil and sold within the local and national 
communities. The coal fired furnace is used due to its easy to manufacture, to operate and its low capital and 
running costs investment which is suitable for small batch production. However made of a mere superposition of 
two tinned drums,  the current coal fired furnaces  in rural foundries have long melting time ~ 6 hours, due to the 
design and material selected in manufacturing the furnace. This paper presents the analysis of design and material 
components of rural foundries furnaces in South Africa and studies the energy efficiency of the particularly coal 
fired furnace. Technical testing of energy in and output was conducted. Findings show that with a heat loss of 
2929.92 MJ and only 2% energy efficiency the heat loss was one of the main contribution to the experienced long 
melting duration The insufficient supply of oxygen or air into coal fuel also plays critical role in the performance of 
the furnace, since combustion of coal depends greatly on the supply of oxygen or air.  To improve the heat retention 
and the energy efficiency of the coal fired furnace used in the rural foundries, a re-design of the furnace and 
selection of specified new lining materials are the main conclusions.

Introduction 
The greenhouse emission is a topic that has been of increasing important in our society. The majority of the 
greenhouse gas emissions originates from the production and consumption of  energy.  According to (Ghodke, 2012) 
there are two principal ways of reducing gas emissions i.e   by energy efficient production or by decarbonizing 
supply.  Literature has reported on the necessary actions taken to promote the energy efficiency and use of 
renewable energy in response to impact of climate change (Hopwood, 2013). However with all the necessary steps 
take to address the issue around the greenhouse emissions there is still a long way toward achieving safe, reliable, 
affordable and sustainable energy system for the future, therefore energy efficiency has  become vital for 
manufacturing and production companies (Fungtammasan et al., 2017).

Conclusions 
 
The current coal–fired furnace in rural foundry has low energy efficiency which was obtained at 2% this has been 
attributed to poor design of the furnace which permits heat loss through the opening of furnace hub and exhaust by 
radiation. The heat loss on the body of the furnace was attributed to inadequate thin insulating material which was 
unable to contain heat with the furnace. The poor supply of air into the furnace limited the performance of the 
furnace as incomplete combustion was established due to dependent on ambient temperature.  
    
 The recommendation on the improvement of the coal-fired furnace were provided focusing on minimizing the heat 
loss can be by redesign to have an enclosure in the furnace which will include refractory lid with exhaust draft 
which allows minimal amount of heat to be lost through the furnace hub and exhaust. An increase in the thickness of 
the insulation or selecting alternatively refractory lining such as brick will improve the ability of the insulation to 
contain heat within the furnace. In addition, the current furnace does not have adequate air supply to fuel ratio to 
promote good thermal efficiencies of the combustion. The rural foundry coal-fired furnace has great potential of 
improving the energy efficiency which will have the bottom line impact such as increase the productivity, reducing 
melting time, reduce coal usage and fumes.

Abstract 
The advancement of technology has created new opportunities for amateur and auteur in filmmaking. The 
technological innovation is continuously transforming the film industry, thus enabling the application of 
re-imaging and re-engineering in the films to enhance the quality of films. Nollywood, a Nigerian film 
industry, is heavily being impacted by the technological advancement which is using digital technologies 
and High-Definition cameras. This has led to film studios and film companies mushrooming across the 
country and its borders. Presently, Nigeria is considered as one of the most competitive film industry in the 
world, and thus has become an African icon. For Africa, this has greatly resulted in a shared commodified 
culture. This paper discusses the role of technological advancement in the film industry and investigate all 
viable prospects for today’s tech-savvy filmmakers for the development of African cinema.

1. Introduction
Film is an artistic product of science and technology that brings out the filmmaker’s story and fantasies in a motion 
picture. The history of film is based on the technological advancement for quality. According to Wang (2011), the 
Lumière Family is considered as the inventor of film - develop from silent film to sound film, black and white to color, 
followed by wide-screen, digital, huge-screen, and 3D films, even the revolutionary VR film. All these are the products 
of technology in the field of film. Technological developments have revolutionized the film industry - how digital 
technology shaped the movie from the 1960s is the most impressive one as it has also introduced filmmakers to 
globalization which has opened up new markets and strengthened the idea of forming partnerships with other 
countries. 
Nollywood, a Nigerian film industry, is currently recognized as the second largest film producer in the world 
(UNESCO, 2009). The revolutionary potential of the technology (Buckingham et al., 2007) has played a key role in 
facilitating the growth of the film industry through low cost digitalized equipment and multiple distribution platforms. 
In 2013, Nollywood produced about 1844 movies making it a $3.3 billion sector, thus becoming a lucrative industry 
(Bright and Hruby, 2015). The increase of film productions in Nigeria has established the Nollywood as a global 
African powerhouse of cinema (Larkin, 2000). The Nigerian filmmakers are considered as the first and quicker to 
adopt the new technological instruments in Africa, such as video cassettes to produce multiple films at a very low 
cost. The affordability of the new advanced technological filmmaking tools gave Nigerian filmmakers an opportunity 
to produce films that showcased a glimpse of Africa, culture and beliefs to other continents (Onuzulike, 2007).

Figure 2. Comparison of film production (Künzler, 2006; UNESCO, 2009; UNESCO, 2016) 
 
The rise of Nollywood is based on technology which have created employment, for instance there are over twenty-
five plants in the country capable of producing over 500,000 optical discs (Video CDs and DVDs) every day. The 
Nigerian films have also been indirectly branding Nigeria through their productions, thus possibly motivating 
indirectly to indigenous and foreign tourism. Nollywood has created an influx of famous Ghanaian actors, such as 
Van Vicker, Jackie Appiah and John Dumelo. These partnerships have helped Nollywood to strike markets in Ghana 
and other countries, and utilize foreign locations such as Accra, Ghana to shoot their films. To reach huge audience 
base across Africa, the Nigerian filmmakers launched Africa Magic Channel on Digital Satellite Television (DStv) to 
53 countries in 2003, increased more television broadcasting services and Silverbird Cinemas in 2004 in order to 
improve the distribution channels and revenue streams available to Nigerian filmmakers. The introduction of internet 
distribution channel resulted in the launch of iROKO tv’s video streaming platform in 2011 for a formal distribution 
of films to African diaspora.  
 
4. Conclusion  
 
Nigeria stands second as the world’s highest film producing nation in the world. Nigeria has a great potential to grow 
and exceed its current performance. The fact that it has been utilizing all the technological equipment, devices or 
systems effectively shows that it is a very competitive industry. However, there are certain aspects that need to be 
immediately addressed, such as piracy which has resulted from lack of knowledge by filmmakers on international 
marketing skills and how to distribute films. The opening of formal internet websites like Iroko and Netflix that 
broadcast licensed films are some of the mechanisms used to address this problem. Nigerian film industry has the 
potential to develop positively in the future for a next generation of filmmakers.

Abstract 
Distribution is one of the least focused subject in film studies, yet it is the most substantial part of the film 
industry. Over the years it has been experiencing significant technological transformations disrupting many 
traditional models of distribution (broadcasting television, DVDs, etc.) which were profiting most of well-
establish broadcasting service providers and studios. The introduction of digitalization in the distribution 
sector has created a competitive global environment with small returns, scrambling for audience over cable 
televisions and online facilities. This paper investigates the challenges and opportunities in the distribution 
sector of Zimbabwean film industry. Selective stakeholders from Zimbabwean film industry were 
interviewed and their responses were analyzed using thematic encoding. The results indicated that there is 
a need for a clear distribution policy, educational workshops on business management skills in marketing, 
maximization of all available distribution opportunities, and formation of more international film 
distributors’ partnership in order for the industry to establish itself in both local and international market.   
1. Introduction
Distribution is the most significant and the only monetization component in film value chain which can lead to the 
sustainability and development of the Zimbabwean film industry. Once the production of a film is complete, it has to 
reach audience through a process called distribution. In order for a film to be a successful and film industry to sustain, 
there is a need to strengthen and use effective distribution channels. Ever since the circulation and consumption of 
film has been driven by technological innovations, there has been a constant change in the market and audience 
behavior on genre preferences, especially after the introduction of internet. According to Grunenwald (2013), 
academic researchers need to focus more on film distribution sector to create a better understanding of the challenges 
that need to be overawed in order to create a more sustainable film industry.  
The biggest challenge of the Zimbabwean film industry lies not only in the global marketing sphere but also within 
Zimbabwe itself. For decades, the industry has been operating without any proper national film policy to guide the 
film practitioners on how to distribute their films, which legal international agencies to deal with and how to negotiate 
the best deals out of their copyrights. In addition, Zimbabwe has been operating with only one national broadcasting 
television, known as Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC T.V), this has resulted in limited distribution 
channels, low budgets with poor productions (Aboo, 2008). Presently, there has been fewer (< 20) theatrical releases 
of Zimbabwean films which clearly shows the lack of local film distribution within and outside Zimbabwe. According 
to Lobato (2006), distribution is the least theorized and most difficult element of the film industry to research because 
the required information is closely guarded for commercial reasons.

distribution mode has made it difficult for most of the filmmakers to predict and satisfy the wants of local target 
audience as they have a wide choice of films. Other respondents have stressed on the importance of embracing the 
new modes like VOD and finding new ways of taking advantage of both the old and new distribution modes to 
maximize profits. Some of them were concerned about the current state of Zimbabwean economy and how it may 
affect the feasibility of strengthening the distribution modes.   
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendations 
 
The paper identified the distribution challenges that need solutions and presented some opportunities that Zimbabwean 
film filmmakers should not overlook. The Zimbabwean film distribution models has been greatly affected by the lack 
of funds to produce quality films that can be easily distributed both at domestic and international markets. The world 
at large have been utilizing a hybrid distribution model, but Zimbabwe is yet to explore it to the fullest. There has been 
lack of distribution infrastructure in Zimbabwe making it challenging to have a sustainable film industry. Most 
Zimbabwean filmmakers have been relaying on DVD sales but piracy has worsened since past two decades leading to 
most filmmakers experiencing losses. However, the rural areas have been always underutilized and most of the 
filmmakers seem be reluctant on exploring these areas. Most Zimbabwean filmmakers believe that VOD has the 
potential to generate income for them but so far only a few have experienced how this new distribution model work. 
Many voiced out that the government should give filmmakers licenses to open television channels and operate 
independently in addition of providing financial support. The Zimbabwean film industry has to continuously work on 
developing innovative solutions and strategies to solve film distribution challenges and build on opportunities towards 
a sustainable film industry.   
 
6.1 Recommendations to the Film Industry   
 
Table 2 highlights distribution challenges and opportunities of Zimbabwean films, which will assist film filmmakers 
and government in identifying what problems need solutions and what opportunities need to be maximized in order to 
create a sustainable Zimbabwean film industry.

Abstract 
Cities in developing countries are growing at an unprecedented rate. In a recent article by the World 
Economic Forum and United Nations, the Sub-Saharan Africa is emerging as the fastest urbanising region 
with a population expected to be around 1.5 to 2 billion by 2050. It is however unfortunate that these 
urbanisation trends have not been without their hurdles for Africa’s developmental progress. The large scale 
infrastructure deficit in the continent is one of the widely recognised challenges inhibiting the realisation 
of sustainable and prosperous African cities. This paper examines the main issues and challenges 
specifically facing urban public transport infrastructure development in Africa. It also argues that the 
success of African cities in sustainable mobility is without doubt based on their ability to respond effectively 
to rapidly changing urban landscapes and migration trends. The paper also uses the City of Johannesburg 
in South Africa as a case study example to illustrate some of the innovative and progressive urban transport 
infrastructure development initiatives currently being implemented towards spatial transformation and 
sustainable mobility. The paper concludes by setting out, at a high level, a number of strategic pillars around 
which urban transport infrastructure development opportunities can be anchored to respond to both current 
and anticipated challenges thereof.

Abstract 
The study proposed a methodology based on queueing theory for travel time assessment over multiple 
routes with unsignalized traffic junction in tandem network. The work carried out in the study gives an 
approach for best route selection between two points based on minimum traveling time. The queuing 
theories used in the study took the M/M/1 model over the unsignalized junction and evaluated the traffic 
performance on different mean arrival rates of the vehicles. The proposed methodology is analyzed in a 
pilot study with observed data of mean service rates for each of the junctions for all route choices. The 
study can be used as a decision-making tool for formulation of route selecting strategies based on minimum 
traveling time.

1. Introduction
Operations research involves a cumulative study of problem-solving techniques, to improve decision-making and 
efficiency. One of the core concepts of operational research is queueing theory, which is defined as the mathematical 
study of waiting lines or queues. Queues develop when the demand for service exceeds the limit of service that can 
be provided (Shortle et al., 2018).  
With rising population and constantly growing network of road transport systems, there has been a consequent increase 
in the number of vehicles plying on roads. In recent time, the growth in the number of vehicles has surpassed the 
capacity of the road transport networks, leading to frequent traffic congestion and traffic snarls, especially in the major 
cities of the world. Excessive traffic congestion leads to increased travel time, reduced speed of travel, elevated 
pollution levels due to vehicular emissions and greater fuel consumption, with the subsequent rise in the cost of travel 
(Lindsney and Erik, 2001). According to a report published by The Times of India for the year 2017, traffic congestion 
in the four cities of Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Mumbai alone cost the economy Rs.1.47 lakh crores (approximately

The results can also be implemented in crisis situations where one or more junctions are shut down due to unforeseen 
circumstances. In the case of diversions, Table 6 can be used to find the next best option of travel, provided the traffic 
conditions at all other junctions remain unaffected. For example, if the road from junction B2 to B3 has to undergo 
repairs or construction, then at high mean arrival rates of 1100 veh/hr, route α9 and route α5 cannot be used for travel 
anymore. Thus, route α12 becomes the most favorable route of travel.

The work proposed in the study provides a route selection methodology between two locations with number of route 
choices having different junction points and traffic conditions. Taking the parameters of least distance and traffic 
intensity at each of the junction points, various traveling time is calculated for each of the route choices for different 
arrival rates of the vehicles. The proposed study provides a method using queueing theory concepts to formulate least 
travel time for covering a distance in urban traffic situations that can help decision-makers to formulate strategies for 
effective traffic routing. Also, the proposed methodology provides a ranking of best route alternatives in terms of 
minimized time at different arrival rates of vehicles giving a comparative analysis over different route choices. The 
work can be considered for further study with future work related to traffic fuel analysis over different routes, route 
selection over unsignalized as well as a signalized junction, and multi-arrival and multi-server junction model for 
making the study more realistic for real-world implementations.

Sustainability as a Vital Leadership Proficiency 
Eric Amankwa 
University of Johannesburg 
ericamankwa2007@yahoo.com 
Abstract 
This paper presents the case that sustainability should be acknowledged as an important proficiency in 
organisational leaders. Arguably, sustainability requirements have been present in organisations for some 
time, however, sustainability has not usually been expected of leaders themselves. Conversely, the advent 
of new requirements of organisations and its leadership are increasing. Therefore, successful leadership 
will not be solely measured on effectiveness criteria, but gradually on the ethics that leaders exhibit when 
taking on environmental and social initiatives.  In the development of both leadership in organisations and 
individual leaders, the application of a competence framework is prevailing among human resource 
practitioners, portraying a popular move toward conceptualising the attributes that ought to be developed 
in leaders to ensure their effectiveness in organisations. Furthermore, it is argued that if sustainability was 
a proficiency that was incorporated by the leadership of organisations, then leaders would be better able 
to achieve the triple bottom line. This paper proposes that individualised consideration, empathy, 
enthusiasm to serve and modesty are some of the attribute of sustainability proficiency in leadership, 
which would distinguish this style of leadership from other leadership competencies. The paper also 
proposes suggestions for further research on sustainability as vital a leadership proficiency.

Abstract 
Metal Oxide surge arresters play a major role in the protection of electrical devices or equipment from 
lightning and switching surges. These surge protective devices are installed in most industrial, commercial 
and domestic power or data networks and facilities, yet do not always form part of predictive maintenance 
strategy. However, due to the critical importance of devices/equipment or networks protected by these types 
of arresters, condition monitoring of metal oxide-based surge arresters becomes essential practice to ensure 
or guarantee surge protection. A review of commonly-applied techniques for condition monitoring of 
MOSA devices yields the need to develop or/and improve suitable models online and remotely-applied 
monitoring application.  
Keywords  
Metal Oxide Surge Arresters, Predictive Maintenance, Leakage Current Monitoring. 
1. Introduction
Lightning and internal switching events are the main causes of power failures, explosions, fires and prolonged supply 
interruptions in telecommunication, transmission or distribution circuits. Metal Oxide Surge Arresters (MOSA) are 
designed for clamping high magnitude of externally or internally-induced transient overvoltages to levels equal or 
slightly lower than the basic insulation level of equipment or devices under protection. In order to achieve that MOSA 
behaves like a high resistance path (open circuit) when subjected to standard supply voltage and a very low resistance 
(short circuit) when an overvoltage occurs. Besides, it is characterized by a non-linear relation V-I and present a 
dynamic characteristic (frequency dependent) appreciable during the application of fast front surges [1], [2]. These 
overvoltage protection units often experience degradation and eventually failure as a result of several combination of 
factors including, temperature, voltage, moisture and high magnitude surge currents. 
Condition monitoring of MOSA is important as it provides life information on real condition and protection 
capabilities of the arrester. However if a MOSA was to be removed from its location, there would be no immediate 
change to the electrical system, however a large surge event would almost immediately impose destruction to 
equipment, device or network. MOSA should therefore be included in a predictive maintenance strategy. A dedicated 
system is thus required to continuously monitor the operating condition of the metal oxide varistor (MOV)-based 
surge arresters [3], so that systematic maintenance planning can be carried out.

Figure 7: Fernandez and Diaz model 
4. Dynamic behaviour for the discussed models 
 This study shows that the Conventional Model does not represent the dynamic behaviour 
of the varistor, since the current and the voltage peak occur at the same time. Besides, the 
Conventional Model reaches the same voltage peak value for both waveforms (Table 1).  
 The IEEE Model presents a relatively higher error for faster front surges (Table 1). It also 
requires physical data and an iterative method to determine the parameters. The occurrence 
of the voltage maximum before the current maximum was observed in all models, except 
for the Conventional . 
 The results of the Pinceti and Giannettoni model are very accurate. Physical data are not 
needed, nor does it require the use of iterative methods, thus not needing much 
computational effort.  
 The Fernandez and Diaz model also presents good results. The major difficulty associated 
to using this model is determining the inductance value, which is related to curves between 
the waveform time to crest and the residual voltage. 
 
 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Monitoring of MOSAs is a critical aspect of a predictive maintenance strategy for power systems. In order to perform 
effective modelling of the device, a suitable and accurate model thereof is required. In this paper, six models have 
been reviewed and not all of them are considered sufficient to related studies.  The other models presented are able to 
represent the frequency dependence with some precision. However, there are problems that were found in the analyzed 
models, those problems parameters calculation, residual voltage front surge increasing rate representation, the residual 
voltage peak value and the energy absorption calculation. Even when all the presented models have strong points, the 
most precise model currently available, attending to the proposed criteria in this paper, is the IEEE model.

Abstract 
Employees are the most important resource to any organization. They contributes to the success and 
development of a company to a great extent. Employees are the lifeblood of every organisation. There is a 
major knock-on effect for companies and employee performance when employees struggle financially. The 
core purpose of this study is to explore the effects of financial stress on employee productivity in the 
construction industry. The study is mainly a literature review on employee financial stress and how it affect 
the construction industry. The study revealed factors that contributes to financial stress as overspending, 
lack of budgeting, high debts level, low salary or wages, lack of knowledge about money and poor financial 
behavior. The study also revealed the relationship between financial stress and psychological symptoms, 
behavioural symptoms, physiological symptoms and productivity. The study further revealed employers 
efforts and programmes that can improve the employee financial life. The study contributes to the body of 
knowledge on the subject of the effects of employee financial stress on job performance and productivity 
in the construction industry.

Financial problems, employees, productivity, financial wellness, financial literacy, stress 
1. Introduction
Typically, financial health has been seen as a stand-alone resource, rather than as an essential part of overall well-
being. There is a growing recognition that wellness is holistic and co-dependent; physical, emotional and financial 
health work together, and if one part is missing, this imbalance may also impact the other two. And while financial 
wellness exists at a personal level, a lack of it can also have a big impact on the workplace and society as a whole, 
with a loss of productivity and effectiveness. There is an increasing body of proof that a business suffers when the 
employees are struggling financially. Financial stress is one of the major factors that contributes to poor financial 
wellbeing. Neyber (2016) on the DNA of financial wellbeing revealed that the poor financial wellbeing of employees 
has been estimated to cost UK employers about £120 billion a year in loss of productivity. Productivity is one of the 
most important factors that affect overall performance of construction industry (Gupta and Attar, 2012). Productivity 
will be at apex and blooming in the construction industry when the employee is not under any financial stress and 
problems. Personal financial stress is a growing problem for the workforce. To conduct all the operations of the 
business expeditiously it is imperative that employees must perform well to achieve organisation’s milestones. The 
issue of financial problem is general problem. It does not only affect the poor. “The U.S. Department of Agriculture 
stated that the declining employment opportunities, income instability and eroded purchasing power of U.S. 
households were important issues of families, policy makers, and educators” (U. S. Department of Agriculture, 1988). 
Financial problem of the households have been increasing. Cash (1996) in his study, described the increasing worries 
of household financial matters. He stated that “Many people feel trapped even with two incomes, they don’t have 
enough money or the time. Employees are living in fear of what will happen next” (Cash, 1996). Also, Coping (1996) 
in his research revealed these concerns in that “two-thirds of Americans say they have trouble paying their bills and 
worry about money” (It is expected that the study will contribute to, firstly, an awareness of employees’ problems in 
1548","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

and to reduce company liability. Programs of primary financial management and investment counseling grew during 
the 1990s although “financial illiteracy” is still under situation in the workplace (Cambridge Human Resource Group, 
1994).  
Office of Disability Employment policy (2007) defined employee assistance programs as worksite-based programs 
and/or resources designed to benefit both employers and employees. EAPs help businesses and organizations address 
productivity issues by helping employees identify and resolve personal concerns that affect job performance. EAPs 
enhance employee and workplace effectiveness and are a vital tool for maintaining and improving worker health and 
productivity, retaining valued employees, and returning employees to work after illnesses or injuries. 
Major outcomes, claimed from EAP programs included: valued employees were helped and retained, absenteeism and 
turnover was reduced, productivity was improved and employee stress reduced. EAP Contributions according to 
ODEP (2007) are- decreased absenteeism, reduced accidents and fewer workers compensation claims, Greater 
employee retention, fewer labor disputes and significantly reduced medical costs arising from early identification and 
treatment of individual mental health and substance use issues. 
Employee assistance programs are constructed upon the premise that an employee’s job performance is negatively 
affected by financial problems, among other types of personal and family problems. “A survey of companies indicated 
that almost half of them sponsored employee assistance programs for their workers and that financial problems were 
listed by 81% as one of the problems most often covered” (Wall Street Journal, l987).  
Breuer (1995) revealed that financial education programs help employees to be more productive and less stressed at 
the workplace. A study conducted by Bergmark (1989) revealed that an effortlessly accessed, assistance program 
assisted employees to solve problems effectively and efficiently. A survey of the Employee Benefit Offices, at 47 of 
Virginia’s largest corporate employers, based on number of employees per job site, revealed that 67% of the companies 
offered counseling for financial problems (Garman et al, 1989). These firms encompassed manufacturing, banking, 
and other service sector firms. Three-fourths of the firms indicated that employees had responded favorably to the 
availability of financial counseling services. Positive outcomes resulting from such programs, reported by 38% of the 
firms, included improved attendance and better on-the-job attitude toward work.  
Financial counseling programs address financial problems and concerns of employees which result to improved 
benefit packages, decreased unrest or conflict on the job and with management, reduced stress and the possible 
resulting breakdown of physical and mental health. Additionally, reduce confusion in selecting various company 
benefits related to insurance, savings and investing, pensions and retirement plans can reduce employee financial 
concerns. Also, reduced confusion related to tax laws can also lessen stress with the ultimate objective-improved 
productivity. The focus of EAP is on productivity, to assist employees with financial problems. “To eliminate financial 
problems, employees must realize that personal money management is lifelong process because their needs change as 
they progress through the financial life cycles; they must also be aware that no individual or institution can completely 
manage their money for them” (Tagtmeier, 1987). 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The employee worries over financial problems is critical due to increased financial pressure that has led to financial 
stress. To improve productivity related behavior and the implementation of employee assistance programs are needed 
by individual and in times of economic prosperity as well as downturn since there will always be those experiencing 
financial stress. 
The review of literature has revealed a very limited amount of research to date and a lack of precision tools for 
determining the effect of financial stress upon productivity in the construction industry. Research tools need to be 
developed and refined to assess the specific education and counseling that will benefit the employees in the 
construction industry.  
Research is needed to identify the impact of financial stress on productivity, performance and the employee morale in 
the construction industry. Research is needed to better document the cost/benefit of financial counseling programs to 
improve productivity, employer employee relations, retention, and well-being.

Abstract 
Cities worldwide have been battling to adopt and implement better ways of addressing a wide range of 
spatial development challenges towards sustainable economies through various policies and legal 
instruments. Interestingly, much attention has been placed upon transport planning as part of transforming 
cities and thus urban public transport has become a cornerstone given its potential of integrating and 
commuting large communities to desirable destinations. In developing worlds very few but albeit 
interesting and successful initiatives are notable leveraging socio-economic and environmental benefits. 
This is particularly so in South African cities with City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality leading; 
introducing Bus Rapid Transit Systems through corridors of freedom project (COF). Using secondary data 
generated from intensive literature review and primary data collected through survey & observations within 
COJ regions, this study investigated the extent to which BRTS has implemented SPLUMA Principles in 
COJ. The findings revealed that BRTS if well planned is crucial for the ambitious spatial visions of 
SPLUMA. With its increasing technological usage (smartcard system, surveillances and upcoming 
Vayamoja App) the BRTS (Rea Vaya) proved to be on the right path. It is hoped that this work may prompt 
further study and help in understanding its praxis and theoretical application.

1. Introduction
There is no denying that BRTS practices have gained popularity worldwide and have increasingly become at the fore 
front of scholarly attention. This kind of urban development have advocated for densified and compact cities supported 
by various other nodes. This provision however, seems to be a challenge in developing economies due to an increased 
individual vehicle ownership which in turn creates a competition among other modes (Pucher & Kurth, 1996).  In a 
similar way, urbanization subsequently fuels this.  As a response, Cervero (2013) emphasized the need to plan for the 
imperative challenge of public transport through corrective and reactive interventions that deal with the growth forces 
unleashed by modernization. This is why most municipalities in developing countries have provision of public 
transport as one of their priority in the task of urban planning. The City of Johannesburg (COJ) is one of no exception. 
This paper highlights how Bus Rapid Transit system (BRTS) is performing on Spatial Planning and Land Use 
Management (SPLUMA) development principles within the COJ jurisdiction. For this study, the purpose was to see 
whether the public transport provided herein satisfies the development principles that apply to spatial planning, land 
development and land use management as indicated in Chapter 2 (section 7) of SPLUMA Act 16 of 2013 given that

Abstract 
This paper addresses the multiple households’ residential load scheduling problem through the scheduling 
of typical home appliances while incorporating more realistic aspects. The objective of this study is to 
generate an optimal load schedule of home appliances for ﬁve households with leveled load profile while 
considering the consumers’ preferences. A myriad of variants of the problem has been addressed in 
literature, however, studies considering minimization of both electricity cost and peak load while 
considering the consumers’ inconveniences in a multiple-household environment have not received 
sufﬁcient attention. Ignoring coordination between multiple households while solving the residential load 
scheduling problem could result in unplanned synchronization of peak loads of the individual consumer, 
which could result in an unmanaged aggregated peak load. Reducing the overall peak load is an important 
goal for all the actors in the power grid. This study, therefore, proposes a multi-objective mixed integer 
programming optimization model under a time-of-use electricity tariff. The objective function minimizes 
the weighted score of three terms: the electricity cost, the schedule inconvenience, and the peak load over 
the day. A case study of ﬁve households shows that the proposed schedules with coordination between 
multiple households could realize a significant reduction in the aggregated peak load.

1. Introduction
Electricity demand is increasing exponentially all over the world, and especially in Africa. For example, the grid peak 
load follows an increasing pattern with growth of 37% from 37,500 MWh in 2017 to 61,596 MWh in 2030 (Eskoma). 
Furthermore, Statistics South Africa reported that households using electricity as the main energy source for cooking 
and lighting in South Africa has increased by around 30% from 1996 to 2016 (Statistics South Africa, 2016). The 
residential sector represented around 20~25% of South Africa’s total load and is a significant contributor to both the 
morning and evening peak periods, resulting in an overall national load factor of 72% (Eskoma). 
Demand Response (DR) is becoming a well-known approach that can help utility companies and customers to reduce 
peak load (Siano, 2014) by managing and scheduling the electricity demand. Effective DR implementation involves 
planned cooperation between utilities and consumers to adjust load curve resulting in beneﬁts to both the utility and 
consumers. Additionally, it has been proven that DR can reduce energy consumption signiﬁcantly in residential sector

4. Conclusion 
This paper addressed the multi-objective and multiple households load scheduling problem of typical home appliances 
while incorporating more realistic aspects. The objective of this study is to generate optimal load schedule of home 
appliances for multiple households with leveled load profile while considering the consumer’s preferences and 
convenience level. A mathematical model is proposed with the objective of minimizing the weighted score of three 
terms: the EC, the IC and the EPL. A case study showed that individual consumers could realize almost the same EC 
and the convenience level. However, the “With Coordination” approach could eliminate the overall EPL significantly. 
The proposed model schedules the appliances with coordination between multiple households could reduce the overall 
EPL by around 17%, 30% or 11% based on the weighting factors combination.

Adaptation and speed: Key reasons to adopt agile project 
management within the IT industry

Abstract 
In the fast-paced world of changing customer demands nourished on the internet, organizations seek to gain 
competitive advantage through flexibility and timely delivery of goods to the market. These rapid changes 
make traditional project management methodologies less practical and real. Considering that the 
information and communications technology industry is one of the significant sectors in terms of revenue 
and investment in South Africa and the world at large, there was a need to move along with these changes 
at a sustainable pace to beat the increasing global competition. This leads to the birth of agile project 
management which began in the software development sector but is spilling into all industries. This paper 
explores how agile project management affects the speed of delivery and the organization’s adaptability to 
the needs of the market. The research is based on the data collected by an independent management 
consulting firm in 2017 across 276 practitioners in the South African IT industry. The results of the survey 
show that most people adopt agile project methodologies with the hope of achieving a fast delivery to the 
market and acquiring flexibility for robust design. The results further show that when agile methodologies 
are adopted, it is possible to flexibly adapt to the market but the increase in speed is not significant for most 
of the practitioners. They also realize unexpected benefits like improved project visibility and increased 
morale. Agile must be strategic, ensuring goal congruence within the organization. It is recommended that 
organizations follow closely the agile frameworks and principles rather than chase instant benefits.

1. Introduction
We are in the information age. The growth and development in the Information Technology (IT) industry is at its peak 
and its growth is not continuing apace either.  It is worth noting that between 1995 and 2014 around the world, 
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Global sector report shows that the main force behind this growth 
is the ICT services sub-sector which includes computer-related activities and telecommunications (KenResearch 
2017), which contributes 73% (Dutta,Mia 2011). The IT sector is a major employer across the whole world. This 
sector is valued at 4 trillion US dollars (cloudcomputing-news, 2018) which makes it one of the important industries 
in the world. This also means that its market share is very broad. The IT sector is inter-linked to all kinds of industries 
across the globe, so this also means that a large population around the globe depends on the IT sector. The IT sector 
is of paramount importance to the development of the world because it affects all industries including health, financial 
sector, security, transport and all projects. As of 2013 there were 9400 IT related organizations in South Africa which 
is continuing to grow (MICTSeta, 2013). 
This research examines why IT companies are turning to agile project management (agile PM). This study also 
examines if the IT companies are meeting their expectations after implementing agile project management and why 
some of the expectations are not reached.  The aim of the study is to identify the key reasons why IT businesses are 
adopting agile project management. The results of this research will help organizations especially within the IT 
industry to be informed about the benefits of agile project management.

From the concept of speed companies must focus on faster reaction to market than faster completion of projects. This 
means they must react to the needs of the market quickly other than focus on peed of project completion which can 
compromise quality. Agile must be strategic hence they must not focus on short-term goals. 
 
Companies are also encouraged to foster the agile culture into their organizations so that they may be able to use agile 
on a day to day basis which brings continuity and, in the end, enhances speed due to constant use hence familiarity. 
Changing organizational culture may also including changing people’s life or way of life (Knipe 1999). 
The main reason for adopting agile PM management must be customer satisfaction because it is basis of agile PM 
development.  Companies are therefore encouraged not to follow profit motives only but to meet the needs of the 
customer. Agile is there for more customer engagement.  
 
Before implementation of agile PM methodology companies must try to introduce change management into the 
company with this can be done by hiring a change management practitioner. The general resistance to change has 
made Agile methods to be hard to use in project, agile is highly related to change hence resistance to change is more 
like resistance to agile PM which focus on frequent product change to meet the changing priorities of the market.  
Companies must also investigate agile PM Critical Success Factors and focus on them so that they may be able to 
successfully implement Agile Project Management into their organizations.   
 
The results show that they are not reaping full benefits as compared to successful companies in developed countries. 
Hence the problem might be with the implementation of the methodology. Other ways for successful implementation 
can be Agile Training at all levels in the project team. 
7. Recommendations for future research  
Further studies on adoption of agile project management by other enterprises outside the IT industry is recommended 
to increase the value and generalizability of the research. This is because Agile Project Management is lagging in 
other industries while its adoption in the IT industry is largely overwhelming. Much study must be done on why the 
Adoption is slow in other industries other than the IT Industry. It is valuable to have more representation of other 
provinces to counter against culture factors, since South Africa is a very diverse country. Hence, a wider geographical 
distribution of the participants is recommended.  
 
8. Conclusion 
The ever-changing customer demands require a methodology that can assists the companies to keep up with these 
changes without affecting the quality of services but on the contrary make the organization flexible to changes. 
Traditional project management are too rigid hence they make it difficult for companies to respond to changes in the 
market. To keep up with the market companies are adopting agile project management which is more flexible and is 
modernised to meet the demands of the market while the market is evolving. 
 
For successful implementation, the organisation must stick to the principles of the agile PM which are easy to 
understand and simple to follow. At the same time, they must keep up with the basic processes if they want to 
implement agile PM. Without basic processes agile PM can lead to chaos (Stare, 2013). Furthermore, organisations 
must not dump the basic project management principles when adopting agile PM but they must combine them with 
agile PM principles because they do not oppose each other but they actually complement each other. The agile PM 
methodology must be adopted bit by bit to give the whole team time to adapt to the methodology. 
 
Through the figures from the survey and the literature review, agile PM is not a simple practice of running projects 
without planning, but it is a whole new philosophy that needs thorough analysis and understanding before it is adopted. 
If agile PM is well planned and implemented well it has many benefits that include flexibility to the market, faster 
market response, improved productivity, improved quality of service and increased visibility of the project. The study 
shows that the most realized result of agile PM is the adaptability of a company to the rapid markets hence it proves 
that agile PM can help organisations to be flexible to any possible changes in the market. Agile PM has penetrated the 
IT industry but it’s yet to find its feet in other industries, whether it is South Africa or abroad. Studies could be 
conducted to see why it’s not penetrating faster in the other industries.

The construction industry is an essential contributor to the economic growth of many countries. In the 
construction industry, construction performance is the measure of the quality of projects delivered to 
clients. The performance is greatly influenced by various issues in South African construction industry. 
This paper is aimed at reviewing previous literature on factors influencing construction performance and 
methods of improving construction performance in South African construction industry. Some of the 
factors influencing construction performance are deprived workmanship with ineffectiveness of 
contractors, construction method, time management, inappropriate planning, scarcity of labour and 
materials, lack of resources; small stage of construction leadership ability; increase of material prices; lack of 
extremely knowledgeable and competent workers. However, the findings from extensive review from previous 
researchers of related literature are cross- sectional. Based on the previous researchers, it was discovered 
that such factors are varies from one aspects to others. It was concluded that, for a proper measurement of 
construction performance to be accomplished, all the factors influencing construction performance should 
be earnestly observed.

Abstract 
This paper is on the design of automated peanut butter making machine for a developing economy which targets small 
scale farmers. Many developing countries are still using traditional methods in making peanut butter for example 
pestle and motor while others are using hand operated machines which are laborious and slow. The demand of peanut 
butter is increasing but machines are manually and expensive therefore the production rate of peanut butter is low in 
developing economy. If peanut butter peanut is taken in small proportions chances of chronic diseases are reduced 
and also due to high proportion of carbohydrates in peanut butter there is gain in weight. There are three types of 
forces when crushing solid food namely shear, impact and compression. Rittinger, Kick and Bond laws are used to 
determine amount of energy needed in size reduction of solid food. . After careful analysis of current peanut butter 
making machines and thorough study, a solution was developed that is efficient, safe and affordable The machine 
grind 50-56kg per hour with minimum human involvement since the machine automatically stop if all peanuts in the 
hopper get exhausted. Power required to grind peanuts is approximately 1.01kW.

current flowing and the machine stops. 
 
Figure 4. How the system will work with automation 
5. Recommendations and conclusion 
The purpose of this project was to design automated peanut butter making machine. The machine was successful 
designed and all the objectives were met. As compared to other existing machines, the machine is almost 
affordable to almost all small scale farmers that are in the business of making peanut butter. Also the machine 
serves time when making peanut butter since the machine can be operated while doing other jobs and the control 
system regulate the amount peanuts entering into the machine. To reduce costs and supporting local business 
locally available materials were used to during designing. All types of peanuts can be grinded using this machine 
and also it cushion the vibration hence the machine is stable. When there is no electricity the machine can be 
operated manually hence there is continuous production of peanut butter. 
 
5.1 Safety and precautions 
There are rotating components on the machine for example belts and pulleys, maximum care is needed when operating 
the machine for example removing of loose clothes. The machines also operates at high voltages therefore wiring 
should be regularly checked and replaced. In case of emergency there is an emergency button with a red color mainly 
and after pressing this button the machine automatically stops. 
5.2 Maintenance 
After using the machine, plates and auger should be disassembled for cleaning with running water to avoid 
contamination of peanut butter .Moving parts are prone to  wearing for example pulley and plates , therefore  these 
parts should be inspected and replaced. Blanching of peanuts is difficult and laborious to small scale farmers hence 
there is need of mechanism that blanches peanuts and blowing out removed materials together with foreign particles 
and then blanched peanuts are grinded. Manually packing of peanut butter requires a lot of labor, contaminates peanut

Abstract 
 
The fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0 drives industrial automation of plant’s processes to 
enhance productivity. The fast pace growth of technology and maturity of plant’s processing technology have 
actually triggered the fourth industrial revolution. Advanced systems under Industry 4.0 architecture comprises 
of hardware, software, electronics, machines and equipments, all working together in a synchronised manner to 
meet the common organisation goals. Industry 4.0 affirms the ability to build dynamic capabilities in an 
organisation and beat market competition. The use of Industry 4.0 tool application is complex and requires 
additional knowledge and special skill sets, thus lowering the interest of companies towards adoption of Industry 
4.0 projects. There is hardly any evidence in existing literature on the technology maturity level of Industry 4.0 
tool. Also there is limited literature on smart factory task and Industry 4.0 technology fit. The current study aims 
to eliminate the void in existing literature by integrating Industry 4.0 Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and 
Industry 4.0 Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model. Using samples drawn from South African companies the 
theoretical framework can further be statistically validated and new insights can be generated.

1. Introduction 
The fourth industrial revolution has advanced manufacturing systems and use cyber physical systems to drive 
automated industrial process (Sung, 2018). Industry 4.0 is a relatively new concept which evolved in Germany 
and gradually gaining popularity globally (Bag et al., 2018). The opportunity to apply industry 4.0 technological 
subsets for business logistics optimization is the focus of most organisations worldwide. Van Looy et al. (2011) 
opined that logistics practitioners frequently neglect the difference between maturity and capability. Business 
logistics cannot achieve excellence without gradually improving the maturity and capability of processes 
(Telukdarie et al., 2018). Industry 4.0 technological maturity is still unknown and is the main focus of this research 
study. The current study aims to use integrated Industry 4.0 Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Industry 
4.0 Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model as the theoretical lens to understand the Industry 4.0 underlying mechanism 
and assess the current maturity level. 
 
2. Research Propositions 
The research propositions of the current study are derived from review of extant literature and discussion with 
industry experts. Smart factory task involves automation and digitisation enabling end to end business integration. 
Executing these tasks require high end technologies which must perfectly fit in the current organisation system. 
Therefore selection of right technology set would depend upon the nature of tasks and further lead to successful 
adoption of Industry 4.0 projects. Therefore, research team hypothesize: 
H1: Smart factory task characteristics have a positive influence on Smart factory task- Industry 4.0 technology fit 
 
Smart factory tasks in a manufacturing setting would involve developing a plant control network to operate the 
machines automatically, manage flexible production lines, optimize resource usage, and use RFID tags for 
packaging and dispatching. There are multiple Industry 4.0 tools including Real time yield optimization; Routing 
flexibility; Machine flexibility; Remote monitoring and control; Predictive maintenance; Augmented reality for 
MRO; Human-robot collaboration; Digital performance management; Automation of knowledge work; In-situ 3D 
printing; Real time supply chain optimization; Batch size; Statistical process control; Advanced process control; 
Digital quality management; Data driven demand prediction; Open innovation; Concurrent engineering; Rapid 
experimentation and simulation; Remote maintenance; Virtually guided self service; Smart energy consumption 
and Intelligent lots. Successful accomplishment of smart factory tasks requires right selection of Industry 4.0 tools 
and proper application in the business environment. Therefore, research team hypothesize:

4. Conclusion 
In this era of globalization and heightened competition every organization aims to optimize business activities not 
only to meet customer commitments but also resources optimization, costs reductions and business sustainability. 
The fourth industry revolution, popularly known as Industry 4.0 drives digitalization and smart systems. Industry 
4.0 has the potential to optimize the protracted and complex global business logistics chains. The current study 
basically aims to eliminate the void in existing literature by integrating Industry 4.0 Technology Acceptance 
Model (TAM) and Industry 4.0 Task-Technology Fit (TTF) model. All fifteen hypotheses are supported based on 
the sampling done in South African context. Managers need to understand I4.0 tool functionality and smart factory 
task characteristics to develop the I4.0 implementation strategy and fit smart factory task-. Understanding I4.0 
tool functionality will help managers to change the attitude of fellow workers towards actual application of I4.0 
tools. 
 
4.2 Unique contributions 
The scientific contribution of this research study is the proposed theoretical framework and its statistical validation 
in context to the South African manufacturing context. The study is grounded upon TAM-TTF theory and the 
findings can be helpful for practitioners and policy makers. 
 
4.3 Future research directions 
Future research directions can focus in the following areas:- 
• 
Impact of I4.0 enabled technologies on the global manufacturing networks 
• 
Managing supply chain risks using I4.0 technologies in VUCA business environment 
• 
Using I4.0 technologies for business logistics optimization in a circular economy 
• 
Integrating I4.0 and Circular economy concept to do facility planning 
• 
Building global supply chain network using I4.0 technologies in remanufacturing context 
• 
Managing talents and building HR capabilities to fit I4.0 in the organisation

Abstract 
Transport remains connected to our indigenous habitat, wellbeing and monetary thriving which rely upon 
good transport frameworks that provides effectiveness, comfort, fairness as well as affordability. Public 
transport is often framed as key component of building sustainable cities. Nonetheless, present estimations 
recommend that transport development is unjustifiable. Transport intimidates the social, economic, and our 
environmental future. Modifying as well as overseeing patterns of transport shows a critical issue which 
necessitates collaboration from participants’ at all governmental spheres. The paper presents a critical 
literature review of the relationship between public transport and sustainability. The paper contributes to 
transport domain by identifying the key problems associated with sustainability of transport based on the 
perceptions and discussions of significant literature on transport. The attention is on connection amongst 
sustainable transport division and the sustainable development within South African setting. Outcomes 
demonstrate that the concept of sustainable transportation has received recognition from the globe and 
improvement of sustainable transport is evident around the city. This work concludes that sustainable 
transportation is still a long process for developing countries, as it provides a progression of proposals that 
are intended to upgrade the execution of the Johannesburg transport development and design method, with 
suggested changes for moving transportation improvement to a sustainable motivation.

1. Background
In this century, both the private and public transportation divisions are facing difficulties due to an expansion in car 
possession as well as the suburbanization of the residences and firms in the ecosphere. Previously, transportation was 
revolved around focal regions of urban communities where work densities and high populace empowered constant 
administrations, high inhabitance rates and numerous courses (Vaz & Venter, 2012). Todes (2012) state that as 
development is scattering to country domains from the urban zone, public transport experiences fundamental 
challenges, to expand services with the end goal of delivering high quality service to commuters and to coordinate 
rural administration with metropolitan administration. 
As indicated by Yusuf and Allopi (2010), the idea of Bus Rapid Transit System started in 1937 in Chicago, be that as 
it may, the full system was just actualized in 1974 in Curitiba, Brazil. The first system in Brazil was worked in 1974 
in the city of Curitiba by the mayor, architect Jaime Lerner, and turned into the primary BRT on the planet with the 
objective to give amazing rail travel administration to clients and at a practically identical cost (Wright & Hook, 2007). 
Pirie (1992) likewise includes that Curitiba's prosperity motivated the execution of comparable plans in excess of 100 
urban communities around the globe, including the Brazilian urban areas of Brasília, São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Rio 
de Janeiro, Manaus, Goiânia, Porto Alegre Aracaju, Recife and Salvador.

as per Sandra within the city are improving access to employment opportunities to individuals who are faced with 
unemployment. TODs happen along significant transport streets because of the improvement of the network 
transportation (Ndebele and Ogra, 2014). Within the city this comprises of student accommodation, for example, the 
South Point accommodations, and in addition infrastructure investment with patching up of city structures. A result 
of politically-sanctioned racial segregation spatial arranging is having numerous individuals who were compelled to 
live far from urban centers. Rea Vaya is improving majority of the conditions that were brought about politically-
sanctioned racial segregation city structure, through bringing individuals who were barred in the past once more into 
the city. From a social point of view the Rea Vaya has brought individuals from various zones together, furnished 
them with the chance to drive to the city and brought individuals closer to financial openings. The above note being 
said, it is crucial to be aware of the lack of access to Rea Vaya to certain individuals within the city. Be that as it may, 
there are a few stations to which travelers may reach for Rea Vaya. Notwithstanding the aim for this framework to be 
in walkable distances from commuters’ work place/home, it isn't generally the occasion. Sandra emphasized be that 
as it may, the municipality is moving in the direction of the improvement of a coordinated transport framework which 
was declared by the Minister of Transport in June, 2013. The approach of an integrated transport system would connect 
the distinctive transport modes, resulting in effective movements within the city. Johannesburg does not gloat a 
completely coordinated transport framework along these lines integration ought to reach out past methods of transport 
and ought to incorporate coordination in scheduling and transport fares. 
8. Conclusions & Recommendations 
 
The city of Johannesburg is still working towards achieving transit oriented development. Be that as it may, the 
strategy that the city has around the improvement of the corridors of freedom gives chances for transit oriented 
advancement with blended land use planning. The method of reasoning for the improvement of the BRT framework 
is to give an accessible, protected, dependable type of transport to the communities (McCaul & Ntuli, 2011). It has 
been in this investigation that the framework currently isn't open to the larger part of communities in the city. The 
Phase1b was introduced during the year 2013, and intended to attract more individual from different zones to use 
public transport, for example, Auckland Park to the down town area. Lack of accessibility is another reasons a number 
of individuals still utilize their private vehicles to move around; in any case, workers who can't manage the cost of 
having private cars are then compelled to using informal transport, for example, the taxis which are seen as more 
available compared to the BRT Rea Vaya. This system has resulted in various difficulties for the private car users as 
well as taxi business. With the conducting of this investigation the Rea Vaya system had been discovered to be 
unreachable to the dominant part of the communities within the city. Even though the future strategy of the city 
demonstrate the BRT Rea Vaya expansion to all zones around the city, the framework still remains inaccessible 
compared to informal taxis. To be able to attend to these issues it is important to integrate the diverse methods of 
transport. All together for this system to be cost effective, it is important for the municipality to adopt on friendly 
integrated fare prices as recommended by Sandra. It can make the system reasonable thus addressing the necessities 
of the less privileged. The city needs to gain from the achievement and disappointments of the BRT frameworks in 
the other nations where it has been a success. Maybe the Rea Vaya Management could watch best routine with regards 
to other transport frameworks in Johannesburg, for example, the Metro Bus and Putco and plan an installed charge 
installment like that utilized by Metro Bus. The Putco and Metro Bus were regarded as an effective installment 
technique by members as passengers would only pay their fare on the transport than having to make cards at the 
station. These buses have been working in the city for a long time, the newly introduced BRT Rea Vaya can gain from 
the achievement and disappointments of these buses and adopt on them to enhance this framework.

Abstract 
Nowadays, companies compete with each other for better service to their customers and this is especially 
true for international companies who face global opposition. One of the most basic challenges these 
companies face is the queuing problem. As an example, there is a giant retail company serving more than 
400 stores in 15 countries with more than 180 million individual sales annually. These sales are variable 
for each day as well as each hour within the day with an over-all average of 700 units sold per minute. In 
this paper, we developed the capability to run different scenarios to solve this queuing problem based on 
the unique data of each shop. Taking assumptions into consideration, different scenarios are developed to 
better serve customers. A discrete-event simulation model is constructed using SIEMENS Tecnomatix 
Plant Simulation software. The model is set up so that it can dynamically be created based on input data 
and automatically optimize an objective function based on limiting variables. These simulation models 
determine the number of cash registers which should be in the store as well as when they need to be 
manned.

Abstract 
An increasing global and African population has brought with it social ills and food insecurity. Due to 
these social problems, it has become increasingly important for farmers to innovate how they conduct 
farming activities in a way that allows them to produce more and better crop yields. Focusing on 
Namibia, a common problem related to farming is inconsistent irrigation water supply. The objective of 
this paper is to explore solar powered irrigation systems as a possible solution to provide sustainable 
irrigation water supply. Preliminary work was completed on five-hectares of Farm Lynkloof, Namibia in 
preparation to install a solar irrigation system. The irrigation system uses solar photovoltaic (PV) 
technologies to pump water for irrigation. Crops will be put under cultivation and water will be supplied 
by two irrigation systems; drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation. The paper, through literature, analyzed 
the performance characteristics of solar irrigation systems and found that these systems are much cheaper 
to use than grid electricity and present a sustainable source of year-round irrigation water to increase 
agriculture productivity.

Method  
The results of this study are derived from an analysis of existing literature. After an extensive review of solar 
irrigation literature, conclusions were reached and recommendations made towards implementation. This paper also 
adopted a case study approach using qualitative methods of data collection.  
 
3.1 
Background of Case 
 
Farm Lynkloof in north-western Namibia measures a total of 5000 hectare and is engaged in large-scale cattle 
farming. The farm is owned and managed by an all female staff of a mother and her three daughters. Of late they 
have decided to venture into soybean farming, using a solar-powered irrigation system. Land has been set aside for 
this venture but before the project can be implemented on a larger scale, a trial operation will be set up on land 
measuring five hectares. 
  
Water analysis and soil tests conducted on the farm determined the feasibility of cultivating on the identified portion 
of the land. This physical testing also ascertained the appropriate location to construct the storage dams and install 
the system as well as to plot the proposed layout of the cultivated land. A portion of land was identified, cleared and 
prepared for soybean cultivation.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. 
Findings  
 
The findings from the literature review reveal that solar irrigation systems are more economically and 
environmentally feasible than diesel-powered systems and other conventional irrigation systems. Solar systems have 
low maintenance costs, low operation costs and no fuel costs. Solar irrigation systems use water optimally and 
reduce the physical involvement of the farmer because they are operated remotely. These systems increase the 
productivity of farmers. The project findings, based on tests conducted on the actual farm, reveal that the portion of 
land allocated for the irrigation system is ideal for the installation to commence.  
 
 
 
5. 
Conclusion 
 
As the results of the various research indicate, harnessing the sun rays to generate electricity is a much cheaper 
exercise then using grid electricity. The use of solar irrigation systems with solar pumps is equally a more cost 
effective way to irrigate land in comparison to using diesel powered pumps or other conventional electric pumps. In

respect of current available technology, employing solar irrigation is evidently a viable option to increase the 
productivity of farming activities on Farm Lynkloof. Solar irrigation systems offer particular benefits that may be 
appealing to most farmers in that they can be controlled remotely, allow for year round irrigation and when there is 
excess electricity generated, it can be used in other areas of agriculture without incurring additional costs. Solar 
irrigation solves the stated problem of inconsistent supply of irrigation water. In a semi-arid country such as 
Namibia with over 300 days of sunshine in a year, solar irrigation systems are ideal systems to employ in the pursuit 
of farming efficiency and food security.  
 
The main objective of this study - to explore solar powered irrigation systems as a possible solution to provide 
sustainable irrigation water supply was achieved through analysis of literature and observation of key infrastructure 
installation. The scope was limited to one case study of a project under implementation and for one crop, soybeans, 
which somewhat limits the generalisation of the results. The scope can be expanded in future research by 
experimenting with a variety of other crops to give a wider view of the effect of sustainable solar irrigation to 
agriculture productivity.

Abstract 
Wood Fly Ash (WFA) as a waste product from the combustion of wood has been regarded as 
environmental pollution since the generation of wood fly ash is much across the continent predominantly 
in the villages and most cities of the world. In recent time, effective and reliable utilization of WFA has 
been developed in areas like filler, additive, aggregate, reinforcement, water purification, activated carbon 
and most especially construction industries. Its efficiency and performance have been traced to whether is 
in the form of nano-, micro-, and macro- particles. Effects of milling time on WFA has been studied, its 
characterizations using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis, 
X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) has been studied. The SEM magnification was 
set to 1000x at 50 µm and the milling time was carried out at 0, 20, 40 and 60 mins. Digital Vibratory 
Disc Milling Machine (VDMM) rated 380V/50 Hz at 940 rpm was used for the milling. WFA was 
received at micro-sized particles, it was washed with distilled water to remove impurities and dry in an 
oven set at 80° C for 48 hours then sieved according to ASTM standard using 75 µm size. The particles 
size got reduced from 75 µm to average diameter of 200 nm. It was established in the study that the 
duration of the milling affects volume, surface area, particle size, pore size distributions, microstructure 
and some other mechanical properties as well as the morphology of the powder.

Introduction 
Fly ash has been described as the fine particulate by-product that was released into the atmosphere together with 
gases as a result of combustion processes (Gianoncelli et al., 2013; Rose, 2018; Rudolf Hela, 2013). Fly Ashes either 
from municipal solid waste or thermal plant solid waste has been regarded as hazardous waste due to toxic 
contaminations like chloride salts, heavy metals, dioxins as well as some organic compounds present within 
(Mubeen, Buekens, Chen, Lu, & Yan, 2017). Fly ash can be described as fine and spherical glassy particles which 
contain fundamentally of  Al2O3, SiO2 as well as CaO as the main constituent (Feng & Clark, 2011). It was 
established by several researchers that Wood Fly Ash belongs to type F fly ash in the aggregate of Al2O3 + Fe2O3  + 
SiO2 mass exceeds about 70% sum total of fly ash mass (Liu et al., 2018). High levels of macronutrients are 
produced from wood ash made from hardwood than conifers, and it has been reported that silica content is usually 
low (Pitman, 2018; Xu & Shi, 2018). Soil type and application rate are primary effects of wood ash. 
It has been reported by (Hamidi, Man, Azizli, Ismail, & Nuruddin, 2014) that Fly ash has great potentials to be used 
in many applications as a result of its abundance and low cost. Notwithstanding, its larger particle size has resulted

existence of crystalline phases before and after disc milling and mineralogical composition was obtained. The 
crystal phases detected by the XRD are rhombohedral, hexagonal, cubic and tetragonal. After the completion of the 
milling process, the samples of WFA were analyzed by X-ray diffractometer with the following processing 
parameters: Current 40 mA, excitation voltage of 40 kV, scanning rate 0.05 (2Ꝋ/seg), angle 2Ꝋ between 10° and 
80°, respectively. The diffraction pattern at different milling times is as depicted in figure 5. The XRD was acquired 
using copper Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) and kꞵ radiation (λ = 1.39225 Å) and an automatic divergence slit; i.e., an 
irradiated sample length that is independent of the Bragg angles ((2θ) in degree). XRD analysis showed that the 
most dominant Minerals in wood fly ash are calcite (CaC03), quartz (SiO2), Sylvite (KCl), Lime (CaO), maghemite-
Q (Ɣ-Fe2O3), nitratetine (Na(NO3)) and magnetite (Fe3O4) phases.       
 
An XRD has widely been used in the characterizations of the nanoparticle to study the crystal structure, peak, and 
crystallite size. Both milled and unmilled WFA powders are characterized by x-ray diffractometer, X-pert software 
is employed to analyze the phase transformation and structural changes micro to nano particles. XRD sample 
preparation is done by following the standard particle. Figure 5 (a, b & c) showed that XRD of the WFA powder 
before and after VDMM was used. Figure 5c shows the x-ray diffraction pattern of wood fly ash at different milling 
time, it was revealed that at 0 min (unmilled) WFA has the highest peak at 30° (2Ꝋ), this is where the highest 
intensity was attained, followed by 20 mins milled and the least peak was observed at 60 mins milled. Figure 5 (a 
and b) also show a similar pattern of x-ray diffraction but in a cumulative pattern. It is clearly shown in Figure 5b 
that unmilled WFA has the highest peak while 60 mins milled has the least peak. Figure 5a shows the area pattern of 
different milling time with respect to WFA. It was observed that unmilled has the highest peak and 60 mins milled 
has the least peak. It was observed in Figure 5c that at 0 min (unmilled), the intensity is at 51,000 counts, 36,000 
counts at 20 mins, 25,800 counts at 40 mins and 17,700 counts at 60 mins. Origin 8.5 software is used to plot XRD 
graphs from the data acquired from the XRD analysis.  
 
3.0         Conclusion 
In conclusion, from the experiments carried out and the analysis, we, therefore, establish that the particle size of 
WFA has been reduced from micrometer to nanometer through the help of vibratory disc milling machine (VDMM). 
The particle size reduced from 75 µm to an average size of 200 nm after 60 mins milling with VDMM. It was 
observed that there is a reduction in crystallite size and the powder becomes amorphous. The crystalline structure, 
surface texture of the WFA has changed over the period of milling time as revealed by XRD and SEM. The 
nanoparticles of WFA can be useful in reinforcement, filler, activated carbon, water purification, it can also be 
utilized in construction industries as alternative or replacement to cement as well as aggregate in metal, polymer and 
ceramics matrices. SEM analysis revealed the morphology of WFA particles which was observed to be spherical in 
shape and the particle sizes reduce as the milling time increases, and the volume and the of the particles increases 
with increase in milling time.  EDX revealed most elemental compositions that are dominant in WFA as presented in 
Table 2 and the chemical composition has revealed by XRF contained in Table 1. XRD analysis showed that the 
most dominant Minerals in wood fly ash are calcite (CaC03), quartz (SiO2), Sylvite (KCl), Lime (CaO), maghemite-
Q (Ɣ-Fe2O3), nitratetine (Na(NO3) and magnetite (Fe3O4) phases. The crystal phases detected by the XRD are 
rhombohedral, hexagonal, cubic and tetragonal.

Abstract 
Soybean industrialization involves different stages; harvesting, processing, storage, and transportation, 
through which seeds suffer mechanical damages that result in significant economic losses for producers. 
Therefore, to improve production processes it is convenient to identify the damage causes and methods 
used in the industry for its measurement, in order to mitigate losses linked to machinery. The objective of 
this work is to provide the reader an overview of the methods of mechanical resistance analysis of 
soybean seeds during processing. A review of the literature related to methods and properties associated 
with mechanical damage in soybean seeds from harvest to storage was conducted. For this purpose, 51 
bibliographic references from 1971 to 2018 were grouped according to the mentioned stages and 
reviewed according to a set of proposed dimensions of analysis. Finally, it is concluded about similarities 
found in the analyzed works and identified common trends of research in the applied methods.

1. Introduction
Paraguay ranks fifth as one of the largest producers of soybean in the world. Currently, Paraguay has a weighted 
yield of 3.000 kg/ha, similar to Argentina, Brazil, and the United States (Salcedo, 2018). In 2017, 6.128.700 tons of 
soybean seeds equivalent to US$ 2.132 million were exported (BCP, 2017), which represents an amount of US$ 348 
per tonne and whereupon, soybean has become one of the main products of export. For this reason, seeking to offer 
seeds that are suitable for trade or sowing, an agricultural research in the country has begun, aiming to improve 
soybean quality (Tomassone, 2018). Figure 1 shows the evolution of soybean seeds production in Paraguay from 
1996 to 2016 (CAPECO, 2018).

Abstract  
The Business environment in the 21st century has experienced a paradigm shift from what it used to be in 
the Stone Age. The wind of change that is evident in the Nigerian economy has risen exponentially and 
common sense behooves that the trend will continue. Hence, the business needs to be strategically 
planned and developed. There are many planning techniques, tools, and methods, models, frameworks, 
approaches, and methodologies, available to support strategic managers in decision making and to 
maintain better performance. This paper concentrates on strategic planning and three (3) basic strategic 
planning tools: SWOT analysis, PESTLE Analysis and Porter’s 5 industrial Forces and their role in 
stimulating business development in Nigeria. The main objective of the study is to examine the impact of 
strategic planning tools on business development using Abuad Ventures as a case study. Having perused 
relevant literature, the study adopted a survey research design using a simple random sampling technique 
to select 120 respondents from Abuad Ventures located in Ado Ekiti Nigeria. Data were collected and 
analyzed from 106 returned questionnaires using multiple regression and correlation analysis. Findings 
show that strategic planning tools positively and significantly influence business development in Abuad 
ventures. The research, however, concluded that Strategic planning tools have a significant relationship 
with factors responsible for business development in Nigeria. The study, therefore, recommends that 
corporate organizations, government agencies, and business entrepreneurs should embrace and adopt 
Strategic Planning tools for effective decision making and to attain organizational goals.

1. Introduction
Sustainability is said to be a widely accepted term while referring to activities aimed at ensuring eco-
friendliness. Brundtland[1] illustrated the concept of sustainable development as it was first explained in 
the year 1987, through a forum called World Commission on Environment and Development anchored by 
a past minister of Norwegian, called Brundtland. The concept of sustainable development describes the 
development as a process attained suitably, and capable of accommodating present needs and ensuring 
economic advancement, social justice as well as a friendly environment without affecting the chances of 
the upcoming generations in actualizing their own needs. Jeffrey[2] stated that the concept of 
sustainability is to provide answers to negativity in human being’s actions to their economy. These 
actions which are detrimental to the country economic developments were said to be due to population 
growth. Adopting total quality management practices is any business or organization is a prerequisite for 
a well-functioning economy.

well formulated and explains that all the self-determining variables jointly describe variation in the 
nonreliant variable. The individual significance of the variable shows that SWOT exhibits a positive and 
significant relationship with business development. Specifically, a unit change in SWOT index increases 
business development index by 0.269 at 1% level of significance. This analysis indicates that an increase 
in the application of SWOT analysis in the business atmosphere has a positive impact on the business 
development, especially during the recession period. Although other strategic planning tools positively 
influence business development, they were not statistically significant 
5.0 Conclusion 
Strategic planning tools have a significant relationship with factors responsible for business development 
in Nigeria. They are grouped under internal and external factors.  
Examples of internal factors also known as controllable factors include organizational structure, staffing, 
business reputation etc.  
Examples of external factors also known as non-controllable factors include government policies, interest 
rate, taxation etc. In determining the relationship between Strategic planning tools and Business 
Development in Nigerian, consideration must be given to SWOT analysis as a panacea to Business 
Development since the process helps an organization to identify its internal strengths and weaknesses, as 
well as its external opportunities and threats.  
 
The study revealed how instrumental the use of strategic planning tools would enhance business 
development in Nigeria. Hence, Strategic Planning tools should be embraced and adopted by the 
corporate organization, government, and business entrepreneurs.

Abstract 
The aim of the study is to identify factors that hinder productivity within the South African Bank (SAB) 
and to propose solutions to eliminate these factors. The study also aims to develop a system that will 
reduce customer queuing time. The methods that were used in the study were Interviews, the five steps 
model to improve productivity and Observations. The most significant problem that SAB bank faced 
was the queues inside the bank, at a percentage of 38% compared to all other identified problems in the 
bank. The reason for this was that the Festival Mall branch were the study was conducted, is a small 
branch and cannot accommodate all of its customers at peak times. The second impactful problem 
identified was the customer complaint which ranked at 27%. Most of the complaints were based on the 
waiting time on queues as customers would become frustrated while waiting for service. The manager 
was recommended to employ two additional employees at the ATM, two at the online banking one at 
the teller and Three at the queues. These employees would work in shifts to improve employee morale. 
The manager was further recommended to implement a team building network and the introduction of 
social events at the bank to motivate the employees. It was found that productivity of the SAB was 
affected by the staff shortage versus the targets of product sales each month. The waiting time in queues 
was shortened by the introduction of more employees to assist in customer service.

The objective of the study was to conduct the following; to reduce customer queuing time inside and outside the 
bank, to improve customer service, to determine factors that influence the productivity at SAB, and to develop a 
framework to improve productivity. It was found that productivity of the SAB was affected by the staff shortage 
versus the targets of product sales each month. The waiting time in queues was shortened by the introduction of 
more employees to assist in customer service. 
It is important the manager at SAB checks on the employee’s performances on a regular basis and provides 
feedback to the employees so they could help move the lines quicker. The five steps in improving productivity 
assisted in identifying the problems that needed to be corrected to reduce their impact of business productivity 
and performance.

Abstract 
Printing industry is faced increased challenges in relation to digital substitution, lower production rate and 
late deliveries due to the nature of the manufacturing process. Productivity as a ratio of output to input has 
a major role to play in defining the business success. This paper focuses on identifying the causes of low 
productivity and determine the factors for improving productivity in the printing industry. The study 
adopted a qualitative research approach using open-ended questions to guide semi-structured interviews.  
The use of compensation practices and operational tools in order to improve productivity is essential for 
the printing industry to grow. Competitiveness within the industry requires quality and cost effective 
production both nationally and internationally. Internal factors influencing productivity include human 
resources, materials, machines, location, layout, finance, management, technology and process 
management, while external factors include supplier and consumer relationships. The results indicate that 
numerous factors contribute to the decline of productivity such as a lack of skills, layout, material 
management, technology, late order placement by customers, late material supply and poor quality material 
by suppliers together with the use of older machines. This paper is significant in that production managers, 
supervisors, artisans as well as shop-floor employees can use the findings as an analytic instrument to 
resolve productivity rate problems, with a view to improve service quality in printing industries.

Abstract 
Power line inspection serves the purpose of fault finding and regular maintenance strategy, which are 
critical functions from an operational perspective. Modern computational intelligence, decreased cost in 
processing and communication components provides the opportunity to automate these inspections with 
the aim of adopting a predictive maintenance strategy. This paper deals with the design of a Power Line 
Tracking Unmanned Arial Vehicle. The literature review focuses on the navigation of the PLTUAV and 
selects the GPS, Gyroscope, and Accelerometer with correction mechanism done through Kalman 
filtering. The details of the overall system design and each of the subsystems are presented. Preliminary 
test results and analysis of the subsystems are also given.

1. INTRODUCTION
One of the biggest challenges that we, in South Africa, are currently facing is the interrupted supply of power. Theft 
of transmission and distribution cables is among the causes of these interruptions. This becomes a cause for concern 
to staff responsible for maintaining these lines. When the cable is stolen, the initial alert in control room arises from 
tripping of the circuit breaker. A very large portion of the line is taken out of service during this fault and it is 
difficult to localize the point at which the problem has occurred. Customers supplied by this part of the network are 
directly affected and do not have electricity. Field service technicians are dispatched to the area for fault finding. 
This is typically carried through visual inspection and technicians traverse the line to detect problems. Furthermore, 
such inspections become more challenging during adverse conditions such as inclement weather and/or poor 
visibility. This process of inspection and fault localization can take several hours to complete. Once the fault is 
localized, then only can the repair/maintenance work commence. The entire process can take several hours or days 
depending on the time taken to find and fix the fault. 
The proposed Power Line Tracking Unmanned Arial Vehicle (PLTUAV) attempts to minimize the amount of time 
taken to search for the problem. This vehicle is in the form of a drone, does not require any pilot, tracks the power 
line and carries out real-time reporting to the Central Control System (CCS).  
The proposed PLTUAV: 
•
First locates the Power Line with confirmation from the CCS
•
Tracks the Power line to the direction specified by the user, in reference to the point of start

4. Conclusion 
 
Almost all the components of the drone, individually, were tested and were found to be function as per the 
expectation. The only component not tested was the camera module, this will be thoroughly explained on the 
next paper to come. This paper shows how these components were tested and shows the results for the 
components that can be proven that they work. The future work to be done will focus more on the flight control 
of the Drone and the Image processing from the camera module and the integration and results of the full Power

Abstract 
 Assessment of black cotton soil (BCS) steadied with plantain peel powder (PPP) was investigated. BCS 
are said to be an extensive soil and mostly disposed to volumetric changes in moisture, because of the 
influence of mineral montmorillonite present in it, which has an extensive lattice. Various material has been 
used in the past to stabilize BCS but in this study, an attempt was made by stabilizing with plantain peel 
powder (PPP), the BCS was obtained from Yola, Adamawa state, Nigeria. The BCS was stabilized in (0, 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10) % proportion respectively. To determine the Engineering properties of the BCS when 
stabilized with PPP, several laboratory tests, such as Grain Size Analysis, Natural Moisture Content, Linear 
Shrinkage, Specific gravity, Plastic Limit and Liquid Limit, which were all carried out in line with the 
British Standard code of practice. The laboratory preliminary tests on the soil results showed that the 
percentage passing sieve 200 is greater than 35% while Grain Size Analysis gave 26%, Natural Moisture 
Content 14%, Linear Shrinkage 14%, Plastic Limit 20% and Liquid Limit 48 % respectively.  
The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and Unified Soil 
Classification System (USCS) classified the soils as A-7-5 which describe the soil as Clay of High 
Compressibility. The effect of PPP on the engineering properties showed that the LL %, PI % and Ls % 
varied between 48 and 32 for LL %, varied between 28 and 13 for PI % and varied between 14 and 7.5 for 
Ls % for (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10) PPP admixture which indicate that the higher the PPP the lower the clay content 
and the better the engineering properties examined. It was determined that with the mixing of PPP with the 
BCS, it enhances the engineering properties of the BCS sampled. Thus, Plantain Peel Powder (PPP) is 
suitable for stabilizing material for roadworks

Introduction 
Plantain is popularly known as Musa Spp., which are cultivated expansively across the tropical and 
subtropical provinces of the world. Daniells (2003) illustrated in his study that plantain serves as a fruit 
crop which its usefulness and benefits exceeds that of the orange by thirty-seven million, and in terms of 
its yearly trade, its exceeds orange in about ten million ton per year. In his study, he characterized plantain 
as an orange-yellow in color which exhibits a complex tepal of its flower head and its fruit tissue at 
maturity(Daniells, Englberger & Lorens, 2003:). Plantain serves an important food crop which is cultivated 
in the humid tropics of sub-Saharan African. Apart from the local food called ‘Amala’ in Nigeria, plantain 
can be used to produce different varieties of other food, snacks etc. However, the waste from plantain has 
been discovered to be a useful ingredient for the stabilization of many engineering concrete ingredients.

5.0   CONCLUSION 
 
The engineering properties of black cotton from Yola Adamawa State stabilized with PPP has been 
evaluated with a view to study its suitability for road construction pavement materials. Samples of 
uninterrupted soil were collected and subjected to laboratory tests. Results obtained from the laboratory 
tests at the natural state of the sample show that it has a percentage of fine greater than 40%, The soils 
sample were grouped as (CH) and A-7-5 correspondingly. The soil was classified as a Clay of high input 
compressibility. The black cotton soil was stabilized with PPP, the results varied between 48-32% LL and 
20-13% PI respectively at (0-10) % proportion of the PPP admixture addition. The Black cotton soil which 
was stabilized with Plantain peel powder is therefore found suitable for earth fill, subgrade, subbase and 
could be used as base course resources in any construction project.

Abstract 
The SAD is involved in a number of operations, including; Safeguarding the Border Disaster relief and assistance, 
Safety and security Ridding the country of illegal weapons, drug dens, prostitution rings and other illegal activities. 
The aim of this study is to analyse the stress management and prevention techniques that the members of the South 
African Defense use and to assess if these techniques are successful. The questionnaire used in this study was 
focused on Biographic details and Deployment Hassles Checklist (DHC). The Biographic details cover the 
variables, which are considered significant in determining an individual’s perception of the stressor and his 
resultant response to the perceived stressor. The results focused on the variables of age, rank, marital status, 
employment type and stress management techniques used at the military base. It was recommended that the 
commanding authorities should always pay attention to policies and organisational practices that may have a 
negative effect on the member’s psychological well-being as this may have an adverse effect on their operational 
functioning.

Four of the participants consulted a psychologist with regarding to handling stress, four have consulted a Pastor, 
two consulted church leaders, one consulted a Sangoma (Traditional Healer), three consulted a psychiatrist, five 
consulted a medical doctor, three consulted their family, two consulted a Social worker, and 2 have kept it to 
themselves. 
 
5. Discussion and Recommendation 
 
It is worth noting that while the inherently stressful military deployment duties cannot be altered, the policies and 
practices of the organisation can be. The lack of supportive and caring military climate, with indifferent 
supervisors and colleagues, can have a negative and long-lasting effect on soldier’s morale, functional cohesion, 
and overall job performance.  
 
It is recommended that the commanding authorities should always pay attention to policies and organisational 
practices that may have a negative effect on the member’s psychological well-being as this may have an adverse 
effect on their operational functioning. 
Military social support services, which can act as stress outlets for the military operational personnel and their 
families, should always be engaged in a process of reviewing their role, functional effectiveness, and relevance 
of their approaches to provide care and support for the operational personnel. More proactive that reactive 
approaches should be adopted. These approaches should attempt to be as inclusive of other service providers as 
possible, e.g. traditional healers, the families, spiritual services, and so forth. There should be continual attempts 
to explore other relevant therapeutic modalities, which are relevant to the present culturally diverse and multi-
racially constituted in the SAD. Social support services providers should take the opportunity of using client 
consultations to informal clients of the organisational changes and the impact these may have on the 
individual/group as these changes are closely related to presentation of stress symptomatology. This will more 
effective if it occurs in line with the service provider’s resolution of his or her own prejudices. 
 
It is recommended that a similar or related study be conducted on senior or higher ranking members. The reason 
is that the high stress levels notes within the low ranking of this study may also be experienced by the senior and 
higher ranking members.

This study confirmed that stress is a problem in the sample of SAD operational personnel. Stressors inherent in 
operational functioning emerged as the most critical precipitant of the stress symptomatology. The former 
members emerged as the most affected of the groups studied. More than 5% of the total sample admitted to 
confiding on family and medical doctors as a way of coping with stress. Results also revealed that cultural and 
religious systems of support were used to deal with stress. It is thus necessary to conduct further research in the 
area of stress in the Defence force to assess its impact of performance and focus on defence officials.

Abstract 
Laser cutting has become an extensively used method of material removal with cost effective solutions for 
complex manufacturing processes. An extensive research has been going on worldwide where researchers 
and industry experts are focusing on maximizing the productivity and reducing the cost while maintaining 
a high quality during laser cutting of engineered parts. Laser cutting, as the prevalent application of laser 
beam machining (LBM), offers a competitive advantage over conventional cutting processes in terms of 
material savings due to narrow kerf width, less heat affected zone and minimum distortions. The process 
offers high precision and good surface quality, with no tool wear and easy automation. The current paper 
aims to present an overview on the recent research on laser cutting of metallic materials, in terms of   process 
monitoring and control as well as modeling and optimization, and to summarize the past five years of 
research on the topic.

1. Introduction
Laser beam machining (LBM), with capabilities to cut, trim, drill holes and weld in a wide range of materials have 
become the most widely used thermal energy process. The process is applicable from a macro-machining scale to 
micro and nano-machining. With a growing automotive industry and increase demand for precision and accuracy in 
aerospace, electrical and electronics sector, laser cutting, have gained advantage over traditional cutting processes 
such as oxy-fuel cutting, plasma cutting, sawing and punching. Laser cutting is a thermal process without contact, 
capable to produce accurate profiles with high cutting rates in a variety of materials, and to easily adjust to meet the 
requirements of new products. For more than two decades researchers embarked on to study closely the interaction 
between the process parameters and to optimize the processes for better quality and faster production. In laser cutting, 
research has been conducted around the influence of the process parameters on the quality of the laser cut (Pavlica, 
2015). The criteria for evaluating the quality of the cut surface as well as the dimensional tolerance are given in 
standard EN ISO 9013:2000. Evaluation of the quality of the cut is based on surface of the cut, geometry of the cut, 
burr formation and the characteristics of material in the cut zone. The geometry of the cut evaluation is based on kerf 
profile (taper) and kerf width, perpendicularity and slant tolerance. 
Most cut quality characteristics evaluated in previous research are the cut surface roughness, kerf width and HAZ 
(heat affected zone), while the most input parameters considered are the laser power, cutting speed and gas pressure 
(Radanovic, 2011). 
This paper aims to present an overview on the recent research on laser cutting of metallic materials, in terms of process

computing techniques such as GRA, Fuzzy logic, and ANN etc. have also been investigated with some interesting 
hybrid approaches. 
As the interaction of the process parameters and their influence on the cut quality have been extensively studied for 
mild and stainless steel there is much scope in the further study of Ti and Al alloys. As the thickness of the material 
in the examined research was between 1 and 10 mm, greater thicknesses still needs investigation. For the validation 
of the process optimization with hybrid techniques, further research is recommended.

Abstract 
Over the past decades, the prime goal of construction sectors was to use fewer resources to sustain the forthcoming 
generation. Thus sustainable development was introduced in construction sector to meet the needs of the current 
generation as well as the future generation to come. In this manner, implementations of sustainable development in 
construction sector was evaluated along with its principles; social, economic and environmental. Consequently, the 
concept of sustainable development has become a buzz word amid scholars and industry practitioners. Despite the 
fact that, the concept of sustainable development is attaining higher level of significance in western countries, 
America, and China due to its ability in ensuring South African particularly in Construction sector. The adoption and 
integration of sustainability development concept is facing several challenges. To date, over the past decades, too 
many studies have been conducted to investigate the benefit of implementing sustainable development at the global 
level in the construction sector. However, few studies have been conducted from South African fast and moving 
consumer goods perspective, hence the overall goal of this paper is to fill this gap by means of critically analyzing 
studies that were conducted in the field of sustainable development over the past decade. As a key sector 
contributing to economic development, the construction industry also has extensive impacts on the environment and 
society. There are several environmental issues derived from construction activities such as outdoor and indoor 
environmental pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and impacts on the ecological environment. As a retort to these 
contests, the shift of the construction industry from the traditional standard towards more balanced development 
among the economic, social and environmental dimensions, for example; sustainable development, has received 
global attentions. There is no shortage of studies on the sustainability of the construction industries worldwide. 
Some studies emphasis on the social facet of sustainability. For instance, proposed there is a deficiency of 
innovativeness in the Finnish construction sector, hampering the societal change towards sustainability.

Introduction 
The World Commission on Environment and Development (1987) demarcated sustainable development as “the 
development that meets the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations 
to meet their own needs” [1]. Sustainable development is a procedure, which tries to conserve a dynamic balance 
state in the long run [2]. It demands the human, financial and environmental disquiets to work together to guarantee 
‘unending life for the human race’ in the global ecological system [3]. The term sustainable development should not 
denote to indefinite production of oil and gas in the oil and gas industry. The term speaks of sustainability of human 
existence by carefully balancing social, economic and environmental capital in a unceasingly changing world [4]. 
Historically, supply chain management (SCM) mostly dealt with the receptive and proficient system of production 
and delivery from raw material state to final state of the component. Nevertheless, these days, environmental issues 
in a supply chain are assumed of having vast importance [5]. The theory of sustainable development has been 
considered essential in terms of policy and research [6]. In the next few decades, it will become one of the largest 
opportunities in the history of commerce [7]. There will be a rise in the environmental standards and people will 
become more sensitive and concerned towards environmental deterioration as income increases [8]. Unless the 
society mounts up some amount of wealth to satisfy the basic needs of human, it will not allocate substantial 
resources towards sustainability. Sustainable practices are more likely to get executed if there are perceptible

demand for material from transport and utility networks can only thrive when combined with a long-term and clear-
sighted urban policy to repel a further expansion of residential areas. Likewise, insights gained from material flow 
modelling can help in the efficient deployment, recycling and disposal of mineral raw materials form existing urban 
developments, thereby profiting the environment. The author focused on sustainable development in existing 
housing and roads to give support but failed to touch on the key significance of sustainability; which is social, 
economic and environmental. Thus, our study will cover these lacks.  
 
Katie Williams and Carol Dair (2006) found out that in England there is both top-down and bottom-up pressure to 
convey a sustainable built environment. Conversely, most new projects parade few sustainability features. This 
paper grants 12 barriers to attaining sustainability in development schemes, drawn from qualitative research on five 
lately finished projects in England. The barriers that were acknowledged by the stakeholders in the schemes contain 
a shortage of consideration of sustainability measures, real and observed costs and insufficient expertise and powers. 
The paper completes by suggesting some ways in which these barriers might be overwhelmed. This paper introduces 
the barriers of sustainability and further covered how these barriers can be overcome. However, it did not address 
the implementations of sustainable development in construction sectors and the three major principles of 
sustainability; which is what our study will cover. 
 
 
Conclusion 
The term sustainable development can be divided into two words to unpack its meaning. ‘Sustainable’ means that 
which can be preserved continuously, although ‘development’ means expansion. Sustainable development is 
therefore the ability to preserve and expand all social, environmental and economic systems of any formation in a 
way such that each generation accomplishes to fulfil its own needs and does not threaten the capability of upcoming 
generation to provide for them. As a major sector contributing to economic development, the construction industry 
also has substantial impacts on the environment and society. There are numerous environmental issues derived from 
construction activities such as outdoor and indoor environmental pollution, greenhouse gas emission, and influences 
on the ecological environment. As a response to these contests, the shift of the construction industry from the 
traditional paradigm towards more balanced development among the economic, social and environmental 
dimensions, i.e. sustainable development, has received global attentions. Although the existing literature discussed 
the sustainable development in the construction industries, they failed to emphasize more on the principles of 
sustainability and the importance of sustainable development implementation in the construction sector. Thus, future 
studies need to carry on advancing consideration of all stages pertaining sustainability in construction sector.

Abstract 
Construction chemicals are commonly used in the construction industry. These materials are divided into 
two main categories, liquid and powdered products. The process of producing the powdered products 
addressed in this paper consists of three manufacturing stages comprising of feeding, mixing and filling 
and packaging. This paper is intended to study the operations in two of the three. Currently, the average 
flow time in the powdered products plants is quite long; consequently, the lead time to deliver finished 
goods to customers is increased. It is anticipated that the customer lead time can be reduced by improving 
the construction chemicals operations. The paper studies the existing operations of the plants, conducts 
process mapping and time study, and develops simulation models for the current production system in 
Arena software for improving the total flow time, resource utilization, and waiting time in queues.

1. Introduction
In general, the manufacturing process in the manufacturing facility comprises of three main stages that take place in 
each production machine before the product is ready. Figure 1 illustrates the three general stages of the 
manufacturing process. Stage 1, the feeding stage, involves collecting and dozing the required RM and processing 
them into the mixers. Stage 2, the mixing stage, involves running the mixer vessel for a minimum amount of time 
until all the ingredients (RMs) are well combined. Stage 3, the filling and palletizing stage, involves filling the 
content (end product) of the mixer into the packaging bags or cans (depending on the product) and placing the 
finished good (FG) onto the wooden pallet in order to be transported for customer delivery.

This paper explores and studies the powder section for identifying potential improvements. The powdered products 
comprise of a physical combination or mixture of several types of raw materials and chemical additives. The raw 
materials consist mainly of dune sand, cement, limestone aggregate and various additive powdered chemicals. The

5. Conclusion 
This paper studied the operations of chemical construction plant that produces powdered products. The average flow 
time is quite long in the current production system. This results in an increased lead time to supply the finished 
goods to customers. It was expected that the total flow time can be decreased by improving the operations in the 
manufacturing plants of the company. We developed simulation model in Arena software to imitate the operations 
of the current manufacturing system in order to the current production system. The proposed improvements to the 
process contribute to reducing the total flow time of manufacturing, increasing the average resource utilization and 
reducing the total time wasted in queue. Some of the areas of improvements are interdependent in the sense that 
enhancements in one area can lead to enhancements of other areas.  For instance, reducing the total manufacturing 
time will result in increasing the total potential production capacity due to the fact that larger quantities of finished 
goods can be produced in the same amount of time.   
The results obtained from simulating the manufacturing process with improvements from the recommended 
alternative indicate 41% reduction in total flow time. This significant reduction would result in a substantial 
decrease in the total lead time required to supply the finished goods to the customers. In addition, the average 
resource utilization in the manufacturing plants has increased by 16% and the total time in queue was reduced by 
2%. The last two parameters indicate a significant increase in the efficiency of the manufacturing process at the 
company.

Abstract 
The pivotal role played by operations in creation of wealth is not fully appreciated and acknowledged. 
The operations function does not have the acceptance as the marketing and finance function even though 
in reality wealth is created by operations. By using a set of case studies in the Indian context, we 
demonstrate the critical role played by operations in wealth creation. Effective management of this 
function is a prerequisite to create , sustain wealth in organisation. The lack of attention Paid to this 
function usually lead to the downfall of this oragnisation. In this paper we develop a framework to 
help organizations to effectively manage this function to support the business purpose.

Abstract 
Robotics potentially provides versatility combined with the technical competence of CNC 
machine could provide us with proficient autonomous CNC laser robot. This paper looks to utilize the 
versatility of robot in CNC laser cutting operation. Autonomous CNC laser machine has numerous 
advantages in comparison with traditional CNC machine. Traditional CNC machines are large, 
prodigious and stationary tools with physical limitations that hinder the creative capacity of users 
whose ideas are larger than the small workspace they are confined to. The purpose of this study is to 
overcome those obvious deficiency. Autonomous CNC laser cutting machine is portable, 
lightweight, autonomous and proprietary CNC technology that has a high machining accuracy. It 
is portable robot that cuts and engraves using various CAD file formats with boundless work area. A 
laser cutter is a cutting machine which has a laser source for cutting, permitting sensible motion 
control in various directions along complex contours. The machine includes rigid frame that 
supports laser cutting head and multi directional movement is achieved by traction wheels. Precise 
control of the cutting machine is achieved through numerical control. This system alternatively controls 
precise rotation of each wheel to have lesser tolerance values.

Abstract 
Nowadays, with entrance of customer relationship management in new fields, identifying the various 
customers' features and optimum allocating of resources to them based on their value for companies 
has converted in to one of the main concerns in CRM. The aim of this paper is to propose a suitable 
model for measurement the customer lifetime value (CLV) as a criterion for optimum allocating of 
resources. In proposal process of this study that was performed in Toos Shargh company, after 
determining weights of the indexes of RFM model (Recency,Frequency,Monetary) using 
fuzzy delphi analytical hierarchy process (FDAHP), processing the values of indexes at 830 
customers and hierarchical clustering of customers, Finally, was measured CLV in 5 Clusters. 
Findings of this paper provide criteria for analysis of customers features based on RFM model and 
CLV and identifying the main and valuable customers. In addition, were presented suggestions for 
improvement of CRM system based on findings.

Abstract 
Cow bone has been regarded as bio-waste and environmental pollutant, nevertheless, many researchers 
have developed ways to utilize this biomaterial and make it environmental friendly especially in the areas 
of reinforcement, activated carbon, filler, additive as well as water purification. It has also been 
established in the recent time that performance, efficiency and effective utilization of CBP depend solely 
on whether is in the form of nano-, micro-, and macro- particles(Oladele, I, 2016). The bone of the cow 
head (Skull) was collected from the abattoir, washed and cleaned from meat, sun-dried for 6 weeks and 
washed again with de-ionized water to remove impurities and contaminants, it was then transferred to the 
oven set at 50 °C to dry for 5 hours before crushing, it was then crushed and pulverised. The pulverized 
powder then dried in an electric oven set at 50° C for a week to ensure total dryness and sieved according 
to ASTM standard using 150 µm size.  In this study, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy 
Dispersive X-ray (EDX), X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) have been employed to characterize the powder at 
different milling time varying from 0, 20, 40 and 60 Mins. Digital Vibratory Disc Milling Machine 
(VDMM) rated 380V/50Hz at 940 rpm was used for the milling. The SEM Images was set to 1.00kx at 50 
µm, 2.00x at 20 µm and 5.00kx at 10 µm. The particles size got reduced from 150 µm to average 
diameter of 300 nm. It was established in the study that the duration of the milling affects volume, surface 
area, particle size, pore size distributions, microstructure and some other mechanical properties as well as 
the morphology of the powder.

Introduction 
Cow bones are readily available at the abattoirs in South Africa as a result of a large number of cows being 
slaughtered daily in order to meet the demand of the people. Research showed that these bones are apparently 
become waste and pollute the environments making it unfit to live in. The study investigates how what regarded as 
environmental pollutants can be converted to useful application in engineering and other fields. Cow bone being 
natural animal fibre is expected to have good surface compatibility in addition to the structural compatibility 
requirements as biomaterials (Ahmad et al., 2014; Aramide, Ibitoye, Oladele, & Borode, 2010; Oladele & Adewole, 
2013).

Figure 6 and Table 2 showed the variations in elemental compositions of Cow Bone Powder. It was observed from 
table 2 that Carbon (c), Oxygen (O) and Calcium (Ca) have a relatively high percentage of compositions. The 
percentage composition of Phosphorous (P) is higher than of Sodium (Na) and Magnesium (Mg). Mg and Na have 
the least composition in Cow Bone as analyzed by EDX.  The elemental composition varied along with the milling 
time from 0 – 60 mins.  
3.0        Conclusion 
From the results obtained and their discussions, the following conclusions were drawn from the research carried out: 
The particle size reduced from 150 µm to an average size of 300 nm after milling for 60 mins using digital vibratory 
disc milling machine shown in (Figure 2). EDX revealed different elemental compositions that were contained in 
CBP which are Calcium, Phosphorous, Sodium, Magnesium, Carbon and Oxygen in which any user of CBP in near 
future can easily use as the basis of their research work. XRF also established different chemical compositions 
contained in milled CBP. It can be concluded that CBP can be used in different science and engineering applications 
varying from reinforcement in metal, polymer and ceramics composites, fillers, activated carbon, water purifier, 
heavy metals absorber, etc.

Abstract 
Logistics has been recognized one of the key elements of the competitive strategy of companies including 
the supply of products and services from a supply point to a demand point. In retail market, companies’ 
net income is usually low and the expenses with distribution are relevant in the composition of logistic 
costs. In addition, there are challenges in the distribution of products such as high customer churn, 
requirement of specific delivery times and high product variability.  This paper proposes a model of 
routing that aims to reduce costs of transportation of companies in the distribution of products, having as 
a base, a network of stores of furniture and home appliances in the south of Santa Catarina state, in 
southern Brazil. By combining Clarke and Wright heuristic with own developed heuristics, a 
computational system has been implemented so that routes considering truck driver work days, truck load 
capacity and time interval for consumer delivery can be found in acceptable computation time. Obtained 
solutions with the routing tool were nearly 1% above the optimal solutions obtained by enumeration, 
showing that the model leads to good results, i.e., reducing trucks travel time by low computational effort.

1. Introduction
Retailing includes the activities of selling products and services for the final consumer. The definition of strategic 
alternatives and their implementation through operations management are essential to retail organizations success. In 
Brazil, retailing has been modifying and stablishing itself with increasing companies’ efficiency and adaptability to 
the market’s needs. According to Delloite’s report “Os Poderosos do Varejo Global” (2015) net profit margin of the 
250 biggest world retailer was 3.4% in 2013 (DELLOITE, 2015). Furthermore, in respect to the 26th Annual State 
of Logistics Report (2014), US’s total logistics costs in 2013 were US$1.5 trillion, or 8.3% of their GDP. According 
to this report, 48% of total logistics costs is associated with road transportation whose 30% is local transportation 
cost, namely transportation within the same city (WILSON, 2015). A reduced net profit margin along with highlight 
transportation costs make the delivery routing process with portable optimized app to be crucial for companies  in 
which logistics is considered one of the key elements in strong competitive markets. In addition, an increasing 
bargain of computational capacity has increased firms’ number with sophisticated software to support decision in 
logistics strategy. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose a delivery schedule model that consider truck load 
capacity and time interval for consumer delivery on routing of goods in retail organizations. 
2. Routing and programming problems
Routing and programming problems are characterized by searching for effective vehicles management and 
associated crews (RAFF, 1983). In routing problems, the routes to be covered by the vehicles must be defined 
considering the demands of deliveries at various points in a transport network. If time intervals for the vehicle 
passing through each point are considered then we have a programming problem to be solved. For many cases,

operational policies. The policy tends to increase sales because it meets customer's needs for products delivered as 
soon as possible. The developed tool allows to evaluate the trade-off between increasing revenues and decreasing 
transport costs. As the priorities increases, the solution is worse, until there are n-1 priority destinations. The gradual 
degeneracy of  a solution occurs because the routing device joins the priority destinations in a single block, making 
it difficult to fit other destinations on the route. The amount of priority destinations is higher when commemorative 
dates are coming, and the increase in the average duration of the routes may result in an increase in the number of 
required vehicles for deliveries. 
The third experiment aimed to check for correct geocoded addresses percentage. Correct geocoded addresses is 
important because a high rate of errors in identification of latitude and longitude causes risk on providing incorrect 
routes and requiring additional effort of the router when using the device routing. The geocoding was performed 
with queries to the Bing Maps database, with help of a program developed in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), 
from a list of streets in Criciúma (SC) considering 135 addresses. The determined geocoder accuracy was estimated 
in 95.6% as detailed shown in Table 3. The location errors root were incorrect address typing (three times) and not 
registered addresses at the base (three times).

5. Conclusions 
The vehicle routing for delivery products to customers is a logistics decision with capability to reduce costs and 
increase service level. In retailers, the distribution process has specific characteristics that make it difficult to define 
the best route, such as the daily change of clientele served, the need to fulfill deadlines and delivery times 
restrictions imposed by consumers. So, in this way, the work contributes with a vehicle routing model for delivery of 
furniture and home appliances from a retail company, as a base on the implementation of a search algorithm for the 
smallest path in graphs, a routing algorithm and an interface for the router uses in the company's distribution 
logistics and drivers. 
Results show solutions close to optimality for a volume of deliveries consistent with what is observed daily in the 
company, and can serve as guidance for the development of commercial application that could answer companies, 
with trade similar profile. 
Additional analyzes such as the preferred customers addition to the model show that companies should limit the 
number of these customers on the same route in order to get economically acceptable solutions, because a large 
number of preferential customers tends to get rigid routes concerning to the sequence of clients to be visited and, 
therefore, solutions with longer travel times.

Abstract 
The talk is on the product development and project execution of installing water ATMs in Indian railway 
stations. The project was conceptualized as early as 2007; nearly 50 water ATMs were installed in several 
railway stations, but was soon declared closed due to numerous operational hurdles. The Ministry of 
Railways (MoR) revived the project in 2015 and assigned IRCTC to install water ATMs in 7,500 stations. 
After due processing, IRCTC had empanelled a set of qualified vendors to install the water ATMs; but the 
overall progress of commissioning and operationalising was far from impressive. There were huge delays 
and hiccups, which had commercial implications on the vendors. Therefore vendors were likely to be 
discouraged and they may choose not to engage any further in the project. The fundamental issue was the 
delay in roll-out of water ATMs arising due to lack of coordination between the vendors, station 
superintends and IRCTC

Abstract 
The use of waste materials within the construction industry has been studied in an attempt to reduce the 
nuisance of waste disposal and recycling these wastes into sustainable engineering products. Sawmill dust 
bonded with polystyrene waste as the binder are being considered in producing wall panels that would 
exhibit improved physical and mechanical properties. A measured volume of polystyrene waste binder 
was mixed with a known quantity of sawmill dust to produce sawmill-dust-polystyrene composite. Test 
specimens were then produced from the various composites which were used to perform flexural, tensile 
and water absorption tests. The samples were left to cure in room temperature for 12 days and 28 days. 
The results obtained showed that the composition of 60% sawdust 40% polystyrene slurry was the 
optimum composition yielding the highest tensile and flexural strength, with desirable water absorption 
properties when compared to some of the manufactured wood samples (particle Board and Plywood). It 
was also noted that the strength of the composite increased with curing time. Therefore the use of Sawmill 
dust bonded with polystyrene waste adhesive introduces a sustainable approach on reducing pollution 
caused by sawdust and polystyrene wastes.

1.0 Introduction 
Waste management is the collection, transportation, processing, recycling or disposal, and monitoring of waste 
materials after their service life.  Proper waste management is essential to preserve our environment as well as it 
reduces the harmful effects that waste has on our health. According to Erik et al (2013) a general problem regarding 
recycling is that recycled plastics may contain brominated flame retardants and pigments or stabilisers based on 
heavy metals (lead, cadmium) additives or blowing agents such as Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) gases. Expanded 
Polystyrene (EPS) is a lightweight cellular plastics material consisting of fine spherical shaped particles which are 
comprised of about 2% solid mass and 98% air. Therefore, EPS has good sound and thermal insulation 
characteristics as well as impact resistance (Cook, 1983). EPS is a voluminous lightweight material; therefore the 
disposal of EPS in landfills will require a large of space for only a small mass which has detrimental effects 
especially in small islands in the Caribbean such as Trinidad and Tobago, where the rate of EPS wastes have 
annually increased while the price for land remains high for waste disposal. 
As early as 1998 researchers such as Noguchi et al., (1998) studied the recycling of polystyrene by shrinking it to 
1/20th its original size using a natural solvent limonene, However it was found that limonene would not be in a 
sufficient supply due to its high demand and it is very costly. The construction industry consumes a large amount of 
raw materials, hence alternative recycled materials and construction techniques can be implemented in an attempt to 
spawn a sustainable approach (Treloar et al, 2003)  and (Horvath, 2004  ). Sustainable approach such as recycling of 
the solid plastic wastes as well as timber wastes such as sawdust would hence bring fort a reduction in the 
consumption of energy and pollution whilst maintaining high quality structural characteristics. Sawdust or wood

700% and particle board 600%.of the moisture content. On comparing with the soft wood “Pine” it was found that 
pine wood absorbed 400% more moisture as compared to sawdust 60%–polystyrene 40% composite. Similar results 
were observed by Rodolfo de Melo et al. (2014) who suggested the highest percentages of water absorption for these 
plywood and the particleboards can be related to the high content of silica and to the lower content of lignin present. 
On comparing with saw-mill polystyrene composite which had chemical constituents with hydrophilic materials 
such as plastics and lignin the water absorption was low. 
7.0 Conclusion 
This paper was done for the purpose of reducing and recycling Polystyrene and sawdust wastes by combining them 
to form a composite for the use of a structural application of wall panels. The polystyrene wastes adhesive was 
combined with the sawdust by trial and error in which four compositions were developed. The developed 
composites were investigated for its physical and mechanical properties. From the 12 day tensile test the 
composition of 60% Sawdust 40% Polystyrene yields the highest Tensile strength of 8.355 N/mm-2, whilst the 45 % 
Sawmill Dust 55% Polystyrene had the lowest tensile strength of 3.980 N/mm-2 of the four compositions. The next 
test done was that of Flexure where the 60/40 composition had the highest modulus of rupture 5723.55 KPa whilst 
the 45/55 composition had the lowest modulus of rupture of 1336.55KPa. With the water absorption test it was 
observed that with increasing polystyrene waste content the water absorption decreased. 
These findings suggest that the 60 % Sawdust 40% Polystyrene wastes adhesive is the optimum composition and 
upon comparison with that of a manufactured wood, particle board it came out as being superior. As a result of 
conducting this research, I propose that the combination of the Sawdust and the polystyrene waste would be able to 
serve as wall panels more effectively than the manufactured board, reducing and recycling the waste of polystyrene 
and sawdust as well as the pollution cause by its large quantity in the environment and society.

Abstract 
Cape Town is a coastal city in South Africa.  It is the second most populous urban area after 
Johannesburg. The city is famous for its harbour, for its natural setting in the Cape Floristic Region, 
Robben Island, and the beach and for such well-known landmarks as Table Mountain and Cape Point. For 
this reasons Cape Town shines as a tourist destination. The purpose of this Project is to develop 
simulation model for Cape Town Tourism using Stella software in order to study the behavior of the 
system for the next coming 10 years. System dynamics is an approach to understanding the nonlinear 
behavior of complex systems over time using stock, flows, internal feedback loops, table functions and 
time delays. The approach that was used was to develop a simulation model is based on the following five 
stages of system dynamics modeling process: problem articulation, formulation of dynamic hypothesis, 
formulation of simulation model, testing of the model, and policy design and evaluation. Initial 
hypothesis was generated based on the research done. The Model study supports the hypothesis; as the 
population of Cape Town grows without the necessary expansion of services, Cape Town will be less 
attractive to tourism. Therefore, the number of tourists visiting will decline.

1. Introduction
Cape Town is a coastal city in South Africa. It is the second most populous urban area after Johannesburg. The city 
is famous for its harbor, for its natural setting in the Cape Floristic Region, Robben Island, and the beach and for 
such well-known landmarks as Table Mountain and Cape Point. For this reasons Cape Town shines as tourist 
destination. As the population of Cape Town grows rapidly, the tourism system may be affected and this may result 
in a complex systems. System dynamics is a technique used to understanding and modeling the behavior of complex 
systems over time by allowing us to construct simulations of our own mental models using simulation software’s. 
The purpose of this Project is to develop simulation model for Cape Town Tourism using Stella software in order to 
study the behavior of the system for the next coming 10 years. 
The main objectives of the project are to: 
•
Develop a simulation Model for Cape Town tourism on Stella software
•
Quantify the model and simulate text and conduct sensitivity analysis and validation.

6. Conclusions and Recommendations  
This study was aimed at developing a simulation model for Cape Town tourism system, in order to study 
the behavior of the system for the next coming 10 years. Based on the simulation results; The Model study 
supports the hypothesis. As the population of Cape Town grows without the necessary expansion of 
services, Cape Town will be less attractive to tourism, therefore the number of tourists visiting will decline. 
For similar future studies additional variables (i.e. other factors that affect population growth and also all 
the factors affecting tourism) that may be linked to the problem of study must added, this can help achieve 
more precise results.

Abstract 
The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) is imminent in the South African economy. Industry 4.0 is 
disruptive and challenges the status quo. This paper investigates the preparedness of South Africa for 
Industry 4.0 implementation. Government policies and initiatives on innovation and manufacturing are 
reviewed and presented to determine their position relative to Industry 4.0. Key statistics on education, 
skills and employment are presented and analysed to assess how well prepared the education system is to 
supply skills required in Industry 4.0. Based on the analysis and reviews of policy and key data 
recommendations are presented which highlight important actions to ensure optimal Industry 4.0 
implementation.

1. Introduction
Industry 4.0 is defined as the convergence of cutting edge industrial, communication and information 
technologies to build synergistic manufacturing systems consisting of the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber 
Physical Systems (CPS) and Smart Factories (Hermann, et al., 2016). As a result, this creates opportunities 
for swift and optimised decision making processes in manufacturing based on big data (Kang, et al., 2016). 
Industry 4.0 has direct implications on value creation, business models, work organisation and other 
supportive downstream processes (Kagermann, et al., 2013). 
Research shows that Industry 4.0 will have major social and economic impact and will redefine the 
industrial workplace and skills required. New skills will be required and jobs will change or in some 
instances certain jobs will be obliterated. The net number of jobs has been shown to increase however the 
jobs will require different skill sets. Industry 4.0 is set to increase the need of new skills in fields such as 
information & communication technologies and data science (Lorenz, et al., 2015). 
It follows that adopting an Industry 4.0 manufacturing approach requires deliberate actions at government 
level in preparing the workforce for the changing requirements as well as managing its possible impacts to 
yield an optimal result. Against this backdrop, this paper seeks to assess the readiness of South Africa for 
Industry 4.0 in terms of skills, government policies and education.

Abstract 
The concept of decolonisation continues to be a topic of debate across academia largely in South Africa 
and other historically colonised nations. There are many questions and few answers, however there seem 
to be clear directions for soft disciplines like humanities. In contrast for hard science discipline such as 
engineering, the topic of decolonisation generally remains a baffling endeavour. This research paper 
undertook a study to understand the applicability of the decolonisation concept within engineering 
education, as understood by students from three different engineering schools within the University of the 
Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. The knowledge sought was to address questions such as “what is 
decolonised engineering education?”, “what are the attributes of such a decolonised engineering 
education?” and “what are the changes needed within the university in order to decolonise engineering 
education?” amongst other questions. Discoveries include developing an Afrocentric education taking 
into account things such as institutional culture, racial diversity and impact of the education in society 
post-graduation. This paper rates and highlights the intensity and importance of some of the pressing 
issues that need to be addressed if decolonisation is to take place. At top of the list is the need to 
transform institutional culture and at the bottom is the need to do away with hierarchies in education.

7. Conclusions    
 
The study has met its purpose and succeeded in exploring the meaning of decolonisation in Engineering education 
from the perspective of students who were involved in agitation around the concept hence uncovering its meaning. It 
should be noted that the concept of decolonising engineering education proves to be an emotive subject hence of 
disruptive nature as evidenced in the lack of visible neutrality from participants. Clearly there are strongly held 
views and there is not one common accepted meaning by everybody.  Nevertheless, even though the decolonisation 
of engineering education means different things to different people, the study has found that the concept of 
decolonisation is considered applicable to engineering education by Engineering students. In addition the study has 
found that certain views about decolonized Engineering education stand out more prominently than others among 
the students. The study findings indicate that curriculum reform is a crucial part of decolonising engineering 
education. Primary focus should be given to developing a curriculum inclusive of knowledge from different 
backgrounds, devoid of dominant western influence culturally and historically, and free of bias of any form e.g. 
towards a certain race or gender. The study findings recognise Science as a universal disciple and that engineering 
education cannot be complete without the laws which govern the universe, therefore science must remain within the 
engineering curriculum. However the position is that it should not come with the traditions of western supremacy 
within the local university. This is addressed by developing a locally centric education, in this case Afrocentric 
education. The study notes that the use of an African language is a crucial element of developing Afrocentric 
engineering education. While the removal of western discovered science from engineering will result in an 
education which is no longer able to solve engineering problems. However efforts must be invested in including 
African science (knowledges) within the engineering curriculum as well as on developing new knowledges.  
 
 
 
8. Suggestions for future research 
 
For future research some themes are worth pursuing that have arisen from this study. Among these, an investigation 
into indigenous scientific knowledge’s should be made with the focus on discovering formerly available knowledge 
and knowledge being developed today which is excluded from the engineering curriculum. 
 
Another area of interest is the applicability of an African language which has been highlighted as necessary for 
developing an African centred education. A detail investigation should be made on the implementation of an African 
language within engineering education.  
 
A notable highlight which came from the research is that decolonisation is a collaborative process between staff and 
students. An investigation should be made on the role of students in the decolonisation process. 
 
 
Finally, it is recommended that an investigation be carried out on the potential impact of engineering education on 
the local society, particularly the society of the very individual who acquire the engineering education.

Abstract 
This paper presents operational improvement outcomes of the Road Transport Management System 
(RTMS) in South Africa. The RTMS is a voluntary, self-regulation scheme that encourages consignees, 
consignors and road transport operators toward best practice in road transport. The views of consignors, 
consignees and road transport operators were surveyed to provide insights into perceptions and outcomes 
of the RTMS. Respondents indicated improved safety, operational efficiency, profitability, and reduced 
road crashes as outcomes of the RTMS. The main obstacles to increased certification are a lack of 
awareness of the RTMS and a poor understanding of the requirements for becoming certified.

1. INTRODUCTION
Logistics costs make up a significant percentage of a country’s gross domestic product (GDP). In 2015 
logistics costs in the USA were 7.85% of GDP (Logistics Management, 2016) and in South Africa an 
estimated 11.7% of GDP (Havenga et al., 2016). This difference of 50% negatively impacts South 
Africa’s manufacturing competitiveness and impedes economic growth and employment creation. 
Furthermore, South Africa has 12.5 truck crash-related deaths per 100 million kilometres travelled. This 
is 4 to 10 times higher than European countries such as Denmark, France, Germany and Switzerland 
(OECD, 2011).

The survey responses from the RTMS Steering Committee show that they believe that the RTMS has 
been effective in reducing crashes, minimising overloading, reducing road traffic offences, and achieving 
self-regulation amongst certified companies. The costs to implement the RTMS are regarded as minimal 
in comparison with the benefits for the operator, and it is viewed as having a good return on investment. 
The reduction in crashes, reduction in fuel consumption, and improved operational efficiencies provide 
the payback to RTMS-certified operators.  
 
Lack of awareness of the value of RTMS certification, lack of exposure to management systems, and lack 
of buy-in from staff and management are seen as impediments to the widespread adoption of the RTMS. 
One respondent suggested that more work needs to be done in aligning the RTMS with the road traffic 
legislation to improve compliance. The respondents were unanimous in agreement that the RTMS has 
been successful thus far. In response to ways in which to improve the number of companies that are 
RTMS-certified, one respondent suggested that a “toolkit” approach be implemented with templates and 
procedures to assist companies that have difficulty in developing a system. Another suggestion was that 
more of the achievements of RTMS certified companies should be marketed to demonstrate the benefits. 
When asked for advice to companies seeking RTMS certification, the respondents suggested making a 
start, taking the first step, doing a gap analysis and implementing a project plan, with internal audits 
guiding the process.  
 
Survey responses from road traffic authorities indicate that they see the role of the RTMS to support 
legislation and promote compliance. It is viewed as having achieved this objective, as well as improving 
safety and productivity, while reducing breakdowns and maintenance costs. More effective marketing of 
the RTMS, as well as improved operational incentives and consignor awareness of the RTMS benefits are 
viewed as strong drivers for increasing RTMS certification. Suggestions for improved monitoring of the 
RTMS achievements are to collect data regarding crashes, maintenance costs, and costs of logistics 
operations. A caveat is in the observed gap in roadworthiness of vehicles and the manner in which they 
are operated, as compared to the standard to which they are certified. Some work needs to be done to 
ensure alignment of processes. 
 
5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
RTMS certified road transport operators have reported significant benefits in improved safety, reduced 
crashes, improved fuel consumption, operational efficiency, as well as operating profits and regard the 
RTMS as well worth the effort and investment. There is significant alignment between the objectives of 
the RTMS and the user experience of the RTMS in practice. It is recommended that the RTMS steering 
committee embark on initiatives that will increase awareness of the improved road transport sustainability 
achieved through the RTMS. Clients of logistics service providers are key influencers in the decision to 
become RTMS certified, and their role should be leveraged in promoting the RTMS and its benefits. 
 
The requirements for RTMS certification need to be made clearer and more transparent. More effort 
needs to be expended in the marketing of the RTMS and its benefits. In addition, improved operator 
incentives may contribute significantly in the drive to increase the levels of RTMS certification. The 
RTMS is perceived as having achieved its stated objectives of improved operational efficiency and 
profits, increased levels of compliance, reduced damage to road network, improved road safety and driver 
wellness. The main challenge now is to create the right conditions for increasing the number of 
companies that attain certification.

revolution is introducing unprecedented market and technological dynamics. The research uses the viable 
system model to provide an iterative systematic process to service system design tackling both service 
delivery and service co-creation complexities. Having identified and discussed various existing service 
system design models available in literature and industry to date, this research identifies the residual 
complexities these models present. The viable system model is used for developing an approach that designs 
for the identified residual complexities existing in present IT service systems in South Africa. The research 
work is currently in progress and therefore this paper serves as a research concept.

organizations. The viable systems model, due to its attenuation and amplification concepts and its 
recursive nature, has proven to be suitable in providing an effective approach to designing 
intelligent ecosystemic service systems that can proactively adapt to dynamic environments.

Abstract 
Advances in power transmission using spur gear technology in some specific mechanical devices required 
lightweight to strength ratio of the gear material. This study evaluated the mechanical properties of a 
particulate palm kernel shell reinforced polyester composite (PPKSRPC) for spur gear application. The 
PPKSRPC sample was prepared and examined experimentally to determine its mechanical properties such 
as tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and shear modulus. The experimental result for 5% weight fraction 
of PPKSRPC gave a tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and shear modulus of 90.3 MPa, 2.35 GPa and 
0.89 GPa, respectively. The value obtained was used to model the PPKSRPC spur gear under a torque of 
140 N-m in ANSYS environment.  The observed values of the responses (mechanical properties) of the 
PPKSRPC under loading conditions are lower compared to the conventional steel in spur gear application.

1. Introduction
The high strength to weight ratio and socio-economic benefits of natural fibre based composites make them suitable 
for many applications such as in polymer gears, vehicles interior and exterior components.  More so, global quest for 
eco-friendly materials has sparked research interests into the development and use of natural composites. Some 
applications and advantageous properties of different natural composites have been reported in the literature (Sanjay, 
et al., 2017; Raju & Kumarappa, 2012; Rozman, et al., 2005; Razaka, et al., 2017; Kilanko, et al., 2018; Oreko, et al., 
2018). A variety of agricultural residues ranging from soft banana peel to hard palm kernel shells (PKS) are being 
used to produce natural fibre based composites. 
Palm fruit is widely cultivated in Nigeria (Poku, 2002).  Palm Kernel Shell (PKS) is a by-product of palm fruit, and 
can be used as a natural reinforcement in the manufacture of polymer composites. Particulate PKS has surface 
elements and is crystalline. PKS has poor thermal conductivity and can serve as a thermal insulator (Ighodalo & 
Okoebor, 1996). It can be used for construction materials and water treatment granular filters (Okoriogwe, et al., 2014; 
Oti, et al., 2017; Alsalami, et al., 2018). It has successfully been used to develop friction materials such as brake pads 
for automobiles (Fono-Tamoa & Koyab, 2017; Ikpambese, et al., 2016; Elakhame, et al., 2014; Ibhadode & Dagwa,

Conclusion 
In this work, particulate palm kernel shells reinforced polymer composite PPKSRPC was experimentally and 
analytically studied. The developed composites were investigated by determining their physical and mechanical 
properties. Their static structural performance in spur gears was analysed and modelled. The results obtained for a 5% 
weight fraction for PPKSRPC indicated that it could perform well in gear application where loading condition and 
torque requirement is less than 90.3 MPa and 140 N-m.

Abstract 
In this paper, Step algorithm to solve positive integer type linear programming problems with two variables 
and n linear constraints is proposed. Classical methods to solve integer programming problems are branch 
and bound method and Gomory’s cutting plane algorithm. Manual solution by both these methods is tedious 
and tiring. Moreover, to get multiple optima through branch and bond method, it is required to select 
different branch and need to solve for that particular branch. While in Gomory’s cutting plane algorithm, it 
is required to solve the problem again with different sets of iterations to have multi optima. Disadvantages 
of branch and bond method and Gomory’s cutting plane method give motivation to develop Step algorithm. 
Proposed method i.e. step algorithm works on the principle that in linear programming problem optimum 
solution always lies on the boundary of feasible region in maximization as well as in minimization problem. 
Furthermore, step algorithm is less complex and can give multi-optima solution in one go. To test the 
effectiveness of step algorithm few instances of integer programming problem with two variables are 
experimented. Obtained results prove that step algorithm is more efficient, easy and less time consuming.

4. Conclusion 
For solving positive-integer type-linear programming problem (ILPP) with two variables and n linear 
constraints; the new algorithm is developed in this paper. The algorithm is developed on the principle that, 
solution for ILPP type of problems always lie in the proximity of boundary of feasible region. Comparing 
this algorithm with existing methods, this algorithm is easy to solve manually. And also this algorithm gives 
multiple optimum solution in one go, where as in existing methods, multiple iterations are required in case 
of multiple optimum solutions.

Abstract 
An ideal bone internal fixation material does more than just fracture union. It ensures the preservation of 
Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and body-bone’s integrity. This has been a major fight in osteosynthesis 
from the ancient time till date. Animal skeletons that were first used as internal fixations though had some 
desirable mechanical properties comparable to bones, their usage resulted in mild pus formation, difficulty 
with resorption of sterile bones and non-union. A shift to metallic bone implants resulted in corrosion and 
bio-incompatibility, stress shielding, imaging and radiotherapy interference, temperature sensitivity, 
revision surgery with extreme difficulty, growth restriction, metal-in tissue accumulation, bone-metal 
elastic modulus mismatch to mention but a few. Advances in osteosynthesis have, however, led to great 
improvement on metallic bone fixations, yet leaving some fundamental issues unresolved. Exploration of 
biodegradable polymers and their composites is fast solving most of the problems encountered through the 
use of skeletal and metallic fixations. Their low Young's moduli and excellent biocompatibility, non-
carcinogenicity and bioresorbability have made them viable materials for bone fracture healing. This brief 
overview covers the biomechanical properties of popular biological materials, metallic fixations and 
polymeric scaffold.  
Keywords: Mechanical properties, Osteosynthesis, Internal fixation, Biodegradability, bioresorbability. 
1. Introduction
Human bone fracture is a problem that is both age long, global and popular (Agaja and Ehalaiye, 2009; Anyaehie et 
al., 2015; Anyanwu et al., 2011; Brasileiro and Passeri, 2006; Eze et al., 2013; Nnonyelum et al., 2015; Ogundipe et 
al., 2012; Singer et al., 1998; Van et al., 2001). About 9 million fractures occur worldwide among the elderly every 
year (Costa et al., 2013) and a whopping €37 billion is spent annually to care for bone fracture in osteoporotic patients 
in the European Union (Hernlund et al., 2013). The enormity of this problem has invited the attention of researchers 
from several fields and there have been several thoughts on how to care for bone fractures. From the time immemorial

Abstract 
End-of-life tyres (EOLT) a problematic source of waste belongs to a type of solid waste named “bulky” in 
waste management. It constitutes a lot of environmental issues which ranges from causative of fires 
hazards to health and hygiene menace. A holistic waste management technique will go a long way to 
determine a proper handling, re-usage, reduction, recycling and disposal of EOLT and peradventures 
make EOLT a huge waste to wealth venture. This article reviews the management, re-use and recycling of 
EOLT in developed countries as compared to that of developing countries. Some pertinent gaps in the 
national managerial policies and programme governing the collection, storage and recycling of EOLTs 
were identified. The article conclusively proffers a managerial pathway that will optimize the 
opportunities of Waste to Wealth resources in EOLTs in developing countries thereby contributing to 
their economic advancement.

End-of-Life Tyre, Waste Management, Recycling, Policies 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
End-of-life tyres (EOLT) refers to tyres that have exceeded their useful lifespan due to deterioration of certain 
properties that make them road worthy. EOLT are usually available in sufficient number to stand as a hazard to 
environment and society as well as be 100% advantageous if well utilized and managed. In the early 1990’s, 
developed regions such as Europe and USA started taking steps to strengthen their engagements in the management 
of EOLT to take advantage of available resources through exploitation for various uses ranging from energy 
generation, civil constructions, material recovery and other innovative uses. Stockpiling of EOLT was set to be 
greatly reduced to 0% resulting into reduction of problems of fire outbreaks from those dumps, breeding vectors in 
certain climates in these regions. Generally, in developing countries effective Waste management has been limited 
by problems like poor infrastructure, insufficient funding, attitudinal behavior of the citizen, graft on the part of 
public officials, dysfunctional legal and majorly poor policy framework (Omole, Isiorho, & Ndambuki, 2016). Like 
exploration of natural resources, many underdeveloped and developing countries especially African countries are 
still on a slow lane in advancing the EOLT management and harnessing of the resources therein EOLT. Most 
developing country’s government policies have not been able to address this available socio-economic benefit. It is 
obvious that regulations and infrastructure for EOLT management can be greatly improved in developing countries 
(Godfrey & Oelofse, 2017). 
In this paper, Section 2 described EOLT in details while Section 3 highlighted the composition and properties of 
different forms and stages of EOLT recycling. Section 4 identified the current uses of EOLT and reviewed different

economy where smuggling activities are prominent, as the solution will just make the used tyres smuggling more 
lucrative. This takes us to this “Subsidized Liberal System” which literarily has a blend of Government 
Responsibility and Liberal System (Free Market). Exactly like the Liberal System described earlier, the only 
significant difference is that Government will have to enter into a Public Private Partnership (PPP) with the 
investors, by giving a capital as Loan or issuing a debt contract with the private investors with a Pay-back modality. 
The government, on the other hand, will provide policies that will allow for a conducive environment for the 
investors. For instance, a simple law of Demand and Supply can be used to crush the business of the used tyre’ 
smugglers and at the same time encourage the EOLT Recycling sector of the developing country by simply 
removing duties on Tyres thus encouraging more inflow of used tyres which will culminate into having more EOLT 
to be recycled. However, caution is on this proffered system in terms of the fact that if not properly managed its fall 
out will result in more tyres ending up at Landfills. 
 
7.0 
Conclusion 
EOLT has a potential of posing a major threat to environmental conservation and ecological well-being of any 
society if not tactically managed; which had been found to be the case with developing countries. The optimum aim 
of developing economy is to invest in any viable project that will bring an enormous profit to strengthen her feeble 
economy. This article extensively discussed the prospect of harnessing the economic value of recoverable materials 
in EOLT while at the same time proffered possible solutions to the bulk waste problem. Valuable suggestions were 
made on designing sustainable management templates for EOLT having clearly defined policies and regulations as 
the arrowhead of approaching a Techno-economic growth towards a safe recycling system. All the major 
stakeholders must be motivated by incentive driven arrangement and at the same time under strict monitoring and 
control by the inaugurated body. The measures to ensure waste tyres are recycled were itemised in order to avoid 
hazards associated with pilling or discarding or burning them in an unhealthy manner but rather to enjoy the wealth 
of recycled products.

Abstract 
The objective of this study is to analyse the design parameters for a pyrolysis furnace designed and built 
for experimental purposes using the principle of heat transfer. The furnace was made of a casing of low 
carbon steel sheets inside which the refractory bricks were moulded, forming the furnace cavity to prevent 
heat loss. The pyrolysis capsule was made of high carbon steel tube with flanges which can be opened for 
batch loading of the precursors and evacuation of products. The furnace was designed to be gas-fired due 
to high efficiency and cleaner nature of gas energy. The pyrolysis capsule is installed along the centre of 
the furnace cavity where combustion takes place. The heat energy accumulated around the capsule is 
being absorbed into the pyrolysis chamber where precursors are being loaded, the regulation of the 
temperature of the combustion chamber via the installed feedback mechanism to monitor and control the 
system. The capsule has a Nitrogen gas inlet for the inert environment needed for effective pyrolysis 
process and an outlet duct for pyrolysis oil collection and gas recovery. The experimental initial 
conditions were inputted in Solidworks Flow Simulation to determine the heat distribution at different 
regions of the furnace and thus made it easy to determine the furnace combustion chamber temperature at 
which the pyrolysis temperature will be attained inside the pyrolysis chamber.

1. Introduction
Pyrolysis is the thermal degradation of materials at elevated temperatures in the absence of air. The process is 
irreversible and it has been considered the most promising process for the waste treatment. The solid products of 
pyrolysis: Carbon black and at further pyrolysis; Graphite had been found to have different kinds of Engineering 
applications in refractory applications, Aerospace applications, as coatings and lubricants, in paint and ink 
production; Crystalline graphite is used in production of batteries, Carbon brushes and grinding wheels as well as in 
Powder metallurgy and Nuclear Power plants (Pierson, 1993) (Chhabra, Shastri, & Bhattacharya, 2016). A furnace 
is a confinement for heat exchange between a material and the surrounding medium with a regulated temperature 
(Jawad, 2010). A furnace is primarily to provide and retain heat to a precursor load. The quality of the production 
depends on how well evenly distributed and controllable the temperature inside a furnace is. At time rapid heating of 
the load to the desired temperature is a prerequisite to have to achieve an intended product (Abioye, Atanda, 
Kolawole, & Olorunniwo, 2015). In a nutshell, high heat transfer rates and uniformity of temperature distribution 
are important factors in determining furnace characteristics (Cadena-Ramírez, Favela-Contreras, & Dieck-Assad, 
2017). The pyrolysis furnace analysed in this article is a pilot scaled model purposely for experiments to optimise 
pyrolysis conditions on some certain precursors. Some agricultural wastes such as coconut shell and palm kernel 
shell and some inorganic waste materials such as plastics, waste tyres and other rubber-based materials had been 
found to have a significant level of Carbon contents that can be recovered by pyrolysis process (Athanassiades, 
2013), (Sunphorka, Chalermsinsuwan, & Piumsomboon, 2015).

7 Conclusion 
The experimental analysis has been observed to have followed the same pattern as the simulated analysis of the 
Pyrolysis Furnace. It was noticed that the temperature difference between the combustion chamber and pyrolysis 
chamber is a bit not favourable as the high temperature is much needed in the Pyrolysis chamber. The heat loss is 
minimal via the kaolin bricks lining the furnace and thus this makes the furnace efficient in the sense that in little 
time and little fuel consumption a high temperature was attained. The Computer simulation shows that in transient 
mode, the furnace does not produce the desired conditions but with a continuous heating over time the furnace will 
acquire a forced convection energy capable of saturating the pyrolysis chamber with enough heat energy that will 
overcome the thermal resistance to radiation inside the pyrolysis Chamber, Ri and thermal resistance to conduction 
through the thickness of the pyrolysis chamber, 
. A rapid rate of radiation from the combustion chamber will give 
rise to the temperature inside of the pyrolysis chamber where a higher concentration of heat energy is needed for 
pyrolysis. One of the major advantages of using a simulation tool for evaluation is that all data for temperature, heat 
flux and energy are available for every part of the furnace as against the real system whereby the measurement was 
being done at disjointed and asymmetric points.

Abstract 
The paper discusses the development and application of GAMMQV in forecasting the long-term electricity 
demand in South Africa. The long-term hourly demand from 2007 to 2023 with in-sample forecasts from 
2007 to 2012 and out-of-sample forecasts from 2013 to 2023 were done. The actual and forecasted demand 
distributions closely matched between 2013 and 2015. Therefore, the forecasted demand distribution is 
expected to represent the actual demand distribution until 2023. The findings are that (a) the expected 
demand and daily demand profiles are well forecasted and (b) future distributions of hourly demand and 
peak daily demand are likely to shift towards lower demand over the years until 2023. The contributions of 
the paper are (a) the development of GAMM with trend model in forecasting long-term electricity demand, 
harnessing the correlation structures within different hours (c) inclusion of a nonlinear trend with forecasted 
values from quantile regression (QR) and (d) the development and application of GAMMQV to the South 
African data.

1. Introduction
The economic growth of any country is dependent on its energy security. Long-term electricity demand forecasts are 
important to those who manage power utility companies including political principals making decisions pertaining to 
the countries energy security. The decisions include generation capacity, maintenance planning, decisions on the 
optimal energy mix and plans for future infrastructure expansions. Electricity demand trend in South Africa is 
unpredictable, it showed an upward trajectory between 1997 and 2007, and it then stabilized between 2008 and 2011 
and started declining in the last four years until 2015, so it is uncertain whether the latest downward trend will continue 
or will revert to the earlier upward trajectory. The accuracy of the demand trend is important otherwise long-term 
forecasts could vastly deviate from the future actual demand which could have serious planning implications. For 
planning purposes, the country must assess its capacity to continue meeting its electricity demand in future with the

Abstract 
In Lubricated Machines, wear particles analysis is a condition monitoring technique used to monitor the 
contact condition of two surfaces in contact and in relative motion. Wear is resulting from the generated 
friction between the two surfaces. Wear and friction are two main disciplines of Tribology, the science 
dealing with interacting surfaces including wear, friction and lubrication. Qualitative, quantitative and 
morphological data could be obtained from the wear particle analysis through the periodically taken samples 
of the lubricant. This is implemented through different techniques to indicate the wear mode and severity. 
In human joints, hips, knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows and finger joints, the phenomena of Tribology is 
found including wear , friction and lubrication. Wear particles are generated from cartilages and bones 
and released into the synovial fluid. The generated wear particles could be used for monitoring the joints 
condition. This is applied for natural and artificial joints and artificial joints as well. Debris materials could 
be metals, polymers, ceramics, cements as well as cartilage and bone materials. Analysis of these particles 
could be an effective tool for disease diagnosis especially in the early stages.  
In this study, a survey of the applications of the wear particle analysis in human joints is presented, the 
similarity of the Tribological aspects between the lubricated machines and human joints is introduced 
and the different techniques used in this analysis is are indicated. Recommendations for future works are 
offered.

Strategies for Sustainable Petroleum Processing 
MP Sukumaran Nair

Abstract 
Petroleum refining and associated downstream hydrocarbon processing operations are challenged on the 
one hand by the tightening product specifications and shifting crude quality on the other forcing an 
increased proportion of heavy and sour crudes. Regulatory specifications for products as well as process 
effluents are getting stringent over the years necessitating utmost optimization at every stage in 
refining operations while still retaining the industry commitment to economically provide 
hydrocarbon based fuel and feedstock and meet the increasing needs of the growing global population. 
All around awareness of environmental degradation caused by industrial activities in the hydrocarbon 
processing sector, on account of greenhouse gas emissions, stratospheric ozone depletion, acid rain and 
acidification, eutrophication, soil contamination, technological hazards, chemical mists and fog, all 
with potential damage to human beings, is indeed a topic of much discussions at both national as well as 
international forums. Environmental considerations, therefore assume significant importance in 
hydrocarbon processing operations which generate large quantum of effluents and emissions capable of 
degrading environment. Besides meeting physical targets of production adhering to quality and safety 
stipulations , industry operators are also responsible for effective tackling of environmental issues 
consequent to the production process and avoid damages to the community. An effective 
environmental management perspective addresses the numerous issues relating to pollution control, 
ensure safety and thus maintain sustainability in the industry. Clean development initiatives in 
hydrocarbon industries is a major development in this direction. The growth of hydrocarbon 
processing hitherto has been guided mostly by the necessity of increasing production at lower costs 
which led to serious environmental degradation of water resources, soil and air around the processing 
plants. Worldwide the focus of pollution control in the industry has shifted from end of pipe treatment 
to source reduction, avoiding pollution, clean technology and sustainable development. Hence, it has 
become imperative that environmental considerations shall play a substantive role in the future 
development of the industry especially at a time when more and more such industrial activities are 
being undertaken in the developing countries. This study focuses this issue with the objective of 
identifying key issues in environmental protection in the different industrial processes, assessing as to 
what extent the national and international norms or guidelines regarding pollution control and 
environmental management are implemented in the industries, understanding the problems 
encountered in environmental management and exploring the reasons for the non-compliance. 
Suggestions were also made on the basis of the above studies to develop guidelines of an 
environmental policy and adopt cleaner technologies that will foster development with least 
degradation to the environment.

Abstract 
Performance measurement for any organization has become an inevitable activity owing to the pressure of 
enhancing the efficiency of the system and to assess the correctness and direction of activities related to 
the performance. Various methods like time series graph, control charts, capability index, quality awards, 
cost of quality etc. are being used for showcasing the measured performances. One of the vital methods 
being used for the purpose is Taguchi’s Loss Function. The purpose of this paper is to develop a 
systematic review of literature on the real cases that used the asymmetric and non-quadratic loss function 
in monitoring and optimizing the cost of rejection for performance measurement. Cases dealing with 
numerical modelling of various loss functions and their applications in industry have been critically 
reviewed.  It has been observed that majority of findings advocate the use of RINF loss function in 
economic tolerance design.

Abstract 
Small and Medium Manufacturing Enterprises are one of the major drivers that stimulates job creation, 
enhance youth empowerment and improve economic growth of a country. Hence, the development of 
optimal production plan that will promote business success and maximize profit generation in these 
enterprises are vital. In light of this, this paper proposed a goal programming model that could be used to 
optimally plan production operations in a Small and Medium Bottled Water Manufacturing Enterprise. 
The goal programming model was formulated by taking into consideration the various objectives that this 
enterprise want to achieve amidst the constraints that the production system of this enterprise is facing. 
Operations-related data of the enterprise such as customer order data, inventory data, production time and 
production cost data were used to solve the production planning model of this organisation. The solution 
to the goal programming model of this enterprise using the LINDO software unveiled the organization 
objectives that could be achieved and those that cannot be achieved. The deviation values that hindered 
the unachieved objectives from been met were also unveiled.

1. Introduction
Small and Medium Manufacturing Enterprises (SMME) contribute up to 35% of the Gross Domestic Product of 
various countries in the global world [1]. This is expected to grow to 60% in 10 to 15 years’ times [2]. This is a huge 
chunk contribution to various nations’ economy in the global space. According to Amra et al. [3], South Africa has 
5.6 million SMMEs’; of which 3.3 million are medium enterprises, 1.7 million are microenterprises and 554 
thousand are small enterprises. This sector is expected to create 90% of the jobs in the next 5 to 10 years, therefore it 
is essential that small business enterprise strategically plan and schedule: (1) their operations and (2) the use of their 
resources, in order to maximize their productivity and profit. Production planning in SMMEs is a difficult and 
enormous task because it requires effective interactions and cooperation among various departments in that 
organisation [4]. Planning operation is a conglomerate of verified and hierarchy decisions that address various issues 
within a particular manufacturing environment [5].

 are 3645530, 4321905, 5066603 and 3453567. In light of this, it could 
inferred that the production time during each week of production in order to meet the customer demands should be 
3771530 seconds, 4447905 seconds, 5192603 seconds and 3579567 seconds respectively.  
 
 
 
7.  Conclusion   
 
 
We have successfully formulated a goal programming model that could be used to plan the production of varieties of 
products demanded by the customers at different time periods in a Small and Medium Bottled Water Production 
Enterprise ABC. Production operations data of the Small and Medium Bottled Water Production Enterprise ABC, 
obtained through: (1) time and method studies and (2) opinions of the production manager of this organization was 
used to solve the model. Based on the results obtained, it was inferred that objectives 1, 2, 3 and 5 of the Small and 
Medium Bottled Water Production Enterprise ABC can be achieved. Objective 4 of this enterprise can be achieved 
during the first, second and fourth week of production, however cannot be achieved in the third week of production. 
Objective 6 of this enterprise can be achieved, however objective 7 cannot be achieved. Inability of the goal 
programming model to achieve: (1) the fourth objective in the third week of production, and (2) the seventh 
objective of the company, were due to the deviations of the results of this model from these objectives target. In 
light of this, it could be inferred that goal programming model could be used to optimally plan the production 
operations of the Small and Medium Bottled Water Production Enterprise ABC, in order to meet the strategic goals

shows that the work discipline of PT Telkom Akses (PTTA) employees in the Bandung 
Lembong Area is very high. 
3. The Big Effect of Leadership Style on Employee Discipline Partially on PT Telkom 
Access (PTTA) Lembong Area Bandung. Autocratic leadership style (X1) obtained t count 
of 2.883 and t table value is 1.665 which means greater than t table, besides the 
significance value in table t arithmetic is 0.005 smaller than 0.05. The results of the 
regression analysis showed that the autocratic leadership style variable (X1) had a 
significant influence on the work discipline of employees of PT Telkom Akses (PTTA) 
Lembong Area Bandung. 
4. The Big Effect of Leadership Style on Employee Discipline Simultaneously at PT Telkom 
Access (PTTA) Lembong Area Bandung. Based on the results of simultaneous hypothesis 
testing (test F) obtained Leadership Style consisting of Autocratic Leadership Style, 
Democratic Leadership Style and Free Leadership Style (Laissez-Faire) simultaneously 
significantly influence the work discipline of employees of PT Telkom Akses (PTTA) 
Lembong Area Bandung . The magnitude of the effect is 10.3% and the remaining 89.7% 
is influenced by other variables not examined in this study. 
 
5.1 Suggestion 
Based on the results of research and analysis that has been carried out, researchers can 
provide useful advice and can be a consideration for the company's progress in the future and for 
further research, namely: 
Leaders must improve the leadership style applied, which can be seen that the democratic 
leadership style and freedom (Laissez Faire) does not affect employee discipline in PT Telkom 
Access (PTTA) Bandung Lembong Area, and continue to improve the autocratic leadership style 
that is applied, so that interrelationships are established positive between leaders and employees 
and improve the work discipline of employees of PT Telkom Akses (PTTA) Lembong Area 
Bandung. 
 
Recommendations For further research 
1. For the next researcher, it is expected to continue to develop this research. The next 
researcher is expected to be more varied by developing other factors that influence work 
discipline as additional variables. As shown in the data analysis, leadership styles 
consisting of autocratic leadership style, democratic leadership style, and freedom 
leadership style (Laissez Faire) were only 10.3%, with the remaining 89.7% formed by 
other variables not examined in the study. this. 
2. And in connection with this, it is recommended for further research interested in examining 
the discipline of work variables to examine or add other factors that influence work 
discipline, such as needs that can encourage and influence work discipline in a company.

Abstract 
The impact of human capital development on the evolution procedure in whichever country or 
state is fundamental, which is the most valuable resource for poverty alleviation. The study tried 
to survey the nexus amid human capital development besides economic growth in Nigeria. The 
methodology adopted used secondary data that span a period of 198the 0 to 2016 from CBN ta 
time series data. This study did an extensive review of empirical studies, which unveils the 
elongated affiliation between government disbursement on the health sector, educational sector, 
and economic growth. Ordinary least square, Trend analysis, and the Johansen cointegration 
were used in the analysis of data. The independent variables were proxied using fixed capital 
formation, both post-primary and post-secondary enrolment rates, and education expenditure and 
health appear with a priori expectations with statistical significance (except government 
expenditure on primary enrolment level and education). The discoveries in this survey pose a 
great great to education and health policies. Hence, urgent attention needs to change the led 
towards accelerating growth process and liberate Nigeria’s human capital from the phase of 
destitution, the research, therefore, recommends that the government expressly swing into action 
on progressive policies that support human capital development bearing in mind these sectors of 
the economy.

Abstract 
The purpose of water distribution systems is to provide a satisfactory and reliable supply of 
safe water to citizens within a specified area. A reliable drinking water distribution system 
must be able to supply and deliver water with the acceptable quality to all its users at their 
delivery points. SA is a water scarce country with optimization of water supply crucial to 
sustainability. The reliability of a water network is a crucial component of delivery but more 
importantly water sustainability. Reliability, Availability and Maintainability (RAM) are 
three crucial subsets of a system and its operational support. This study outlines the theory 
together with an assessment of current practices relative to the RAM theory. The results 
indicates adoption capacity with recommendations on implementation constraints. The 
potential impact to the water network is also assessed.

Introduction
The reliability of water distribution systems is critical in guaranteeing public safety and the continuous 
operation of urban activities. In this manner, careful preparation of infrastructural planning, resources 
allocation, maintenance, and operational activities for water distribution systems is essential. Optimal 
reliability and maintenance schemes are beneficial to the receiver of the service delivery.  
Reliability and maintenance of water distribution schemes, if used correctly, will not merely save 
money for the government, but will also improve government service delivery, improve customer 
satisfaction and the general quality of life of residents. This is also good for the water distribution 
systems because it will extend its lifespan. 
Water distribution systems comprises interconnected systems such as pipes, intersection joints, water 
towers, reservoirs, and pumps that require extensive planning to guarantee that water is delivered to 
the consumers without service interruptions. The water distribution systems are designed and planned

Polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) water pipes are the least 
problematic 
The literature revealed no failures of pipes constructed from Polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (uPVC) 
and High-density polyethylene (HDPE).  The 2005 – 2013 study shows that cast iron had the highest 
failure while UPVC had the least number of pipe failures. This could be due to the minimal use of 
these pipes or that it is more durable and should therefore be considered as the pipe of choice to 
replace all pipes in the water distribution system.

Conclusion
The research results reveal that there are multiple areas of concern that cause the water distribution 
system in the Randburg area to be unreliable. With the constant and continuous application of RAM, 
these system failures can be reduced. This study conclusively brought to light the complex issues that 
speak uniquely to the Randburg area. These can be attended through multiple interventions such as 
the creation of maintenance policies, water pipe audits, water pipe replacements, infrastructure 
revamp and collaborations with other municipality service providers to minimize disruptions of any 
important municipal service.  The study revealed that the water distribution system layout is as per 
best practice thus it is best suited for the area.  
The study makes the following recommendations to maximize the reliability of the water distribution 
systems:  
•
Application of new technology to assess water distribution systems such as Monte Carlo
Simulation, EPANET, Distributed Acoustic Sensing system.
•
The creation of a routine water pipe maintenance policy.
•
Ensure thorough training of employees to limit human errors in the system design, construction
and operation stages of the water distribution systems.
•
Educating the community on protecting the water distribution systems  and encouraging its
correct use e.g. reporting of illegal connections, how to prevent blockages and protecting the
infrastructure.
•
Pipeline rehabilitation to improve reliability, availability, and maintainability of water
distribution systems.
•
A proactive maintenance plan be created as part of a management strategy to reduce
destructions to the water distribution systems.
•
FThe pipes to be replaced with Polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl and high-density polyethylene
(HDPE) as they are the least problematic.

Abstract 
The concept of Industry 4.0 has bought a big change in business process management 
enabled through wireless sensors networks and advanced technologies. Industry 4.0 has lead 
to successful smart manufacturing, smart warehousing and smart logistics. These practices 
have direct and indirect effects on supply chain sustainability. This area is under researched 
and need focus from the research community. The aim of this paper is to systematically 
review prior literature in the field of Industry 4.0, Cyber Physical Systems, and supply chain 
sustainability. Further analysis is performed to view the publication trends, number of 
publications per year, author affiliation, top papers and highest number of citations. This will 
provide a clear picture and enable researchers’ to draw a boundary for proposing future 
research directions.

Introduction
Digital transformation is no more a choice to  manufacturers in today’s dynamic business environment 
and is rather an imperative for survival. The previous three industrial revolutions have witnessed 
significant improvement in firms’ productivity. The past industrial revolutions had effect on the shop 
floor level only. Industry 4.0 is a more advanced concept and shifts productivity much more by 
involving support functions such as engineering [Schuh, 2013]. Under Industry 4.0 concept, factory 
personnel will be able to work with smart phones and tablets for running production and 
communication at all levels. Industry 4.0 has been instrumental in improving supply chain 
connectivity, which further enhances supply chain visibility. However, the dark side of all previous 
industrial revolutions has been the ignorance of social and environmental dimensions. 
The first industrial revolution was driven by steam power that transformed lives of people. The second 
industrial revolution was driven by electricity and communication enabling just in time operations 
and production lines in the mid-1800s. The 20th century witnessed the third industrial revolution 
through introduction of information technology. However, the fourth industrial revolution is much 
2071","© IEOM Society International 
2.3 Reporting the findings from the literature review 
The key points which emerge from the review of existing literature are as follows: 
• 
Industry 4.0 or the fourth industrial revolution integrates core technologies such as IoT, Cyber 
physical systems and cloud computing. Industry 4.0 has enabled firms’ advancement by 
significantly enhancing the productivity and efficiency.  
• 
The literature review brings out some interesting facts and figures which will be helpful for 
the research community. Although there has been studies in all domains but limited studies 
exist in the area of managing supply chain network through smart technologies.  
• 
Smart supply chain is an emerging form of logistics systems, integrating resources and 
capabilities with wireless sensors and actuators to collect data and process data for business 
decision making [Kusiak, 2017]. Such real-time information sharing aids in right decision 
support and enhanced profitability [Lee, 2017].  
• 
From stage 5 of the review, the researchers’ identify 53 research papers, which focuses on both 
Industry 4.0 and Sustainability. However, only 10 papers out of 53 papers actually focuses on 
smart manufacturing/production system, smart warehouse management system, smart logistics 
and sustainability. Most of the previous research works ignored one the important dimensions 
of sustainability i.e. Social dimension. None of the papers provided a holistic framework on 
smart supply chain network design under Industry 4.0 concept. 
• 
This area has been under researched and the gaps in the existing literature opens new research 
avenues for future researchers. Future study must explore Industry 4.0 and sustainable supply 
chain network design from both technological and management perspective.  
 
This study provides food for thought to future researchers. New research studies are required to 
explore the risk management strategies in  supply chain network under the control of Industry 4.0. It 
would be interesting to see the effect of supply chain connectivity on information sharing and finally 
on supply chain visibility.

Conclusion 
The study provides a clear picture on prior research works related to Industry 4.0 and supply chain 
sustainability. Further, a framework is proposed which can be tested by collecting data through survey 
2076","© IEOM Society International 
methodology. The design of smart warehousing, smart logistics and smart production systems through 
technology enabled automation is a major learning compared to past studies. Most importantly, the 
safety, security and sustainability parameters must be remembered while designing IIOT architecture 
in context to industrial systems. Change management, training and up grading of manpower is vital 
for meeting Industry 4.0 demands. The better managers know Industry 4.0 requirements, the better 
they are ready for adopting Industry 4.0 technologies in the supply chain network. Industry 4.0 enables 
supply chain connectivity and information sharing, the key to supply chain visibility which further 
leads to supply chain sustainability. 
 
4.1 Limitations, unique contributions and future research directions 
The only limitation of the study is the data, which has been obtained from the Scopus database which 
is dynamic and changes every second. However, the current study provides an overview of the number 
and nature of studies conducted in the field of Industry 4.0 and Sustainable Supply chain management. 
Future research work can be conducted to perform an empirical survey to test the model in a South 
African context and validate it through multiple case studies.

Abstract 
Greenhouse gases from power plants are a threat to society, biodiversity and food security. South Africa 
is relying on traditional methods such as coal to generate energy. The International Energy Agency (IEA) 
forecasts a global increase of greenhouse gases to about 62 billion tons in 2050. In order to reduce 
greenhouse gases release, it is necessary to develop GHG (Green House Gas) capture technologies and 
renewable energies. This research paper is based on the analysis of greenhouse gas technologies which 
are widely utilised to capture greenhouse emissions from fossil based power generation process. These 
capture technologies are: amine scrubbing and flue gas desulphurization (semi wet and wet). The research 
paper covers the following aspects, background of the GHG capture technologies, applications, 
efficiencies, economies of scale and summary of the operating philosophy. The paper also provides 
strategies that can be implemented to combat climate change. Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) 
methodology is used to analyse the input data and simulation of the results. AHP analysis is done on 
constituencies such as water consumption, reliability, capital expenditure and energy consumption of the 
greenhouse gas capture technologies. The results indicate the semi wet scrubber has an optimal cost 
benefit compared to other capture technologies.

1. Introduction
The world has since the year 2000 experienced the effects of global warming. The primary cause of the global 
warming is attributed to greenhouse gases from coal fired plants and chemical/petrochemical plants. Currently, coal 
is the primary source of energy globally; about 85% of power generation is from fossil fuels (Kapdi, et al., 2004). In 
order to reduce the concentration of GHG in the atmosphere, industrialized countries must reduce greenhouse gas 
emission levels to about 5.2% (Peter, et al., 2012). The International Energy Agency (IEA) pointed out that to 
achieve this goal, CO2 capture and storage technology is required. It is imperative to start developing and rollout 
more greenhouse gas capture technologies, such as amine scrubbing and flue gas desulphurisation in order to meet 
GHG reduction demand (Peter, et al., 2012). Research conducted at the Council for Scientific and Industrial 
Research (CSIR) provides analysis of the South African energy integrated resource planning. The study highlights 
that, investing more on renewable energies will translate to reduction of CO2 as well as water reduction since coal 
fired power generation uses substantial amounts of water for cooling processes. The CSIR study suggests that, South 
Africa should avoid building new coal fired powerand nuclear plants and focus on least cost mix for new 
regeneration capacity with emphasis on photo-voltaic, gas and wind energy. South Africa could save up to 87 
Billion rands by 2040 and could translate to 18% reduction in price of electricity per KWh if South Africa follows

Conclusion 
Considering all the climate change effects that have been experienced in recent years, it is essential that state organs 
prioritise implementation of greenhouse gases capture technologies and expedite development of renewable 
energies. Due diligence in selecting optimal GHG is imperative, constituents such as water consumption, reliability, 
energy efficiency are some of the critical fundamentals which can be used as a basis to select the most optimal GHG 
capture technology. The research has provided some strategies which can be implemented in reducing toxic gases, 
which are harmful to human lives and biodiversity. It is recommended that a pilot plant be built in South Africa in 
order to have practical analysis of the performance of GHG technologies. Comparative studies can then be 
performed in a more controlled environment.  The research has provided a balanced argument between renewable 
energies and fossil fuels. The research recommends implementation of renewable energies and fossil fuel plants 
should be fitted with GHG capture technologies.

ABSTRACT 
Technological advancement tends to influence the selection, manufacture and modification of ceiling 
materials. The properties of the ceiling materials have been improved upon in decades so that end users 
are comfortable psychologically, mentally and are able to escape in the event of fire outbreak caused by 
external factors due to the flame-retardant characteristics of the ceiling material. This study examines the 
evolution of ceiling and the factors responsible for the new product. Such factor involve the aesthetic, 
thermal comfort, thermal insulation properties, combustion properties and emission characteristics which 
tend to improve the overall product in terms of style and safety. Factors that still needed to be investigated 
are presented in this article. Stakeholders such as standard organizations, manufacturers, and consumers 
will begin to appreciate a viable wholesome ceiling material due to thorough cognizance of various 
properties to be embedded in the ceiling products thereby leading to a safer environment and delay in fire 
propagation.

Introduction
Technology involves the introduction of new method and initiative to solve problem. It is an essential element of 
globalization (Dahlman, 2007). Technology gives birth to modern man called, renaissance, which is a product of 
education (Kruss, McGrath, Petersen, & Gastrow, 2015). This is a technological revolution as the society in which 
man exists is now transformed (Sutton, 2013). A city with its future is sustainable due to the application of 
technological innovation (Goi, 2017). Innovation is an offshoot of technology which reveals the differences in the 
dispensation of man; gone where the era of transportation by animal; now is the age of different models of 
automobile (Auma, 2014). Consumers now have options to make in patronizing products of technology (Pae & 
Hyun, 2002). The transportation industry is thriving under the ascension of innovation (Mizuta, Swindler, Jacobson, 
& Kuciemba, 2013); better still a radical innovation (Morone, 1993). The construction industry especially the offsite 
type, is revealed to be the focal sector in the economy of the United Kingdom (Taylor, 2010), some construction 
type is traceable to the ancient Roman era (Vokes, Brennan, Bayliss, & Beck, 2013). The challenge technology 
poses to this industry is that of competitiveness in its operation and the option of choice of its products (Cakmak & 
Tas, 2012).  
Technological advancement made available options for the choice of ceiling materials. This is so due to various 
profiles, products and style of building ceilings. Ceiling is the location in a building that is opposite to a floor in a 
bungalow, or opposite the last floor of storey building. It is also the material that is connected to the base of roofing 
framework(Ashby, 2005). 
Ceiling have been applied to inhibit sound at balconies of buildings(X. Wang, Mao, Yu, & Jiang, 2015) which 
prevented the environment from commuter noise. The height and aesthetics of ceiling is perceived to influence the 
emotion of encountered occupants who engages in active or passive activities under it(Vartanian et al., 2015).

Abstract 
 
On the one hand, manufacturers, suppliers and vendors of equipment, spares and systems continuously 
seek ways to sustain their respective businesses. On the other hand, operators seek ways to concurrently 
minimise the costs of operating and maintaining turbomachinery whilst achieving increased reliability of 
associated equipment and systems. This brief paper is based on an investigation into product-to-service 
transformation and the effect on the relationship between manufacturers, suppliers, vendors and operators 
of equipment and machines deployed in a case study industrial environment.

Introduction 
 
Manufacturers, suppliers and vendors of equipment and machines are confronting numerous challenges arising from, 
inter alia, technological transformations and globalisation of logistic supply chains. In order to sustain their 
businesses, an approach that is increasingly being adopted by original equipment manufacturers (OEM), vendors 
and agents, value-adding resellers, system integrators, and original design manufacturers (ODM) is to augment their 
products with services. The concept of product-to-service transformation or servitisation (Vandermerwe et al 
1988:314) highlights the new phenomenon whereby manufacturers are supplementing existing and new products 
with service offerings of varying degrees. This means, on the one hand, that manufacturers, suppliers and vendors of 
equipment and machines are increasingly seeking ways to providing additional services to the clients who utilize 
(i.e., operate and maintain) such equipment and machines to achieve their own business objectives. 
 
Businesses that use equipment and machines to provide final consumer goods and services face similar 
unprecedented challenges often underpinned by extensive pressure to commoditize so as to grapple with the 
increasing customer demands for instant gratification of life-style ‘experiences’. Thus, on the other hand, users or 
operators of equipment and machines deployed in industrial processes concurrently seek ways to (i) increase 
reliability and availability, (ii) maximize useful life, as well as (iii) minimize operating costs and risks.  This paper 
arises from an investigation into product-to-service transformation and the effect of servitisation on the relationship 
between manufacturers (including suppliers and vendors), and operators of equipment and machines deployed in a 
case study industrial environment. Section 2 includes a brief overview on product-to-service transformation and 
servitisation, while some features of product-to-service models are outlined in section 3. An example of product-to-
service offerings to a user client is discussed in section 4 and some concluding remarks are included in section 5.

Product-to-Service Transformation and Servitisation  
 
The product-centric philosophy traditionally followed by most manufacturers was based on the convention that 
strategic advantage resides within the product and the brand, or that the product provides greater value to the 
manufacturer than to the customer (Fader 2012:20). As manufacturers pursued the conventional product-centric 
philosophy to gain market dominance, they also became exposed to the vagarious demands of the wide variety 
customers. The difficulty of satisfying vagarious demands of a large customer base further increased risks of

Concluding Remarks
The paper briefly discussed the emergent concept of servitisation and associated product-to-service transformation 
spurred on by rapid changes and evolutions in technologies, globalization, and consumer behavior. Although 
secondary data from literature suggests that manufacturers/suppliers/vendors are shifting from product-centric 
traditions towards customer-centric market-oriented product-service systems, however, the evidence garnered from a 
case study environment indicates that the transformation can, at best, be described as sluggish in this particular 
context. A muted point here is that the ten contract agreements manifesting three or more features of 
servitisation/PSS have each been in existence for at least five years.

Biogenic Waste to Energy Case Study- a strive for Energy 
Autonomy 
Busisiwe Patience Sigawuke 
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) 
Pretoria, South Africa 
psigawuke@csir.co.za  
Abstract 
The Energy Autonomous Campus program is aimed at making the CSIR Pretoria campus energy 
autonomous over a 5- to 8-year period by supplying its energy from the three primary energy sources – 
solar, wind and biogas. This platform will be used to demonstrate, in a real-world setting of significant size, 
a future energy system that is based on a combination of fluctuating and dispatchable renewables that can 
be designed and operated in the most cost-efficient manner. 
Figures from the World Bank (2016) indicates that South Africa is the 15th highest producer of waste in 
the world. According to (Godfrey et al., 2014) South  African waste  sector  survey results showed that  
landfilling remains  the  main technology  option for management  of  waste, with 90% of all waste generated 
disposed to landfills. Currently South Africa’s landfills are rapidly running out of space however policy 
and regulatory reforms, environmental pressure and increased sustainability awareness are changing the 
waste landscape. Estimates from Department of Environmental Affairs (2012) showed that only 10% of 
waste is recycled, therefore there is substantial room for industries to come up with solutions to reduce the 
amount of waste sent to landfills that can create a sustainable environment.  
One main focus of the Energy Autonomous Campus program is to establish a biogas plant that utilises 
biogenic waste for power generation. The biogas plant will provide a dispatchable electricity generation 
when solar and wind energy are not available. The plant will also make use of Combined Cooling, Heating 
and Power (CCHP) which will allow for increased efficiency. The security of feedstock supply is key in 
the success of the waste to energy project. The feedstock is expected to be 100% organic in both dry and 
liquid form. Three potential sites have been identified within the CSIR Pretoria campus for the location of 
the plant. To limit the cost of transporting waste to the biogas site, a virtual boundary of feedstock collection 
with a radius of 50km is considered. However, this boundary was not deemed to be prescriptive, meaning 
if a significant source of organic waste is identified slightly beyond this boundary, it would also be 
considered.  
In order to mitigate negative impacts of biogas facility on the ecosystem, the selection of right technology 
is important.  A feedstock study showed that a total of 49 tons of food waste could be sourced from the 
nearby areas daily. The biogas feedstock can be improved by co-digestion of sewage sludge and abattoir 
waste resulting in 0.5MW electrical capacity and 0.56 MW cooling and/or heating capacity. The feasibility 
study and technical design will determine the viability of the proposed project by providing a high-level 
business model. This model considers different ways to maximize outputs from biogas waste plant such as 
electricity, heat, organic fertilizer etc. 
This presentation will focus on a holistic approach of generating energy from waste for the CSIR, 
contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gases, waste in landfills and production of electricity as well as 
useful by-products and determining viability of the business case.

Abstract 
Modern thin film industries require precise tailoring of thin films properties to have excellent 
performance for specific applications intended. Thin film mechanical behavior and stress presents a 
technological challenge for material scientists, physics, and engineers. Atomic-scale understanding of the 
microstructure of thin films is a crucial aspect for the control and manipulation of the film properties for a 
wide range of industrial applications. Thin film growth of thin films influences the crystallographic 
orientation of grains, grain shape and distribution thereby affecting their reliability and performance of 
the material. This article reviews the present understanding of the mechanism(s) determining the 
microstructural evolution of thin films, defect formation, and the related failure modes. General trends in 
microstructural evolution, grain morphology, and texture formation mechanisms are briefly discussed in 
terms of their respective kinetic processes. The temperature dependency of the film microstructure 
evolution is described using the structure zone models.

1. Introduction
Modern technologies in industries producing dedicated thin film devise require precise control and manipulation of 
the thin films properties depending on the intended area of application. A thin film refers to a layer or multilayer of 
materials created by atomic or molecular particle condensation and having a thickness ranging from 10nanometers 
to 100micrometers(Adachi & Wasa, 2012). The use of thin film technology to harness the nature of atoms and 
molecules to achieve enhanced materials properties has significant commercial application and potential. In gas 
turbines engines, chemical and thermal inert thin surface films are used to increase engine efficiency and stability at 
elevated temperatures. Structural materials incorporate the tribological and mechanical properties of hard thin films 
to enhance properties and extend the lifetime of the materials they protect. Other applications of thin films include 
electronic, magnetic and micro chemical device and systems (Petrov, Barna, Hultman, & Greene, 2003).  The 
controlled synthesis( deposition) of thin films is a fundamental step in many applications since the properties, 
performance and reliability of the coatings are influenced by the microstructural characteristics of the films 
(Thompson, 2000).  Common techniques for thin film synthesis are illustrated in figure 1(Adachi & Wasa, 2012).

One of the other thin film defects is porosity. Irrespective of the thin film deposition method used, voids or pores 
will exist in the film due to phase transformation. Also, porosity may be caused by inadequacies of prior deposition 
such as cleaning, machining, and heat treatments. It has been reported that the material strength and ductility 
decrease with increasing porosity(Bourcier, Koss, Smelser, & Richmond, 1986; Potecaşu, Marin, & Potecaşu, 2015).

4. Conclusion 
 
The surface and microstructural evolution of thin films have been demonstrated. The kinetic energy and 
the surface diffusion of adatoms plays an important role in the size of grains, grain distribution and hence 
the crystal orientation of the film. Thin films are subjected to defects or flaws due to the nature of the 
synthesis (fabrication and deposition).  Presence internal stresses and voids in thin films are usually 
inevitable, such defects tends to lower the mechanical properties of the film making it susceptible to a 
various form of thin film modes aforementioned.  The understanding of surface evolution and defects 
formation in the thin film is of critical value since the performance of the thin film system is attributed to 
the influence of particles and propagation at scales as low as atomic level, hence this review.

Abstract: 
The large, complex IT project within a major South African bank, is a multi-faceted temporary 
organisation. Existing methodologies, standards and bodies of literature leave scope for the construction 
of a model that aides the customisation of a unique methodology for the individual, large, complex IT 
project. Distinct portions of a single, large, complex IT project may differ in terms of characteristics 
and in terms of the organisational unit that delivers the portion. These organisational units may have 
unique locations within or external to the organisation. It may be desirable for all or most portions of 
the total initiative to be managed as a single project. In such a case the project management methodology 
employed must provide a requisite variety of characteristics and adaptability to manage and integrate 
the diverse portions of the project. In lieu of these requirements, the Multi-Level Model of the large, 
complex project within the large South African bank is proposed. Literature regarding the tailoring of 
project management methodologies have developed from describing selection, to describing tailoring 
and more recently the fusion disparate project management methodologies. The Methodology 
Customisation Framework is proposed, presenting valuable and usable theory pertaining to project 
methodology customisation.

Introduction
This paper introduces two items that are intended to be simple and usable, addressing challenges identified in 
practice and corroborated by literature and publications by professional institutions. The goal is to improve the 
customisation of project management methodologies. The focus is on projects with technology components, in 
South Africa’s large banks. It is expected that the outcomes would be applicable to technology projects in general. 
Does project management methodology (PMM) matter? There is empirical literature indicating that the use of a 
PMM is correlated with improved success rates (Joslin & Muller, 2015), and the argument is supported by other 
publications (de Carvalho, Patah, & de Souza Bido, 2015) (Kerzner, 2018). The call for research regarding PMM 
tailoring, by the Project Management Institute (PMI, 2017) further supports the importance PMMs. 
Project management success rates are said to be improving (PMI, 2017), should research of project management 
(PMt) be prioritised? A report by Mckinsey in conjunction with Oxford university (McKinsey & Company, 2012) 
painted a stark picture of the failure of large IT projects often threatening the survival of the firm. Irrespective of

the project to adhere to organisational governance and compliance. Keeping to these agreements, the individual 
teams enjoy the freedom to follow to follow the PMM that optimally cater for their requirements. In this example 
the Systems Development (SD) component of the IT portion follows agile DSDM to deliver its part of the project, 
IT Infrastructure follows the procurement process and Marketing and Training prefers to deliver their portions 
following a traditionally sequenced approach. 
 
7. Conclusion - Validation of the MLM and MCF 
The MLM and MCF have been subjected to three initial validations. A research proposal of which the MLM and 
MCF forms part has been approved by a panel of industrial engineering academics in 2017. The MLM and MCF 
has been vetted by a limited group of professionals in the environment of large banks that range from business 
analyst with post-graduate engineering qualification, to senior business consultant with MBA degree, to business 
unit executive. The ideas behind the MCF has been introduced to the Cape Town chapter of the PMI. The value 
and usefulness of the MCF has been clear to all groups and valuable critique has been gathered and applied. The 
MLM and MCF will be presented at IEOM South Africa 2018 and thereafter, taking all feedback into 
consideration, the MLM and MCF will be finetuned and subjected to case study and peer-review through 2019. 
Validation by peer review seeks to test the theoretical adequacy of these propositions against existing PMt theory, 
management theory and systems theory. There is a need to enhance pluralism in PMt theory (Soderlund, 2011) 
and it would be worthwhile to test the outcomes against the goal of pluralism too. Therefore, the study will make 
specific reference to Soderlund’s schools of PM research and the approaches to PM research (Blomquist, Hallgren, 
Nilsson, & Soderholm, 2012). 
Validation in practice through case study is aimed at answering two unassuming, but most important, questions: 
Is the value, the benefit to the project environment, evident? Are the MLM and MCF simple enough to be usable? 
Usability is paramount and a current problem with PMt research is not that there is a lack of theory, but rather a 
lack of readily usable theory (Laufer, Hoffman, Russel, & Cameron, 2015). Project stakeholders across the 
organisational hierarchy will be introduced to these propositions in answering the two questions.  
While validating in large banks, the question will also turn to the current shortcomings experienced in dealing 
with 3rd party suppliers during projects. When validating with 3rd party suppliers, the question will also turn to the 
shortcomings in direction received from large banking clients.

The computation of airflow within the healthcare facilities (hospitals and clinics) is challenging. The 
balance of air ventilation and infection control within the facilities geometries is primarily a concern that 
requires detailed investigation. The objective of this work was to simulate airflow of various geometrical 
configurations of ducting system in building. The outcome being recommendations to air conditioning 
and ventilation designers for new healthcare buildings on placement of functional departments relative to 
airflow demands and quality. ANSYS® Fluent® 19.0 a student commercial package for Computational 
Fluid Dynamics (CFD) was used to provide flow visualization and the magnitude pollutant species in the 
airflow at the healthcare facility. The results will be compared to experimental data from lab-built 
apparatus for various duct designs.

Airborne; ventilation; Computational Fluid Dynamics; modelling; health care facility. Pollutant species 
1. Introduction
Air ventilation is the system/method used to allow natural/mechanical airflow to get into the building with the 
intention of replacing the existing air in the area mostly for healthier respiration. In the healthcare facilities, 
Ventilation is one of the most reliable methods of creating comfortable and health friendly environment for 
personnel together with the machineries. Ventilation airflows in the healthcare facility are the most important aspect 
from the mechanical engineering scope. One of the most difficult tasks Mechanical engineers face is getting the 
ventilation airflow balancing correct and effectively addressing the space comfort issue as well as airborne infection 
control. 
There are different types of ventilation airflow systems offered in the building constructions, but the most 
dominating systems are natural air ventilation, mechanical/convectional air ventilation and mixed air ventilation. 
Natural air ventilation is the system that completely relies of natural air coming in and leaving the space. Its airflow 
directions and magnitude depend on the orientation and geometry of building. This system is used in the non-critical 
areas of the building departments. Mechanical air ventilation is the system that is made up of mechanical component 
to collect and supply air in the required space. Its airflow direction and magnitude depends of the air handling units, 
ducting and diffusers. Most of the critical spaces of the building use mixed air ventilation. This is the combination of 
the natural and mechanical air ventilation. It suits better in the departmentalized building structures, with critical and 
non-critical spaces. 
The figure below shows the modelling geometry of typical consultation room in the healthcare facility. The air 
(containing Nitrogen) comes from the inlet and reacts with ethyl-alcohol-air in the room. The reactant mixture 
leaves through the outlet duct. The room has square area of 9 meters with the ceiling height of 3 meters.

Fluent velocity vectors and streamline model. 
 
Figure 9: Fluent Velocity vectors 
 
 
 
Figure 10: Fluent Velocity streamline 
The two figures above display the vectors and streamline of the fluent in the model; the velocity vector and 
streamline are higher on the outlet because they are drawn with 8m/s while supplied at 6m/s from the inlet. The 
velocity profiles drop as the fluent travels and circulate along in the room. 
 
 
 
 
 
Conclusions 
The CFD model validate that ethyl-alcohol-air can react with the airborne. Further work will still need to be 
completed on modelling and experiments in order to improve or validate the results. The anticipated outcome results 
should not only prove that ethyl-alcohol-air can breakdown or weaken airborne species. Results should also prove 
that the resulting air is good for inhaling without any negative effects and it is viable as far as the cost benefits 
analysis is concern. The required supplied air to channel out this airborne will change if the experiment tests proves 
positive for engineering design and cost implications. The ethyl alcohol-air will have to subsidize the supplied air 
and reduce the energy usage of the air handling unit system.

Abstract 
Automation in construction has shown a great advantage in the construction industry for execution of 
different types of work in construction in terms of increasing production, cost reduction, resolving labour 
issue and delivering project on time. Problem faced in construction had been studied and inventors designed 
new robotics and construction automation to mitigate those problems. This study focused on assessing the 
level of willingness to adopt robotics and construction automation in South Africa. Literatures were 
reviewed and with the findings obtained from the administered questionnaire, the objective of the study 
was achieved. Respondents were chosen from the population of construction professional and retrieved data 
was analysed. The study indicated that construction professionals are willing to adopt robotics and 
construction automation. Although reviewed literatures showed there are barriers to the adoption of 
Robotics and Construction Automation. The study concluded that construction automation and robotics 
would have positive effects on the delivery of the construction project by increasing quality of the 
construction product, enhancing supervision, improving working conditions, cost effectiveness and it will 
also reduce construction accidents if adopted. It was recommended that government provide subsidies to 
encourage construction professionals in getting necessary technology for the adoption of robotics and 
construction automation.

1. Introduction
Productivity is slow without the use of construction technology (Bock, 2008). Construction is an industry that is 
identified to have more accidents and workers dying at work. Collapsing of the building is the main factor of fatalities 
in construction and falling from heights. Till today construction had proved that implementation of construction 
automation is required for the purpose of lifting heavy materials because cranes are faster than workers in moving 
materials from one point to where it is required and it is a safer way to avoid accidents. To avoid material from falling, 
cranes are automated with computers that calculate the weight of the material to ensure that it is not beyond the lifting 
capacity of the crane. The use of robots is proven to be safer, prototypes are developed to improve the quality of 
machines and to be user-friendly in order to reduce fatalities in the construction industry (Chonnaparamutt & Birk, 
2006). Quality can be achieved using construction automation because machines are more precise than worker and 
advanced software in the factory are used to automate the machines so that it can reject the product that does not meet 
required standards. Factory specializing in the precast concrete use concrete cubes to check the quality of the 
components by using robotic hydraulic, records of readings are then examined to see if they meet the required 
standards and rejected if they fail the test. Precast components are manufactured in a controlled environment so that 
temperature that causes cracks to a concrete can be avoided, they are allowed to pass through laser sensor to check for 
quality, information is captured on the computer as report of component, save time to check the product manually 
(Kwen & Cheong, 2005).

5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
The study indicated that there is willingness to adopt robotics and construction automation in South Africa 
construction industry. This shows that the professionals are ready to adopt Robotic and Construction automation so 
as to improve working conditions, increase the level of productivity of workers, improve health and safety, improve 
scheduling and upgrade the overall performance of construction projects. Literatures revealed that robotics and 
construction automation have barriers in gaining ground in the society. Automation has been considered expensive 
and professionals are not willing to adopt because of threats robotics has on workers, society, and construction 
professional. This study concludes by revealing that construction professionals are ready for the adoption of 
automation and robotics which will have positive effect on the delivery of the construction project by increasing 
quality of the construction product, enhancing supervision, improving working conditions, cost effectiveness and it 
will also reduce construction accidents. It is therefore recommended that there is the need for government to subsidies 
and lower interest rate so as to encourage construction professionals take loans which will give them opportunity to 
acquire the necessary technology for the adoption of robotics and construction automation.

Abstract 
This study critically examines the cost information management system used in the Nigerian construction 
industry and its impact on project performance. It also explores and identifies the current cost information 
management practices in the Nigerian construction industry, the sources cost information, as well as the 
underlying factors responsible for poor management of construction cost information. A quantitative 
research method was adopted, using a structured questionnaire which was administered to practitioners in 
the Nigerian construction industry using a web base survey. A total of 45 responses were received from 
the questionnaire administered, out of which 7 were partially completed and 38 fully completed. The 
empirical findings revealed that many construction practitioners in Nigeria adopt in-house cost 
information management techniques such as QMATE Estimating Software, Microsoft Excel etc. One of 
the major limitations identified is the non-existence of national cost database system in the Nigerian 
construction industry. The study provides a comprehensive insight into how project cost information can 
be managed effectively to aid successful delivery of construction projects in Nigeria. It proposes strategic 
recommendations one of which is have an effective national cost database which construction 
practitioners and stakeholders draw information for project planning through to completion.

Abstract 
The disruptive technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT) are encouraging innovation in 
different sectors. Smart cities and infrastructure, smart energy, smart industry, and smart 
health are as a result of the application of the IoT concept. But how effective is IoT in the 
disaster risk management field? Strengthening capacity for Disaster Risk Management 
(DRM) has been a trending theme at international conferences. Substantial reduction of new 
and existing disaster risk is a target. This paper evaluates the potential of IoT technologies 
in reducing disaster risk, and recommends a framework for Disaster Risk Management Best 
Practice (DRMBP) on transforming ordinary objects to intelligent devices. A comparative 
case study analysis on DRM is conducted to contrast the benefits between GPS/Seismic 
station (not “smart” devices) and M2M devices. Based on the findings, IoT technologies are 
effective Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) tools. A framework for how systems will come 
together (IoT platform) for purposes of DRR is developed and recommended.

Introduction
“Earthquakes don’t kill people, buildings do”[Dunn, 2016]. Although natural hazards are inevitable, 
materialization into disasters can be prevented or mitigated[Opadeyi, 2008]. Disasters pose a serious 
challenge to achieving sustainable development, globally [Twigg, 2015]. This observation is 
supported by the endless occurrence of disasters in different parts of the world. What is problematic 
is that even  technologically advanced countries like Japan and United States of America, countries 
that have invested in building networks of Earth Observation (EO) systems, as Disaster Risk 
Management (DRM) tools, are devastated by disasters  [Zhou, 2014].    
International agreements like the Sendai Framework (2015) for Disaster Risk Reduction (SFDRR) 
(2015-2030) acknowledged the significant shift from disaster management to DRM . The rise in 
human and economic costs encouraged this shift. Safe Site Selection (SSS) which is regarded as a 
critical phase in infrastructure development is generally not considered. As a result, so much money 
is invested in building cities in hazard-prone areas. Aleppo, a city in Syria, and Japan[Yamasaki, 
2012], are built in active faults, introducing disaster risk, in turn human and economic assets are left

Conclusion
One of the many contributing factors that lead to disaster losses is not having the necessary 
information at the right time. The study determined the opportunity for IoT solution to improve 
disaster risk reduction. The researcher conducted an exploratory study, analysing multiple cases, in 
order to determine if IoT is the appropriate technology  to improve risk reduction. The findings 
revealed that IoT is the right technology for the reduction of human and economic losses. Technology 
transfer is moving slowly, capacity is a challenge to most countries, and financial constraints 
contribute to countries not affording to implement such solutions.  
This study recommends to countries; hazard prone or not, to invest in IoT technologies, as it is proving 
to be efficient systems for everyday living. Based on the findings of this research, for countries to 
realize the Priorities for Action as outlined in the Sendai Framework (2015), they need to consider 
investing in these industrial technologies (Industry 4.0 as a whole).

Introduction
Industry 4.0 describes the digital transformation of information across the horizontal and vertical 
chains of an enterprise. Industry 4.0 escalates automation in manufacturing processes by utilizing the 
artificial intelligence network and the micro level sensors. Industry 4.0 is tangible and intended to 
include technologies and embedded processes. Industry 4.0 integrates various business subsets i.e. 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) and Plant Control 
(PC).  Industry 4.0 is being applied in several industrial sectors i.e. steel, oil, gas, energy, pulp and 
paper.  
The pulp and paper industry manufactures a range of paper grades and paper-based packaging by 
utilizing wood traded globally. Contemporary challenges for producing higher volumes of products 
with minimum lead-time and higher quality actuate the pulp and paper industry to drive production 
systems further. Improvement in the production rate of the pulp and paper industry is possible with 
the application of industry 4.0.

Abstract 
The manufacturing and service sectors are the most dominant sectors that propelled the rapid growth and 
development of many industrialized nations. They are regarded as the engine of growth. However, their 
performances have remained largely slow in Nigeria. Therefore, the research investigated the influence of 
the manufacturing and service sectors on Nigeria’s economic growth and development in the period under 
review. The methodology employed to test the levels of stationarity of the variables is the Augmented 
Dickey-Fuller, while the dependent variable proxied by GDP and that of the independent variables are 
manufacturing sector, value added, service sector, value added, government expenditure and consumer 
price index. The obtained results indicated all variables are of order one. Also, the study found the 
existence of a long run relationship existing among the variables of manufacturing and service sectors 
which are positive and significant meaning that as the manufacturing and service sectors grow, the 
economy also grows rapidly. The recommendations of the study among other things are that the central 
authorities should, therefore, endeavor to massively invest and boost the infrastructural needs of the 
manufacturing and service sectors of the economy to further enhance the economic growth potentials of 
the economy.

1. Introduction
The expansion of the manufacturing and service sectors are generally seen as the greatest crucial machine of the 
development process. Kaldor (1966, 1967) suggests that the growth of manufacturing output with respect to the 
GDP have a strong positive affiliation. Which is founded on specific features of the manufacturing sector, thereby, 
making it the significant input of GDP increase well as reduces the poverty rate in the country? Firstly, inert and 
energetic growing revenues to scale are features of manufacturing activities, in the same vein, diminishing returns 
are tantamount to other non-manufacturing activities (Kaldor, 1966: Olamade and Oni, 2016).  
Growth law as postulated by Kaldor (1966), which were created based on the GDP increase characteristics of the 
manufacturing sector. It says that the manufacturing sector is a key determinant of the rapid increase in the GDP of 
the country.  He also enacted a law that describes the efficiency of the manufacturing sector, stating its own 
contribution to its increases, that is, the output of the manufacturing sector has contributed vastly to its own growth. 
He lays emphasis on the efficiency of the other sectors aside from the manufacturing sectors, on how their output 
has also positively enhanced the great increase in the manufacturing segment(Olamade and Oni, 2016). 
It is important to know that the manufacturing sector offers no positives inputs at the initial stage of development, it 
is ultimately strengthened by the “post-Keynesian growth model” in line with the hypothesis used by Kaldor’s in his 
study called ‘engine of growth’. Some of the important features of the manufacturing sector are to promote its 
competitiveness in the long-run and bring about helpful and resourceful advantage to every other significant 
segment of the country economy.

autonomous component of the model. Independent variables of the regression model are not statistically significant. 
The autonomous component also is not affected by variations in the descriptive variables.     
The obtained R2 of 0.94, meaning 94% of the total disparity of Gross Domestic product level in Nigeria is elucidated 
by the chosen explanatory variables. Occurring as the golly of fit of the regression persisted to be high despite 
altering for the degree of autonomy as showed by the accustomed R squared: 92%. The Durbin Watson statistics 
(1.985) is higher than the R2 (0.94) which implies that the model is non-spurious. The Durbin-Watson statistics 
suggest the absence of autocorrelation.  
Manufacturing sector value addition is found to be positive and significant. The study observed a positive 
association between manufacturing and GDP. As manufacturing output grows, this is expected to spur economic 
growth. This positive and significant relationship is also observed in the first and second-period lags of the variable. 
Similarly, the result of the service sector value addition was found to be positive. The research also noted a positive 
relationship between the service sector performance and GDP. This means that as the service sector output grows, 
this is expected to lead to economic growth. This positive and significant relationship is also observed in the third 
period lag of the variable.  
Also, the Agric sector value added is shown to be positive and significant. This shows that as the Agric sector output 
increases, so did the GDP. This was also observed for the first period lag of the variables. 
Consumer price index which represents inflation is shown to be negative and significant. This follows our a priori 
expectation that a continuous rise in the prices of goods and services do often affect economic growth negatively as 
it makes it difficult for policymakers to make robust monetary policies 
4. Conclusion and Recommendations 
The study studiously examined the accomplishments of Nigerian manufacturing and service sectors, and its impact 
on the Nigerian economic growth using time series data for Nigeria. It was observed that its accomplishments in the 
initial time covered by the study were a relatively static period, while the concluding years showed some recovery in 
the performance of the economy. The study largely agrees with the previous works of Soderhom and Teal (2002), 
which noted that the more the manufacturing and service sectors grow and become more efficient, the more the 
export volume, the more the revenue to investment and the better the payment to workers and hence their well being. 
The study, therefore, recommends the following that: 
1. All efforts should be geared towards ensuring the production of value-added products and the creation of 
new inter-sectoral linkages to ensure a more integrated production structure in the nation. 
2. The Federal government should critically address the high infrastructure deficit been experienced by the 
manufacturing sector especially the epileptic and erratic power supply, poor roads network and the 
provision of potable water.  
3. Also, the Federal government should enter into a joint partnership with private firms in investing in 
manufacturing activities that will trigger sustainable economic growth in Africa especially in technology 
components, human capital development and other areas that are critical to development. 
4. Initiating and sustaining the right policies to encourage foreign direct investment and foreign investors will 
be a right step in the right direction.

Abstract 
A drying machine for selected vegetable extracts under varying temperatures and moisture content was 
developed. The machine consists of sub-components: belt and pulley system; dryer enclosure; conveyor 
assembly; air fans; heat sources; product feeder; and other accessories. The power transmitted by the belt 
and pulley system was designed as 72.53 W. The speed of the dryer shaft and length of the belt that connect 
the motor and dryer pulleys together were estimated to be 60 rpm and 957.94 mm respectively with tension 
values of 176.77 N (T1) and 22.46 N (T2) on tight and slack sides of the belt. The designed value for the 
diameter of the dryer shaft for full strength was estimated as 10.7 mm. The conveyor belt length, corrected 
factor, belt speed, belt capacity, belt power and pressure loss through the belt were estimated to be 1070 
mm, 1.035, 0.47 m/s, 0.279 kg/s, 11.57 W and 450 Pa respectively. The mass of the load per unit length of 
the belt was 2.14 kg/m. While the maximum belt tension and feed flow rate on the conveyor belt which the 
machine can handle were 388.4 N and 1.01 kg/s (3636 kg/hr) respectively. The drying rate of 0.856 kg/s at 
fresh air rate of 9.51 kg/s was obtained. The thermal energy requirement of the heating chamber was 1352.3 
W over the heat transfer area of 4.55×10-4 m2. The electrical power of the conveyor dryer was 46.11 W 
while overall efficiency of the machine was estimated as 71.64 %.

1. Introduction
Vegetable plants are important in any society for consumption and also used for natural supplement that contain 
substances which could be used for treatment purposes or used to produce drugs. These plants have been reportedly 
used in the treatment of ailments such as stomach disorder, fever symptoms and cough traditionally (Udochukwu, et 
al., 2015). Sequel to this, it is imperative to preserve the vegetable plants from spoilage and bacteria attack. 
Traditionally, most people particularly farmers expose their crops to the sun by spreading them widely to dry before 
storage. Example of some of these vegetables are: scent leaf and bitter leaf (Muazu et al., 2013). Sun drying still 
remains the most widespread method of food preservation due to its simplicity and low cost (Chua and Chou, 2013). 
Several drying machines have been designed and fabricated to solve the problems being experienced by traditional 
methods but still faced with the challenges of human intervention and their inability to dry varieties of vegetable at 
different drying temperature and moisture content using a single drying machine (Mujumdar, 2015). Therefore, a 
drying machine that will flow with vegetable extracts process plant with little or no human intervention can be 
implemented to simplify the existing method. This will not only reduce the labour cost but also retain the quality of 
the vegetable plants at required temperatures (Asaolu et al., 2012). 
Vegetable plants can be dried in the sun, in an oven or in a food dehydrator by using the right combination of warm 
temperatures, low humidity and air current (Harrison and Elizabeth, 2009). Drying process can be classified into batch, 
where the material is inserted into the drying equipment and drying proceeds for a given period of time, and as 
continuous, where the material is continuously added to the dryer and dried material continuously removed (Ayodeji 
et al., 2012). There are different types of dryers for agricultural foodstuffs, among which are fluidized bed dryer; 
spouted bed dryer; solar drying; conveyor infrared drying; low-cost convective dryers; and desiccant drying (Desrosier,

rise to overheating of any region inside the drying chamber thereby effectively removing moisture through the pipes 
to the ambient.   
Inferring from the thermal fluid simulation carried out on the heating zone of the machine in examining the 
temperature gradient, the heat flux and temperature distribution in the model as well as the heat exchange between the 
designed model and its environment, it is summarily observed that the range of temperature generated by the heater 
was between 130 oC and 170 oC. As the air flows into the chamber, the temperature decreases to the required range of 
temperatures required to dry the leaves hygienically whose values were 50 oC and 60 oC and was achievable around 
the dryer maximum temperature of 160 oC. Stress analysis carried out on the machine frame showed the maximum 
stress of 8.756 Mpa under the action of equivalent load of 409.13 N.  The static analysis also revealed the maximum 
displacement of 0.042 mm. Thus, the machine is efficient for drying vegetable extracts and its preservation.

5. Conclusion 
 
A robust designed drying machine for selected vegetable extracts under varying temperatures and moisture has been 
proposed and implemented in this paper. The designed concept has been discussed while thermal simulation was 
carried out to validate and verify the reality of the concept. Simulation results indicated that the proposed dryer 
machine’s design was appropriate and suitable for fabrication.

Abstract 
The design of pulverized and packaging machine is discussed. The pulverizer and packaging machine were 
designed using appropriate design equations. From design analysis, the speed of the pulverizer shaft, belt 
velocity, maximum belt tension and power transmitted by the pulverizer belt were 900 rpm, 5.89 m/s, 317.9 
N and 1771.2 W respectively. In the same analysis, 102.3 N of centrifugal force was estimated to be acting 
on the hammers, while the torque acting on the pulverizer pulley and maximum sheer stress on the shaft 
were 18,794.4 Nmm and 2.5 N/mm2. The velocity of the conveyor belt and conveyor capacity were 1.07 
m/s and 30.3 tons/hr while the effective tension of the conveyor belt and horse power required to drive the 
conveyor belt were 201.8 N and 1.5 Hp respectively. The design was simulated using ANSYS to check the 
structural stability and functionality of the system. Simulation results showed that the maximum 
deformation experienced by the milling mechanism was 7.284 mm while the maximum static and dynamic 
load was not more than 131 Mpa.  The beater mechanism had the maximum deformation of 1.283 x 10-5 
mm while the twisting and bending moment was 25707 pa. The maximum stress imposed by the static and 
dynamic load on the storage device was 12 Mpa at the deformation of 0.016 mm. Packaging machine 
component had an average factor of safety of 3.5. The results of the design and simulations showed that the 
machine is safe for the selected working conditions.

1. Introduction
Vegetables which includes fruits, leaves, fungi, bulbs, tubers, seeds. stems, roots, and flowers, are the edible parts of 
plant that are consumed as food (Iheanacho et al., 2009). Vegetables are majorly cultivated and consumed by humans 
in many parts of the world particularly in the view of the fact that it plays significant role in human nutrition and 
consequentially beneficial to human health (Craig and Beck, 1999). Vegetables are major source of vitamins, dietary 
fibres, minerals and phytol-chemicals which is strongly associated with overall good health and protects the body by 
reducing the risk of cancer, heart diseases, anaemia, gastric ulcer, diabetes and other chronic diseases (Prior et al., 
2000 and Keatinge et al., 2010) 
The perishable nature of vegetables resulting to post-harvest losses has brought the need for further processing so it 
can easily be packaged and preserved for future usage. However, Vegetable processing is dominated by small-scale 
producers and this is done traditionally without any standardization. Traditional method of processing vegetables 
includes; sun drying, grinding with a mortar and pestle and hand sieving and packaging. The problems connected with 
this method of processing include; poor hygienic, loss of vegetable during grinding and packaging, time wastage 
during processing and low production rate. The development of a pulverizing and packaging machine will ultimately 
reduce the aforementioned challenges.

The maximum deformation experienced by the temporary storage device (Fig. 7a) when the valve was closed is 1.5815 
e-5 m (red portion) which is not enough to affect the stability of the system and from Fig. 7(b), the maximum stress 
imposed by the static and dynamic load is 12 MPa which is far below the yield stress of stainless steel. This implies 
that the temporary storage device can withstand the stress imposed on it and the valve is capable of preventing the 
flow of the milled leaf after the milled leaf has completely filled the jar on the packaging machine. 
 
 
3.4 Packaging Machine Components with the Machine Frame Simulation (PMCMF) 
 
The PMCMF mechanism was subjected to both static and dynamic load as well as the result of the discrete phase 
analysis earlier carried out. The conveyor roller was subjected to a rotation of 200 rpm and the conveyor belt was 
loaded with load equivalent of ten (10) filled jar of 500g/Jar. The result is as shown in Fig. 8. 
 
 
 
Fig. 8. Packaging Machine Component with The Machine Frame (PMCMF) Simulations 
 
The maximum factor of safety is between 2 and 5 which implies that the system can withstand at least twice the load 
it is subjected to. This shows that the system will work effectively. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
A pulverizing and packaging machine for vegetable powder production has been proposed and presented in this paper. 
The design concept adopted and the design analysis required for reliable production of vegetable powder has been 
discussed. The simulated results obtained indicate that the system is effective and safe for fabrication. The magnitude 
of stresses (including bending and twisting) experienced are not enough to impair the conditions of the machine in 
real life or when being used.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 is knocking on South African miners’ doors, with the introduction of a digital mine 
increasingly becoming seemingly important for their survival and success. In order for mines to 
remain competitive, digital innovations will be needed in the future to increase productivity. This 
paper looks at an artificial intelligent technique in order to assist in the control of shuttle vehicles 
in the coal mining industry. Since the bord and pillar mining technique is used, shuttle car 
movements are based on queuing, shortest paths and path constraints. A graphical user interface 
(GUI) was designed in order to assist mining operators. The algorithms used in this optimization 
of these cars are Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm, K-shortest path algorithm and discrete event 
simulation. In order to test this application, simulations and test results were carried out using 
Matlab. 
Keywords 
Industry 4.0, Dijkstra’s algorithm, K-shortest path algorithm, discrete event simulation, artificial intelligence. 
1. Introduction
Current mining processes do not possess the visibility to real time and accurate information. Therefore, the ability to 
track performance and increase equipment uptime is hindered. With the introduction of the fourth industrial 
revolution, industries will change the way they operate. Individuals, communities, but particularly organisations 
lives will be disrupted. Mines are no exception to this rule, with implications and important opportunities. 
2. Brief History
Coal mining in South Africa can be traced back to the beginning of gold mining towards the end of the 19th century, 
the first coal being extracted on the Highveld coalfield close to the earliest Witwatersrand gold mines. As the

dynamic weights), and the new path is selected for car 3 (blue arrows). 
 
The final step was to create a queuing system; this was done using discrete event simulation, this was important so 
that cars do not collide and since they have trailing power cables, damages to these cables could occur if the cars 
rode over them. In this case First-in-First-out, the 1st shuttle car arrives at the destination will leave first, the 2nd and 
3rd shuttle cars would que near to the destination, and only once the destination is vacant the 2nd car will move into 
that space, once the 2nd car has left, the 3rd car will occupy that space. This process then continues as a cycle from 
source to destination, until the operator changes all inputs to the GUI to map a new route. 
 
6. Conclusion  
 
The development of shortest path algorithms to navigate through environments is a continuing area of research. 
When paths can be logically decomposed into a collection of routes and intersections, such environments can be 
represented by a graph. Edges of the graph can be assigned a cost, representing the expense of traversing a route 
between two graph nodes. Algorithms such as Dijkstra’s shortest path operate on these graphs to find paths with a 
minimal summed edge cost. Thus, different routes can be favoured or avoided by weighting graph edges with some 
metric associated of the environment. The distance travelled along a route is the most frequently used, but other 
measures such as traffic congestion can also be used. 
 
Many techniques to be employed for such applications are still being determined. Crucial tasks such as these are 
directly linked to operational efficiencies. The designed system in this paper is a positive step forward in solving this 
issue, at the same time taking steps to include the new industrial revolution. There is room for vast improvement to 
the concept such as the monitoring of real time data underground i.e. knowing the exact location of the shuttle cars, 
since GPS and other techniques are not readily available underground.

Acceptance of a new reporting platform for work experience 
reporting in an Engineering discipline 
Abstract 
Technology has become crucial to the success of learning design, and more so in the recent years. The 
success of technological solutions depends on its acceptance within the target community of users, which 
in most cases is the student community it is meant to serve; but when it succeeds, it can be a great enabler 
of learning. A department in a University decided to migrate from the paper based approach submission 
of students’ vacation work report to electronic based submission. Adapting this technology platform to 
continue to meet student needs is important, and so, it is necessary to understand the students’ perception 
of the new submission system. Students were requested to complete questionnaires related to their 
perception of the system relative to the traditional system in order to guide the future evolution. The basic 
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used to elicit students’ changeover experience. Results 
suggest that the changeover is acceptable to the students, and the basic TAM hypotheses postulated seem 
empirically supported. Moreover, it seems the category of students that have used the previous paper 
based submission appreciated the shift more than those that had little contact with the old system.

1. Introduction
The advent of the digital social media era and the related solutions has been transforming the learning environment. 
Technology has created opportunities for learning that enable the use of electronic platforms and tools in creating 
flexible and user-friendly learning environments that is well adapted to the students’ diverse needs. Many learning 
institutions have also been migrating from the traditional mortar and brick and paper based learning solutions to 
electronic platforms. 
Technology has been driving changes in education and also changing teaching styles and approaches. This is 
creating a shift from the traditional classroom style into a class space style, providing a lot more flexibility in how 
students consume information and how they expect study materials and teaching to be delivered. This has affected 
not only the didactics of teaching itself, but also how many other aspects of learning are planned and implemented. 
Engineering students all over the world are mandated to acquire some industry related experience during the period 
of their training. The students are usually requested afterwards to submit different kinds of written reports and 
probably log-books detailing what was learnt during such industry exposure and how they have been able to apply 
the learnings they acquired in classes and during practicals before such industry training experience was undertaken. 
In the case department studied here, the students usually produce such reports in the form of long written essays and 
then submit hard copies of such. 
In the last two years, the department decided to change the model of submission. One of the goals of the submission 
is to make all such reports project based such that students report along the lines of projects they were involved in 
during such industry learning experience as opposed to writing documents of their daily chores in the industry. This 
is to help to focus on learning as derived from such experience, which usually comes in the form of participation in 
group (or individual) projects. Another goal was to generate the report in such a way that is easy to collect learning 
meta-data that can be used to evaluate the process of industry learning and improve the classroom learning and 
preparation process. In addition, this should help to further structure the organisation of the modules presented to 
students in the engineering program and have a view of how often and where each of the techniques learnt in the 
modules are applied in the industry. Hence, effort was made to standardise the report such that a portion is 
completed through an online form posted via google document, while a short descriptive report is further submitted 
online. It is anticipated that such migration might create some temporary discomfort among the students who have to

Conclusion 
The acceptance of the new submission platform for the submission of undergraduate students’ vacation work report. 
The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) adapted and a Structural Equation Model was developed. The result 
indicated that the TAM model hypotheses were supported by the data collected. This suggests that perceived ease of 
use and perceived usefulness are important factors to consider in engendering acceptability of leaning management 
solutions. The qualitative ranking of the features of the submission system also indicated that the ability to work, 
save and return to continue is about the most desirable feature of the system. Such information is useful in guiding 
the future development of the platform. It is recommended that an expanded system would be developed to see the 
effects of other moderating variables like mobile app capability, real-time data capture in log-form, and other such 
technology enhancement capabilities on the acceptance of the learning system.

The Exploration of Modern Noise Control Measures for 
Mining Operations

Abstract 
Operations managers are confronted with both first-level noise control (noise engineering) and second-level 
(hearing conservation) measures. The exploration of the full spectrum noise control is highlighted by a case 
study of South Africa’s largest gold mining group. While modern factories will use sound cameras and new 
types of electromagnetic noise will occur, mine workers are continuously more exposed to potentially 
dangerous noise levels than to similar levels of any other noxious agent. The paper shows how second-level 
measures are not further compromised with second best quality. It focuses on a best-practice hearing 
conservation case, designed and implemented (maintained) on a large scale for more than 25 000 mine 
workers. The paper contributes to the prevention of NIHL (noise-induced hearing loss) and provides 
management with an overview and practical principles for best-practice noise control.   
Keywords  
Noise pollution; noise-induced hearing loss; noise engineering; hearing conservation; mining case study 
Background to the Problem 
The science of sound, noise, acoustics and vibration is technical and complex. The control of the physical laws of 
sound is necessary for reasons of productivity, quality of life and health. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
(MIT), the University of South Hampton’s Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR) and highly ranked journals 
such as the Sound and Vibration Journal, the Noise Control Engineering Journal and the Journal of the Acoustical 
Society of America are leading contributors to the challenge.  
Millions of healthy life years are lost because of traffic noise pollution and noise became the second biggest health 
risk in Europe. With all the technologies available, mine workers are still more exposed to potentially dangerous noise 
levels than to similar levels of any other noxious agent. Occupational hygiene of humans is at risk due to the negative 
impact of noise on general health and productivity, affecting tasks requiring accuracy rather than speed. Noise also 
detrimentally affects demanding tasks, especially those requiring attention to multiple signal sources. Noise-induced 
hearing loss (NIHL) compensation statistics are so alarming as to be unbelievable. Noise and NIHL should therefore 
not merely be accepted as a common, inevitable fact of life. Nobody should continue to ‘whisper to’ the problem and 
first defences against noise should be first priority.   
The problem is also underlined by desperate pharmaceutical companies seeking quick fixes by pursuing drug therapy 
in their search for developing an oral capsule for (NIHL). Many other industries such as the military are in dire straits 
in seeking a drug that will prevent hearing loss if taken just before noise exposure, or for treatment after exposure. 
Hearing damage is unfortunately detected too late in most cases and the conventional audiogram (measuring hearing 
status in terms of frequencies and sound levels) needs to be improved (see OAE technology in the case study). 
If the noise epidemic in the world could kill it would have been declared as a pandemic by the World Health 
Organization (WHO). The state of affairs is exacerbated by the complacent culture of acceptance of the problem 
because noise is natural to the science of physics and the gradual harm and insidious nature of NIHL is deceiving.

ventilation and localisation which are important features needed by mine workers. Communication ability can only be 
measured accurately by using audiometry tests for speech discrimination and speech detection tests. Apart from those 
tests communication ability remains very subjective. However, the results indicate that very few people are able to 
identify or realise that they have some degree of communication loss. This may be due to the brain’s ability to 
compensate for each situation as well as other coping strategies such as lip reading, also depending on background or 
environmental noise. The positive aspect is that a small percentage of employees of the gold mines indicated that they 
have communication problems when in noise or when it is quiet. 
At the end of 2015 the gold mines fitted a total of 23 450 employees with custom-made HPDs and the single most 
significant positive change was in terms of behaviour and ownership. The employees indicated that they are very 
satisfied with a hearing protector that is largely comfortable (in all dimensions). The behaviour change is an outcome 
from the integration of all the HCP embedded in the personal consultations and engagements with each employee. 
The program manager however does allow limited flexibility for other types of HPDs and the exceptions in 2015 were 
746 for non-use, 3 530 disposable types and only four earmuffs.  
 
Core observations of the case 
 
The primary findings from the case (based on the 2015 data) of the South African gold mine are:  
 
(A) International benchmark - the case of the largest gold mining groups in Africa and their buy-into the scope 
and complexity of this program is significant and a world-first.   
(B) The outsourced service-providing company portrays the ability to be lean and agile in terms of several 
operations management performance objectives.   
(C) Second-level noise control was demonstrated by means of a best-practice HCP. It distinguished itself in four 
unique dimensions with unique process technologies such as the OAE and sophisticated HPDs.     
(D) The scope in terms of the cumulative facts and figures of the case are: individuals tested (25 560), 
questionnaires recorded (27 179), high risk (above 68% damage) (13 017), individuals referred for wax (909) 
and those referred to the doctor for pathology (873). Curative care is necessary to prevent further damage. 
Since NIHL is a disability it may be necessary to transfer workers out of noise areas to other jobs and 
financial compensation may come into play.  
(E) Although the majority of the people are on the high OHC damage group (due to over exposure over the 
years), the HCP is regarded as a success in terms of the measures that are in place and the positive behaviour 
changes achieved. The basic questionnaire responses of 6 380 indicate that 315 employees were knowingly 
also exposed to private noise. The majority (6 324) were fully aware of noise risks and most (6265) knew 
where and when to use hearing protection.     
 
Conclusions   
 
The paper described the problem of noise and addressed the research problem in terms of a review of first-level noise 
control (noise engineering and the modern future of noise) and second-level noise control (hearing conservation) to 
eliminate NIHL (noise-induced hearing loss). Most solutions to the noise challenge were explored in terms of the 
science of noise engineering, the design (sources) of noise, noise ergonomics, the three primary noise control 
dimensions, principles to reduce noise, control of noise propagation, the use of acoustic barriers, sound absorption 
(and reflection), reverberation , the future of innovative modern noise control and best-practice HCPs.      
 
The focus of the paper was on second-level noise control in terms of a best-practice HCP for a South African gold 
mines  describing how custom-made hearing conservation can be done on a large scale. It showed how important a 
competent HCP service provider is in terms of several operations management performance objectives and to manage 
complex MPSs. The four dimensions of the best-practice HCP indicated several unconventional measures needed for 
HCP effectiveness. The single most significant change at the gold mine was the overall buy-in in terms of the positive 
attitudes towards the HCP, ownership (wearability) of custom-made HPDs and hearing conservation awareness in 
general. The other success factor highlighted is the OAE technology providing an additional dimension for prevention. 
The majority of the workers are in the high risk groups for OAEs, but with normal hearing. This indicates the 
importance to sustain the HCP because the majority of employees have acquired OHC damage in the cochlear but still 
have normal hearing thresholds.

It is recommended that a personal approach to ergonomics, noise control and PPE be followed and that all the 
dimensions of noise control undergo continuous improvement. As long as the world economies demand mineral 
resources and while the laws of sound physics prevail, noise control excellence will be imperative. A culture against 
noise must overcome complacency and the insidious nature of NIHL. More drastic measures such as penalties or 
taxation are necessary to put the focus away from second defenses, while hearing conservation must be based on an 
international best-practice quality standard.

Abstract 
Shortage of adequate water sources in rural communities has become a global concern and severe in 
developing countries especially in African countries. This is due to the consistent increase in population, 
global warming and poor planning by municipalities in strategizing water supply and billing. The aim of 
this study was to apply a ground magnetic geophysical survey to investigate the geological structures or 
lineaments which are potential sources of ground water. To carry out the ground magnetic survey, six 
magnetic profiles 1 km long were designed to cut perpendicular to the general geological strike. All the 
profiles were spaced 500 m apart with a sampling interval of 20 m. The survey was carried out using a 
proton precision magnetometer-G856 kept at a constant height during the survey. Data was processed for 
artificial anomalies, diurnal variations as well as the geomagnetic field. Presentation of data was done in x-
y distance against magnetic intensity graphs of all the profiles as well as a contour color map to delineate 
the potential structures. The findings of the study revealed several lineaments, most of which are low 
magnetic zones associated with geological structures such as faults, fractures and dykes. These provided 
potential zones of ground water where boreholes to supplement the community water needs can be drilled. 
The technique offers operational efficiency in water exploration projects.

1. Introduction
In many areas around the world especially in developing countries shortage of water is an increasingly major problem 
because of the global population which continues to increase on daily basis, leading to high demand of resources and 
forcing the discovery of alternative or new resources for sustainable living. In many rural areas communities usually 
depend on surface water from rivers and dams which, during dry seasons, can be completely or nearly dry (Yang 
2018). For these reasons, ground water remains the only solution to the problem (Alsharhan et al., 2001). According 
to Alsharhan et al., (2001), Ground caps water is the water which is located beneath the surface of the earth trapped 
in geological formations which are usually fractured or containing high pore spaces. Many boreholes in the past 
decades were drilled randomly without any scientific approach in determining the potential of ground water in terms 
of quantity and quality which is the reason some boreholes have low water yield or dry up during dry seasons.  
Amongst many resources, water is the greatest need all over the world, the threat to this resource increase as the 
population and human activities increases. Nevertheless, the available surface water sources such as streams and rivers 
face a great threat as competition amongst living organisms.  
According to Meinzer (1923) in the past hydro-geologists used to locate and design the wells to be drilled without 
considering any environmental assessments which led to numerous dysfunctional wells due to pollution, and currently 
before any construction of a well or any borehole is drilled, site assessments are done to determine the quality, quantity 
and the pollution status of the area as well as the location of monitoring wells to monitor the ground water levels. It is 
impossible to physically locate ground water; therefore, it is very important to apply different techniques in 
determining the potential zones with certainty. The use of ground geophysical methods such as resistivity, magnetic, 
electromagnetic and induced polarization used with the geological mapping of an area can determine the water

or dykes as shown in figure 4.4. The difference in the magnetic survey lineaments map of this work compared to the 
work of Nyabeze et al. (2013) is the values of magnetic intensities on the map which is due to the difference in the 
geology of the two areas. They are different as the Tshipise which not good split it up is under the Soutpansberg group 
is a sedimentary area and the Mukula area is the igneous area as well as the difference in the filtering technique which 
on Nyabeze's work it was vertical derivative convolution and on this work it is vertical derivative.

4. Conclusions 
The study revealed the basement geological structures showed as lineaments in the study which are the potential zones 
of ground water, meaning that the objective of this study has been achieved with the most favorable outcomes.  Based 
on the findings of this study, the following recommendations for further studies are suggested; more work needs to be 
done around the extent of Mukula village to detect other potential zones; detailed geophysical survey needs to be done 
to ascertain the potential water zones as follow up work prior to any drilling. Furthermore, a detailed geological 
mapping is needed to back up the geophysical data for lithological references.

Abstract 
Thermo-acoustic refrigerator constitutes a viable alternative to the search for suitable replacement of 
conventional refrigeration systems. Although the device is simple to build and environmentally friendly, 
the issue related to its efficiency requires some investigation. Advanced optimization schemes are being 
developed in order to handle the designing of the device which appears to be challenging with regards to 
the interdependence of its design parameters. In this paper, a mathematical programming formulation is 
presented in order to model and optimize the geometry of a simple standing-wave thermo-acoustic 
refrigerator. The model developed has been implemented in the software GAMS. The geometry of the stack, 
described as the heart of the device, constitute the focus of this study. The stack length and the stack position 
are the main variables considered in this work. This work provides guidance on the selection of the most 
suitable geometry of the stack in order for the device to achieve a relatively higher performance. In addition, 
the details of the mathematical programming model have been disclosed for further analysis and 
improvement.

1. Introduction
The field of refrigeration and air-conditioning is impacted greatly by the concerns arising from the issue related to the 
ozone depletion and global warming due to the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) contained in refrigerants. The proposal to 
adopt hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) or hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) as a replacement of CFCs may not solved 
this problem permanently. It appears that developing new technologies that incorporate ammonia, hydrocarbons, 
water, air, carbon dioxide and air, as alternatives to natural refrigerants, may provide a long-lasting solution (Ciconkov 
and Zahid, 2009). Thermo-acoustic refrigerators is potentially a clean technology that can be considered because they 
don’t require the use of harmful refrigerants during operation. The devices normally consist of a sound wave that 
interact with a porous media, inducing cooling due the thermo-acoustic effect within the device. With suitable 
pressure, geometrical configuration of the device and proper operation setting, a significant cooling could be achieved. 
Based on the shape of the device, thermo-acoustic refrigerators can be classified in two different categories: Standing-
wave and travelling wave devices. The former is generally smaller, simple to build and relatively cheaper but could 
only exhibit a relatively lower coefficient of performance (COP). Standing-wave thermo-acoustic refrigerator consists 
a long tube (or resonator) filled with inert gas containing a porous media refer to as stack. This porous media has a 
low thermal conductivity and high specific heat capacity. In order to generate the thermo-acoustic effect, a relatively 
higher temperature gradient is applied across the extremities of the stack through two heat exchangers. A loudspeaker 
is generally used to generate the sound as shown in Figure 1(a). On the other hand, travelling-wave device consists of 
a toroidal tube and a regenerator sandwiched between two heat exchangers. As a results of the topological feature of 
the toroidal tube, the phasing between the travelling acoustic wave and the pressure and velocity within the device is 
the same. Hence, the travelling-wave thermo-acoustic device denomination. Travelling-wave devices are generally 
more efficient in comparison to their standing-wave counterparts. A typical travelling-wave device is shown in Figure 
1(b). This looped tube incorporates a regenerator having smaller porosity as compared to the stack.

Abstract 
The performance of the South African construction industry is a major cause of concern in the country. 
This study investigates the factors influencing the performance of the construction industry. Primary data 
was obtained through the questionnaire survey which was distributed to professionals in the construction 
industry. Quantitative method was adopted whereby a total of 50 survey questionnaires were distributed, 
however only 35 questionnaires were returned which gave a response rate of 70%. To analyse Statistical 
Packages of Social Sciences was used for the study. The value for the internal consistency and reliability 
of the research instrument was 0.866.  The study revealed significant factors affecting the performance of 
the construction industry as; Instability/escalation of construction material prices, project cost overruns, 
backlogs of payment to contractors, material and equipment and inefficient funding of construction projects. 
The study contributes to the body of knowledge in relation to what influences the performance of the 
construction industry. It is evident that economic growth, regulatory bodies, skills and training programms 
influences the performance of the construction industry in South Africa. Therefore, an increase in 
infrastructure investment and firm regulatory implementation measures by CIDB can accelerate the 
economic growth and improve the performance of the construction industry.

1. Introduction
The construction industry renders a vital role in the economic growth of developing countries. This is seen through 
the production of much needed infrastructure that is required for development and growth of the economy, 
construction productivity as well as the wellbeing of the citizens (Dlamini, 2012:1). Ramachandra, Olabode and 
Rotimi (2009:1) similarly shares that the construction industry contributes significantly in the growth of the South 
African economy, as it produces  infrastructure that is required for the development of other productive activities in 
the country.The growth of any economy is measured by the rate of physical infrastructure development such as roads, 
bridges, harbours and buildings 
Therefore the construction industry has a potential to bridge inequality in the country by generating employment and 
opportunities for jobs to skilled, semi-skilled and unskilled work force. Stats SA (2014) states that, the construction 
industry creates employment to more than 1.4 million people all over the country, it helps the formal and informal 
sectors to generate income and contribute to the growth of the economy by creating employment. The driving force 
behind the government investing more in infrastructure development is to help eradicate poverty in the country, reduce 
unemployment and to achieve high economic growth (Mosenogi, 2011:1).

Abstract 
Delay in project delivery has become a common phenomenon in the project management profession. This 
should not be accepted as a norm considering that projects form an integral part of achieving organization’s 
strategic objectives. This paper examines how internal organizational processes affect the successful 
delivery of projects by exploring a case study on the project management processes at a South African 
university. Various project managers in the university, under the Operations Department were interviewed. 
The paper addresses project planning processes, organizational strategic objectives in relation to project 
management processes as well as addresses organizational bureaucracy and its effects on project processes. 
Furthermore, the analysis addresses current internal challenges through the Theory of Constraint.

1. Introduction
The delays in project delivery has become a common phenomenon in the project management profession. This should 
not be accepted a norm considering that projects form an integral part of achieving an organization’s strategic 
objectives. Projects are born because of a practical need. Hence, there is always a strategic intent behind every project 
delivered at the university; whether it is a security system upgrade, refurbishment of classrooms, installation of new 
laboratory equipment, there is always a strategic intent which validates and secures the corporate demand and funding 
for such projects. A small delay in the project planning and approval processes can cause substantive delay in the 
delivery of the major project, with high impact on the organization. Project delay can have detrimental effects for the 
client, who will be losing out on potential payoff or revenue generated as a result of completing the particular project. 
Similarly, to the contractor it means higher costs in terms of overheads which leads to loss of opportunity in other bids 
(Assbeihat, 2016).  
Organizations adopt various methods to implement projects within their Project Management Office. Such processes 
will highly depend on the policies and procedures of the organization. However, the said policies and procedures 
should support sensitive projects that otherwise may undermine the organization’s reputation through failure to meet 
deadlines. Personnel, whether project management office based or functional departments, should provide the 
necessary support and urgency to the delivery of projects. Moreover, the project management office should be 
supported by the internal processes of any organization in order to meet project deadlines. Organizations that depend 
highly on project management and the success of projects should give the project management office the required 
support to ensure successful completion of projects. The importance of timeous project delivery in a university 
environment cannot be overstressed. 
Project delays have been the subject of researchers throughout the years (Sunjka, 2013; Afzal, 2014; Mohamed, 2015; 
Assbeihat, 2016; Atout, 2016). Internal and external factors can contribute to the delay in project delivery. However, 
it is of paramount importance to start examining project delaying factors internally in order to address external factors. 
This study explores how internal organizational processes affect the successful delivery of projects by looking at a 
case study on the internal processes of a South African university. To this end, various project managers in the

5. Recommendations and Conclusion  
 
5.1 Recommendation  
 
Firstly, the employer needs to investigate stabilizing the project management office. There are currently over 100 
projects that need to be implemented within the organization. However, due to lack of staff and inconsistency in the 
office, these projects are not being implemented; causing a negative effect on the organizations operations. In addition, 
the Human Resource department needs to develop current staff in their positions to provide the necessary training and 
development courses to satisfy the project management methodologies. This will allow the project management office 
to have a strong solid foundation in terms of project management methodologies.  
 
Secondly, with the implementation of projects from inception to close out, the level of stakeholder involvement in 
executive decisions needs to be investigated. The reality of the matter is that, not often will a certain stakeholder be 
available to approve a certain document or conclude on a certain concept design. Some of the stakeholders (especially 
those in approval positions) involved do not provide much justice to project delivery. One respondent indicated that 
they are required to get signatures for payment certificates to the level of the Vice Chancellor (VC).  Therefore, 
changing some stages in the process is also something that the employer can consider. One other respondent suggested 
that the procurement department should look at the option of pre-approving a list of suppliers for a period of about 
three years. This will in turn prevent lengthy signatory approvals and tender committee dates. However, it does not 
seem like a viable option as organizations are required to assist and build small emerging enterprises. Having a panel 
appointed for a three year period, leaves the other small enterprises out – as often the requirements for this option are 
intense. It also does not give them an opportunity to grow and gain the experience they need.  
 
Lastly, in support of the first point, the employer should look at the option of housing all the supporting functions to 
the project management office in one space. Having a procurement administrator, financial business partner, health 
and safety practitioner, and legal representative will allow projects to be implemented in isolation, not having to 
depend on functional departments. In that way they can all report to the Director, and all the necessary approvals can 
take place in one space, according to one standard process.  
 
5.2 Conclusion  
 
The study revealed that although the project management office is recognised, it is not given due support to optimise 
its operations. The evidence is in the internal processes, and how they do not compliment project management 
methodologies. Furthermore, there are many areas that need to be given attention if the project management office is 
to work and be of efficient service to the university. The employer needs to determine the need of the project 
management office within the university and what the office needs to deliver. By so doing, the company will be able 
to place a visible structure within the project management office, and all stakeholders affected, positively or negative, 
need to buy in to it.

Abstract 
Clear investigation on mineral rock characterization is essential for establishing solid bridges between the 
mineral resource location and area of application, i.e. rock provenance. Major scientific revolutions in the 
industry was made possible via technologies of characterization (XRD, XRF, SEM etc..,) providing 
improved processing routes that effectively address arising challenges and problems faced by our local 
quarries and mining industries, therefore attempting also to explaining fundamental treatment techniques 
that were adopted anciently. Modern civil engineering activities, mining and construction entail clear 
statistical data on material composition, texture, petrographic and mechanical properties of the source 
material or mineral ore they are handling for clear documentation. Visual inspection was carried out on 
Diorite samples acquired from various locations. Microscopic examination of component were classified 
in order to rationalize unique and recognizable features (mineral type, structure and color patterns), and 
estimations for specific purpose the rock is suited for (i.e., as a sculpting material or fabrication tool). 
Characterization therefore, provided crucial information to the interpretation on quality of stone and 
relevant processing factors relating to energy input and effective processing technique. In this work, In-
situ X – ray powder diffraction analysis was performed at rtp conditions on powdered samples of Diorite 
(a) and (b). Various components were identified which revealed that phase composition is significant in
determining the strength of material and processing parameters.

Introduction 
Since the dawn of civilization powder diffraction (PXRD) has continually been employed as a standard 
analytical tool at both research faculty institutions and the industry (Spectrometer n.d.)(Wills and Finch 
2016). Powder diffraction technology offer reliable estimations about material property information with 
X- ray diffraction scan measurements that are expeditious, information evaluation simultaneously
displaying on a computer monitor for straightforward analysis as well as classification (Spectrometer
n.d.). In-situ x-ray diffraction consider the crystal structure of polycrystalline materials identifying
crystallinity of components, their relative quantity and phase magnitude relative to the whole matrix
(Scanned Powdered Diorite Rock). Diorite rock is an intrusive material intermediate of gabbro and
granite rocks in terms of composition (Austin 1963). It finds location mainly in mountainous landscapes
where it occurs in substantial amounts as batholiths. With rock composition of about 5-50% dark minerals

Petrographic Examination of the Sample (s) 
 
Petrographic examination of the panda rock specimen estimated that the rock is fine-grained structure that 
contain slightly-to-partially altered structures of quartz imbedded within a diorite matrix material (Nidhi 
et al. 2011). The rock comprise mainly plagioclase as the major constituent of the rock and amphibole 
and/ or actinolite complex, with also small quantities of quartz, SiO2, Potassium feldspar with inclusions 
of other trace elements and constituent compounds like chlorite and mica which were simultaneously 
identified via the x-ray analysis device. The amphibole distinguished within the specimen matrix 
dispenses itself to be initiated from clinopyroxene alterations, but the plagioclase resulted mainly due to 
nucleation through the process of argillisation. Trace elements and other members identified within the 
rock were mainly accounted as the clay fraction, sericite, ilmenite and sulphites deposited also as part of 
the petrographic investigation. Therefore, due to this large degree of alteration on phase composition, it is 
suggested that the panda rock material type will be best suited for road construction material rather than 
as an aggregate for concreate constituent. The diorite rock sample obtained from Serowe region display a 
random distribution of phase orientation within the matrix with rather a unique classification of minerals 
composition fraction of hornblende (45 – 55%), Berlinite (18 – 20%), Bazzite (10 – 15%), Quartz (5-
12%) and other minor traces of chlorites mixed with mica mineral as depicted in the diffractogram above, 
information that was theoretically justified. The melanocratic minerals crystallized simultaneously 
together as the dark appearance of the rock texture suggests and this matrix is surrounded but the light 
colored mica trace constituents which only deposited along grain boundaries together with the randomly 
dispersed minor alteration products like sericite, chlorite and calcite compounds (K et al. 2013). The 
overall texture of the magmatic master quarry rock sample show a fine-grained texture which resulted due 
to rapid crystallization of the host mineral during formation together with a mixture of few equigranular 
grain particles of aligned hornblende laths with an ophitic texture. Consequently, due to this random 
orientation of components it is thus difficult to classify mafic igneous rocks with consistent mineralogy 
and texture since there is high variation with a short range of ordered particles. 
 
Conclusion  
From the data acquired by the diffractogram, it was visible that majority of crystalline phases where easy 
to identify with panda quarry rock sample as plagioclase (39.20%), amphibole (31.74%), Quartz (12.26%) 
and minor inclusions of mica mixed with chlorides compounds. For the analyzed scan results clear data 
obtained with less noise levels, N, made classification straightforward, presenting the material to possess 
a high fraction of crystallinity with larger particle components which consequently led to 
recommendation of the material as mainly suitable for road construction activities and infrastructural 
work due to the inherent character of large phase composition. The data analysis for master quarry diorite 
sample as mainly Hornblende (49.9%), Berlinite (18.2%), Bezzite (16.1%) together with traces of other 
complex, displayed less crystallinity of components while showing greater amounts of fine – grained 
distribution of phases thus suggesting a larger contribution to be occupied by clay and minor trace 
constituents of lazurite, mica and silicates. From the diffractogram analysis it can be suggested that the 
master quart stone is much suited to use in infrastructural work like building and also civil industry. Due 
to great domination in phosphates (Al (PO4)) and lesser crystallinity of components, master quarry rock 
would require less amount of breakage energy in comparison to the Francistown’s panda quarry rock 
product with higher crystallinity and a well-defined component field. The signal-to-noise ratio is 
important during analysis and a material with a high noise level remain difficult to classify, from these 
specimen it is clear that for Serowe rocks the signal was two times greater than the noise level, 2:1 while 
for panda quarries the ratio was approximately 3:1, these difference was due to the material’s diffraction 
characteristics and linear absorption coefficient of each specimen.

Abstract 
In recent times, it has become crucial to protect soil, surface and groundwater reserves from pollution due 
to the consequential effects of landfilling operations. In a bid to safeguarding environmental and human 
health, various technologies have been employed in waste containment over the years. Significantly, 
geomembranes/ mineral composites liners have been employed. Sequential tests using a small-scale 
laboratory bespoke column hybrid permeameter device was conducted on the impact of infusion of 
pollutant species in a geocomposite lining system/ mineral barrier through a circular destructed 
polyethylene membrane. The imposition of pressure as a simulation for waste load on the pollutant 
infusion rate, pollutant transport and the buffering capability of natural-mineral soil profile were studied. 
Infusion through the geocomposite liner-buffering system (BS) was measured for tests with the destructed 
membrane under simulated waste loads of up to 150 kPa. Results and analysis showed significant 
reduction in infusion rate with increased pressure on the system. This reduction is attributed to the 
reduced barrier transmissivity, θ and soil liner compressibility alterations in the soil barrier. The infusion 
rate data for tests with the destructed membrane in this study were compared with predicted values from 
equations provided by Forchheimer and Giroud et al. The comparison showed inapplicability to this study 
and also showed imperfect contact conditions at the membrane/soil interface if assumed in practice. 
Nevertheless, equations from Giroud for good contact conditions revealed rational infusion rate 
predictions through the destructed membrane of the geocomposite media.

1. Introduction
From decades past till date as recorded by Rowe (2011) the commonest form of waste disposal has involved land 
application. Waste disposal by landfilling produces gases and leachates/ chemical pollutants whose breakaway or 
escape from containment facilities must be controlled to restrict or prevent consequential impacts on environmental 
and human health. As such, to ensure the protection of soil and ground water resources from landfill pollutants, 
geocomposite liners are often considered. Geomembrane/ mineral composite liners are mostly employed in waste 
containments and will remain significant components as lining systems in landfill design and construction. However 
when in-situ, defects or destruction of geomembranes cannot be avoided. In most cases, as reported by Touze-Foltz 
and Giroud (2003) geomembrane forming part of a geocomposite liner may fail due to defects in-situ or ex-situ from

Consequently, the results obtained from the chemical analysis of the pore fluid extracted from six core sections of 
the BS were consistent with the soil column effluent concentrations. The results showed that significant amounts of 
heavy metals were retained in the top portions/ sections of the soil as revealed in the concentration-depth profiles 
shown in Figure 13.

The Fe ions appeared to be more mobile than Pb ions found in the leachate, especially in the case where a more 
acidic environment prevailed. Therefore, the natural soil exhibited good buffering tendencies to the infusion of 
heavy metals through the BS. 
4. Conclusions 
A test on geo-composite liner with defected polyethylene membrane under the effect of chemical transport was 
conducted in a small-scale device called a Modular Consolidometer-Percolation Column Hybrid. Effect of pressure 
on the leachate flow rate with the transport mechanism and buffering of heavy metals were investigated. From tests 
and analysis of results, the following conclusions were reached; 
 
The increase in applied pressure on the liner systems was observed to significantly reduce the leachate flow 
rate; and from analysis, there was clear indication that the reduction was as a result of the membrane/soil 
interface transmissivity, θ, reduction and thickness reduction of the soil barrier. 
 
The assumption of perfect membrane/soil interface contact condition is not applicable to leachate flow 
through a defected membrane with underlain soil barrier. Giroud empirical equations for good contact 
condition provided a reasonable prediction for this problem under very low pressure (close to 0 kPa). 
However, the influence of pressure was not catered for by the predictive equation in their work. 
 
The measured pore fluid concentration of the transported contaminants, confirmed there was flow through 
the membrane-soil interface; the concentration of selected chemical ions in sectioned cores of the BS after 
percolation test revealed the natural soil to have good buffering abilities towards the selected chemical 
species/ions. However, further study needs to be conducted on the influence of pressure on the interface 
contact behaviour and modification is required for Giroud empirical equations such that the effect of 
pressure need be taken into account.

Abstract 
Waste containment has always involved the use of land which sees the disposal of enormous quantities of 
waste in landfills. This waste disposal approach creates gases and other toxic substances whose escape 
from containment facilities poses severe threats to environmental and human health. Most breakaways of 
toxic elements from landfills are often associated with leachate infusion through failed barrier 
components/ containment materials to levels with consequential impacts. As such, it is pertinent that 
barrier lining systems are designed and constructed with integrity to ensure the protection of soil, water 
resources and other natural reserves, as well as prevent the pollution of surrounding environment. These 
challenges paved way for the study to investigate landfill leachate infusion through a circular failed 
geocomposite liner using a laboratory fabricated permeation testing apparatus. Pressures which simulated 
actual landfill waste loads were applied to the lining system and the buffering capacity of a natural 
zeolitic mineral layer was investigated by measuring the leachate infusion rate and anionic (Cl and HCO3) 
contaminant infusion through the geocomposite liner-buffering strata (BS). 25 - 150 kPa of simulated 
landfill waste loads were imposed on the system at intervals. The study was also done as a revalidation 
mechanism to previous studies. The outcomes revealed significant reduction in infusion rate over the 
varied pressure. The infusion reduction is attributed to the reduced liner transmissivity, θ and compressed 
soil layer. However, the natural zeolitic soil displayed poor buffering of Cl ions but showed a fair result in 
the case of HCO3 ions. Data for infusion rates were compared with empirical values from existing models 
by Forchheimer and Giroud. The comparisons indicated inapplicability to this study and to real life 
scenarios if conditions of perfect contact at the polyethylene/soil interface were assumed. Nevertheless, 
Giroud’s model for good contact condition considerably predicted infusion rate through a failed medium.

1. Introduction
The disposal of waste involves the use of land and this trend has been in existence for many decades. Disposal of 
waste in landfills as recorded by Rowe (2011) generates gases and leachates/ contaminants whose escape from 
engineered containment facilities must be constantly monitored and controlled to prevent or eliminate severe impact 
on surrounding environments. Therefore, to ensure that soil and groundwater resources are protected from landfill 
leachates, geocomposite systems are mostly utilized. Polyethylene (PE)/ mineral composite liners are often used in 
engineered containment facilities and for the longest time possible, will continue to be adapted, especially by 
developing countries as significant components of landfill lining systems. More so, it is well established that in-situ

elements do not travel in a significant manner through the natural BS examined. Effluent and relative concentration 
profiles for the Cl ions with respect to the pore volume of the natural zeolitic soil subsequent to reaching steady state 
is shown in Figure 12. The observed buffer is generally not a function of the type or amount of clay minerals present 
in the zeolitic material. Hence, there was no appreciable difference in anionic infusion through the soil. 
 
 
Figure 12. Relative conc. of anions in effluent (Co and Ce = initial and final conc.) 
Results from the BS showed low accumulation and retention of the Cl ion, as revealed in distribution profile depths. 
Minute HCO3 was however, detected in the extracted pore fluid subsequent to leachate infusion as presented in 
Figure 13. This can be attributed mainly to physical dispersion in the soil column system, with perhaps a small 
amount of interaction at the anions exchange sites on the respective soil edges or due to other chemical reactions. 
The exchange between chloride ions and other ions with negative charges, which are part of the lattice is not feasible 
because the chloride ion is about two and half times the size of the oxygen ion, i.e., it is too large to replace or co-
ordinate with oxygen and hydroxyl ions.

Figure 13. (a) Infused profiles of Cl ions through the BS; (b) Infused profiles of HCO3 ions through the BS 
The buffering of chloride ion that was observed was relatively low and it is not surprising because: (a) Cl is 
considered to be a mobile and non-interacting anion which make it a conservative contaminant and (b) chloride ions 
are generally considered to be non-specific ions, which implies they exist only in the outer coating of the double 
layer as recorded by Sposito (1979). Therefore, the natural zeolitic soil exhibited poor buffering characteristics 
towards Cl ions but had a reasonably fair outcome in the case of HCO3 ions. 
4. Conclusions 
Tests on geocomposites with failed PE under the influence of leachate infusion were conducted in a fabricated 
laboratory column device. Pressure effects on the leachate infusion rate, infusion mechanism and buffering of 
anionic contaminant species were investigated. From the analyses of results the following conclusions were reached: 
• 
The increase in applied pressure on the liner significantly reduced the leachate infusion rate; and from 
analysis, there was evident that the reduction was as a result of the decreased PE-soil interface 
transmissivity, θ, and the soil liner densification. 
• 
The assumption of perfect PE-soil interface contact condition is not applicable to leachate infusion through 
a failed system with underlying mineral layer. Nonetheless, Giroud’s empirical model for good contact 
condition provided a rational prediction for this problem under pressure of 0 kPa. However, the influence 
of pressure was not considered by the model as contrary to the case of this study.

• 
The measured pore fluid concentration of the infused ions, confirmed there was flow through the PE-soil 
interface; the concentration of the selected nominal anion in the sectioned cores of the BS subsequent to the 
compatibility test revealed the natural zeolitic soil to have poor buffering behaviour towards Cl ions but 
had fairly buffered the HCO3. Additionally, it is recommended that further studies be conducted on the 
infusion of other trace chemical contaminants/ ions through the tested zeolitic material in this study as well 
as through other locally available clayey media. 
In a nutshell, the chloride infusion curves through the zeolitic soil showed the characteristics of the non-reactive 
ions, which were not readily altered by chemical and biological processes. This revealed that Cl ions infused faster 
through the BS than in the case of the HCO3 ions. This study has demonstrated that the tested soil type used in the 
experimental works to contain the generated leachate from solid waste disposal can be sparingly used to contain the 
different selected contaminant species investigated. The results gathered in this study further suggests that under 
favourable soil conditions, landfill leachates containing low anionic trace levels will not pose a substantial threat to 
the subsurface environment. Although, it is emphasized that the buffering efficacy of the zeolitic tested soil is not 
infinite. Hence, from observations and analyses of results, care must be taken not to dispose heavy concentrated 
inorganic waste in the landfill site where the soil samples were collected.

Abstract 
The usage of electricity for heating, lighting, transportation, cooling and operating appliances has become 
the main source of energy for socio-economic development. As a result, the consistent accessibility of 
electricity supply is crucial in ensuring sustainable global best practice measures in the electricity 
industries. Moreover, the ease of reliability, affordability, quality, and availability of electricity supply is 
essential in stimulating sustainable economic activities. Yet, there is an energy crisis especially electricity 
in many developing countries in Sub-Sahara, which have lead these countries in extreme poverty due to 
lack energy. In addition, there has been challenges with electricity supply resulting to power shortages. As 
a result energy resources industries and stakeholders are seeking for best practices on renew and 
sustainable energy. Equally, this paper intends to determine how the application of Quality Management 
Systems (QMS) can utilized as a sustainable quality tools in energy industries. In this regard, a case study 
the South African energy industry particularly the electricity area was selected in accomplishing 
envisaged objectives. The findings suggest that the implementation of an effective QMS for continual 
improvement relate to meeting the supply demands still lagging behind. Therefore, strategic planning for 
developing a sustainable structure for implementing an effective QMS is needed.

1. Introduction
The adoption of the ISO 9001 has become regulatory or a necessity for the global standard organization to subscribe 
to the best practice requirements for the effective implementation of QMS. This standard put into effect the 
compliance of ensuring quality goods and services that are free to errors, harmless to consumer and meeting the 
need and exceed the expectations costumers. In terms of sustainable QMS requires, a dynamic change in the ethics 
of corporate sectors (Golder, et.al, 2012). There is a necessity to constantly review organizations QMS. The ISO 
9001 certification serves as a marketing tool employed by most corporate sectors in sustaining competitiveness 
(Poksinska, et.al, 2006) rather than an instrument for the improvement of internal processes and systems. A structure 
for constant review and maintenance of QMS post certification through a proactive approach driven by a continuous 
improvement strategy is therefore essential in corporate sectors (Kaziliūnas, 2010). The electricity industries are 
challenged in mitigating electricity restrictions, ensuring the regular supply of safe and quality electricity. The 
quality of electricity supplied is facilitated towards stimulating sustainable economic developments. Literature 
presents certain limitations in the effective adoption of sustainable QMS. These are inclusive of the scarcity of 
resources, employee engagement, and managerial attitude. Literature establishes corporate sectors consider the 
implementation of QMS as the obligation of quality departments rather than the entirety of the business units 
(Chemuturi, 2011). This presents gaps in comprehensively understanding and implementing QMS within business 
units. Electricity industries in South Africa are continually challenged with electricity restriction issues in form of 
power outages. These limitations present a need for this paper. The adoption of QMS in relation to a defined 
business strategic plan of a selected electricity industry based in South Africa is investigated. This paper seeks to 
enhance the quality and reliability supply of electricity to consumers in South Africa. The effectiveness of QMS is 
dependent on the efficient implementation of a defined business strategic plan (Kaziliūnas, 2010). A gap analysis

Results establish the need to develop QMS benchmarks based on a collaborative structure of business strategic 
indicators investigated. This paper recommends implementing a unified framework of “Behaviour”, “Quality”, 
“Barriers”, “Benefits”, and “Performance” categories in relation to an effective implementation of QMS. A 
collaborative structure enhances the efficiency and execution of day-to-day operations. 
• 
Results affirm on the importance of developing a structure which supports QMS developments resulting in a 
framework for continuous transparency, monitoring, visibility, and assessments. This is in relation to 
implementing effective QMS policies and sustainable practices, facilitating a base for identifying and 
addressing concerns timeously. This ensures risks and opportunities are catered for when it arises. A structure 
for continuously driving QMS policies both internally and externally is extremely recommended in this paper.  
• 
Results encourage for frequent re-certification of the company’s processes based on ISO quality management 
benchmarks. This ensures employees, customers, and stakeholders are aware of improvements in service 
mandate based on the integration of quality management principles. Educating on the importance of obtaining 
an updated certified document from ISO on QMS benchmarks is highly recommended in this paper.  
• 
Results affirm continually developing an effective maintenance strategy based on ISO quality management 
policies is essential. This paper encourages and recommends a cultural shift from the pre-ISO certification 
period to the post-ISO certification phase. 
• 
Results established the need for frequent training of employees and management team in relation to quality 
management benchmarks. This enhances the efficiency of the management team and employees in relation to 
implementing an effective ISO QMS benchmarks.  
 
The results indicate implementing a unified framework of strategic business indicators explored (Behaviour, 
Quality, Barriers, Benefits, and Performance) serves as an effective tool for implementing an effective QMS. These 
tools enhance electricity generation, distribution, reliability, and sustainability. Increasing generating capacity and 
mitigating electricity restrictions. These align with TQM (strategic business plan) benchmarks in ensuring 
employees and management team are actively involved in achieving global best practice QMS benchmarks. A 
framework for effectively facilitating “Management responsibility”, “Resource management”, “Product realization”, 
Measurement analysis” and “Measurement improvements” is stimulated. 
 
Conclusion 
This paper selects an electricity industry based in South Africa as a subset of electricity industries in accomplishing 
envisaged objectives. This paper conducted a gap analysis testing in relation to the implementation of an effective 
QMS. The influence of integrating QMS on a defined strategic business plan of electricity industries is investigated. 
This is based on ISO 9001:2015 benchmarks. The results present best practice measures as an effective TQM tool 
relative to developing a sustainable structure for implementing an effective QMS. This paper established for 
electricity industries to ensure sustainability of a QMS, the business unit must support a paradigm for the redesign 
and continuous development of QMS benchmarks. This research demonstrated the development, integration, and 
adoption of an effective QMS on a defined strategic business plan results in an enhanced generation and distribution 
of electricity. Future research can be directed to a broader investigation of the research objectives. A case study 
comparison between Africa as an underdeveloped continent and the developed countries globally can be explored. 
This is in relation to the adoption of QMS benchmarks on a defined strategic business plan.

Abstract 
Over the last decade, there has been a huge debate that has risen around the issue surrounding risk 
management within banking sector mostly due to current monetary crisis. Numerous attempts were 
put in place with the objective of improving the risk management and performance in banking 
industry comprising the introduction of the Basel Accords and also risk management strategies by 
central banks. As a result, the South African state-owned Banks have allotted risk management 
policies to reinforce the risk management system and to enhance the functioning of the banking 
sector. But, the existing literature within South African perspective do not elucidate the influence 
of these attempts on the functioning of banks. Lin light of this, the present research paper aimed 
at examining the efficiency of risk management systems in the South African local banks. This 
paper appraises the related literatures on banking risk management as of various methodological 
aspects and develops a conclusion to contribute to the existing literature; mainly in addressing 
some flaws concerning risk management system in the South African baking sector.

1. Introduction
The Business environment that organisations find themselves operating in today, is a completely different one to a 
few years ago, as it is constantly changing at a rapid pace and new risks are emerging not only internally but externally. 
“Risk exposure has become greater, more complex, diverse and dynamic, due to rapid changes in technology, speed 
of communication, globalisation and changes in the market” Chapman (2006:3) Therefore, the need for Risk 
management in an organisation is vital if an organisation wants to prosper and succeed in today’s turbulent 
environment. Risk can be described as an undesired and unexpected outcome of an event, risk usually emerges due to 
a degree of uncertainty and the lack of knowledge about the future, so understanding and treating risk must be the 
primary responsibility of any organisation Cooper et al, (2014:4) According to Dludhlu (2016:1) “risk can be identified 
as a loss due to an occurrence of an incident, the probability of the incident reoccurring and then determining to what 
extent the consequences may be changed”. Risk management can be described as a process for managing risk, the 
main objective of risk management is to prevent losses from occurring or to minimise the extent of the risk impact on 
an organisation. According to Young (2014:3) to manage risk effectively risk must be measured, the basis of this 
assignment is to investigate the risk management systems of the Banking industry in order to monitor and measure 
risk. Bank X utilises a system called Open pages which is used throughout the organisation by every business segment, 
it is a data base for managing, controlling and monitoring risk.  According to Young (2014:55) “the primary 
responsibility of risk management function is to coordinate all risk management information on a centralised system”.

When an organisation has identified, evaluated and analysed the potential risks posed to an activity, process or project, 
the organisation needs to consider what controls, can be put in place in order to minimise the effects of such risks. In 
this regard, it may happen that the organisation will accept the risk and therefore put no controls in place whilst on the 
other hand; the organisation may consider a specific risk as detrimental and therefore invest a lot of time and effort in 
putting sufficient controls in place to mitigate the risk. The organisation may decide that a risk should be avoided at 
all costs and therefore restructure the activity, process or project so that the risk is no longer applicable.  According to 
Mhlanga (2012:6) “risk management is how organisations select the type of risk that they want to mitigate and what 
risks they are not prepared to take”. 
 
4.6 Risk Management  
An interview was conducted with the Head of Risk Management for Branch Banking at Bank X, the question raised 
was what risk management system does Bank X use when reporting on their risks?  The system that Bank X use is 
called “Open Pages”, and it is the only official risk management system within the group and only tool that the South 
African Reserve Bank (hereafter after referred to as SARB) recognises.  Bank X is a business segment within a large 
organisation and having a uniform system in place for the entire group is important, because ultimately what Bank X 
reports on as well as the other segments needs to be accumulated and provide to the various stakeholders. The reason 
for this is that Bank X reports to SARB at a group level and therefore it’s imperative that there is one system that is 
used between the various business units for the collection and reporting of risks.  Open pages is a uniform system 
where every business unit in the group will log the risk management requirements as dictated by policy and framework, 
defined by group level and that then gets aggregated to Bank level and then to a Group level. What follows hereunder 
is a discussion regarding how Bank X monitors risks using Open pages. Open pages are the Operational Risk 
Management system which contains the Process Based Risk and Control Identification and Assessment (PRCIA) 
framework and is used to: 
 
 
• 
Capture risks  
• 
Assess risks 
• 
Monitor and report on processes 
 
• 
Risks and controls 
 
 
• 
Internal losses and external losses  
• 
KRIs  
• 
Risk Scenarios 
 
Open Pages is the data base where all risks are captured by all business units within the organisation.    
 
5. Conclusion  
 
Risk is everywhere whether it be internal or external, what is significant is how an organisation prepares for it, as risk 
is unpredictable and uncertain and can occur at any given time.  Organisations prepare for risks even if they do not 
transpire, they do this by implementing certain controls and processes involving continuously monitoring and 
reporting.  If an organisation implements the six steps in the risk management process, and everyone within the 
organisation from top to bottom understands the purpose and importance of risk management the entire organisation 
will benefit. There are many frameworks and models an organisation can implement, however at the end of the day 
what matters is what the organisation does with the information that they collect, how do they utilise it and implement 
it to better the current risk controls of the organisation. Enterprise risk management is entrenched in most organisations, 
for an organisation to thrive and remain competitive they need to ensure that all risks affecting an organisation have 
been predicted and treated. The main objective of this assignment was to provide an understanding of what risks 
management is and how Bank X incorporates the theory into their risk management system called Open Pages.  It is 
vital to have a system that speaks theory and is a centralised point for the collection of data it allows for accurate 
reporting when there is one centralised system for capturing of risks.  Risks usually emanates from external and 
internal factors both locally and internationally and therefore it’s important that organisations constantly monitor new 
risk that emerge. ERM should ensure that policies and regulations are constantly updated and incorporated within the 
Banks ERM framework.  Risk is an ongoing threat and if an organisation implements the systems and processes 
discussed throughout this assignment, the organisation should be resilient enough to survive unscathed.

Abstract 
Over the years studies have revealed that location and environmental impact are important factors to be 
considered in building materials selection. These have become major criteria in selection of appropriate 
building materials especially in the coastal regions of the world. In Nigeria, Lagos State has a close 
proximity with the Atlantic Ocean and the saline air present in this Ocean have been discovered to cause 
physical and chemical damages to the nature of the building materials used in this area. Hence, in order to 
curb these effects, understanding the impact of this saline air on building materials and the way towards 
improving the resistance of buildings within this area to salt reaction is necessary. This study present the 
result gotten from the review of literature on the effect of salt on buildings in coastal areas and the 
possible ways of ensuring a reduction of the negative effect of this salt reaction with building materials. 
Findings revealed that salt attack on concrete and steel reinforcements leads to structural failure in 
buildings. Also, moisture penetration leads to blistering, chalking, and peeling of paints, which leads to 
constant re-painting of buildings. Cracking of walls, deterioration of floorboards and wood degradation 
are some of the effect of salt on buildings within the coastal areas.

Introduction
In construction, several factors affect the choice of materials used in building construction one of which is the 
building location (Ogunkah and Yang, 2012). According to the World Bank (2009), the coastal area as a building 
location has grown to be the most developed areas in most parts of the world today. However, in more recent times 
these part of the world has been affected by the tremendous climatic change, which according to Susmita et al. 
(2014) can lead to increased salinity from sea water, loss of wetland, a flood from as a result of the rise in sea level, 
and storm damage. The impact of salinity on building materials is not a truth farfetched among buildings in Lagos 
state, Nigeria. This part of the country is located around the Atlantic Ocean which according to Oyewo et al. (1982) 
and Folorunsho (2004) experience low and high sea tides on a daily basis which leads to release of salt into the area. 
Folorunsho and Ahmad (2013) further stated that buildings with close contact with the Atlantic Ocean in Lagos state 
are affected by the impact of saline air from the ocean. 
The effects of increased salinity from sea water and inundation due to sea level rise have been a threat to buildings 
around the coast today. Thus, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA, 2005) explained that the 
durability of any home around the coastal area depends on the type of building materials used in constructing it. 
Fabio (2014) opined that salt crystals are often the reason why buildings show signs of aging at an early stage. This 
is because these salts crystallize inside the building materials making them crack and crumble. Wilson (2003) has 
earlier stated that in some cases, cracked bricks or stone, mortar turning into dust, and cement render flaking off on 
internal and external walls can be seen when salt crystals come in contact with these building materials. Department 
of Environment and Climate Change (2008) affirmed that when building materials are exposed to seawater they are

Conclusion and Recommendation 
This study through a review of literature assessed the effect of salt on buildings along the coastlines and the possible 
ways of ensuring a reduction in the negative effect of this salt movement. The effect of salt on concrete, clay brick 
and tiles, metal, wood and paint were investigated in this study. Based on the findings, the study concludes that the 
prevailing presence of saline air within areas along the Atlantic Ocean is a major reason for the degradation and 
deterioration of building materials in the area.  The salt attack on concrete and steel reinforcements leads to 
structural failure in buildings. Also, moisture penetration leads to blistering, chalking, and peeling of paints, which 
leads to constant re-painting of buildings within these areas. Cracking of walls, deterioration of floorboards and 
wood degradation are some of the effect of salt on buildings within the coastal areas. The study, therefore, 
recommends that if building in the coastal areas of Lagos State, Nigeria are to achieve better resistance to salt 
reaction within the area, then proper consideration should be given to environmental factors as they have a role to 
play when choosing the right building materials for buildings around the coast and this provides prior knowledge of 
the reaction of the building materials to salt. The use of SRC and low water to cement ratios mixtures in designing 
concrete structures will help improve the resistance of concrete to deterioration from seawater and saline  air. Oily 
preservatives such as creosote should be used on woods to prevent the effect of saline air on them while PVC can be 
used to control salt penetration into buildings by using them as surface finishes.

Abstract 
Despite the inherent benefits in the delivery of construction through prefabrication, its adoption is still 
considered to be low in most developing countries like South Africa. This paper presents the result of an 
assessment of the challenges facing the adoption of prefabrication in the South African construction 
Industry (SACI) and the measures for improving same. The study adopted a quantitative survey approach 
with information gathered from participants within selected construction organisations in Gauteng 
province, South Africa. Data gathered were analysed using percentage, mean score and standard 
deviation. Findings revealed that the most significant challenges facing the adoption of prefabrication are 
lack of prefabrication branding and promotion, low awareness and knowledge, need for specialized 
equipment for installation, difficulty in getting tender, negative perception, improper assembly of 
prefabricated components, high investment on equipment, and clients doubts in using prefabricated 
materials. If the system of prefabrication in construction is to be adopted considerably within the SACI, 
then there is the need for the adoption of measures such as, conducting research and testing to prove 
feasibility of design, organizing workshops to train individuals on prefabrication projects, providing skills 
development programmes, creating awareness among parties involved in construction, adequate 
government support, regular training of machine operators, and advanced technology in assembling.

Introduction
Construction industry still faces many challenges as there are issues that are not yet resolved coming from the 
adoption of traditional construction system, which is characterised by delays, poor quality, cost overruns and safety 
issues (Khalil et al., 2016). Ghosh (2002) opined that available traditional technologies and processes adopted for 
construction of buildings are inefficient and resource wasteful due to the enormous amount of resources consumed. 
This unhealthy situation has led to an increasing demand for the further development of technologies and 
construction process in most countries around the world. One of such development is the Industrialised Building 
System (IBS) which makes uses of prefabricated materials in the delivery of construction works. Hamid et al. (2008) 
portrayed IBS as an improved method whereby building components are created in a controlled environment (off-
site), transported, situated and assembled into a structure with less extra site work. IBS is simply seen as a way of 
achieving construction through prefabrication. This can be in the form of precast component frameworks, 
manufactured steel structures, innovative mould systems, block system and pre-assembled timber structures as 
development segments (Muhammad et al., 2016). The repetitive building parts that take time to be casted on site are 
designed and detailed as standardised components at the factory and brought to the site to be assembled. Kamar et 
al. (2012) described this system of construction as an alternative construction strategy which is expected to deliver 
fast, increase quality, reduce wastage and safer environment on construction site  (Kamar et al., 2012).   
In developed countries, the construction industry has attempted to utilize prefabrication as a strategy for getting 
improved construction quality and productivity, alleviating risks related to occupational health and safety, reducing 
issues related to a shortage of skilled workers and achieving the goal of reducing the overall cost of the project

value and associated SD. The result from the table reveals that all the assessed measures have their mean score to be 
well above the average of 3.0. This means that the respondents believe that all the assessed measures to a 
considerable extent have the tendency to improve the adoption of prefabrication within the SACI if implemented. A 
look at the SD column also shows that there is a considerable agreement in the view of the respondents as regards 
these challenges as an SD value of less than 1.0 was derived for all the assessed measures. Chief of these measures 
are conducting research and testing to prove feasibility of design (mean score = 4.44, SD = 0.501), organizing 
workshops to train individuals on prefabrication projects (mean score = 4.40, SD = 0.495), providing skills 
development programmes (mean score = 4.38, SD = 0.490), creating awareness among parties involved in 
construction (mean score = 4.38, SD = 0.490), adequate government support(mean score = 4.36, SD = 0.485), 
regular training of machine operators(mean score = 4.32, SD = 0.471), and advanced technology in assembling 
(mean score = 4.30, SD = 0.463). 
Following the technicality and the need for precision in constructing using prefabricated materials, there is a need 
for proper testing of the feasibility of the design. This will go a large extent in reducing the possibility of failure 
during construction and by extension increasing individual’s confidence in the system. The study of Rahman and 
Omar (2006) also agrees with the findings of the study which reveals that research should be conducted to test 
prefabrication in construction. There is also the need for proper training and improving skills of construction 
workers in the handling of prefabricated materials and constructing with same. This can be achieved through 
organized workshops and skills development programmes. Through these programmes, awareness of the system of 
construction can be increased among construction participants, and the negative view of the system can be 
eliminated. These findings agreed with the study of Kamar et al. (2009) which reveals that the way forward with the 
adoption of prefabrication in construction is inclusive of encouraging environmentally friendly techniques, 
awareness and provide proper training. Ayoola and Aghimien (2017) suggested the involvement of government in 
the promotion of prefabrication in construction. A similar submission was made by Kamar et al, (2009). Findings of 
this study agree with these submissions as adequate support is seen as crucial measures which can help improve the 
adoption of prefabrication within the SACI.

Conclusion and Recommendations 
This study set out to assess the adoption of prefabrication system within the SACI with a view to providing faster 
and better quality construction within the country. Using a quantitative survey with information gathered from 
participants within selected construction organisations in Gauteng, the major challenges of the adoption of 
prefabrication as well as the measures for improving its adoption were identified. Based on the findings of the study, 
it is, therefore, concluded that the most significant challenges facing the adoption of prefabrication within the SACI 
are lack of prefabrication branding and promotion low awareness and knowledge about prefabrication, need for 
specialized equipment for installation, difficult to get a tender, negative perception, improper assembly of 
prefabricated components, investment on heavy equipment, and clients have doubts about using prefabricated 
materials. If the system of prefabrication in construction is to be adopted considerably within the SACI, then there is 
the need for the adoption of measures such as, conducting research and testing to prove feasibility of design, 
organizing workshops to train individuals on prefabrication projects, providing skills development programmes, 
creating awareness among parties involved in construction, adequate government support, regular training of 
machine operators, and advanced technology in assembling.

It is believed that the findings of this study will go a long way in contributing to the increased use of the concept of 
prefabrication in the SACI. The study contributes the knowledge as it showcases some of the key challenges of the 
use of prefabrication within the SACI and the possible ways of improving its usage. However, despite the immense 
contribution the study brings, care must be taken in generalizing its findings as it is limited based on the 
geographical scope and sample size. The study was conducted in Gauteng, hence further studies can be conducted in 
other provinces within the country, in order to compare results and also garner information on a larger sample size.

Abstract 
The insufficient or little attention given to sensitivity analysis (SA) approach in the extant literature 
prompted this study to incorporate both Linear Programming (LP) and Sensitivity Analysis (SA) 
techniques to determine segment that best contributes to the objective function in Flour Mills of 
Nigeria Plc. The study considered five main segments of the company namely;   food, agro-allied, 
packaging, port operation and logistics and real state of the company and financial information 
extracted from the company annual report for the year ended March 31, 2017. Result from the LP 
analysis using simplex algorithm revealed that milling and sales of flour and rice and production and 
sales of pasta, snacks, sugar and noodles in the food segment contribute ₦72, 156, 441, 200 to profit 
representing 7.57% increase over the initial total contribution of ₦66, 689, 068, 000  with production 
of 1,250 units of the food items while  each extra ₦’000 spent on the binding constraints (cost of 
sales), would produce ₦0.15 extra contribution. It was also found that SA analysis improves LP 
result by 1.34% and 0.88% respectively for units of production in the food segment and total 
contribution to profit. The study thus concluded that milling and sales of flour and rice and 
production and sales of pasta, snacks, sugar and noodles are more profitable to the company. For that 
reason and in order to maximize profit the management of FMN Plc should give more attention to 
the food segment.

1. Introduction
It is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the roles of production planning in virtually every aspect of a 
company’s operations as it serves as a useful tool to coordinate the activities of production system. It helps 
companies to supply good quality products to customers on the continuous basis at competitive rates (Rose, 
2002). Planning, along with scheduling, provides the glue for bringing all the reliability processes together and 
maximizing the opportunity for more reliable production.

Abstract 
ISO standards are getting an increasing attention from different organizations. However, the effects of using 
different standards on the organizational performance are still unclear. ISO 55000 standard aims to provide all 
the stakeholders with a better understanding of the asset management system in order to achieve excellence in 
managing assets. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of moving toward implementing ISO 55000 in an 
educational institute that has started preparing for implementing it. The process of this assessment started by 
identifying the key performance indicators (KPIs), shortlisting them and then performing meetings and 
interviews with experts to evaluate the KPIs based on the available data. It was found that ISO 55000 
requirements started to positively enhance the facilities management and planning department and its 
performance; however, the lack of data and records availability prevented from obtaining a full picture about 
the impact of ISO 55000 requirements.

1. Introduction
Standard of the International Organizations for Standardization (ISO) are getting an increasing attention from different 
organizations to increase their reputations and achieve excellence (Su, Dhanorkar, & Linderman, 2015). However, the 
effects of using such standards on the organization performance are still unclear. For instance, some researchers on ISO 
9000 concluded a negative impact on the performance (Heras-Saizarbitoria, Arana, & Boiral, 2015) while others concluded 
a positive impact (Cagnazzo, Taticchi, & Fuiano, 2009). The variation in the results might be due to different set of factors 
such as the measuring criteria used, the type of service provided, the company size, the regional location, laws and 
regulations. 
With a similar structural level to IS0 9000 (quality management system) and ISO 14000 (environmental management 
system), ISO 55000 has been published in 2014 for asset management framework (Minnaar, Basson, & Vlok, 2013). 
According to the British Standards Institute (BSI), it includes overview, principles and terminologies regarding asset 
management and it can be applied to all organizational types (British Standard Institution, 2014). In addition, ISO 55001 
includes the requirements for asset management, however, it does not provide organizations with the way of achieving 
resources management (Nowakowski, Tubis, & Werbińska-Wojciechowska, 2017). ISO 55001 is followed by ISO 55002 
which contains guidelines for implementing ISO 55001 (International Organization for Standardization, 2014). ISO 5500X 
documents provide requirements for implementing asset management at organizations according their needs (Minnaar et 
al., 2013).  
Some of the expected advantages from the asset management standard are the enhanced financial performance, the 
improved services and reputation. ISO 55000 standard aims to provide all the stakeholders with a better understanding to 
the asset systems and achieve excellence in managing assets (British Standard Institution, 2014). The aim of this study is 
to assess the impact caused by starting the implementation of ISO 55000 in an educational institute.

4. Discussion 
 
During the interviews, it was found that the assets were poorly managed prior the start of implementing ISO 55000 
requirement, which can be noticed from the lack of data to assess 10 out of the 16 KPIs, where the documentation 
process has started with the start of applying ISO 55000 requirements. As a result, in the future and once the required 
data is available, the organization can re-assess its state and determine its strength and weakness.  It can be noticed 
that the current practice of measuring the customer satisfaction is not enough, as not all customers are participating in 
the satisfaction survey, which indicates a need for a better method. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The purpose of this work was to assess the state of the facilities management and planning department at an educational 
institute before and after the start of implementing the ISO 55000 requirements. The process of this assessment started 
by identifying the KPIs, shortlisting them and finally performing meetings and interviews to evaluate the KPIs based 
on the available data. ISO 55000 requirements started to positively enhance the department and its performance;

improvement during the different stages. The process of this assessment started by identifying the key performance 
indicators (KPIs) and then performing meetings and interviews with experts to evaluate the KPIs based on the available 
data. It was found that ISO 55000 requirements started to positively enhance the facilities management and planning

Abstract  
The cost overrun on projects brings about poor speculation comes back from the utilization of the 
undertaking, delay in the usage of the general population offices and expanded burden for people in 
general. Putting resources into foundation is a prime method to help financial development, enhance the 
social prosperity of populations, and advance territorial incorporation. In any case, unnecessary cost 
overruns result in expanded subsidizing needs and go about as an imperative to advancement. The 
objective of this study is to identify Building Contractors, Consultants and Clients perception on cost 
overrun in South Africa construction sector, examine factors that cause, or influence cost overrun in 
South Africa construction sector and identify the challenges in the construction sector regarding cost 
overrun. This study employs mixed methods that is an application of both quantitative and qualitative 
approaches to triangulate data. Based on the contractor’s, consultants, and building clients response on 
identification and ranking of the determinants that causes cost escalation in projects from most pressing 
cause to least causes, the study revealed factors as listed in order of most pressing factor as; Poor 
planning, Fluctuation of prices of project materials, High interest rates by bankers, Inflationary pressure, 
Cost of labor, Poor coordination between agents of construction, On site poor financial management, 
Inadequate local production of raw materials.

1. Introduction
The African Development Bank (AfDB), governments and NGO’s are concerned about critical cost accelerations of 
construction in execution. This is especially imperative, given the AfDB's solid sense of duty regarding scale up its 
help to framework improvement, as an operational need of its Ten-Year Strategy 2013-2022 (Mubila, 2014). Putting 
resources into foundation is a prime method to help financial development, enhance the social prosperity of 
populaces, and advance territorial incorporation. In any case, unnecessary cost overruns result in expanded 
subsidizing needs and go about as an imperative to advancement (Mubila, 2014).    
The basic to increase infrastructure and enhance the intensity of African economies is being compelled by 
constrained information accessibility (Gbahabo and Ajuwon, 2017). In fact, there is a shortage of data with respect 
to the expenses of actualizing street foundation extends in Africa, albeit critical information of each cost of 
undertakings development offices in the district. There is in this way a need to efficiently audit and examine these 
sources, to enhance the age of measurable information on the unit expenses of different sorts of street framework 
projects.  
Studies done in the last four years back watched that cost overruns in street infrastructure projects had turned out to 
be progressively normal. The normal cost overwhelm was 35 percent, yet in 33% of the cases it could be as high as 
50 to 100 percent. The suspicion has been that the increments are because of an assortment of elements, 
incorporating absence of rivalry in the offering procedure, increments in fuel and bituminous item costs locally and 
universally, technology utilized as a part of street works, contract management rehearses, and the accessibility and 
nature of street development materials (Mubila, 2014). 
Although the South African construction sector is given high conspicuousness, a few imperfections are observed in

5. Conclusion and Recommendations 
 
The study employed a well-structured questionnaire to solicit views and opinion information particularly perception 
on cost overrun from a conveniently sampled agents in Johannesburg, South Africa. Findings obtained from this 
study indicated that majority of the agents or stakeholders in construction industry perceive proportionally a higher 
cost escalation in the construction projects. Contractors expressed their worry on the escalating cost in their projects.  
Based on the contractor’s, consultants, and building clients response on identification and ranking of the 
determinants that causes cost escalation in projects from most pressing cause to least causes, the study revealed 
factors as listed in order of most pressing factor as; Poor planning, Fluctuation of prices of project materials, High 
interest rates by bankers, Inflationary pressure, Cost of labor, Poor coordination between agents of construction, On 
site poor financial management, Inadequate local production of raw materials.  
Finally, the main challenges or constraints faced in the South African construction industry as indicated by 
respondents were; Constant rising of Project Costs” (Cost overrun) followed by Corruption Issues, Lack of Skilled 
Labor.  
The study recommends following for policy implications. Firstly, government should put keen interest in controlling 
inflation rates and interest rates especially on the cost of building and construction material prices in the South 
African economy. This would go a long way to relieve project contractors’ from incurring marginal cost in their 
construction project budgets. Also, government, vocational/technical construction institutions and NGO’s should 
incorporate project management and financing program (lessons) in their curriculum to educate and improve 
building and construction agent’s knowledge, skills and understanding of potential cost overrun in every project.

Abstract 
The construction industry is heterogeneous and enormously involved with projects that are exposed to an 
uncertainty found in design and planning, presence of various interest of stakeholders, availability of 
resources, environmental factors, the economy of the country and statutory regulations. However, most 
activities of the industry have negative impacts on the environment by generation of construction and 
demolition wastes. Lean Construction (LC) technique gives the opportunity to more but with less of 
everything, lean use less of human effort, equipment, time, and space. This study seeks to appraise the 
benefits of LC technique based on professionals’ opinion in the South African Construction Industry. Well-
structured questionnaire was prepared to collect data from respondents which include Quantity Surveyors, 
Architects, Construction Managers, Project Managers and Civil Engineers. Result of the analysed data 
revealed that clients, consultants and contractors agreed that the most significant benefits of adopting LC 
technique are waste reduction, efficient administration of materials and improved whole-life cost of 
construction projects. This implies that management of construction waste is one of the important 
management processes necessary to achieve project objectives. Recommendation was made that companies 
should use LC to identify and analyse waste to improve productivity, minimise time and accidents, improve 
reliability, improve quality and ensure more client satisfaction.

1. Introduction
The construction industry is heterogeneous and enormously involved with projects that are exposed to an uncertainty 
which is found in design and planning, presence of various interest of stakeholders, availability of resources, 
environmental factors, the economy of the country and statutory regulations (CSIR, U. I., & CIB, C. (2002)). The 
South African CI contributes to the growth of economy of the country, especially the provision of physical 
infrastructures (Takin & Akintoyi, 2002:545). However, most activities of the industry have negative impacts on the 
environment (i.e. generation of construction and demolition wastes), which can be ameliorated through changes in 
management of waste (CSIR, U. I., & CIB, C. (2002)). As established by Womack and Jones (2010:15), Lean 
Construction technique gives the opportunity to more but with less of everything, lean use less of human effort, 
equipment, time, and space. Therefore, the implementation of LC technique is paramount in reducing waste and to 
enhance the overall South African Construction Industry performance.  
By implementing LC tools and principles, productivity is increased, time and accidents are reduced (Mossman, 2009), 
and waste generation significantly minimised. It gives the Construction Industry the opportunity to improve 
sustainability by optimising the utilisation of resources and safety during construction process and minimising waste 
through standard procedures (Nahmens & Ikuma, 2012). Lean Construction (LC) can have a positive effect on safety 
since it contributes to the social dimension of sustainability during the construction phase. It also helps in protecting

Table 1. Presents the respondents ranking of benefits of adopting lean construction technique in the CI. Interesting to 
note that all the factors ranked above average Mean Item Score of 3.00 which is an indication that South African 
Construction Industry experts knows the value of LC technique and they are benefiting from these techniques. The 
results as given in the table indicates that contractors ranked reduced waste as well as improved whole-life cost as 
most important benefits with a MIS of 4.13 and SD=0.640 respectively; efficient administration of materials on site 
was ranked third with MIS of 4.07 and SD=0.799; reduced project timetable was ranked the lowest with MIS of 3.27 
and SD=0.884. 
Clients and consultants also ranked reduced waste first with MIS of 4.33 and SD=0.547, followed by efficient 
administration of materials with MIS of 4.30 and SD=0.466; reduced project timetable was ranked third with MIS of 
4.27 and SD=0.740; Efficient communication among the client and construction team was ranked lowest with MIS of 
3.87 and SD=0.937.  
Jointly, the two category of respondents ranked reduced waste first with the MIS of 4.23 and SD= 0.501; efficient 
administration of materials on site was ranked second with MIS of 4.20 and SD= 0.611, while improved whole-life 
cost was ranked third with MIS of 4.19 and SD=0.760; improved customer satisfaction was ranked fourth with MIS 
of 4.13 and SD=0.711; Improved safety was ranked fifth with MIS of 4.08 and SD=0.810; The effective system with 
less cost is the least benefit, with the MIS of 3.76 and SD of 0.881. It was noted in the opinion of both category of 
respondents that the SD is below 1.00 which indicates that there is little difference in their opinion on the benefits of 
LC technique in the South African CI.  
Findings of this study are in concordance with those of Aigbavboa, Oke and Momoti (2016), Luo & Horman (2005) 
and Mossman (2009), the study revealed that clients, consultants and contractors agreed that the most significant 
benefit in adopting lean construction technique is reduced waste however it seems like all the mentioned benefits are 
important since the overall mean item score is more than 3.5. The findings were not ranked the same but there are 
similarities with what the respondents agreed to be the most significant benefits. Considering individual opinions of 
the categories, it was observed that efficient communication between the client and the construction team ranked 
lowest by the clients and consultants while it was ranked fourth by the contractor which indicates that although there 
are significant benefits of LC to the CI, clients and consultants are of the notion that it has average effect on improving 
effective communication in the construction industry. Same situation was observed for Reduced project timetable 
which ranked lowest by the contractor of which the clients and consultants ranked it third, the differing opinions shows 
that the perspective of the benefits of LC technique by both category of respondents is based on their services rendered 
on a construction project.  
The findings also agree with Womack & Jones (2003) who opined that there are six (6) typical benefits of LC technique 
to the CI. Among the highlighted six benefits are less process waste, reduced inventory, financial savings and reduced 
lead time. These highlighted benefits are in tandem with reduced waste, efficient administration of material, improved 
whole-life cost and reduced project timetable respectively as suggested by construction professionals in the South 
African CI. It also agrees with the findings of Modi & Thakkar (2014) that LC technique helps in encouraging 
collaboration, improves effective communication and increases productivity. It also agrees with a similar research 
carried out by Oguntona, Aigbavboa and Mulongo (2018) which focused on Gauteng province of South Africa. 
5.   Conclusions and Recommendations 
This study has been able to identify the benefits of lean construction technique to the South African Construction 
Industry as also identified by many researchers for other developing countries. Therefore, it is concluded that among 
others, reduced waste and efficient administration of materials are the main benefit which are the core objectives of 
LC technique. Since managing construction waste is one of the most significant management processes necessary to 
achieve project objectives, it is hereby recommended that companies should use lean construction to identify and 
analyse waste to improve productivity, minimise time and accidents, improve reliability, improve quality and ensure 
more client satisfaction. For further studies, this research can also be carried out in other provinces of South Africa to 
have a wider knowledge of the opinion of Construction Industry professionals on the benefits of LC technique.

Abstract 
In has long been established that the escape and consequent permeation of landfill leachate through a 
barrier medium is one of the contributing factors to environmental contamination, especially where vital 
regions with consequential impacts are concerned as in the case of soil, surface, subsurface and 
groundwater pollution. Although the contamination process of environmental resources from leachate 
permeation may be slow, it poses a significant threat to human and environmental health in the long run. 
These challenges paved way for the study to evaluate via laboratory tests the permeation rates of a landfill 
mineral lining system as compacted clay liner (CCL) overlain an unsaturated/ vadose and saturated zone 
of known thicknesses respectively. The laboratory permeation tests were conducted to simulate the 
moisture flow regime and steady/ quasi steady-state permeation rates for typical conditions of a landfill. 
The results of the tests revealed the hydraulic conductivity of the fine textured vadose zone to be 1-2 
magnitude in order lesser than the saturated zone hydraulic conductivity. Nonetheless, the hydraulic 
conductivity of the mineral barrier and the permeation rate to underlying groundwater was found to 
dependent on the nature of the zone as the last line of defense to contaminant permeation in the event of 
leachate breakthrough. Thickness values of up to 225 mm for the fine textured zones were reached which 
appeared to be functional parts of the tested landfill mineral liner. Consequently, the vadose zone was 
found to behave better than the saturated zone in the permeability of the overall lining system as such, 
upshots of the tests showed permeability coefficient of the CCL of 24 mm natural clay mineral liner to be 
the key regulator of the steady/ quasi steady-state permeation rates in the overall system lining setup.

1. Introduction
The escape and eventual permeation of leachate through landfill liners as reported by Rowe (2011) is one of the 
major challenges to soil, surface, subsurface and groundwater contamination. It has been established that in South 
Africa as in many parts of the world, composite lining systems comprising of either a geomembrane (GM) or 
geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) and compacted clay liner (CCL) are used in waste containment facilities. Significant 
research have been done and more are ongoing on factors and effects of leachate permeation through landfill lining 
liners (Touze-Foltz et al., 2006). Similarly, studies by Rowe et al., (2004) showed how single low permeability clay 
liners have been effective in containing advective leachate permeation to regions of consequential impacts. It has 
been established that in the absence of a GM but with a leachate collection system (LCS) of typical design heads up 
to 0.3 m, CCL dependent on the natural geology/ aquitards can prevent leachate permeation through landfill liner

4. Conclusions 
This study investigated on soil mineral lining systems to determine the effect of vadose zone on leachate permeation 
behaviour. A laboratory fabricated permeation column hybrid device was employed in the testing procedure with 
materials sampled from an active landfill site around the CoJ. The overall permeation rate, Q for the lining system 
was determined under certain boundary conditions presented in the study. It was therefore emphasized that failure to 
consider the presence of a vadose zone underlying a CCL can result in significant underestimation of the permeation 
through the clayey liner, thereby leading to consequential effects to sensitive underground regimes on the event of a 
contaminant escape from landfills. This consideration is based on the effect of the vadose zone on the permeation 
through the CCL. It was also noted that hydraulic conductivity of a soil is a function of water content among other 
factors. Therefore from the results and analysis, the following conclusions were reached: 
 
In the fine textured soils, the vadose zone was observed to have 1 - 2 difference in order of magnitude 
lesser than the saturated zone; which was conceivably due to the difference in MC, pore-water pressure and 
density of zones. 
 
The permeation rate for the overall mineral lining system for the vadose and saturated zones were 
determined as 0.0043×10-6 m3/s and 0.0061×10-5 m3/s after breakthrough was reached respectively. 
 
In the permeability of the overall lining system, the vadose soil zone was found to behave better than the 
saturated soil zone. 
 
In an event of contaminant breakaway, the vadose zone can function as advective barrier as was the case in 
the study, as well as an effective diffusive barrier. 
 
The tests revealed the permeability coefficient of the CCL to be the key factor of steady/ quasi steady-state 
permeation rates through the overall barrier system. 
In a nutshell, the effect of hydraulic conductivity of the mineral soil as CCL was observed to be highly influential 
over the tested zones. Hence, it is important that critical considerations be given in the design of a functional mineral 
lining systems. Finally, the study has significantly established by laboratory simulation of permeation tests that the 
soil liner contributes a crucial controlling feature for leachate permeation into regimes with consequential effects.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to systematically improve the performance of engineering assets. This has been 
achieved using the six-sigma DMAIC methodology: define, measure, analyze, improve and control. Other 
tools have been used such as fishbone diagram, Pareto-chart, six-hats, quality function deployment, multiple 
criteria decision making. The methodology was tested by implementing it at the physical plant department 
at an educational institute in UAE. Primary historical data were collected for the period 2016-2017, and 
secondary data were collected by distributing questionnaire. It was found that the main identified problems 
are poor service quality in air-conditioning and Internet. These problems are related to the lack of preventive 
maintenance strategy, low level of competence and skills, poor quality of spare parts, low labor efficiency 
and effectiveness. A set of relevant solutions were identified. Implementing six-sigma DMAIC 
methodology helps organizations sustain best performance and customer satisfaction which result in 
achieving organizational excellence.

1. Introduction
The comfort and satisfaction of the occupants of buildings in hot countries like UAE become very important. Indoor 
environments quality becomes more important than before because people spend more time in their offices, and other 
types of buildings. These stakeholders are expecting high quality services in these facilities that should meet and 
exceed their requirements and expectations. Analyzing stakeholder’s requirements and expectations can result in 
identifying the main common problems they are facing and provide solutions which may result in improving 
performance and stakeholder’s satisfaction. Six-Sigma define, measure, analyze, improve and control (DMAIC) 
improvement methodology has been used as a continuous improvement tool for many years (Alsyouf, Al-Aomar, Al-
Hamed, & Qiu, 2011; Alsyouf, Kumar, Al-Ashi, & Al-Hammadi, 2018; Shahada & Alsyouf, 2012; Shamsuzzaman, 
Alzeraif, Alsyouf, & Khoo, 2018; Zugelder, 2012) However, despite their wide use in the manufacturing industry, 
their application in the service industry has been limited (Dieterich et al., 2017). Although DMAIC methodology was 
used in educational institutes, however, it was not used for measuring and improving the performance of the physical 
plants of educational facilities. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to investigate how to continuously improve 
the performance of physical plants at educational institutes using six-sigma DMAIC methodology. The structure of 
this paper is sequenced as follow: section II presents the methodology used, section III shows the results and 
discussion, and section IV represents the conclusion.

In the following we list possible final suggestions and recommendations to improve the performance: 
 
1. Conduct monthly planned maintenance check-up. 
2. Invest on new cooling system such as central AC. 
3. Shift from “Corrective maintenance” to “preventive maintenance” to prevent breakdowns from happening. 
4. Invest on new condition monitoring technologies such as vibration analysis, infra-red cameras, acoustic 
sound analysis. 
5. Use high quality long life cycle spare parts. 
6. Increase operator’s skills and competence by hiring the right person. 
7. Implement training and education courses to increase willingness of operators. 
 
Finally, multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) can be used as tool to select the most suitable recommendation.  
 
 
3.5 Control 
 
Monitoring the current state is a must, monitoring will help to control an improvement and reduce failures as much as 
possible to achieve the main goal which is stakeholder’s satisfaction.  
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
This study will increase stakeholder’s satisfaction by meeting their expectations and reduce number of breakdowns 
and failures that they are facing, as a result of using DMAIC methodology and other industrial tools; we are the first

Abstract 
System effectiveness in crude oil processing industries can be constrained by operational 
efficiency of the constitutive units. Thus ascertaining availability status of all system units can 
provide decision makers with an effective means of improving the technical performance of 
complex processing systems. Most of the works found in literatures focused on either models 
specifically for estimation of interval, instantaneous or stationary availability with specific repair 
distributions or models with mathematical complexities whose underlying assumptions impose 
ample application constraints to industries. This paper proposes a proof of concept compact 
generalized model for determination of availability of complex processing industries. The 
approach is clearly presented as an off-shoot of earlier but independent availability models (Lie 
et al. 1977, Ebeling, 2010). The applicability of the models has been illustrated using data 
obtained from a typical oil company, which will be called X-Company for the sake of 
confidentiality. The unit availability for the studied period as well as mean annual availability of 
the system can all be computed with the models. The lowest and highest availability values 
recorded for the units were 0.083 and 0.692 respectively. The mean system availability during 
the period stood at 0.451. The result shows that the proposed model is a good means of 
computing system availability. The results have also updated decision makers support tools for 
system performance improvement.

maintenance improvement program to reverse the trend. This presentation has exposed the availabilities of each unit 
which can guide managers and practitioners more properly on the hierarchy of attention to be accorded to specific 
units for improved system performance. It has also presented a useful model that can track availability status of 
components up to system levels. 
The future direction of the research will involve investigation of root cause of the low mean availability level and its 
analysis to further provide availability improvement policies that can be used alongside the results of this research 
work.

Conclusion 
 
A general approach for the determination of availability status of processing plants and allied industries has been 
proposed in this paper. The method of models formulation is clearly presented as an off-shoot of earlier but 
independent availability models (Lie et al. 1977, Ebeling, 2010). The applicability of the models has been illustrated 
on relevant data obtained from a typical X-company. The results were graphically displayed and the significance 
properly explained. The unit availability for the entire period as well as mean annual availability of the system can 
all be computed with the models. The lowest and highest availability values recorded were 0.083 and 0.692 
respectively at the Kero Hydro-treating unit and second boiler unit. The mean system availability during the study 
stretch is about 0.451. The result shows that managers and practitioners should embark on urgent availability 
improvement strategies to improve the functionality and effectiveness of the company.

Dimensional Analysis of Natural Vibrations of Planar 
Multilink Flexible Robots with Elastic Constraints at

Abstract 
Non-dimensional variables are very useful as they reduce the number of variables when analyzing 
physical phenomenon. In this paper, the solutions to the frequency equation of multilink flexible robots 
with elastic constraints is analyzed in a compact form using the dimensional analysis. First, dimensionless 
governing differential equation of motion is presented. Second, dimensionless boundary conditions are 
obtained. Third, the dimensionless frequency equation and the orthogonality conditions among the mode 
shapes are derived. Fourth, some degenerate cases are developed and compared against some existing 
models. Finally, dimensionless wave numbers are plotted for various joint stiffness ratio to show the 
influence of various dimensionless parameters on the natural vibrational behavior of the planar multilink 
flexible robots. 
Keywords  
Dimensionless, planar, mode, vibration, wave. 
1. Introduction
Most studies dealing with the vibrational behavior of planar multilink flexible robots have considered the base of 
each link as clamped to the actuator gearhead shaft. Such approaches however failed to consider the relative 
displacement between link and actuator shaft. Beards (1995) observed that actual connections have always some 
degree of flexibility. Moreover, few previous published studies focus on the dimensional analysis of the multilink 
flexible robots. However, dimensionless analysis reduces the number of relevant variables needed to describe a 
physical phenomenon (Volker, Bernhard & Hassan, 2017). Han, Benaroya and Wei (1999) investigated the 
dynamics of transversely vibrating beams using dimensionless quantities. The aim of this paper is to conduct a 
dimensional analysis of natural vibrations of planar multilink flexible robots with elastic constraints focusing on the 
dimensionless wave numbers. 
1. Equation of motion and boundary conditions
Consider a planar multilink flexible robot with link i connected to the shaft of the gearhead of the ith actuator. The 
link- shaft connection can be modelled as either clamped or elastic. Figure 1 represents the traditional clamped 
model against the elastic constraint model.

From Figure 9, it is clear that when the actual moment at the end of link 2 changes from 0.0028 to 0.01, the 
 
curve moves downward with a slight change of shape in the region of higher joint stiffness. 
 
Figure 10 shows that when the contribution of masses non-collocated at the distal end of link 1 decreases from 3 to 
0.5, the 
 curve undergoes a steeping twist shift, which implies that the first wave number of link 1 that is less 
sensitive in the region of low joint stiffness, becomes more sensitive in the region of high joint stiffness. 
 
As shown in Figure 11, when the contribution of masses of distal link increases from 0.5 to 1.149, the 
 curve 
shifts upward without losing its shape, which implies that the second wave numbers of link 1 on all joint stiffness 
values increase by the same amount. However, as the contribution of masses of distal link reaches 3, the 
 curve 
undergoes a parallel upward shift up to transition, where there is a steeping twist shift, after which the slope drops to 
zero. 
 
Conclusion 
In this paper, a dimensional analysis for planar multilink robot was performed. For this purpose, some physical 
dimensionless parameters and variables were defined to express the system physical parameters in a compact form. 
The general dimensionless frequency equation and boundary conditions were developed. Some degenerate cases 
were derived and compared against the existing models. The general frequency equation was solved for various 
dimensionless stiffness values and the results discussed. The results show that the first and second wave numbers 
decrease when the actual mass and moment at the distal end of flexible links increase. However, when the 
contribution of mass of distal link is increased, the first wave number decreases while the second wave number 
increases. The findings from this analysis contribute towards enhancing our understanding of the effects of different 
physical parameters on the natural vibrations of planar multilink flexible robots.

Abstract 
The study focused on the research performance of the world class Universities with emphasis on the 
performances of African Universities as compared to the western Universities. One of the best University 
according to (World University Ranking) was selected from each continent and six (6) continents were 
considered. The study also evaluated the performances of each University in terms of total student’s 
subscription, student per staff, and percentage of international student’s subscription. The result showed 
that Oxford University was rated number one with an output research of 99.5% followed by California 
University of Technology having a research output of 97.3%. The result also showed that University of 
Cape Town had research output of 36.2%. This is quite poor compared to Oxford University. However, 
reasons for this output were discussed and the way forward were suggested on the need to becoming a 
winning University.

1. Introduction
1.1 
 Exploring Research Importance 
The technological advancement of the top world countries relies heavily on research. This can as well be traced 
to the quality standard invested in their education system. It is therefore important to say that investment in 
research for academics and students is needful to develop competencies in their various chosen field. Applied 
research approach deals with solving immediate problems of societies or an industry, and this largely depend on 
research tools and equipment availability.  
Great solutions have been achieved from the work of many researchers. For instance, Vouri et al., 2015 
emphasized on the importance of formal research training for postgraduate students before they embark on their 
residency in pharmaceutical studies. Top pharmaceutical positions requires research expectations and this can 
only be achieved formally. Lack of adequate research skill would make certain advanced positions unattainable 
in the field of pharmaceutical studies. Therefore, pharmaceutical students must continue to develop research 
skills during their clinical in order to develop a better curriculum program Anderson & Saseen, 2017. 
According to Hanson & Weinstock, 2016, the relationship between human response and microorganisms 
involved adequate research that would provide a multivariate data. This data set would make certain preventive 
solutions to the causative agents of diseases possible. Therefore, research in diseases and health prevention can 
only be possible where adequate and accessible equipment are available. More so, to improve our 
undergraduate and postgraduate research skills, certain factors are important such as; faculty interaction using 
demonstrative and applied research equipment, engineering or research field of interest and also use of 
appropriate library skills. This will not only broaden the learning capacity of students, but the ability to develop 
and engage in research and publications, thereby contributing to the University’s research concept Soria., 2013.

Universities are committed to sponsoring and retaining good researchers to enable them transform lives through 
research. They provide world class teaching and research thereby producing graduates of pure distinctions and high 
international standard. On the contrary, the best University in Africa continent is the University of Cape Town in 
South Africa with a research output of 36.2% making the university number 171 in the ranking. This is quite 
incomparable to the winning Universities. Our institutions are backward owing to the result of our teaching, 
research, publications and citations. That is why you see most of our academics travelling to this Universities to do 
Post-Doctoral research work because the research aids are not available for them to use. 
Research attracts more researchers. It is a gear that can drive our University output and in turn increase our impact in 
meeting the need of mankind and Africa at large. Therefore, the African Universities must understand that 
competing to be a world class University meant a global task and it is quite intense. Academics, graduates and post 
graduates will benefit a lot from improved method of teaching and research aids that are available. Therefore, since 
the University system is a platform for drawing talent, the stakeholders must look into adequate provision of 
research aids instead of teaching aids. This will eventually help us in raising new generation of researchers that can 
and will solve African problem.

Abstract 
The driving force behind this research is the disposal of contaminated water in municipal drains by 
abattoirs in the meat production sector in South Africa, while the Country’s Water crisis remains 
unabated. The Government cannot allow contamination of the little available water. This paper is an 
attempt to determine an effective management of waste water generated by abattoirs, taking data from a 
typical abattoir located at Ekurhuleni, East of Johannesburg. The abattoir slaughters about a Hundred and 
twenty (120) cattle per day and produces about 60m3 of waste water to the effluent plant. Its treatment 
facilities uses mechanical processes for the treatment of the Beef waste water. This research adopts a 
method whereby the waste water sample is collected, and taken to a standard laboratory for analysis. 
Laboratory reagents are then introduced to the partially treated water. Flocculation tests were conducted 
to aid the sedimentation of the undesired substance. The waste water treatment plant at the current status 
has been found to reduce the Chemical Oxygen demand (COD) from 7000-6000ppm, Conductivity from 
7.5 - 5.5 mS/cm, Total suspended solids (TSS) from 700-650ppm, Nitrates from 720-600 ppm, and 
Phosphates from 600-400ppm.  Some of the reagents used include but not limited to aluminium chlorate, 
ferriflocc, ferric chloride and Polymers. The results show that quality of the mechanically treated water 
can be improved by reducing the COD by 39%, TSS by 58%, Phosphates and nitrates by an average of 
40% apiece.

Introduction
South Africa is a semi-desert with only 40% annual rain fall amounting to an average of 450mm per annum, hence 
South Africa is a water scarce country compared to the world whose average rainfall is 860mm. The Global 
warming environmental and climate adversities are worsening the Water crisis in the Country. The estimated annual 
volume of water in South Africa is averaged to 50 billion m3, of which 10 billion m3 of that water originates from 
Lesotho. About 15% percent of available Water is used by the industry. This implies that up to 7.5 billion m3 is 
channeled to satisfy Industrial needs. About 25% is used by the domestic sector while the remaining 60% percent 
finds usage in agricultural activities. The use of treated Water for irrigation, pollution of rivers with chemicals 
(fertilizers) constitute further reduction in usable Water.  
Water plays inalienable role in the sustenance of plants and animals and by virtue of its fundamental 
composition, can be termed fugitive in nature. Though water is very easily contaminated by dissolving many solutes 
into itself, it can better be described as a flux rather than a stock. When managed effectively, water can be a 
renewable resource [1]. Poor quality water is not good for either human or industrial use as it can threaten life.

which does not support aquatic life. Nitrates can also cause Methemeglobinemia a disease that can cause death to 
infants. It can be removed by de-Nitrification from water. Many researchers such as Zang, Su and Puls came with 
different perspectives of  de-Nitrification reaction. The  following is the chemical reaction of zero valent Iron and 
Nitrate. 
Fe0 + 2NO3- + 6H2O  
N2 + 5Fe2+ +12OH- 
4Fe0 + NO3- + 7H2O  
NH4+ + 4Fe2+ +10OH- 
The Nitrates Curve resembles more the suspended solids curve. They all look similar. The ferriflocc removed 
Nitrates by 88.83%. The Aluminium Chloro hydrate removed the Nitrates by 71.60 and the ferric chloride removed 
he nitrates by 90.78%.

Conclusion 
The study seem successful since the Chemical reagents applied  in the Project proves to be appropriate in the Quality 
improvement of the abattoir waste water treatment    A methodology to optimize the waste water treatment plant of 
the abattoir at Ekurhuleni east of Johannesburg can be invented to correct the current status quo. The researcher 
recommends that a clarifier be installed in order for the abattoir waste water treatment plant to practice 
sedimentation activities in the plant to further improve the waste water Quality.

Abstract 
This study is focused on super hard materials in terms of their characteristics assessment, super-hardness 
coating techniques and super-hardness coatings as corrosion inhibitors. However, plasma cladding 
showed good and effective technique for surface performance enhancement. Taper abrasion tests revealed 
enhanced good mechanical wear resistivity of the coatings which was the result of applying the 
magnetron sputtering technique. Also the study showed the importance of super-hard coatings techniques 
as corrosion inhibitors in roofing materials in protecting the roofing sheet from corrosion or rust due to 
the influence of moisture content of the air as well as rainfall.

Introduction 
The quest for super hardness in materials by researchers is important because proper combination of material 
hardness value which can exceed the hardness value of diamond provides a better material for advance 
manufacturing purposes. Hardness therefore is the measure of the ability of a material to resist failure when 
subjected to load. Further definition of theoretical hardness, is a measure of the resistance of a material to 
deformation under isostatic stress (Vepr, 1999). According to (Fischer-cripps, 2016), in measuring hardness of a 
material, the area of projection of the indent performed in a significant pattern when the indenting device is 
withdrawn which invariably led to an immense rise in the measured hardness value by a factor of two. Therefore, 
from finite element analysis approach measurement of hardness by indentation revealed that the Meyer measure of 
abrasion of diamond is greater compared to that of the controlled quality when the indentation is used as a 
fundamental calculation. However better hardness values in materials such as Zn-Sn-Ti coating of mild steel can be 
obtained by applying laser technology. A laser power application of 750W and 900W together with a scanning 
speed of 0.6 and 0.8 m/min produced a better hardness value as well as better corrosion resistance and 
microstructure of the mild steel. It can be deduced therefore that surface hardness values and better corrosion 
behavior can be improved using that laser alloy of Zn-Sn-Ti on UNS G10150 steel (O.S. Fatoba, A.P.I. Popoola,

Abstract 
The photo-catalysis technology has been effective and efficient in the reduction of chemical oxygen demand (COD) 
in wastewater. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is one of the most commonly used photo-catalyst and plays significant a 
major role in reducing COD concentration levels in wastewater. The polyaniline (PANI) was synthesized using an 
in-situ chemical oxidative polymerization method. This work focused on the reduction of COD in distillery 
wastewater using an annular rector under batch mode. The influent was diluted at different concentration levels of 
about 5 ml/l, 10 ml/l and 20 ml/l. The pH condition was adjusted at pH of 1.00, 2.00, 3.00, 4.00 and 5.00 in order to 
evaluate its effect on the COD reduction efficiencies. The TiO2/PANI was prepared in different ratios and was 
allowed to mix with the wastewater for a good homogeneity mixture. The experiments were carried out at ambient 
temperature (± 25 ºC), whereby solutions were pumped into the photo reactor (annular) inserted with a 25 UVC 
lamp. The results indicated that the concentrations of all three solutions without the catalyst decreased from 355 
mg/l, 655 mg/l and 837 mg/l to 325 mg/l, 572 mg/l and 820 mg/l, respectively. The solutions containing the catalyst 
also decreased from 325 mg/l, 572 mg/l and 820 mg/l to 344 mg/l, 475 mg/l and 752 mg/l, respectively. The results 
showed an increasing reduction trend of 2%, 2%, 19%, 20% and 26 % when the catalyst was used at pH of 6.0. It 
can be concluded that photo-catalysis can reduce COD in distillery wastewater when running under both 
recirculation and continuous. It can therefore be recommended that higher adjustments of pH can be done, and the 
process can be operated for more than 2 hours to further enhance the COD reduction in distillery wastewater.

1. Introduction
The effluents produced by most of the industries (gaseous or liquid) are harmful to health and the environment in 
general. The presence of undesired substances in liquid effluents can be disastrous as they pose serve threats to the 
immediate recipients. Wastewater from various factories, industries, laboratories, etc. are serious problems to the 
environment(Akpan and Hameed, 2009). 
Different industrial effluents such as agrochemical, Kraft-bleaching, pulp and paper, and distillery wastes contains 
biological organic contaminants which are not easily removed by biological treatment (Susree et al., 2013). 
Distillery wastewater usually contains extremely high traces of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Total Organic 
Carbon (TOC) and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) which cannot be released into the environment without 
treatment(Selvanathan and Deshpande, 2014).  
The shortage of fresh water has led to the exploration of effective technologies for treatment of wastewater for reuse 
purposes. Conventional wastewater treatment is said to be inefficient when coming to the degradation of 
contaminants such as organic compound, since the micro – organic pollutants have the ability to avoid elimination in 
most wastewater treatment plants(Mecha et al., 2017).  
Amongst the many techniques developed for wastewater treatment, the use of advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) 
has be implemented to refinement the effluents of wastewater to the required standards. The AOPs have been

5. Conclusions and Recommendations  
5.1 Conclusions  
The study was conducted to evaluate the reduction of COD in distillery wastewater using the PANI/TiO2 catalyst. 
From the experiments conducted, it can be seen that photo-catalysis of distillery wastewater was an efficient process 
of degrading COD, the results showed the process is effect with and without the addition of a catalyst. However, an 
addition of a catalyst increases the efficiency. Results showed that the reduction of COD in distillery wastewater can 
be done using photo-degradation, however, the process requires more processing time and an addition of a catalyst 
to be efficient.  
 
The results obtained the from the 5 ml/l diluted distillery wastewater, for both the solutions (without and with the 
catalyst) showed no consistence in decrease of the COD concentrations. The results for the 10 ml/l and 20 ml/l 
diluted distillery wastewater showed a decrease in concentration. Therefore, the UV light had an effect on the 
concentration with the assistance of the catalyst. 
 
One can conclude that pH has a great effect on the reduction of COD, as seen from results in figure 3-5. The results 
showed COD reduction of 2%, 2%, 19%, 20% and 26 % when pH was adjusted to 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively, all 
operated under the same conditions (room temperature, stirring speed = 360 rpm, pumping speed = 55 ml/min).  
 
5.2 Recommendations  
Results showed the reduction of COD in distillery wastewater, proving that photo-catalysis is one of the process that 
can be used to treat this type of effluent. However, the study recommends that the process should be conducted for 
more than 2 hours and be conducted under isolation (the beaker containing the solution should be closed) to prevent 
any sort of contamination.  
 
In addition, the hypothesized 50% reduction of COD could have been achieved if the pH was adjusted to be more 
basic (< 7), by observing the obtained results. The result might show a different deviation if the process was 
conducted in both batch and continuous mode. Due to time constraints and lack of distillery wastewater, the process 
was conducted only in batch mode.

Abstract 
Transport remains connected to our indigenous habitat, wellbeing and monetary thriving which rely upon 
good transport frameworks that provides effectiveness, comfort, fairness as well as affordability. Public 
transport is often framed as key component of building sustainable cities. Nonetheless, present estimations 
recommend that transport development is unjustifiable. Transport intimidates the social, economic, and our 
environmental future. Modifying as well as overseeing patterns of transport shows a critical issue which 
necessitates collaboration from participants’ at all governmental spheres. The paper presents a critical 
literature review of the relationship between public transport and sustainability. The paper contributes to 
transport domain by identifying the key problems associated with sustainability of transport based on the 
perceptions and discussions of significant literature on transport. The attention is on connection amongst 
sustainable transport division and the sustainable development within South African setting. Outcomes 
demonstrate that the concept of sustainable transportation has received recognition from the globe and 
improvement of sustainable transport is evident around the city. This work concludes that sustainable 
transportation is still a long process for developing countries, as it provides a progression of proposals that 
are intended to upgrade the execution of the Johannesburg transport development and design method, with 
suggested changes for moving transportation improvement to a sustainable motivation.

1. Background
In this century, both the private and public transportation divisions are facing difficulties due to an expansion in car 
possession as well as the suburbanization of the residences and firms in the ecosphere. Previously, transportation was 
revolved around focal regions of urban communities where work densities and high populace empowered constant 
administrations, high inhabitance rates and numerous courses (Vaz & Venter, 2012). Todes (2012) state that as 
development is scattering to country domains from the urban zone, public transport experiences fundamental 
challenges, to expand services with the end goal of delivering high quality service to commuters and to coordinate 
rural administration with metropolitan administration. 
As indicated by Yusuf and Allopi (2010), the idea of Bus Rapid Transit System started in 1937 in Chicago, be that as 
it may, the full system was just actualized in 1974 in Curitiba, Brazil. The first system in Brazil was worked in 1974 
in the city of Curitiba by the mayor, architect Jaime Lerner, and turned into the primary BRT on the planet with the 
objective to give amazing rail travel administration to clients and at a practically identical cost (Wright & Hook, 2007). 
Pirie (1992) likewise includes that Curitiba's prosperity motivated the execution of comparable plans in excess of 100 
urban communities around the globe, including the Brazilian urban areas of Brasília, São Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Rio 
de Janeiro, Manaus, Goiânia, Porto Alegre Aracaju, Recife and Salvador.

as per Sandra within the city are improving access to employment opportunities to individuals who are faced with 
unemployment. TODs happen along significant transport streets because of the improvement of the network 
transportation (Ndebele and Ogra, 2014). Within the city this comprises of student accommodation, for example, the 
South Point accommodations, and in addition infrastructure investment with patching up of city structures. A result 
of politically-sanctioned racial segregation spatial arranging is having numerous individuals who were compelled to 
live far from urban centers. Rea Vaya is improving majority of the conditions that were brought about politically-
sanctioned racial segregation city structure, through bringing individuals who were barred in the past once more into 
the city. From a social point of view the Rea Vaya has brought individuals from various zones together, furnished 
them with the chance to drive to the city and brought individuals closer to financial openings. The above note being 
said, it is crucial to be aware of the lack of access to Rea Vaya to certain individuals within the city. Be that as it may, 
there are a few stations to which travelers may reach for Rea Vaya. Notwithstanding the aim for this framework to be 
in walkable distances from commuters’ work place/home, it isn't generally the occasion. Sandra emphasized be that 
as it may, the municipality is moving in the direction of the improvement of a coordinated transport framework which 
was declared by the Minister of Transport in June, 2013. The approach of an integrated transport system would connect 
the distinctive transport modes, resulting in effective movements within the city. Johannesburg does not gloat a 
completely coordinated transport framework along these lines integration ought to reach out past methods of transport 
and ought to incorporate coordination in scheduling and transport fares. 
8. Conclusions & Recommendations 
 
The city of Johannesburg is still working towards achieving transit oriented development. Be that as it may, the 
strategy that the city has around the improvement of the corridors of freedom gives chances for transit oriented 
advancement with blended land use planning. The method of reasoning for the improvement of the BRT framework 
is to give an accessible, protected, dependable type of transport to the communities (McCaul & Ntuli, 2011). It has 
been in this investigation that the framework currently isn't open to the larger part of communities in the city. The 
Phase1b was introduced during the year 2013, and intended to attract more individual from different zones to use 
public transport, for example, Auckland Park to the down town area. Lack of accessibility is another reasons a number 
of individuals still utilize their private vehicles to move around; in any case, workers who can't manage the cost of 
having private cars are then compelled to using informal transport, for example, the taxis which are seen as more 
available compared to the BRT Rea Vaya. This system has resulted in various difficulties for the private car users as 
well as taxi business. With the conducting of this investigation the Rea Vaya system had been discovered to be 
unreachable to the dominant part of the communities within the city. Even though the future strategy of the city 
demonstrate the BRT Rea Vaya expansion to all zones around the city, the framework still remains inaccessible 
compared to informal taxis. To be able to attend to these issues it is important to integrate the diverse methods of 
transport. All together for this system to be cost effective, it is important for the municipality to adopt on friendly 
integrated fare prices as recommended by Sandra. It can make the system reasonable thus addressing the necessities 
of the less privileged. The city needs to gain from the achievement and disappointments of the BRT frameworks in 
the other nations where it has been a success. Maybe the Rea Vaya Management could watch best routine with regards 
to other transport frameworks in Johannesburg, for example, the Metro Bus and Putco and plan an installed charge 
installment like that utilized by Metro Bus. The Putco and Metro Bus were regarded as an effective installment 
technique by members as passengers would only pay their fare on the transport than having to make cards at the 
station. These buses have been working in the city for a long time, the newly introduced BRT Rea Vaya can gain from 
the achievement and disappointments of these buses and adopt on them to enhance this framework.

Abstract 
Energy efficiency of furnace should be based on its ability to conserve heat within the combustion 
chamber. This depends mainly on the design and furnace materials selection. The coal fired furnace is 
common amongst the rural foundries in Limpopo province of South Africa. The coal fired furnace is used 
to melt aluminium scraps to cast the three legged aluminium pots commonly used as cooking utensil and 
sold within the local and national communities. The coal fired furnace is used due to its easy to 
manufacture, to operate and its low capital and running costs investment which is suitable for small batch 
production. However, made of a mere superposition of two steel drums, the current coal fired furnaces in 
rural foundries have long melting time ~ 6 hours, due to the design and material selected in manufacturing 
the furnace. This paper presents the analysis of design and material components of rural foundries 
furnaces in South Africa and studies the energy efficiency of the coal fired furnace. Technical testing of 
the energy balance through the furnace i.e. energy in and output was conducted. Findings show that with a 
heat loss of 2887.2 MJ and an energy efficiency of only 3.37%. The heat loss was one of the main 
contributions to the experienced long melting duration. The insufficient supply of oxygen or air into coal 
fuel also plays a critical role in the performance of the furnace, since combustion of coal depends greatly 
on the supply of oxygen or air.  To improve the heat retention and the energy efficiency, a re-design of the 
coal fired furnace used in the rural foundries and selection of specified new lining materials were 
introduced.

From the study conducted, the recommendations include the re-designed and prototyped furnace 
should be adopted and test for the optimisation of its performance be conducted. The prototype 
should be transferred to the rural foundry as trigger to generate new ideas about further 
improvement of the design of the furnace.

Abstract 
The aim of this paper was to explore the prevalence of the use of performance measures in the oil 
and gas industry and their impacts on organisational performance.  A questionnaire survey was 
designed with a set of performance measures that was developed based on earlier a combination 
of literature review and exploratory interview of practitioners. These measures comprise of 
financial measures, operational measures, safety measures, environmental and social 
responsibility measures. The questionnaire was distributed amongst 550 oil and gas companies in 
the UK and 120 companies in Malaysia.  The response rate was 17%. A correlation analysis was 
conducted using SPSS to evaluate the impact of the choice of performance measures on the 
actual organisational performance.  This study reveals the prevalence of performance measures 
in the Oil and Gas industry based on the level of importance. In addition, it shows that 
performance measurement framework has a significant positive correlation with the overall 
organisational performance.  As little research has been conducted on performance measurement 
within the oil and gas industry, these findings provides additional insights into the usage and 
roles of performance measurement in the industry. Further research can be conducted to 
investigate the most influential measures in determining overall organisational performance in 
this industry.  This study provides some guidance to practitioners with regards to the potential of 
specific measures in enhancing overall organisational performance.

Abstract 
This research focuses on the performance comparison of real-coded Genetic Algorithms (GA) and 
Biogeography-based Optimization (BBO) algorithms. Specifically, it takes three modified versions of the 
original algorithms made suitable for continuous operations (real-coded) – the standard real-coded GA 
(SRCGA), the real-coded GA with mathematical projection (RCGA-P) and the real coded-biogeography-
based optimization algorithm (RCBBO); then conducts a performance-based comparison of these three 
with respect to convergence, speed and robustness criteria. This comparison was done using 52 standard 
optimization benchmark problems over four, ten and twenty dimensions. Results show that overall, 
SRCGA outperforms the others for speed while RCGA-P was the most robust of the three. The major 
value-add in performance of RCBBO was mainly from speed as in two dimensions, it delivers better 
speed than the two real-coded GA

 Overview 
1.1 Introduction 
Historically, differential calculus was used to find minima or maxima of optimization problems, from the 
introduction of Gantt Charts in 1900, to its use in determining economic order quantity by Harris in 1915; from the 
queuing analysis of Erlang to its more recent uses in Network flow, knapsack, facility location and layout, logistics 
and transportation, production planning and scheduling problems (Sarker, Newton 2007).  In all these cases, 
optimization problems have shown increasing levels of complexity.

Overall, as a group, the RCGAs displayed a higher robustness when compared with RCBBO especially with D = 20 
where for all problems, RCBBO was not the most robust algorithm for all the runs. For D = 4 and 10, RCBBO did 
show superior performance over the others for Easom, Paviani, Ackley 1, Levy Montalvo 1, Levy Montalvo 2, 
Paviani, Salomon respectively. With the exception of D = 20 where SRCGA showed more robustness, RCGA-P 
otherwise was the most robust algorithm.  
The statistical result shows that with increasing dimensions, the success rate of all the algorithms was reduced. Also, 
certain characteristics of problems made RCBBO perform better namely continuous, differentiable. On the whole 
GAs as a group showed to be more robust than RCBBO.  
4.3 Conclusion 
The result confirmed that the real-coded GAs are generally more robust than the real-coded BBO with the 
application of the projection feature enhancing this robustness. As such, problems whose have a range of applicable 
objective functions could benefit from the use of GAs. However performance based on speed showed that the real-
coded BBO proffered a better alternative to the projection based GA variant (RCGA-P) in all cases; therefore 
problems for which convergence is of higher priority could consider BBOs..

Abstract 
The current development of thermo-acoustic devices suggests that there is a possibility to enhance their 
performance even further. This technology could potentially contribute to the effort to swap conventional 
pollutant energy refrigerators/generators with environmental friendlier systems in the forthcoming years. 
The configuration of the regenerator is so far believed to be one of the factor that could contribute to the 
improvement the performance of the engine. This paper aims to investigate the behaviour of a designed 
thermo-acoustic engine when changing the porosity of the regenerator. It also aims to provide guidance 
on the construction, from mostly scrap and cheap materials, of a traveling wave looped-tube thermo-
acoustic engine capable of generating higher sound level. The design is conducted using a code program 
named Design Environment for Low-Amplitude Thermo-acoustic Energy Conversion that helps to 
simulate in fine details the performance of the device. Three ceramic substrate blocs of different 
porosities have been considered as regenerators during the simulation. The results showed that the smaller 
porosity produced higher acoustic power. The higher performing bloc was subsequently used to develop 
and test a physical prototype. The constructed looped-tube thermo-acoustic engine produced a sound level 
of 121.4 decibel, just above the minimum auditory pain threshold.

1. Introduction
The escalation of the human lives on earth is contributing to the stress the planet is facing with respect to the 
management of its resources and the mitigation of environmental issues resulting from it. The potential damage of 
pollution has resulted in the prohibition of ozone depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and 
hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) by the Montreal Protocol. The latter is now forbidden in developed countries and 
is planned to be phased out by 2030 in developing countries (Montreal protocol, 1987). Anyanwu (2012) study 
provides details on the danger human health and ecosystems are exposed to from the pollution caused by 
chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) used as refrigerants in the refrigeration systems.  
The development of thermo-acoustic devices could potentially reduce air pollution. The devices consist of either a 
thermo-acoustic engine, also called prime mover (Power producer device); or a thermo-acoustic refrigerator (TAR), 
also called heat pump (Power consumer device). The former convert thermal energy from waste heat, such as solar 
and furnace heat, into acoustic energy by inducing a temperature difference across a porous material (regenerator). 
The latter utilises the generated acoustic energy to oscillate sound inside the small channels of a porous material and 
induce cooling. It pumps heat from the cold heat exchanger side to the ambient heat exchanger side, thus, converting 
acoustic energy into thermal energy. Configuration types of thermo-acoustic devices can be arranged into two major 
groups according to their external shapes: The standing-wave and the travelling-wave configurations. Existing

which is considered to be the time taken for the sound wave to start, was estimated to be 121 sec.  
5. Conclusion 
This work has analysed the performance of a looped tube thermo-acoustic engine with a main focus of providing 
clarity on the influence of the regenerator’s geometrical parameters on the performance of the device. A numerical

simulation has also been performed to predict the performance of the engine with the most effective regenerator to 
be used in the construction of a travelling-wave thermo-acoustic engine. Material and geometrical parameters of 
the regenerator have an impact on the travelling-wave engine's performance. Mylar regenerator has shown great 
performance over the stainless steel and the ceramic ones. But the latter has been chosen because of its ability to 
stand high temperatures. The 400 CPSI ceramic has been used in the built prototype as it has performed better than 
the 300 and the 230 CPSI. From the experimental test performed on a travelling-wave engine, constructed with 
scrap and cheap materials, a sound level of 121.4 dB, corresponding to a temperature difference of 577.6oC across 
the 400 CPSI regenerator considered in this experiments, was measured. Although the onset temperature reported 
in this study was relatively higher, the results reported have undoubtedly demonstrated the potential for travelling-
wave thermo-acoustic engine for sound generation.
