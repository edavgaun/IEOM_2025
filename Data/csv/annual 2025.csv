Locating Wastewater Treatment Plants in an Industrial Cluster

Abstract 
Pollution of freshwater sources is a major problem in many developing economies. Environmental norms mandate 
that Industrial wastewater must be treated before releasing it in the environment or recycling. Apart from large 
enterprises, many medium and small-scale enterprises use water for industrial purposes. However, many of these 
enterprises do not have enough financial resources to set up their own wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). 
Government policies encourage establishing a common set of WWTPs that can service all the enterprises in an 
industrial cluster and will be more economical to operate. We formulate the problem of locating WWTPs of 
appropriate sizes and allocating polluting firms to them as a Mixed Integer Non-linear Program (MINLP). The model 
minimizes the setup cost and the operating cost for the network of WWTPs. When water treatment is done through 
reverse osmosis, scientific literature and empirical evidence shows that there exist economies of scale with wastewater 
volume and diseconomies of scale with pollutant concentration. Hence, the operating cost function is non-convex. We 
provide an exact convexification strategy for this problem. Still, the commercial solvers are unable to solve practical 
size instances. Therefore, we propose a Generalized Benders decomposition-based algorithm with many refinements. 
We exploit the structure of the problem to solve the sub-problem very efficiently. Our proposed method can solve this 
MINLP much more efficiently than commercial solvers.

Abstract 
This paper traces the recent growth trends in the MSME sector of India, which indicate transformation of the sector 
in terms of scale and expansion. Given this, the factors inducing such a sectoral transformation are explored. Increased 
investment limits, improvement in the ease of doing business through Udyam Portal, Small Finance Banks, improved 
credit flow, VC funding, fintech financing, skill mapping and training, digital marketing including GeM, Open 
Network for Digital Commerce, and support from leading e-commerce companies are together favorable to MSME 
growth, scale expansion, and transformation. Thereafter, the two critical challenges faced by the sector are described 
and policy imperatives are suggested. Two key challenges have been emerging and gaining magnitude: (i) Fourth 
Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) characterized by the integration of man, machines, and production processes, and 
(ii) the imperativeness to achieve carbon emission reductions for sustainability, are two critical challenges which must
be dealt with gradually and steadily. Financial constraints, knowledge constraints, and technology information
constraints would prevent MSMEs from overcoming these challenges on their own. Policy intervention has a decisive
role to play. Towards this end, an Annual Survey of MSMEs is recommended. In addition, promotion of LSE-MSME
linkages, HEI-MSME linkages, LSE-ITI linkages, exclusive small business management programs, introduction of
climate finance, and differential treatment for unorganized enterprises are suggested as the remedial measures. This
can smoothen the process of Indian MSME growth and transformation with a higher degree of competitiveness in the
coming decades.

1. Introduction
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) occupy a place of strategic significance in Indian economy. As a 
sector, it comprised more than 63 million enterprises, and contributed about 45% of the manufacturing output, 30% 
of the GDP, and 49% of the total exports, and its employment of about 111 million workers was next only to agriculture 
in 2015/16 (Ministry of MSMEs, 2023). Therefore, the growth of the sector needs to be nurtured for the benefit of the 
economy from the triple angle of employment, income, and exports.  
MSME contributions have been emerging despite multiple challenges and constraints which have been persisting over 
a long period. The constraints over the functional front such as finance, market, production technology & operations, 
and human resources which are widely acknowledged across the global economy may be more intensely applicable 
to Indian MSMEs. Exclusive policies at the national and state levels have been increasingly pursued through exclusive 
institutions and programs for their alleviation since independence (Ministry of MSMEs, 2023; Bala Subrahmanya, 
1998).

would train and develop skilled human resources for manufacturing units and first-time entrepreneurs, in the light of 
Government of India’s focus on ‘Make in India’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (Business Today, 2021). The Toyota model 
of Karnataka deserves to be replicated elsewhere. 
 
(e) Introducing exclusive Management Programs for MSMEs 
Professional management would play a crucial role in the management and transformation of MSMEs. In general, 
management graduates emerging from B-Schools prefer to join the corporate sector, preferably MNEs. Only lower 
ranked B-School graduates, who do not make it to the corporate sector, may join MSMEs. However, the curricula 
taught in B-Schools in general are suited for corporate sector enterprises, whereas the management problems of 
MSMEs are unique and they cannot be solved readily within the framework of the former. Therefore, there is a need 
for introducing an exclusive ‘Small Business Management’ program in our B-Schools and Universities.  
 
(f) Introducing Climate Finance for MSMEs 
There is a need to introduce ‘climate finance’ to encourage MSMEs to adopt environmentally friendly and sustainable 
technologies for reducing carbon footprints. Comprehensive procedures are needed to avail ourselves of international 
climate funds for the benefit of MSMEs. Technology upgradation and modernization programs must focus on cleaner 
fuel, common combustion facilities and energy efficiency technologies which will achieve decarbonization 
(Upadhyay, 2022). The international source of climate funds can also be another means to bridge the credit gap in the 
sector. 
 
(g) Unorganized MSMEs call for a Differential Treatment 
The MSME sector is heterogenous, and this heterogeneity can be perceived at the broadest level between organized 
and unorganized sectors. Unorganized enterprises emerge mostly as a means of subsistence employment, and many 
of them thrive as a means of subsistence only. They primarily need finance, and they identify the market themselves. 
They are transitory in nature. This is largely true in the micro enterprises service sector. As the level of income steadily 
improves in the country, they are likely to undergo a gradual dilution. Through SFBs and fintech startups, a steady 
flow of credit to these enterprises must be ensured. For them the crucial issue is survival and not growth. Free entry 
and free exit are the distinguishing characteristics of these unorganized enterprises. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The current MSME sector growth signals scale expansion and transformation. Though constraints persist on multiple 
fronts, several emerging factors are favorable to MSME growth, scale expansion, and transformation. Increased 
investment limits, improvement in the ease of doing business through Udyam Portal, SFBs, improved credit flow, VC 
funding, fintech financing, skill mapping and training, digital marketing including GeM, ONDC, and support from 
leading e-commerce companies are together favorable to MSME growth, scale expansion, and transformation.  
 
However, two key challenges have been emerging and gaining magnitude. (i) Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 
4.0) characterized by the integration of man, machines, and production processes, and (ii) the imperativeness to 
achieve carbon emission reductions for sustainability, are two critical challenges which must be dealt with gradually 
and steadily. Financial constraints, knowledge constraints, and technology information constraints would prevent 
MSMEs from overcoming these challenges on their own. Policy intervention has a decisive role to play. Towards this 
end, an Annual Survey of MSMEs is recommended. In addition, promotion of LSE-MSME linkages, HEI-MSME 
linkages, LSE-ITI linkages, exclusive small business management programs, introduction of climate finance, and 
differential treatment for unorganized enterprises (for their survival) are suggested as the remedial measures. This can 
smoothen the process of MSME growth and transformation for greater vibrancy and competitiveness in the coming 
decades.

Abstract 
The complexity of sustainable supply chain impedes identification of its impact on business sustainability inducement. 
Hence, based on the research question of how sustainable supply chain affect sustainability development 
Mexican context, this paper studies this problem by taking a case of supply chain of 35 companies that form 
S&P/BMV Total México ESG index. The selection of these companies is based on their efforts of integrating 
sustainability practices into their operations and the statement that sustainable firms induce their suppliers to be green 
by using environmental criteria in supplier selection process. To achieve its objective, the method of network approach 
analysis of supply-demand relationship is used. The findings are that the is no significant interconnection between 35 
companies that form S&P/BMV Total México ESG index which means that their good sustainability practices do not 
depend on the supply chain relationship per see but to resource use system. Hence, the sustainability supply chain-
based policy is not appropriate to induce sustainability in Mexico.

4. Conclusion 
To conclude, we can ignore the high importance sustainable supply chain system has to induce sustainability 
development in terms of sustainable clients push their suppliers to be sustainable. However, taking S&P/BMV Total 
México ESG index, this relationship is not identified since 35 companies that compose this index, belong to different 
sector of activities and their relation is much niched by resource use system with short connectedness with at least one 
connection in average. Hence, in general the sustainability supply chain-based policy is not appropriate to induce 
sustainability in Mexico, however, Walmart and Chedraui S.A de CV can be good points to star with.

Extending the Horizons of FMEA: An MCDM Approach 
Prof. Omkarprasad S Vaidya 
Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow

osv@iiml.ac.in 
Abstract 
Failure Mode Effect Analysis is popularly called as FMEA. FMEA is a pro-active tool to access potential failure 
modes and also evaluate the possible effects arising due to these failures. Typically, a Risk Priority Number 
(RPN), is evaluated for the identified failure modes. Traditionally, this RPN is computed as the product of three 
values namely, Severity, Occurrence, and Detectability. The range of this RPN value is from 1 up to 729. The 
RPN value helps the decision maker, prioritize the potential failure modes and take appropriate action/s to mitigate 
the risks. As RPN considers only severity, occurrence and detectability, there are chances that some significant 
criteria might be missed out or is not considered for evaluation. In this work we consider more than 21 criteria, 
which can help evaluate/quantify the potential failure modes. While, we do not claim that these criteria form an 
exhaustive list for the evaluation of failure modes, but will help provide a near holistic view of the problem at 
hand. With more than 21 criteria for performance evaluation, the RPN value will range from 1 up to 1.09419 x 
1020.  This is a very large number and will create computational complexities and hence very difficult to develop 
priorities of the failure modes. This will further have a cascading effect on developing potential strategies for 
mitigation of risks. Here, we propose an approach to evaluate the modified RPN, by using MCDM technique/s. 
This approach will provide a realistic range of modified RPN, and hence help in proper evaluation of the potential 
failure modes. Thus, this approach helps the decision maker to develop realistic strategies for mitigating risks. In 
this work, we not only enlist the different criteria for modified RPN evaluation, showcase the developed approach, 
but also illustrate the procedure with a hypothetical and real-life example. It can also be seen that, with minor 
modifications in the proposed procedure, this system FMEA approach can be applied to process FMEA as well. 
We hope that this work will help the decision makers make better and near holistic evaluation decisions.

A Mixed-Integer Programming Model for Supply Chain 
Resilience: Identifying Vulnerable Sectors and 
Interdependencies in Saudi Arabia

Abstract 
The supply chain network is a complex, interconnected system. Any disruption in the flow of products or information 
within this network will have ripple effects, impacting other industries and partners in the supply chain. A disruption 
to one component of the network can lead to the isolation of certain industries. To analyze these impacts, a mixed-
integer programming (MIP) model is proposed. This model aims to measure the effects of disruptions on the flow of 
transactions between industries in Saudi Arabia, and how such disruptions affect the economic interdependencies 
across sectors. The study focuses on the 10 sectors most representative of the Saudi Arabian supply chain network. 
To evaluate the model's effectiveness, two different disruption scenarios were implemented. First, hundreds of random 
disruptions were generated, with one sector fully disrupted at a time. This allowed identification of the most vulnerable 
sector - sector 10. Then, targeted disruptions were applied to specific sectors, and the results showed varying levels 
of impact on other affected sectors, demonstrating the complex, interdependent nature of the supply chain. This study 
highlights the significant impact that disruptions in one economic sector of the Saudi Arabian supply chain can have 
on other interconnected sectors, due to the high degree of interdependency within the network.

1. Introduction
Supply chain decision-makers must navigate a complex landscape of disruptions and uncertainties within the supply 
chain network (SCN) itself. This includes dealing with surprising events such as natural hazards and human-created 
attacks, which can disrupt the various infrastructure networks (e.g., transportation) that the SCN relies on. The supply 
chain's heavy dependence on road transportation systems to deliver products to consumers, supply vendors, or provide 
raw materials to manufacturers makes SCNs highly susceptible to disruption. The road transportation network is 
considered the primary mode of freight transportation in the United States. According to the Federal Highway 
Administration, the U.S. daily average flow of freight exceeded 50 million tons (valued at $48 billion) in 2012, with 
70% of this freight distributed by trucks (Strocko et al., 2014). To mitigate the impact of disruptive events, the U.S. 
government has emphasized the need to enhance the preparedness of critical infrastructure, including the 
transportation network (Yusta, Correa, and Lacal-Arántegui, 2011). This underscores the importance of understanding 
and addressing the vulnerabilities within supply chain networks. 
Transportation networks and supply chain networks (SCNs) are highly interdependent, with their relationship 
extending beyond just physical connections. This interdependence can also be economic in nature, meaning that a 
disruption in one network can influence the operational and economic performance of other networks. A prime 
example of such harmful impact is the 2011 Tokyo earthquake and tsunami. The disruption to the infrastructure was 
estimated to be equivalent to 3-5% of Japan's GDP. The impact reverberated through the supply chains of various

Chemical Products, amplifying its sensitivity to sectoral disruptions. Similarly, the Food Products Sector exhibits high 
dependence on Agriculture, with a 95% performance decline under full disruption. These insights highlight the 
importance of prioritizing resilience strategies for highly interconnected sectors. By mitigating risks in these pivotal 
nodes, the overall stability and efficiency of the supply chain network can be significantly improved. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Disruption to any of the elements within the supply chain network, such as the nodes or transportation links, will 
influence the performance of many components of the supply chain network. This impact will not necessarily manifest 
as physical discontinuity, but rather as indirect constraints caused by the economic interdependencies that exist across 
the interconnected networks. 
 
In this study, the findings from the targeted and random disruption scenarios provide valuable insights into the 
vulnerabilities and interdependencies within the supply chain network of Saudi Arabia. The targeted disruption results 
demonstrate the strong connections between the Transportation Sector and the Agriculture and Chemical Products 
Sectors, highlighting the significant cascading impacts that can occur when these critical sectors are disrupted. 
Additionally, the analysis reveals the high dependency of the Food Products Sector on the Agriculture Sector, 
underscoring the need to address vulnerabilities in this area. The random disruption scenario further confirms the 
Transportation Sector as the most vulnerable economic sector, with its average performance dropping below 15% due 
to the disruptive impacts. These insights can inform the development of targeted strategies and policies to enhance the 
overall resilience and robustness of the supply chain network, ultimately improving the economic stability and 
sustainability of the region. By addressing the identified vulnerabilities and strengthening the interdependencies 
between sectors, supply chain managers and policymakers can better prepare the system to withstand and recover 
from potential disruptions, ensuring the continuous flow of goods and services within the Saudi Arabian economy. 
 
For future work, each sector should examine strategic approaches to expand and diversify their supplier base. This 
will help reduce the effects of interdependency and mitigate the risk of shortages in required elements during 
disruption events in any related sector. Additionally, due to the limitation in finding data for tangible products or 
commodities, the current model does not consider disruptions in the transportation system. Obtaining such data would 
improve the efficiency of the model, and the outcomes would be more beneficial for supply chain decision-makers.

Abstract 
Present-day application of metaheuristic algorithms for job scheduling is highly centralized. However, the onset of 
Industry 4.0 is rapidly changing the manufacturing paradigm from ‘centralized’ to ‘de-centralized’ production through 
technologies such as Cyber-Physical Systems and Industrial IoT. This mandates a new generation of distributed 
methodologies to perform operations planning. Thus, a novel decentralized algorithm, known as an agent-based job 
scheduling algorithm (ABJS), is proposed in this work to perform the scheduling of jobs in a manufacturing flow shop 
environment. The problem of flow shop scheduling is solved by minimizing makespan under wide-ranging scenarios 
using machine agents and a scheduling agent. The ABJS algorithm's superior performance for many jobs signifies its 
usefulness in real industrial applications.

6. Conclusion  
This research proposes a decentralized algorithm for job scheduling in a manufacturing flow shop environment, 
treating the shop floor as a network of intelligent assets capable of autonomous decision-making. The problem of flow 
shop scheduling is addressed to minimize makespan. It is tested under various scenarios by varying three parameters: 
the number of jobs, the number of machines, and the variability in processing time for each job on each machine. 
 
Through simulations and evaluations, the algorithm has demonstrated comparable performance with established 
centralized algorithms, such as tabu search and hybrid genetic algorithm, for small problem sizes. Notably, its superior 
performance for a large number of jobs makes it a promising solution for real industrial scenarios. 
 
However, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations, such as for smaller problem size makespan obtained by 
ABJS are comparable to convention methods but the computational time may be more, due to agent to agent 
communication. Also, if any of the agents becomes inactive or fails to respond then the algorithm will not work. 
Several directions for further exploration are presented, including upgrading the optimization problem to be multi-
objective by incorporating factors such as optimizing job holding time. Additionally, there is potential for expanding 
the scope of the algorithm by including more industrial agents, such as job agents, maintenance agents, inventory 
agents, etc., for more comprehensive agent-based distributed decision-making. Further improvements in the original 
algorithms are possible by exploring criteria to decide hyperparameters, for instance, determining the number of jobs 
shortlisted for each position as a function of the total idle time.

Abstract 
Wall construction tasks involve awkward and repetitive body movements that can lead to musculoskeletal disorders 
(MSDs) and injuries. Working at different heights can affect the risk of MSDs. However, the effect of different 
working heights on body postures like bending and twisting has not been fully explored. The objective of this study 
was to investigate the effects of working heights on bending and twisting postures during wall construction tasks. 
Twelve male participants (age: 21.83±1.27 years) performed simulated bricklaying tasks with four different working 
heights (0 cm, 47 cm, 107 cm, and 142 cm) in a laboratory environment. Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors 
were used to collect data on participants’ actual body movements. Inverse dynamics simulation was conducted to 
estimate posture angles. Statistical tests (ANOVA) were conducted to determine the significance of differences in 
postural angles across the working heights. Research findings indicated that (i) the bricklaying (task-B) task 
significantly increased trunk bending angles compared to the mortar spreading (task-A) task (p = 0.001), while twisting 
angles were insignificant across the task types (p = 0.05); (ii) increasing working heights significantly reduced both 
bending (p < 0.001), and twisting angles (p = 0.001) during the task-A; (iii) moreover, working heights significantly 
influenced bending angles (p = 0.001), while twisting angles were not affected (p = 0.471) during task-B. In summary, 
increasing working heights significantly affects both bending and twisting postures during wall constructions. These 
findings highlight the importance of working heights in wall construction tasks to prevent MSDs risks and injuries.

5. Conclusion  
This study explored how different working heights affect bending and twisting postures during wall construction tasks. 
From the study results the following conclusions were drawn: 
 
 The bending posture is statistically significant difference between mortar spreading and bricklaying, while 
twisting body posture is insignificant with these task types.  
 The body postures (bending and twisting angles) were significantly different with four examined working 
heights during mortar spreading task. The outcomes revealed that higher working heights significantly 
reduced both bending and twisting angles of this task.  
 Bending posture was significantly different with four working heights in bricklaying task. In contrast, 
twisting posture was insignificant with different working heights during this task.  
 Bending angles were reduced due to increased working heights for both mortar spreading and bricklaying 
tasks, while twisting angles were not reduced significantly with higher heights during bricklaying task. 
 
This research found the significant impact of varying working heights on the bending and twisting postures during 
wall construction tasks. Consideration of working height in designing workstations, tools and equipment are 
recommended to minimize the risk of musculoskeletal problems in construction workers.

Abstract 
Erratic electricity through scheduled power outages, also known as load shedding, has had different impacts on the 
livelihoods and businesses in South Africa. This has forced organisations with vital businesses and critical electricity 
infrastructure to opt for alternative and reliable power supplies. Using a suitable case study, we developed an adapted 
transportation model that could be used to allocate and distribute electricity at a minimal cost. Firstly, a current state 
analysis was performed to allow the feasibility of allocating electricity to specific load or demand points. After the 
model development, the feasibility and benefits of implementing alternative power sources, such as solar, were 
assessed. The adapted transportation model was solved using commercial solvers to obtain a total cost of R408.66 for 
allocating electricity to all the required loads for one hour of load shedding. Compared to the current state of only 
generator usage, this was a 34% decrease in company expenditure for one hour of load shedding. What-if and 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate the feasibility of the solar power installation and the effect of 
changes in input parameters on the total cost of electricity allocation. Recommendations to increase the impact of the 
findings on similar industries being affected by the just energy transition are discussed.

1. Introduction
South Africa is experiencing an erratic energy supply. The main producer and distributor of electricity, Eskom, has 
implemented varying stages of load shedding – stages ranging from Stage 1 to Stage 8 varying in frequency of two-
hourly power cuts. The erratic electricity supply is caused by Eskom's inability to satisfy the required demand. Further 
factors like poor infrastructure, lack of planning, and an exponentially increasing population resulting in increased 
demand are putting pressure on Eskom’s electricity system. This has demonstrated a need in electricity systems for 
demand to be adequately satisfied by supply, both on a national and individual level.  
Company X is a medium-sized company in the telecommunications, radio frequency, and data networking industry. 
This company is directly impacted by an erratic supply of electricity from Eskom (Reuss, 2023), resulting in the use 
of a generator and an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) system to supply the premises in its entirety during periods 
of load shedding. The generator and the UPS system largely eliminate the negative effect of the inability to operate 
during periods of load shedding. The company has had significant cash flow constraints (Reuss, 2023). The capital 
investment of the diesel generator was a successful business decision in 2007, however, the operating and maintenance 
costs thereof are affecting the company’s profitability and business confidence (Reuss, 2023). The increased 
occurrence of load shedding has prompted increased use of the company generator, requiring frequent refuelling, and

Abstract 
The emerging technologies referred to as ""Industry 4.0"" offer substantial competitive advantages in performance 
measures such as cost, quality, and time by enabling strategic and operational decision-making in manufacturing. The 
goal is to seamlessly connect physical and digital systems in real-time. However, Industry 4.0 research often focuses 
on literature reviews and conceptual frameworks, lacking the comprehensive, practical insights gained from actual 
implementation. This gap highlights the need for a practical framework for implementing Industry 4.0, similar to those 
found in lean literature. This study proposes a digital value stream mapping case study to implement emerging 
technologies by mapping and investigating the journey of a manufacturing company undergoing Industry 4.0 
transformation. The selected company has been digitally mapped for the implementation process and benefits obtained 
from emerging technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, cloud computing, augmented and virtual 
reality, AI/ML, collaborative robots and additive manufacturing (AM). The study emphasizes the importance of digital 
value stream mapping, providing real-life insights for practitioners and manufacturing companies embarking on the 
Industry 4.0 journey.

Abstract 
Most retail stores have implemented self-checkout systems to enhance checkout services and ultimately improve 
customer satisfaction. Long lines at checkout counters can influence a customer's decision to shop at a particular 
retailer (Chain Store Age, 2008). While Juntti (2014) argued that self-checkout systems are costly and do not 
necessarily reduce transaction times or the number of customers in line, Morimura and Nishioka (2016) suggested that 
they are effective in reducing perceived waiting times. However, it has not yet been quantitatively verified whether 
self-checkouts actually decrease customer waiting times. This study addresses two key research questions: 1) Do self-
checkouts truly reduce customer waiting time? and 2) How can we determine the optimal ratio of self-checkout 
counters to regular cashier lanes? To investigate these questions, we developed a simulation model using Arena 
simulation software to analyze waiting-related performance metrics such as customer waiting time and the number of 
customers in line at both self-checkout and regular cashier lanes. An extensive simulation study is conducted, taking 
into account factors such as arrival rates and the number of cashiers and self-checkout lanes, using data collected from 
a grocery store.

Abstract 
This study intends to evaluate the inventory strategy analysis of manufacturing firms, particularly applied steel product 
manufacturing companies engaged in manufacturing for the zinc or steel industry utilizing CRC (Cold Rolled Coil) in 
two countries in the ASEAN region: Thailand and Indonesia. The sample companies in this study are companies 
producing applied steel products sized 020 x 914 x C (H) and 020 x 762 x C (H) in greater Jakarta (Jakarta, Bekasi 
and Tangerang) industrial area in Indonesia and Bangkok, Thailand. The expected outcome of this study is that the 
determination of raw material control policies under the EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) approach is more optimal 
and efficient than the determination of raw material control using conventional methods. This study is using order 
quantity that includes the digital price setting to analyze the raw materials purchasing. It figures out how many orders 
are cost-effective for each order with a set frequency and when to reorder to minimize total inventory cost. Thus, 
inventory efficiency runs well and an optimal number of ordering units can be achieved by keeping costs to a 
minimum. The results elucidate that, at a certain point, although the cost of salary is more expensive in Thailand,

Further research is still needed to obtain more comprehensive information, due to the limitations of the research, as it 
is only comparing two countries. Besides that, the measurement of order and handling costs is only considering 
electricity expenses, which are presumed to be the average cost per 1000KwH, and also the operation of moving 
materials. It does not include fixed costs such as equipment purchases including depreciation of either the apparatus. 
Additionally, the internet costs used are estimated at 60 MBps with fixed broadband specifications only, without 
taking into account the costs with mobile specifications. This study also did not include the cost of increasing the 
number of warehousing staff and levelling the job specifications. Notwithstanding the relatively limited sample, this 
work offers valuable insights into the application of order quantity in managing inventory costs in Southeast Asia 
countries. 
6. Conclusion
Based on the results of research on the application of EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) in inventory management in 
manufacturing companies in the Jakarta, Indonesia and Bangkok, Thailand areas and its effects, it can be concluded 
as follows: 
1.
According to research conducted on the reordering of CRC raw material inventories required by zinc and steel
manufacturers in the Jakarta, Indonesia and Bangkok, Thailand regions, there is no significant difference in
quantity. Particularly in Indonesia, certain types are considerably varied.
2.
Poor inventory management causes frequent shortages and surpluses of critical raw materials (CRM) for
Indonesia's zinc and metal manufacturers. In the case of a significant decline, safety stock can serve as a valuable
safety net.
3.
Inventory management of firms in Thailand is likely more efficient because internet costs are cheaper even though
it has a higher speed than in Indonesia and affects order costs. Meanwhile, in Indonesia, manpower costs are less
and affect storage costs. However, the storage cost component is greater in hoist and electricity costs than labor.
If assumed to use digital warehousing equipment.
4.
Based on the research conducted at a zinc and steel manufacturing company in Indonesia, it can be inferred that
EOQ method is away more plausible than the conventional approach currently used. The EOQ method can
effectively estimate future purchasing and reduce the risk of running out of CRC in both countries, Thailand and
Indonesia.

Abstract 
This research addresses inefficiencies in Peruvian textile SMEs, focusing on improving sewing operations. Existing 
studies highlight the effectiveness of Lean Manufacturing and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) in enhancing 
productivity, but few examine their application in textile SMEs. The case study implemented SMED to reduce setup 
times and autonomous maintenance to minimize machine downtime, combined with linear programming to optimize 
production scheduling. The study yielded significant results: sewing efficiency improved by 26.80%, setup times 
decreased by 30.97%, and machine downtime reduced by 33.83%. These outcomes validate the integration of Lean 
and TPM as an effective solution for enhancing operational performance in textile SMEs. Academically, this research 
contributes to the growing body of knowledge on Lean and TPM in small enterprises, while socio-economically, it 
promotes competitiveness and sustainable growth in the Peruvian textile sector. This study encourages further research 
on adapting Lean and TPM tools to various industries, emphasizing the need for continuous improvement in 
operational efficiency.

1. Introduction
The textile industry, and in particular the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating within this sector, 
play a crucial role in the global economy. In the global context, textile SMEs are responsible for a significant share of 
production and employment, contributing to the economic and social sustainability of various communities. According 
to a study, these companies represent approximately 90% of all textile enterprises and generate more than 60% of the 
jobs in this sector (Ruiz et al., 2019). In Latin America, the textile sector is equally vital as it not only provides 
employment for millions of people but also is a driver of economic development in developing countries. In Peru, for

and TPM to improve production scheduling and order compliance, offering a comprehensive approach to solving 
production challenges. 
 
The final observations suggest that the integration of Lean Manufacturing and TPM is highly effective in enhancing 
production efficiency in textile SMEs. However, for these methodologies to be sustainable, it is necessary to ensure 
continuous training and engagement of operators in maintenance tasks, as well as regular monitoring of key 
performance indicators. Future studies should explore the long-term impact of these interventions and investigate their 
applicability in other sectors facing similar operational challenges. It is also recommended to explore the use of more 
advanced technologies, such as predictive maintenance tools and automation, to further reduce machine downtime 
and increase productivity. Moreover, further research could examine how these process improvement tools can be 
integrated with broader supply chain management practices to enhance the overall competitiveness of textile SMEs in 
the global market.

Abstract 
Most Operational Excellence corporate initiatives fail to yield the desired results: many organisations are struggling 
to turn their Operational Excellence efforts into a success, citing lack of leadership, changing business focus, internal 
resistance, and availability of resources as the main impeding factors. While a lot of focus is usually put on the 
technical side, the Leadership, organisational and cultural impacts are often an afterthought, causing failure down the 
line. The Design-Measure-Analyse-Improve-Control (DMAIC) framework is the problem solving approach that has 
been at the core of the Six Sigma methodology since its inception, while Scrum is among the most known and adopted 
Agile methods, characterised by teams given significant authority and responsibility for many aspects of their work. 
Although it may seem that DMAIC and Scrum tend to pull organisations in different directions, with Scrum favouring 
flexibility and adaptability and DMAIC favouring process standardisation instead, this conceptual paper shows the 
two methodologies and can work well together, proposes a practical framework for their integration, and defines the 
Leadership’s traits needed for their successful integration.

Agile, DMAIC, Leadership, Lean Six Sigma, Scrum 
1. Introduction
Agile methodologies came to prominence in the software development industries from the early 2000s, and are now 
widespread in many different industries, where they are being used in place of more traditional project management 
techniques: among the different Agile methodologies, Scrum is one of the most known and adopted (Dikert et al., 
2016). 
In parallel, the term Lean Six Sigma started to be used in 2000 to describe the integration of Lean and Six Sigma 
philosophies (Sheridan, 2000) into a business improvement methodology that aims to maximise shareholders’ value 
by improving quality, speed, customer satisfaction and costs. DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, Control) 
is a specific Lean Six Sigma framework for improving existing processes falling below specification (Jadhav et al., 
2015). 
The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how Scrum and DMAIC methods can be integrated to be benefit of 
organisations: while there have been a number of attempts to integrate Lean Six Sigma and Agile in an overall 
production and quality philosophy (Kovach et al., 2005), this paper aims to introduce a practical framework for 
practitioners to combine the empirical approach typical of Scrum with the rigorous and prescriptive techniques of 
DMAIC. 
1.1 Objectives

5. Conclusion 
The purpose of this paper is to illustrate how Scrum and DMAIC methods can be integrated to benefit organisations: 
after illustrating their commonalities and differences, a practical framework intended for their integration has been 
presented, followed by the Leadership’s traits for a successful integration. 
 
This paper advances the literature on Operational Excellence in two practical ways: first, articulating the practical 
knowledge, artefacts, and tools where Scrum and DMAIC can came together, at each stage of a project, to facilitate 
the delivery of high-quality and customised products/services in the fastest time and at the lowest cost. A second 
practical contribution, in comparing the Leadership characteristics for Scrum and DMAIC, suggests there is an 
overlap, with two additional Leadership traits needed for Scrum deployments: the ability to empower self-organised 
teams and an iterative mind-set.  
 
As this was a conceptual paper, it needs to be empirically validated with research in the field, in order to build a 
systematic understanding of Scrum and DMAIC integration: a mixed method approach, combining qualitative and 
quantitative methods, is suggested, together with a case study of real application of DMAIC knowledge and tools into 
a Scrum project. 
 
Integrating Scrum and DMAIC may be a challenge for organisations that tend to compartmentalise knowledge, and 
professionals that have specialised in either one, requiring enlightened Leadership to balance among the speed of 
Scrum and the rigour of DMAIC, but the rewards will be the capability to adapt and adhere to constantly changing 
customer demands.

Abstract 
This study evaluates the sustainability efficiency of alternative fuel buses within the public transportation system using 
an integrated model combining Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) with Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). This study evaluates six buses that run on diesel, electric, and 
Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and are produced and recycled in different nations to comprehend the societal, 
economic, and environmental effects. with the aim of understanding their environmental, economic, and social impacts. 
Thirteen sustainability indicators were assessed, including Global Warming Potential (GWP), Particulate Matter 
Formation (PMF), Water Consumption, and Total tax. PCA was used to reduce the complexity of these indicators, 
and DEA was employed to assess the relative efficiency of each bus type by using the environmental impacts as inputs 
and the socioeconomic impacts as model outputs. The resulting sustainability scores were clustered into three 
categories: poor (3), fair (2), and excellent (1), reflecting the overall sustainability performance of each bus type. The 
clustering analysis revealed that CNG buses from Turkey recycled in China and India clustered as excellent and fair 
categories, with sustainability scores of 1 and 0.8798, respectively. Due to their balanced environmental and economic 
profiles, while electric and diesel buses were clustered as poor, primarily due to high life cycle costs and greater

6. Conclusion  
The study results show notable differences in the sustainability performance of alternative fuel buses according to the 
type of fuel, country of manufacture, and recycling location. The LCSA framework was enhanced with the 
combination of PCA and DEA to provide a comprehensive approach for evaluating the complex sustainability profiles 
of different bus types. Using thirteen sustainability parameters such as GWP, PMF, LCC, water consumption, human 
health impacts, employment, and compensation, the research evaluated three main fuel alternatives: CNG, diesel, and 
electric buses. In terms of life cycle impacts, the results show that CNG buses, especially those made in Turkey and 
recycled in China or India, consistently performed better than other bus types. Among all the analyzed buses, these had 
the lowest LCC and the fewest adverse effects on the environment in most categories. The great success of CNG buses 
is due to their lower pollution and lower operating costs, both of which make them much more environmentally 
friendly. The clustering investigation verified that CNG buses offered a good mix of environmental benefits and 
financial efficiency, as indicated by their high sustainability scores.  
 
Despite their low direct emissions, electric buses could have performed better in the sustainability assessment due to 
high life cycle costs and more significant resource consumption, particularly regarding water use and land footprint. 
This was consistent across manufacturing and recycling countries, highlighting that electric buses' current operational 
and production framework is not optimized for sustainable performance in Qatar. Their poor sustainability score is 
due to the energy mix situation in the operational country since natural gas is Qatar's primary electricity production 
source. Diesel buses, in contrast, were repeatedly identified as the most environmentally harmful alternative. They 
were the most inefficient and damaging to the environment, with the highest GWP, PMF, and water-related impacts, 
as well as significantly higher life cycle costs. The potential socioeconomic benefits of CNG buses outweigh the 
severe environmental impacts, even if diesel buses significantly influence employment and tax revenue. The study 
concludes that diesel buses should be replaced with more environmentally friendly ones. 
 
In summary, the results highlight that CNG buses are the most environmentally friendly and economically viable 
option for Qatar's public transportation system. While electric buses do less damage to the environment than traditional 
buses, they still need some work in production and operational efficiency by adopting renewable resources in 
electricity production. This research will be invaluable to policymakers as Qatar moves toward a more 
environmentally friendly public transportation system. Using a life cycle perspective provides a solid basis for 
comparing the sustainability of different transportation alternatives.

Abstract 
The Peruvian small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) furniture manufacturing sector faces critical challenges in 
operational efficiency, driven by disorganized workspaces, machine downtime, and inefficient material flow. Previous 
research has focused on larger industries, leaving a gap in the literature regarding the integration of Lean 
Manufacturing tools and the Theory of Constraints (TOC) for improving efficiency in SME furniture production. 
Addressing this gap is essential for offering practical solutions to resource-constrained firms. The pressing challenges 
include eliminating production bottlenecks, reducing waste, and improving machine reliability. This study contributed 
by developing an innovative production model that integrates TOC and Lean tools such as 5S, Kanban, and preventive 
maintenance. The model significantly improved production efficiency by 10%, reduced machine downtime by 15%, 
and optimized workflow. The practical implications of these findings extend beyond individual firms, offering a 
sustainable framework for SMEs to enhance productivity and competitiveness. This research advocates exploring 
Lean and TOC integration across other SME sectors, offering a proven approach to boost efficiency and 
competitiveness in similar operational contexts.

1. Introduction
The small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) furniture manufacturing industry plays a crucial role in the global 
economy, especially in Latin America and Peru. This sector not only contributes significantly to employment but is 
also a driver of innovation and sustainable development. According to a study, SMEs account for more than 90% of 
enterprises in Latin America and generate approximately 60% of employment in the region (Singh et al., 2016). In 
Peru, SMEs are responsible for about 70% of formal employment and 40% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
129",,"Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Constraints (TOC). The study identified bottlenecks in the production process and implemented a structured model 
that combined 5S, Kanban, preventive maintenance, and TOC principles. Key findings demonstrated a 10% increase 
in production efficiency, a 15% reduction in machine downtime, and a 91% decrease in material waiting time. These 
results confirmed the model's effectiveness in optimizing production flows and minimizing waste. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its practical application for SMEs, a sector often overlooked in favor of larger 
industries. By focusing on small-scale furniture manufacturers, this study addressed critical inefficiencies that directly 
affect profitability and competitiveness. The implementation of a combined Lean and TOC approach offers SMEs a 
pathway to overcome resource constraints, improve production processes, and strengthen their market position, 
especially in an increasingly competitive global market. 
 
The study contributes significantly to the field by filling a gap in the existing literature, where most research on 
operational efficiency improvements focuses on larger corporations. This research demonstrated that SMEs can 
benefit from Lean and TOC methodologies, traditionally applied in large-scale industries, by adapting these tools to 
their specific needs. The model presented in this study serves as a scalable and practical framework for other SMEs 
facing similar production challenges, providing actionable insights for process optimization. 
 
Final observations suggest that while the Lean-TOC production model showed promising results, further research is 
necessary to explore its adaptability in other sectors and regions. Future studies could examine the long-term 
sustainability of these improvements and explore additional Lean tools to address new bottlenecks that may emerge. 
Additionally, expanding this model to incorporate digital technologies such as Industry 4.0 solutions could further 
enhance efficiency and resource management for SMEs.

Abstract 
The global poultry processing industry faces significant challenges related to equipment availability, particularly due 
to insufficient maintenance practices. This study aimed to address these issues by integrating Lean Manufacturing and 
Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) methodologies in a poultry processing plant. The main problem identified was 
frequent machine breakdowns, especially with the Lincoln plucking machine, which caused over 30% of total 
downtime. To tackle this, the investigation applied a combination of autonomous and preventive maintenance, along 
with the implementation of a Poka Yoke device for optimizing rubber finger placement. The study resulted in a 6.81% 
increase in equipment availability and improved overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) by reducing downtime and 
operational errors. These improvements had significant socio-economic impacts, decreasing costs and increasing 
production stability. This research highlights the effectiveness of Lean-TPM integration in enhancing operational 
performance and calls for further exploration into automating other critical processes to achieve even greater 
efficiency.

1. Introduction
The significance of poultry processing plants in the global food supply chain is profound, particularly in regions such 
as Latin America and Peru. Poultry processing plays a crucial role in meeting the increasing demand for protein-rich 
food sources, contributing to food security and economic development. According to the Food and Agriculture 
Organization (FAO) (2020), poultry production has become one of the fastest-growing segments of the agricultural 
sector, with global production reaching over 130 million tons annually. In Latin America, countries like Brazil and 
Mexico are among the largest producers, with Peru also emerging as a significant player in the poultry industry 
(USDA, 2021). The poultry sector not only provides employment opportunities but also supports the livelihoods of 
millions of people involved in various stages of production, processing, and distribution (Baskin-Graves et al., 2019). 
In Peru, the poultry industry has seen substantial growth, with production increasing by approximately 5% annually, 
reflecting the rising consumer demand for chicken meat (Ministerio de Agricultura y Riego, 2022). This growth

6. Conclusions. 
The study identified the primary causes of downtime in the poultry processing plant, with the Lincoln plucking 
machine being the most affected, accounting for 34.93% of total downtime in 2023. This downtime was primarily 
caused by frequent replacement of rubber fingers and feather accumulation, which together contributed to over 80% 
of machine stoppages. The proposed solution involved applying Lean and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) tools, 
including Poka Yoke, autonomous maintenance, and preventive maintenance practices. These tools successfully 
addressed the root causes of the downtime, leading to measurable improvements in equipment availability and overall 
plant efficiency. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its contribution to addressing key operational challenges in the poultry 
processing industry. By enhancing machine availability, the plant's productivity increased significantly, reducing 
unplanned stoppages and ensuring smoother operations. The introduction of structured maintenance practices not only 
reduced machine failures but also fostered a culture of continuous improvement within the plant, positively impacting 
operational efficiency. 
 
This research contributed to the field of industrial engineering by integrating Lean Manufacturing and TPM principles 
in a poultry processing context, offering a novel approach to increasing machine availability. The use of Poka Yoke 
to reduce human errors in equipment handling and maintenance, combined with the autonomous maintenance 
practices that empowered operators to perform basic machine upkeep, provided a comprehensive strategy for 
improving operational performance. 
 
In conclusion, the study demonstrated that the Lean-TPM model was effective in reducing machine downtime and 
increasing equipment availability. However, further research could explore the integration of automation technologies 
in other areas of the poultry processing plant, such as the feather removal process, to further optimize operations. 
Additionally, refining the preventive maintenance schedule to address other recurring issues could lead to even greater 
improvements in plant efficiency. Continuous monitoring and adaptation of these strategies will be crucial for 
sustaining these improvements over time, ensuring long-term operational success.

Abstract 
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has consistently invested in providing pilgrims with various services to ensure an 
efficient, safe, comfortable, and spiritually enriching experience. One of the essential services that are given to 
pilgrimage is transportation. For arranging and organizing the transportation of pilgrims, the government of the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia established the General Car Syndicate (Naqaba). Naqaba has incorporated GPS technology 
into the buses dedicated to transporting pilgrims. By utilizing GPS, Naqaba aims to enhance the safety measures and 
provide precise tracking of the buses, thereby ensuring the well-being of the passengers during their journeys. The 
study develops integration between the Internet of Things (IoT) and Blockchain to enhance the efficiency of pilgrim 
transportation services Naqaba provides during the Hajj season. By utilizing IoT and blockchain technologies, this 
study aims to design a comprehensive system to be implemented by Naqaba to monitor and track the buses designated 
for pilgrims during the Hajj season. This study also seeks to maximize the benefit of the Naqaba monitoring system 
and provide an opportunity for all relevant parties in the system to leverage the extensive information it offers. The 
proposed system includes unlimited information that can be utilized to enhance the level of transportation services 
provided to pilgrims. By analyzing and building upon this information, it is possible to improve the service level. The 
system can provide numerous alerts to Hajj transport companies Naqaba and other relevant entities using the system 
to ensure the safety of the pilgrims and enhance the services provided to them .

Abstract 
The global semiconductor chip shortage has exposed critical vulnerabilities in supply chains, significantly impacting 
various industries. This study proposes a comprehensive framework to enhance the resilience of semiconductor supply 
chains by identifying key factors and their interactions. Leveraging Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), the 
framework integrates fourteen hypotheses to analyze nine different factors affecting the semiconductor supply chain 
resilience.  Artificial Intelligence (AI), supply chain integration, agility, and localization are among the factors 
analyzed in this study. The model is developed based on insights from literature within the engineering and decision 
sciences subject areas and is preliminarily tested using secondary data generated based on the literature. Initial results, 
based on this secondary data, underscore the importance of AI and digital technologies in fostering transparent, agile 
supply chains, enabling firms to respond swiftly to disruptions. Additionally, manufacturing flexibility and supply 
chain integration emerged as critical enablers of resilience, ensuring long-term competitiveness in the semiconductor 
industry. Future research will validate these findings by applying primary survey data on the framework developed in 
this study to further contribute to the understanding of supply chain resilience in high-tech industries.

1. Introduction
The global semiconductor chip shortage has emerged as a critical challenge, necessitating a comprehensive 
understanding of its complexities. Building upon the foundational research presented in ""The Global Semiconductor 
Chip Shortage: Causes, Implications, and Potential Remedies"" by Mohammad et al. (2022), this study aims to deepen 
our understanding of the crisis. Our primary objective is to transition initial findings into a scholarly paper, leveraging 
an updated literature review and employing statistical analysis to identify effective strategies and remedies. 
Recent advancements in semiconductor research underscore the importance of our investigation. Azzoni et al. (2023) 
highlight the roles of international initiatives and the significance of emerging technologies and digitalization 
strategies in reshaping supply and value chains, emphasizing the interconnected nature of the global semiconductor 
landscape. Similarly, the work by Mohammed & Khan (2022) examines the causal factors behind supply chain 
disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the imperative of resilience and providing a framework for 
analyzing disruptive elements. 
Our paper synthesizes these scholarly insights to make substantive contributions to the field. We have developed a 
robust framework guided by existing literature and expert opinion to discern the factors influencing semiconductor 
supply chain resilience. Through hypotheses formulation and the use of Partial Least Squares Structural Equation 
Modeling (PLS-SEM), we test both measurement and structural models using secondary data based on the literature,

Modeling (PLS-SEM) for this analysis. The framework is developed based on evidence from the literature and expert 
opinion. 
 
The paper also conducts a preliminary test of the proposed model using artificial survey responses grounded in insights 
from the literature and expert opinions. This initial test suggests that advanced technologies, such as Artificial 
Intelligence (AI) and digital inventory systems, play a crucial role in creating agile and transparent supply chains. 
These technologies are central to enhancing manufacturing flexibility and the industry's ability to swiftly adapt to 
disruptions. The findings further underscore the importance of integrating supply chain processes, which fosters 
collaboration and innovation, ensuring long-term competitiveness. Continuous investment in capital and innovation 
remains vital for growth and for addressing emerging challenges. Manufacturing flexibility emerged as a key enabler 
of supply chain resilience, allowing for rapid adaptation to external pressures. 
 
Nevertheless, these preliminary results need to be validated by replicating the analysis using real survey responses, as 
opposed to the artificial data employed in this study. This represents a promising avenue for future research with 
significant potential for further contributions to the field.

This study examines the integration of Markovian and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) models to effectively 
manage the progression of cohorts within organizations and operations settings. By tracking the transitions of these 
cohorts through various states, the research aims to steer the system towards desired objectives through strategic 
interventions. We present a modeling framework that combines the stochastic nature of Markov Chains with the 
deterministic approach of DEA, facilitating the evaluation of policies as Decision Making Units (DMUs) in achieving 
anticipated outcomes. The models, which operate in both single or two-stage configurations across single and multiple 
targeting environments, offer insights into the dynamics of and the effectiveness of policy interventions. The findings 
underscore the benefits and constraints of employing these models to guide operational systems, such as human 
resource settings or even circular economy entities, towards optimal future structures.

1. Introduction
Manpower planning is a cornerstone in the operational strategy of both public and private organizations. Decision-
makers must anticipate future demand fluctuations, evaluate the availability of necessary skills, and simultaneously 
address essential considerations such as diversity and equal employment opportunities (Georgiou et al. 2022). To aid 
decision-makers in navigating these complexities beyond relying solely on past experiences, various mathematical 
models have been developed. These models serve to illustrate how an organization’s operations might be influenced 
by future workforce needs and ensure that strategies are in place to attract, nurture, and grow a talent pool aligned 
with the organization’s future leadership and operational demands (Adekoya 2019; Al-Daihani et al. 2019). 
Among these models, Markov Systems have emerged as a particularly flexible tool for managing human resources 
and assessing potential within organizations (Hrustek et al. 2020). Key elements of Markov Systems include internal 
transitions and attrition probabilities, which are critical to the overall process (Georgiou et al. 2022). This approach 
thus focuses on estimating how internal transitions might shape an organization’s workforce composition over time. 
An additional dimension of manpower planning involves evaluating the effectiveness of recruitment policies, for 
which Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has proven to be a valuable tool. Since its introduction, DEA has been 
applied in modeling manpower requirements across various sectors (Charnes, Cooper et al. 1968; 1973; 1976), with a 
continued presence in the literature. For instance, Thanassoulis et al. (2018) used DEA to evaluate academic 
recruitment and promotion policies, while Singh and Aggarwal (2014) combined DEA with the Analytic Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) to assess employee performance across organizational levels.

One interesting result is that R3 has an optimal target that is equal to the target vector that was used as an input in the 
first model (2.1)-(2.7). This policy can be considered fully efficient, since all the slack and deviational variables are 
zero and has an intensity of λ3=1. This fact acts as a validation; R3 was specifically designed to attain the specific 
target in just one step and the results of the second model confirm this characteristic. Moreover, no other policy/DMU 
has a “pure” target value, meaning that the optimal target values for the other policies/DMUs are derived from convex 
combinations of the other possible targets through the intensities various μ that form the “targets frontier”. In this 
illustration no other policy/DMU is fully efficient, since all of them have at least some of the deviational variables 
different than zero. Regarding the policies/DMUs that performed relatively well in the previous model, i.e. R2 and R5, 
they continue to behave in a similar manner, with λ2 and λ5 equal to 1, zero slack variables but non-zero deviational 
variables. On the other hand, R1, R4, R6 and R7 are underperforming. Their θ values differ from 1, they seem to have 
distinct policies or DMUs as peers, and they exhibit non-zero slack and deviational variables. Another interesting 
result emerges from the values of the λs for the inefficient policies/DMUs: R3 is a peer for R4 and R7 but not for R6. 
Further, the optimal target values for R4 and R7 are relatively similar (or at least do not differ by much) from those of 
R3, while the target values of R1 and R6 differ enough. Consequently, the multiple targets model can group together 
policies/DMUs that have relatively similar target values and incentivizes the inefficient policies/DMUs of that group 
to look up to the more efficient within that group. 
 
4. Concluding remarks 
The general purpose of this paper is to present preliminary results of a holistic framework for evaluating potential 
recruitment flows within systems governed by uncertainty. Building on the work of Georgiou et al. (2022), this study 
combines Markov systems with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to incorporate a network structure that supports 
achieving specific population targets. The single-stage DEA-Markov model provides a foundation for evaluating 
recruitment flows by assuming that the desired workforce structure can be reached in one step. This model successfully 
achieves the objective of offering a unified approach that integrates stochastic workforce transitions with deterministic 
efficiency assessment, where recruitment policies are evaluated as Decision-Making Units (DMUs) based on their 
efficiency in achieving target structures. 
 
Recognizing however that those organizational goals may require gradual workforce adjustments, in the current paper 
we try to investigate further the initial framework by investigating a two-stage DEA-Markov configuration. This two-
stage model examines the efficiency of potential recruitment policies, allowing organizations to attain target structures 
over multiple steps rather than all at once. By treating recruitment flow as a decision variable in the second stage, the 
model mirrors realistic workforce planning, where gradual shifts often align with operational needs. The second 
modeling variation of the study, introduces a multiple-targets model, which further enhances the flexibility of 
recruitment flow evaluation by including multiple potential workforce targets. This model achieves the goal of 
allowing decision-makers to assess recruitment policies against a variety of desired future states, creating a targets 
frontier. The novelty of this variation lies in the ability to select recruitment policies that balance diverse objectives, 
by weighting and prioritizing specific targets within a set of potential outcomes. 
 
Naturally, there are numerous limitations that suggest possible directions for future research. For instance, we utilize 
time-homogeneous probability matrices, which can be somewhat restrictive. Additionally, we apply fixed-time control 
in the two-stage model, whereas a promising approach could involve free-time control, incorporating the minimum 
number of steps required to reach the target as an additional decision variable. Finally, we acknowledge that these 
models are preliminary attempts to explore multi-stage models or multiple targets; there are various potential modeling 
adaptations (such as introducing a θ factor in the multi-stage model) that also call for investigation. Additionally, 
future plans include applying these methodologies to comprehensive case studies to showcase their applicability in 
real-world contexts. These studies aim to highlight the practical implications of the outcomes and propose actionable 
solutions based on the findings.

Abstract 
Climate action is one of the most important issues in the modern world, with demographic, economic, personal, and 
long-term societal implications. The consumption of non-renewable energy has increased carbon emissions as the 
industrial revolution has progressed, which is the primary cause of climate action and global warming in the economic 
world. This study was undertaken to determine the relationship between carbon emissions (Co2), Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP), Industrial Value (IV), and Population (POP), in developed countries, over a period of 10 years, from 
January 1st, 2010 to December 31st, 2020. The impact of Co2 emissions and population growth on economic growth 
in developed countries was examined in this study. GDP and Co2 emissions were used as indicators of economic 
development and environmental degradation in the context of climate change, respectively. Statistical tools, for 
econometric analysis, employed Granger causality across all variables. According to the findings of Granger causality, 
increasing GDP per capita reduced carbon dioxide emissions in the long run whereas increasing industrialization 
increased carbon dioxide emissions. In developed countries, economic growth is regarded as critical to meeting targets 
and providing financial assistance to developing countries. The study found a long-run relationship between all 
cointegrated variables.

1. Introduction
The climate change has emerged as a global issue that has engaged the interest of scholars in recent decades. This 
global phenomenon has been linked to excessive reliance on fossil fuels to meet energy demand, population growth, 
and bad farming practices. Over the last 36 years (1979-2014), worldwide carbon dioxide emissions had risen from 
1.4 parts per million per year in early 1995 to 2.0 parts per million per year thereafter. Climate change mitigation 
techniques necessitate scientific and innovative research, which gives evidence of the causal influence of pollution on 
the environment and information for environmental policymakers, donors, and investors. The development of current

while increasing industrialization increases carbon dioxide emissions. However, as a result of increased carbon dioxide 
emissions, the environment, health, and air quality are all harmed. Unidirectional causality runs from industrialization 
to GDP per capita, population to carbon dioxide emissions, population to GDP per capita, and population to 
industrialization, according to Granger-causality evidence. The modern econometric techniques have empirically 
proved the causal effect of environmental pollution in various countries. 
 
The study suggests the development of environmental-related institutions such as the Agricultural and Environmental 
Ministries, for adopting people-centered approaches to climate change adaptations, early warnings, and impact 
reductions. Policies that support small and medium-sized businesses and industries, as well as access to financial 
services, subsidies, and lower taxes, should be implemented to create decent jobs, lower the unemployment rate, and 
boost the country's economic growth. The government should create an environment that encourages the use of clean 
and renewable energy technology for home, commercial, and industrial applications, to reduce pollution and burnt its 
consequences. Transportation is considered a major source of greenhouse gases. One can save 1.6 metric tons of 
carbon dioxide equivalents per year, by eliminating just one roundtrip plane ride.  
 
5. Conclusion 
In this study, an effort was made to find out the causal relationship between carbon dioxide emissions, GDP per capita, 
industrialization, and population, and also to identify the impact of Co2 emissions on economic growth. This study 
was conducted with data from ten sample developed countries, during the period between 2011 and 2020. The rate of 
economic growth is heavily influenced by technological progress. Technological advancement primarily refers to the 
development of new and improved production methods, as well as the upgrading of existing ones. The indiscriminate 
use of natural resources is the result of technological advancement. Technical advancements lead to increased 
productivity. The growth of economy in the developed countries is considered very much crucial because only when 
the developed countries do achieve the target in their economy’s growth, then these countries could lend a helping 
hand to developing countries. According to the study, the variables such as Carbon dioxide emissions, GDP per capita, 
industrialization, and population are all co-integrated, and with a long-run equilibrium relationship. Hence to minimize 
the rate of carbon emissions, the government should take appropriate measures. Since all four variables are co-
integrated, reduction in carbon emission would increase the country’s GDP while industrialization would increase the 
rate of carbon emissions. 
 
The scope for further research is a comparative study, which can be done with other macroeconomic factors and 
economic growth on carbon emissions, with the help of renewable energy, financial sectors, and institutions. The same 
study can be used to investigate the relationship between regional- and sector-specific studies, as well as the same or 
different macroeconomic variables. Furthermore, the study can be used to predict future carbon emissions and 
greenhouse gas emissions over various periods using various analyses.

Abstract 
In an increasingly interconnected global marketplace, the resilience of supply chains is crucial for ensuring the 
uninterrupted flow of goods and services. This paper addresses the Reliable Facility Location Problem (RFLP) within 
a two-echelon supply chain network, focusing on the fortification of facilities to mitigate risks posed by potential 
disruptions. We model the decision-making process for locating and fortifying facilities at candidate sites, 
incorporating fixed location costs alongside two distinct fortification cost functions: linear and non-linear. The 
objective is to minimize total costs related to facility location, fortification, and transportation while ensuring that each 
customer is served by both a primary and a backup facility. The model with the linear fortification cost function 
employs a two-reliability framework, allowing for either fully fortified or unfortified facilities. In contrast, the non-
linear fortification model introduces complexity by allowing for partial fortification, thus reflecting more realistic 
scenarios. Both models are solved using a Lagrange relaxation method, yielding near-optimal solutions. Our findings 
emphasize the strategic importance of investing in facility fortification as a means of enhancing supply chain reliability 
and resilience against disruptions. This research contributes to the development of robust supply chain networks 
capable of navigating the complexities of modern logistical challenges, highlighting the need for effective strategies 
in facility location and risk management.

1. Introduction
The increase in businesses today is a result of Thailand’s 4.0 policy, which aims to promote small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs), accounting for more than 90% of all businesses. This policy encourages the adoption of 
technology and innovation in business operations, making businesses a key driver of Thailand’s economy (Small 
Industry Credit Guarantee Corporation, 2020). According to statistics on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), micro-
enterprises contributed GDP of 449,046 million baht (2.6%), small enterprises contributed 2,495,444 million baht 
(14.4%), and medium enterprises contributed 3,161,113 million baht (18.2%) (Office of Small and Medium 
Enterprises Promotion, 2023). However, the direction of economic growth has been at odds with the number of 
businesses that can survive. In November 2023, there were 2,608 businesses registered for dissolution, an increase of 
16.43% from the previous month. (Office of Small and Medium Enterprises Promotion, 2023) The causes include poor
financial management, lack of managerial, marketing, and sales skills, as well as changing customer behaviors after 
the COVID-19 pandemic, which shifted consumers toward online services. Some businesses have failed to adapt to 
trends or integrate science and technology into their operations. To address these issues, the government has

Each type employs different tools or techniques to achieve the desired outcome. ML is applied in various dimensions 
of business, including customer data analysis, sales forecasting and demand prediction, customer service 
enhancement, marketing data analysis, and other related areas, in order to leverage existing data to predict or formulate 
future business strategies. The choice of which type of ML to use depends on the appropriateness of the data 
characteristics and the objectives of the analysis. However, business leaders must prioritize data accuracy and 
customer privacy to ensure that the analysis is effective and responsible. Utilizing ML in business can help 
organizations adapt and grow more efficiently in the digital age, enhance competitive capabilities, create positive 
customer experiences, and foster sustainability in business operations.

Abstract 
Pharmaceutical SMEs in Peru face significant logistical challenges, particularly in their On-Time In-Full (OTIF) 
performance. Prior research suggests that Lean Six Sigma, combined with Kotter’s Change Management model, can 
effectively reduce operational inefficiencies, yet most studies focus on larger enterprises. This study addressed urgent 
issues like procurement delays and packaging errors by applying the DMAIC framework and Kotter’s model to ensure 
successful implementation of new practices. The objective was to enhance OTIF and streamline operations. Results 
showed a 40% reduction in dispatch times and a 15.66% improvement in OTIF, rising from 81.5% to 94.26%, with 
procurement efficiency increasing by 23.29%. This research contributed to the literature by integrating Lean Six Sigma 
and Kotter’s model in SMEs, improving competitiveness and operational performance in the pharmaceutical sector. 
Future research should explore broader applications of these methodologies in SME logistics across various industries.

1. Introduction
The importance of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector in marketing pharmaceuticals is undisputed, 
both globally and in the specific context of Latin America and Peru. These companies represent a significant part of 
the economy, contributing not only to employment but also to innovation and competitiveness in the pharmaceutical 
sector. An analysis of the importance of SMEs in the economy shows that they are crucial for economic development, 
as they generate a high percentage of jobs in the region, making them an essential pillar for economic and social 
stability (Tenesaca, 2023). In Peru, pharmaceutical SMEs face the challenge of adapting to a changing environment 
where demand for quality and affordable pharmaceuticals is increasingly demanding. The European Commission has 
also highlighted that SMEs are crucial to the economy, since they represent around 99% of all companies in the

6. Conclusions 
The main findings of this study indicated that the implementation of Lean Six Sigma methodologies significantly 
improved the logistics processes of the pharmaceutical SME under study. Specifically, the OTIF index, which reflects 
the percentage of orders delivered on time and in full, increased from 81.5% to 94.26%, representing a 15.66% 
improvement. Additionally, the procurement rate improved by 23.29%, and there was a notable reduction in product 
returns, decreasing by 41.18%. The analysis of root causes, followed by the introduction of standardized work 
procedures and error-proofing systems like Poka Yoke, contributed directly to these positive outcomes. This approach 
helped the company reduce dispatch times by 138 minutes, increasing operational efficiency by 40%. 
 
The importance of this research lies in addressing critical operational inefficiencies that negatively impacted the 
SME’s performance. The study highlights the significant role of Lean Six Sigma in streamlining logistics operations, 
which is crucial for pharmaceutical companies that operate in a highly competitive and regulated environment. The 
need for SMEs to adopt methodologies that ensure timely and accurate deliveries while maintaining quality is evident, 
given the industry's demands for efficiency and compliance with regulatory standards. 
 
This research contributes to the field of industrial engineering by demonstrating the applicability of Lean Six Sigma 
methodologies in pharmaceutical SMEs, an area often neglected in favor of larger enterprises. The combination of 
process improvement tools with Kotter's change management model ensures that these improvements are not only 
implemented but also sustained. The study provides a practical framework for SMEs in similar sectors to optimize 
their logistics operations and improve their competitive standing. Moreover, the integration of Poka Yoke and 
standardized work serves as an effective method to reduce human error and enhance consistency in the logistics 
process. 
 
Future studies should explore the long-term sustainability of the improvements achieved in this research, particularly 
focusing on the scalability of Lean Six Sigma in other areas of the supply chain beyond logistics. Additionally, 
research could investigate the integration of advanced digital technologies, such as automation and artificial 
intelligence, into Lean methodologies to further enhance process optimization in pharmaceutical SMEs. This would 
allow companies to remain competitive in an evolving market that increasingly demands both efficiency and 
innovation.

Abstract 
The study aims to enhance the emergency response capability of the City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office 
(CDRRMO) in Lipa, Batangas, a critical component in the management and mitigation of emergency situations. The 
office encounters significant challenges, including limited personnel and resources, which impede simultaneous 
responses to various incidents. These challenges are further compounded by long travel times due to geographical 
distances and road traffic. To address these challenges, the study proposes the strategic expansion of the emergency 
response units across the city. Binary integer programming (BIP) was utilized to identify the optimal locations for 
establishing additional posts, while network analysis utilizing Google Earth Pro and Maps was used to identify 
efficient routes. A streamlined emergency response system was developed using Excel’s Visual Basic for Applications 
(VBA), integrating the optimal post locations and routing data to facilitate real-time emergency reporting and response 
coordination. The analysis identified a need for a minimum of seven (7) posts in specific barangays across the city to 
cover all potential incident locations within an 8-minute response time. Additionally, alternative posts were designated 
to handle simultaneous cases. The results of the study are validated through Monte Carlo simulation and hypothesis 
testing. Thus, the strategic placement of additional posts and the development of a system can significantly enhance 
the emergency response capability of the CDRRMO, resulting in a notable reduction in response time.

Abstract 
We study the Dynamic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (DFJSSP), which is a well-known combinatorial 
optimization problem where new jobs arrive dynamically over time and have to be scheduled on a sequence of 
machines. Unlike most works that look at makespan or related criteria, we study a new cost minimization objective 
for the DFJSSP. We propose a new deep reinforcement learning method for scheduling and show that our method 
outperforms benchmark methods.

Abstract 
When the business department of an enterprise decides which orders to accept, they must consider the capacity of both 
local and outsourced factories to develop a comprehensive plan. However, there is a lack of literature that 
simultaneously considers order selection scheduling and outsourcing options. This study proposes a simulation 
optimization model that addresses order selection by considering both local factory scheduling constraints and lead 
time constraints of outsourced factories. The model determines which orders to outsource for specific processes and 
provides a production schedule for the local factory. Additionally, this paper introduces a Digital Twin-based 
framework, where the simulation system interacts with actual production information to update the probability 
distributions of simulation times and outsourcing orders. This enables the simulation to increasingly reflect the real 
production situation. Finally, numerical analysis is conducted to discuss the relationships between various parameter 
settings. The more stable the capacity and delivery times of the satellite factories, the higher the outsourcing costs for 
the local factory. The study aims to explore the trade-offs between the lead time variability of outsourced processes 
and outsourcing costs. The contributions of this paper are as follows: 1.Establishing a simulation optimization model 
to determine order acceptance, outsourcing, and scheduling. 2.Proposing a DT-based framework that continuously 
updates scheduling simulation information. 3.Simulating the impact of different variabilities on makespan and profit 
through the lead time of processes returning to the local factory and exploring the trade-offs involved.

Abstract 
In the event of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), providing emergency care within the golden rescue time is 
crucial for maximizing patient survival. However, due to insufficient Emergency Medical Services (EMS) resources, 
timely defibrillation or CPR is often not possible. To address this challenge, we leverage volunteers registered through 
the ""First on Scene"" app to provide immediate care before EMS arrival. This research aims to optimize Automated 
External Defibrillator (AED) placement and volunteer dispatch to maximize the expected survival rate of OHCA 
patients. Our approach ensures that the probability of providing emergency care within the golden rescue time meets 
a specified service level, considering the stochastic behavior of volunteers. We propose a stochastic simulation-
optimization method using mixed binary and integer variables, incorporating data-driven models of OHCA 
occurrences, pedestrian flow volumes, and real road network data to simulate volunteer rescue routes. To identify the 
most effective AED locations and volunteer assignments, we employ a Rapid Screening algorithm based on OCBA-
CO combined with a Nested Partition (NP) algorithm. In collaboration with the National Science and Technology 
Center for Disaster Reduction (NCDR) in Taiwan, we conduct simulations in the Sanmin District of Kaohsiung City 
to validate our algorithm's effectiveness and provide valuable management insights for OHCA emergency medical 
services.

Table 1: Comparison of Experimental Results and Scenarios 
 
 
The rescue time for AEDs is the minimum of the travel times for EMS or AED volunteers, and the CPR rescue time 
is the minimum of the travel times for EMS, AED volunteers, or CPR volunteers. 
 
EMS travel time follows a normal distribution, with the mean and standard deviation based on 2022 statistics for 
Sanmin District. Additionally, the dispatch time for both AED and CPR volunteers follows a uniform distribution of 
1 to 2 minutes, while AED volunteers’ time to deliver a shock after reaching the OHCA site follows a uniform 
distribution of 15 to 45 seconds. The simulation is limited to 1,000 iterations, and the optimal solution is re-evaluated 
through a 30-day simulation to ensure accuracy and fairness. 
 
The experimental results are shown in Table 1. In the first scenario, where only EMS is available, the expected survival 
rate is 0.1193, and the response time exceeds the 6-minute golden rescue time. In the second scenario, with 115 AEDs 
and 6 AED plus 8 CPR volunteers, the expected survival rate improves significantly, but only 73% of OHCA cases 
meet the 6-minute AED response time, falling short of the 90% service level target. The third row considers the case 
of deploying all 351 AEDs, representing the optimal configuration, but this scenario does not meet the study's 
constraints and is not discussed further. 
 
In Case 1, 101 AEDs are deployed (19 existing, 82 new), with 6 AED and 8 CPR volunteers. The expected survival 
rate is 0.3726, with all response times under 6 minutes. EMS dependence drops to 30.36% for AEDs and 16.07% for 
CPR, showing that adjusting AED placements and using volunteers can substantially improve outcomes without 
increasing the number of AEDs. In Case 2, 168 AEDs are deployed (37 existing, 132 new), with 7 AED and 5 CPR 
volunteers. The expected survival rate reaches 0.3773, with EMS dependence reduced to 13.04% for AEDs and 4.35% 
for CPR. Decision-makers can consider whether adding more AEDs to further reduce EMS load is worth the additional 
cost, or if improving existing placements is sufficient. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study developed a mixed binary and integer variable algorithm that integrates the OCBA-CO simulation resource 
allocation method, enabling the identification of optimal solutions with high feasibility. The results demonstrate that 
optimizing the placement of existing AEDs, even under a limited budget, and coordinating with volunteer support can 
increase the expected survival rate for OHCA patients by 3.12 times. Furthermore, with a sufficient budget for 
deploying additional AEDs, not only is the expected survival rate further improved, but the reliance on EMS in rescue 
operations decreases significantly—from 100% to just 13.04%. By accounting for the stochastic behavior of

Abstract 
Demand response programs are designed to shift electricity usage from peak to off-peak periods, typically through 
pricing strategies or financial incentives, to better align supply and demand. In this study, we explore equitable 
incentivization policies within these programs by accounting for the diverse characteristics of various demographic 
groups. We model the trade-offs between efficiency and equity in these policies and propose mechanisms that maintain 
efficiency while promoting social equity across different customer profiles. The findings are expected to offer utility 
companies actionable insights for refining their demand response strategies, fostering a more sustainable and fair 
energy management system.

Abstract 
Sustainable and energy-saving transportation options such as electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly 
common in our society. This has extended not only to EVs but also to real-life transportation such as two-wheelers, 
bicycles, and scooters.  However, in many large cities, the limited capacity of batteries and the number of battery 
swapping stations (BSS) have led to an imbalance between demand and supply. Indeed, when drivers go to a BSS, 
there are many cases where the number of fully charged batteries is not available, or the BSS is relatively far away. 
Therefore, in this study, we propose a session-based recommendation system for electric two-wheeled vehicles. We 
first consider both temporal and spatial factors to integrate the data by analyzing the demand by time of day for each 
day of the week in the region. Then, we perform ensemble clustering using BSS data installed for electric two-wheeled 
vehicles in Seoul, Korea. Finally, it recommends the BSS with the shortest distance without waiting time by 
considering the current time and location of the driver.

Abstract 
As the fabrication process of integrated circuit substrates (IC substrates) becomes more complicated, higher capital-
intensity equipment is adopted, making equipment utilization critical to maintaining a competitive advantage. There 
has been little research into machine learning applications for the IC substrate build-up process. This study aims to 
develop a data-driven framework to predict and monitor equipment health by integrating extreme gradient boosting 
regression with exponentially weighted moving-average methods, based on status variable identification (SVID) 
analysis, and providing maintenance recommendations according to domain knowledge based on different health 
statuses. The proposed method has been validated in a leading IC substrates company in Mainland China. Results 
have shown that the proposed approach can provide early detection of abnormal equipment health status, reducing 
unplanned downtime, capacity loss, and direct labor costs for repairs as part of efforts toward Industry 3.5.

1. Introduction
As the IC substrate fabrication process becomes more complex, an increasing number of capital-intensive equipment 
are utilized, making maintenance strategies increasingly crucial for equipment productivity enhancement, minimizing 
unplanned downtime, and reducing direct labor cost (Kuo et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2020). Efficient maintenance 
management decreases the impact of equipment failure, promoting cost savings and improving productivity (Haroun, 
2015; Wu et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2014).
Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) enables on-site condition monitoring to diagnose system degradation 
trends related to equipment health, capturing precise information about the product's condition or its remaining useful 
life (RUL). Maintenance decisions in this context can be made more informed and proactively (Sun et al., 2012). PHM

5. Conclusion and Future Research 
To address practical challenges, this study developed a data-driven framework that integrates XGBoost and EWMA 
to predict and monitor equipment health by analyzing SVID data and providing maintenance strategies for critical 
stripping equipment in IC substrate manufacturing. The results of the empirical study demonstrated the practical 
feasibility of the proposed approach, filling a gap in preventive maintenance for the build-up process in IC substrate 
production. An empirical study conducted at a leading IC substrate manufacturing company in Mainland China further 
validated the solution. First, a checklist of decision elements, combined with domain knowledge, was used to clarify 
the existing maintenance issues of the stripping machine and to identify key features. Second, XGBoost 
hyperparameters were optimized using BOA, where the surrogate model was iteratively refined by incorporating all 
observations of the target function. This process enabled the XGBoost model to better approximate optimal 
hyperparameter settings, resulting in improved performance and enhanced robustness in varying conditions and data 
complexities. 
 
The proposed framework addresses common features that can be applied to various processes and industries. The 
empirical study on the vertical stripping machine in IC substrate manufacturing has demonstrated the practical 
feasibility of this approach, supporting smart manufacturing initiatives and advancing Industry 3.5. Proper threshold 
settings are essential to accurately detect changes in machine conditions. Future research should focus on continuously 
collecting new data to increase the sample size and incrementally update the training dataset. This approach will help 
maintain model effectiveness, enhance decision agility, and improve the quality of on-site maintenance decisions.

Abstract 
This study focuses on the payment process of a tissue paper manufacturing plant in Cambodia, which is overseen by 
its headquarters in Thailand. The identified issues include delays in payment processing and high costs associated 
with international document delivery. The objectives of this study were to 1) reduce payment processing time and 2) 
minimize international delivery costs. Tools such as the Fishbone Diagram and Pareto Chart were used to analyze the 
factors causing delays. The methodology involved documenting the work steps in a flow process chart, measuring 
activity durations, and identifying inefficiencies. To address these issues, the ECRS technique (Eliminate, Combine, 
Rearrange, and Simplify) was applied, and an Internet banking system was introduced to replace the need for 
international document delivery. The results demonstrate significant improvements. The number of steps in the 
payment process was reduced from 38 to 23, a decrease of 39.47%. Payment processing time dropped from 137.20 
hours (17.15 days) to 57.83 hours (7.23 days). Additionally, international document delivery costs were eliminated, 
resulting in 100% savings. This research underscores the effectiveness of process optimization techniques and internet 
banking solutions in reducing operational inefficiencies and costs savings of 79,886.99 Baht per year.

1. Introduction
The Improvement of the payment process using lean principles focuses on eliminating unnecessary steps and 
enhancing work efficiency. This research applies lean concepts to improve the payment process, using a tissue paper 
manufacturing company as a case study. The company has a subsidiary in Cambodia, and headquarters in Thailand. 
Currently, the payment process is delayed and incurs unnecessary costs compared to similar businesses in the region. 
Additionally, there are challenges related to document transfers between headquarters in Thailand the subsidiaries in 
Cambodia. The adoption of lean principles and the use of information technology helps reduce redundant steps and 
waste, thereby improving process efficiency. Implementing lean concepts with the ECRS technique, along with

Abstract 
In smart manufacturing, companies continuously gather large volumes of data from machine sensors. Extracting value 
from this data requires advanced analytical methods to integrate, analyze, and predict potential issues, which is where 
Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) comes into play. PHM is a comprehensive framework that uses data 
mining, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) to perform condition monitoring, fault diagnosis, failure 
prediction, and lifespan tracking of industrial machines. The goal of PHM is to improve machine performance, reduce 
downtime, and optimize maintenance strategies. In this research, unsupervised learning techniques are employed to 
process the vast amounts of raw, unlabeled data commonly found in industrial environments. These techniques 
transform raw data into machine health scores, allowing real-time monitoring of machine conditions. By visualizing 
health scores of each machine, the system helps on-site personnel rapidly identify anomalies and determine whether 
predictive maintenance is required. This shifts the focus from conventional preventive maintenance, which is often 
time-based, to a more efficient predictive maintenance approach, which is driven by actual machine performance data. 
Moreover, this research integrates optimization algorithms to enhance the configuration of air compressors, a critical 
component in many industrial systems. By optimizing the operation and configuration of these compressors, the study 
aims to maximize their efficiency, reduce energy consumption, and ensure consistent production line performance. 
This combined approach not only supports predictive maintenance but also leads to significant cost savings and 
improved overall system reliability, making it an essential tool in modern smart manufacturing environments.

squared error (MSE) of only 0.16. Similarly, in Figure 8, the Stepwise Regression results also show a high correlation 
coefficient (𝑅𝑅2) of 0.91 and an MSE of 0.16. This demonstrates that both methods provide highly accurate predictions. 
We choose to adopt Stepwise Regression as the primary model, as it eliminates the need to determine the number of 
principal components, making it more convenient and flexible in application. Furthermore, from the scatter plot 
results, we can see that Stepwise Regression performs better in terms of both the correlation coefficient (𝑅𝑅2) and MSE,

indicating more accurate predictions of machine operational efficiency. The calculated efficiency for each machine 
can then be used as input for the next phase of machine scheduling optimization. Additionally, the machine efficiency 
values can be compared with the previously derived health scores to ensure the feasibility and condition of the 
machines, providing a dual-validation mechanism. 
 
 
4.4 Optimized Machine Combination 
After determining the operational efficiency of each machine, we use the Random Search Algorithm and Dynamic 
Programming methods to optimize the configuration of the machines. Machines with higher efficiency are kept 
running, while those with lower efficiency are shut down. The main optimization focuses on machines with 
intermediate efficiency, deciding whether to turn them on or off. Table 1 presents the results of the machine 
configuration optimization using the Random Search Algorithm.

Abstract 
Hypertension is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making blood pressure prevention and monitoring 
critical issues. With the rise of smart wearable devices, smart blood pressure monitors are gradually replacing 
traditional ones due to their convenience. This study aims to develop a calibration-free blood pressure prediction 
model using electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals, thereby eliminating the need for cuff-
based calibration in smart blood pressure monitors.To address the problem of insufficient practical data, this study 
adopts a transfer learning approach. Initially, a pre-trained blood pressure model is established using the publicly 
available MIMIC-III dataset. Subsequently, a small amount of practical data is used to fine-tune the model. 
Methodologically, the pre-trained model employs a ResNet deep learning model, achieving a mean absolute error 
(MAE) of 3.60 for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and 2.97 for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). To enhance the 
effectiveness of transfer learning, this study proposes a novel transfer learning architecture called TL-SQEBPP 
(Transfer Learning-based Signal Quality Enhanced Blood Pressure Prediction Framework). This framework utilizes 
the ResNet deep learning model for blood pressure prediction and incorporates a signal selection model, AutoEncoder, 
to provide high-quality input. The results demonstrate that this method performs excellently, with the final model 
achieving an MAE of 4.9 for SBP and 4.19 for DBP on practical data.

Abstract 
The pottery Industry is an eminent segment of the cottage sector, recognized for its environmentally sustainable nature 
and cultural and traditional significance. It entails skill and labour-intensive procedures. However, globalization and 
technological advancement have resulted in numerous competitive items affecting pottery businesses worldwide. It 
affected the livelihood sustainability of artisans within this sector. Understanding the challenges pottery entrepreneurs 
encounter within the manufacturing value chain is crucial to safeguard this sector. This research identifies, classifies, 
and evaluates the barriers faced by cottage entrepreneurs through multi-criteria decision-making techniques. Out of 
thirty barriers identified from the field visits to artisans in the Jalaun and Sonbhadra districts of Uttar Pradesh and the 
national capital region of India, this study finalizes twenty-five barriers following expert consultation. This study 
groups these barriers into eight categories based on experts’ assessment using Kappa statistics. Then, it employs the 
Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to assign relative weights to barriers. This study utilizes the Decision-
Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology to uncover the causal and effect linkages among 
the identified barriers. This study integrates quantitative methods to bridge the gap left by qualitative assessment 
studies. This study contributes to the literature by offering a quantitative framework that managers and policymakers 
can employ to prioritize critical challenges in the value chain of different sectors. It provides insights into the hidden 
causal relationships among barriers, assisting decision-makers in formulating targeted interventions to boost cottage 
industry sustainability.

Abstract 
Healthcare services are one of the factors that contribute to global carbon emissions. The global healthcare system 
accounts for approximately 4–5% of the world's total carbon emissions. Telemedicine is a method to reduce the need 
for physical access to healthcare. It not only improves the accessibility and efficiency of healthcare services but is also 
recognized as an effective way to reduce carbon emissions from patient commuting. Previous studies have focused on 
patient transportation patterns. This study utilized a system simulation technique to evaluate the impact of telemedicine 
on the carbon footprint of patient visits. Firstly, outpatient data of the hospital were collected and organized, covering 
specific data such as the registration process, daily number of patients, number of emergencies, number of surgeries, 
etc. in each department, and carbon footprint statistics and calculations were performed on these data. The study 
designed two scenarios for simulation and analysis. The results of a simulation of telemedicine in a hospital in 
Taichung City showed a reduction in carbon emissions from patients' physical visits to the medical institution, which 
in turn reduced the hospital's energy consumption and resource requirements. The results show that the total carbon 
footprint of hospital patients is 1,512.6 tCO2e per year and 1,225.7 tCO2e under the current telemedicine adoption 
rate of 20%. As the proportion of telemedicine increases in the future, its impact on carbon emissions will increase.

Managing Advertiser and Subscriber Revenues for Online 
Platforms with Time Varying Consumer Heterogeneity

Abstract 
Online platforms need to strike a balance between advertiser and subscriber revenue streams. Getting more viewers 
for ad-free subscriptions results in fewer viewers for advertisers. This two-sided market situation calls for joint pricing 
decisions. Moreover, the demand for the platform's content will often have a time variable demand pattern with 
predictable seasons of high and low demand. Such is the case of many news portals, online knowledge portals, video 
streaming platforms, etc. We consider the revenue management problem for such a two-sided market case. Consumer 
valuations in this case are heterogeneous, thereby allowing segmentation into high and low valuation segments. Our 
model allows for time varying heterogeneity in consumer valuations as is the situation in the case of news portals or 
video streaming platforms. The platform's decisions are about the subscription prices, where we consider three cases: 
low subscription fee, high subscription fee, or no fee at all. We study the platform's pricing decisions during times of 
high and low demand and find the price regimes that should follow the demand pattern.

Abstract 
E-governance projects are the main mechanism used by governments across the world to deliver citizen services
efficiently and economically as well as make the service delivery processes more transparent. Planning the structure
of the project and defining impact assessment criteria for an e-governance project are two of the crucial decisions that
will determine the success of a project and justify the investments done on the project by the government. Should a
project be public private partnerships or outsourced or completely owned and executed by the government is a project
structure decision that has to take at the planning stage of a project. There are multiple studies that answer this question 
in infrastructure projects but literature on the same question in e-governance projects are very limited. As e-governance
projects are different from infrastructure projects in many aspects there is need to address these questions. Similarly,
current research literature and actual practices in the area of impact assessments shows that the dimensions of
efficiency and economics are primarily measured. The existing set of dimensions ignore project structure while
assessing the project success. This study addresses these gaps by studying the existing literature on e-governance to
understand the challenges in these two aspects of an e-governance project. It then identifies the gaps in the existing
literature and proposes a set of guidelines that can be used by policy makers in planning of future of new e-governance
projects

Abstract 
This paper presents the action research conducted to streamline and automate workflow at McLaren Automotive Asia 
Pacific (APAC) based in Singapore. McLaren is a British luxury supercar manufacturer with racing lineage dating 
back to the 1960s. McLaren Automotive produces luxury performance road cars from its base in McLaren Technology 
Centre in Woking, England.  McLaren Automotive has more than a hundred (100) retailers in thirty (30) markets 
worldwide. McLaren Automotive APAC in Singapore, is the regional sales and marketing office for twenty-two (22) 
retailers in ten (10) Asia Pacific countries. This paper features a real-world case study of applying Lean Six Sigma 
(LSS) solutions to improve the sales forecasting and order pipeline management processes in the Commercial 
Operations department of McLaren Automotive APAC. The three main processes managed by the Commercial 
Operations team are 1) APAC Regional Sales Tracking 2) The Specification Change Requests and 3) Retailers 
Commissions Reporting. The key issues that were identified during this study are legacy sequential manual processing, 
which requires highly repetitive manual tracking and monitoring, and a lack of end-to-end process visibility.  
LSS DMAIC was applied to address these three root causes. The LSS techniques that are utilised are value stream 
mapping, root cause analysis, 5S, stakeholder analysis and standard operating procedure (SOP). After streamlining 
these process flow, successfully the various engaging the stakeholders and establishing the SOP, automation using 
Microsoft Power Automate will be implemented. 
This action research is in the final stages with the paper planned for completion end 2024, and presentation during the 
IEOM conference in Singapore February 2025.

Abstract 
Hedonic methods are widely used to estimate real estate prices. However, such methods require multiple regression 
analysis, making it difficult to consider the complex motivations and preferences that shape real estate prices because 
of multicollinearity. Neural networks (NNs) have recently gained considerable attention as analytical methods that 
compensate for the shortcomings of hedonic methods. An advantage of using NNs is that they diminish the need to 
assume explicit functions between the input and output of studies because NNs learn directly from observed data. As 
research on using NNs in real estate price estimation progresses, several studies have compared the accuracy of 
hedonic methods with NNs. The accuracy of hedonic methods and N models for estimating house prices in Turkey 
and showed that these are a better alternative to hedonic methods. However, using NNs also has certain disadvantages. 
First, the choice of explanatory variables for the model has been insufficiently examined. Previous studies often 
employed only micro variables as explanatory variables in their models, and few employed macro variables in their 
models, despite macro variables, such as GDP, significantly impacting real estate prices. Population dynamics can 
also affect the accuracy of real estate price estimation models. However, few studies employed population dynamic 
variables in their models. Second, similar to NNs, Random Forest (RF) has been applied to estimate real estate prices 
to overcome the limitations of the hedonic model. The accuracy of HA, NNs, and RF models for estimating house 
prices in Lisbon using micro variables where RF had the best accuracy. However, research on the accuracy of different 
combinations of explanatory variable patterns and multiple estimation algorithms remains inadequate. Therefore, this 
study compares the accuracy of models using RF and NNs with micro-, macro-, and population-dynamic variables. 
The analysis used data on Japanese real estate prices, population dynamics, and macroeconomic variables. Results 
indicate that NNs were more accurate than RF. Therefore, it is important to determine the appropriate method.

Abstract 
The integration of Lean, Green, and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies has emerged as a crucial focus in the pursuit of 
enhanced efficiency and sustainability in the construction industry. In particular, the Mechanical, Electrical, and 
Plumbing (MEP) systems, which are fundamental components of modern construction projects, stand to benefit 
significantly from the application of these advanced frameworks. However, despite the growing body of literature 
exploring Lean and Green principles as well as I4.0 technologies, the specific intersection of these concepts within 
MEP construction remains underdeveloped. This paper aims to address this gap by conducting a systematic literature 
review that critically examines the integration of Lean, Green, and I4.0 technologies in MEP construction. By 
analysing existing studies and identifying synergies and challenges, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive 
understanding of the current state of research and to propose pathways for future development in this area.

1. Introduction
The rapid evolution of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies, combined with an increasing focus on sustainability, has 
reshaped many sectors, including construction. As the need for more efficient and eco-friendly practices grows, the 
integration of Lean and Green principles into construction processes, particularly in Mechanical, Electrical, and 
Plumbing (MEP) systems, has emerged as a pivotal area for investigation. While these approaches offer significant 
potential to enhance operational performance, the construction industry, in contrast to sectors like manufacturing, has 
been relatively slow in embracing and applying these innovations. This paper seeks to explore the synergies between 
Lean, Green, and I4.0 technologies, with a particular focus on their implementation in MEP systems. Through a 
systematic review of existing literature, the study aims to identify research gaps, evaluate current frameworks, and 
propose a cohesive approach to integrating these methodologies. By doing so, this review contributes to the 
advancement of sustainable, technology-driven practices within the construction industry, offering insights that could 
lead to greater efficiency and environmental stewardship.

Abstract 
The semiconductor manufacturing industry, inherently capital and technology-intensive, faces growing complexities 
in production scheduling due to increasing process sophistication and stringent energy requirements. Diffusion 
Furnaces (DFs), which are essential in semiconductor doping processes, are critical bottlenecks due to their long 
processing times, high energy consumption, and the need to accommodate incompatible job families with specific 
time constraints. This study proposes a dynamic scheduling model for DFs aimed at minimizing total costs, including 
penalties for tardiness, time window violations, and electricity usage under a Time-of-Use (TOU) tariff structure. A 
mathematical model is formulated for non-identical parallel DFs, incorporating  machine eligibility restriction (MER). 
The proposed mathematical model is empirically validated using randomly generated small size numerical problem 
and the LINGO solver. The results obtained from LINGO Solver for the numerical problem confirms the correctness 
of the model proposed for the research problem considered in this study. While the proposed model achieves optimal 
total cost, they exhibit computational intractability for large-scale problems. This research contributes to the 
advancement of efficient scheduling strategies for DFs in semiconductor manufacturing, with potential for significant 
cost reductions and improvements in energy efficiency.

1. Introduction
The semiconductor industry is highly capital- and technology-intensive, with manufacturers continuously innovating 
to keep pace with Moore’s Law. As transistor density increases, production complexity rises, requiring efficient 
scheduling to minimize costs, energy consumption, and delays. This study focuses on scheduling diffusion furnaces 
(DFs), a critical bottleneck in wafer fabrication. DFs, essential for doping, operate as parallel batching machines with 
long processing times, contributing to 30% of total work-in-process (WIP). Given rising demands, minimizing 
tardiness is crucial to maintaining efficiency and customer satisfaction. 
Semiconductor manufacturing is energy-intensive (Schorn et al.,2023), with DFs consuming significant electricity 
due to high operating temperatures of 973K–1523K (Tan et al., 2020). Optimizing energy use not only reduces costs 
but also enhances sustainability by lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Implementing Time-of-Use (TOU) pricing 
strategies—scheduling high-energy operations during off-peak hours—can significantly cut electricity expenses and 
improve grid stability. Beyond energy savings, adhering to time window constraints is essential, as delays degrade job 
quality and may result in scrapped wafers, increasing costs and jeopardizing timely deliveries (Jung et al.,2014). Given

Abstract 
The current focus on sustainability has motivated countries globally to adopt sustainable practices. This study seeks 
to examine consumer behavior towards bamboo-based products as an alternative to plastic to promote sustainable 
products and link them to societal goals of sustainability and improved lives. A survey based on analyzing customer 
usage behavior has been circulated across India and collected responses have been analyzed using logistic regression 
through SPSS v28. Different stakeholders including startups, government reports, and artisans have been used to filter 
out the significant variables for the questionnaire to mimic the real scenario of this sector. The findings of the analysis 
suggest that trend (Exp(B) = 2.923, p = 0.004), alignment with sustainability (Exp(B) = 2.596, p = 0.001), and the 
willingness to pay premium prices for certified sustainable bamboo products (Exp(B) = 2.109, p = 0.01) have a 
significant positive impact on consumers’ intentions to buy or use bamboo products. However, perceived product as a 
substitute (Exp(B) 0.423, p = 0.007) and satisfaction with current products (0.332, p =0.001) have less impact when 
compared to other significant variables. Overall, the results of this research indicate that consumers are adopting 
sustainable products when they are relevant to their lifestyle and have a quality and sustainability advantage. This 
research provides fundamental knowledge about consumer attitudes toward environmentally friendly product 
substitutes and can help businesses and policymakers to understand the concepts and principles to cut a compelling 
trail to sustainable product sourcing and supporting the local economy.

Abstract 
Electric vehicle technology innovation can provide environmentally friendly and energy-efficient transportation 
solutions. However, there is a problem, namely batteries that have a limited lifespan. Therefore, researchers created a 
Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) model of electric vehicles. The model allows researchers to analyze the interaction 
between various levels, namely the socio-technical landscape at the macro level, the socio-technical regime at the 
meso level, and specific innovations at the micro level that will be used to analyze the sustainability transition. In 
addition, an electric vehicle battery life cycle model was created to plan a circular economy for electric vehicles. In 
the battery life cycle, batteries that have expired must go through a reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling process 
before being completely discarded. By creating a supply chain model with the implementation of a circular economy, 
it is hoped that it can help realize the use of more renewable energy, reduce the accumulation of electric vehicle battery 
waste, and maximize the value of recycled materials and ensure optimal performance in the supply chain. This research 
is expected to be a reference for future planning related to battery waste management.

1. Introduction
The increasing use of motorized vehicles in Indonesia has resulted in higher fuel consumption, especially gasoline, 
with total ownership reaching 158,698,240 units, where motorcycles are the most dominant type of vehicle with 
132,522,215 units (Korlantas Polri, 2023). The increase in the number of vehicles has raised concerns about the 
scarcity of fossil fuels (Prastyono et al., 2024). To address this issue, the government plans to commercialize electric 
vehicles as an environmentally friendly and cost-effective solution (Istiqomah et al., 2020, 2021). Electric vehicles

EV batteries, has been proposed as a more sustainable alternative. By shifting energy consumption from fossil fuels 
to electricity, it is expected that carbon emissions will be reduced, leading to long-term environmental sustainability. 
However, it has been observed that regulatory gaps, inadequate recycling infrastructure, and economic constraints 
remain significant barriers in Indonesia, delaying the adoption of circular economy principles compared to developed 
nations. Additionally, technological challenges in battery recycling processes, such as the efficiency and 
environmental impact of hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy, have been noted. To address these issues, alternative 
solutions, including bioleaching, have been suggested to enhance material recovery and reduce hazardous waste 
production. Moreover, it has been recommended that policy frameworks, such as Extended Producer Responsibility 
(EPR) and centralized recycling hubs, be strengthened to facilitate a smoother transition to sustainable battery 
management. 
 
To ensure a more quantitative evaluation, it has been suggested that dynamic simulation models be incorporated into 
future research to assess the long-term impacts of circular economy practices on battery supply chains. Through the 
application of System Dynamics (SD) or Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), simulations could be conducted to measure 
the flow of used batteries, recycling rates, material recovery efficiency, and economic feasibility under various policy 
scenarios. By adopting this approach, a more realistic and measurable evaluation of sustainability strategies could be 
achieved, ensuring that proposed solutions are both practical and scalable for real-world implementation.

Abstract 
This work presents the Tec4MaaSEs (T4M) project, which focuses on supporting Manufacturing as a Service 
(MaaS) ecosystems using advanced enabling technologies within the Industry 4.0 context. Central to the project is 
the development of a network of Digital Twins (DTs) that are both trustworthy and cognitive, enabling seamless 
collaboration within distributed value networks. The project examines three distinct value networks (VNs), each 
with specific needs and objectives: Value network 1 focuses on the production and distribution of electronic boards 
for white goods manufacturing. The aim is to optimize production and distribution processes by introducing an 
innovative ordering and production system that leverages the capabilities of multiple providers. Value network 2 
involves stakeholders in the additive manufacturing sector, and focuses on mould production for plastic components. 
It seeks to promote the adoption of additive manufacturing by offering comprehensive services that include finishing 
processes like machining and coating. Additionally, the network addresses reducing idle periods in aggregate 
planning. Finally, Value network 3 is built around an EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) contractor 
responsible for constructing large-scale energy facilities. The focus is on streamlining and digitizing the negotiation 
process with suppliers at the strategic planning level. The project introduces standardized Information Models to 
improve communication and collaboration between the contractor and suppliers. The work concludes by 
emphasizing T4M’s holistic approach to meeting diverse manufacturing challenges, serving as key facilitator in 
addressing these needs. This project was funded by the European Health and Digital Executive Agency, Project:

Abstract 
This study investigates the optimization of cassava flour production using FlexSim 3D simulation software integrated 
with Lean 4.0 principles to enhance efficiency and sustainability. Six production scenarios were simulated, varying in 
levels of automation and workforce involvement. Results revealed that fully automated processes increased production 
capacity by 92%, from 64 tons/day in traditional methods to 123 tons/day, while reducing waste by 33%, from 64 tons 
to 43 tons. Scenario 6, which relied on minimal manual labor with only two workers for transportation tasks, 
demonstrated significant cost savings and high productivity. The introduction of continuous input and automation 
enabled scalability and sustainability, effectively meeting higher demand without compromising efficiency. These 
improvements illustrate the transformative potential of combining Lean 4.0 with simulation technologies, providing a 
replicable framework for cassava flour manufacturers to reduce costs and waste while boosting operational efficiency. 
This research not only addresses existing bottlenecks and inefficiencies but also aligns with global trends towards 
smart manufacturing and environmental sustainability. The findings offer valuable insights for advancing Thailand’s 
agricultural sector, ensuring its continued leadership in the global cassava starch market. By leveraging Industry 4.0 
technologies, the cassava flour industry can achieve a balance between efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and 
sustainability, setting a benchmark for modern agricultural production practices.

1. Introduction
The cassava flour production industry holds immense significance in Thailand, a country recognized as one of the 
largest global producers and exporters of cassava starch. Despite its prominence, the industry faces several operational 
challenges that hinder its efficiency and global competitiveness. These challenges include bottlenecks in production 
processes, high operational costs, inefficiencies in labor allocation, and significant waste generation. Addressing these 
issues is critical for improving the quality of cassava products, reducing environmental impacts, and enhancing market 
competitiveness. 
Traditional production processes often rely on manual labor, which can lead to inconsistencies in quality and 
inefficiencies in operations. Additionally, the lack of modern technological integration results in higher production 
costs and increased waste. As consumer demand for high-quality and sustainably produced cassava flour grows, 
manufacturers are under pressure to adopt innovative methods to streamline their processes and meet market 
expectations. 
FlexSim, a 3D simulation software, emerges as a pivotal tool for modernizing cassava flour production processes. 
This software allows manufacturers to visualize their entire production systems, identify inefficiencies, and simulate

5.1.1 Production Efficiency 
- Scenario 6, representing the fully automated process with only two transport operators, achieved the highest daily 
output of 123 tons/day, an increase of 92% compared to the baseline (Scenario 0: 64 tons/day). 
Hourly processing capacity improved from 1.46 tons/hour (Scenario 0) to 5.13 tons/hour (Scenario 6) 
 
5.1.2 Waste Reduction 
- Scenarios 2 and 3 demonstrated the lowest waste generation at 43 tons/day, a reduction of 33% compared to the 
baseline (64 tons/day). Even with increased capacity, Scenario 6 produced 68 tons/day of waste, maintaining 
efficiency with scalability. 
 
5.1.3 Workforce Optimization 
- Fully automated scenarios (Scenario 3 and 6) reduced workforce requirements to 2 workers, compared to 5 workers 
in traditional processes, representing a 60% reduction. Scenarios with minimal manual labor achieved comparable or 
higher productivity with fewer personnel, emphasizing the benefits of automation. 
 
5.1.4 Work-in-Process (WIP) 
- WIP levels for processes such as drying increased in automated scenarios, from 1.25 (Scenario 0) to 3.07 (Scenario 
6), aligning with the higher throughput. Despite increased WIP in specific stages, overall process flow remained 
efficient due to optimized resource allocation. 
 
5.1.5 Continuous Input Benefits 
- Scenarios 4 to 6 implemented continuous cassava input at 10 tons/batch, which enhanced system stability and 
supported higher throughput without compromising waste management or labor efficiency. 
 
The simulation aimed to address key challenges, including bottlenecks, extended production times, excessive waste, 
and inefficiencies. By employing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as production time, waste volume, and 
workforce productivity, the outcomes were effectively evaluated. The integration of Lean 4.0 principles further 
reinforced efforts to reduce waste and optimize resource utilization throughout the process (Nuruddeen et al., 2020; 
Wojciech et al., 2024). 
 
6. Conclusion  
The research successfully identified bottlenecks and inefficiencies in cassava flour production and validated process 
improvements using FlexSim simulations. Analyzing six production scenarios highlighted the trade-offs between 
automation, workforce allocation, and efficiency. Fully automated scenarios achieved the highest capacity, processing 
up to 123 tons per day compared to 64 tons in traditional methods, while significantly reducing waste and enhancing 
throughput. Minimal manual involvement demonstrated potential for reducing costs while maintaining productivity, 
with Scenario 6 requiring only two workers for transportation tasks. Automated processes consistently minimized 
waste, reducing it from 64 tons in the baseline scenario to 43 tons in optimized scenarios. Scenarios with continuous 
input and automation also illustrated scalability and sustainability for meeting higher demand efficiently. This study 
emphasizes the transformative potential of integrating Lean 4.0 and FlexSim simulation into traditional processes,

Abstract 
Employees were reluctant to let go of Work-From-Home when they were called back to offices after the COVID-19 
pandemic ended. This is evident in the state of flux organizational policies are since then. Work-From-Home forms an 
integral part of today’s ‘hybrid way of working’. Earlier, Work-From-Home has been a ‘perk’ as a well as a ‘force 
majeure decision’. This paper investigated the reasons behind the perceptions of employees about Work-From-Home. 
These reasons helped explain the underlying theories across the three forms of Work-From-Home. Twenty-four 
employees of the Indian Information Technology Industry participated in the study by reporting their experiences of 
Work-From-Home. Qualitative data of voices of employees was analysed by using the Gioia Methodology, which 
classifies data into categories and themes leading to credible interpretations. The Gioia Methodology is designed, not 
only to surface new concepts, but also to generate persuasive new theories. Employees consider employment as 
induction into a ‘work community’ and seek guidance from organizations to maneuver through these communities. 
They consider the means by which they work as a ‘resource’ through which they achieve life-goals. Their ‘quality of 
life’ intrinsically includes work and non-work activities. ‘Non-productive work’, one that does not get paid for, impacts 
Work-From-Home significantly. The research provides novel information that can be utilised in developing the 
operations and management of organizations. Though IT organizations have taken significant steps towards a modern 
hybrid work community, there are still some challenges in terms of providing the best of both worlds to employees 
when they work out of offices or homes.

1. Introduction
There are three distinct types of Work-From-Home (WFH). The first is ‘WFH as a perk’. This was prevalent even 
before the 1980’s when the term ‘telecommuting’ was first coined. It was offered to a select few and the requisite 
terms and conditions of doing so were sorted out between the concerned employees and management (Timsal and 
Awais, 2016). The larger workforce was unaffected by it. The second is ‘WFH as a force majeure decision’. The recent 
COVID-19 pandemic forced organizations to ask their employees to work from home to prevent the spread of the 
contagion. WFH was thrust upon employees at an extremely short notice. Organizations did not have WFH protocols

At the same time, the identified categories also form dimensions that can be measured through quantitative research, 
which different organisations and researchers can utilise in their own research. Continuing research into remote 
working and raising awareness of, among other things, good remote working practices and successful management of 
remote working are currently highly recommended. Today, research of WFH is a critically important topic nationally 
and internationally for researchers, and this study can expand the current research. 
 
The research provides novel information that can be utilised in developing the operations, management, and work 
practices of organisations. 
 
In conclusion, it seems that organisations need to undertake a paradigm shift in how they approach workplace policies. 
The role of organisations in our society seems to have evolved from just a job provider to a creator of work 
communities within which employees can lead a holistic life.

Abstract 
The truck-drone hybrid delivery system has been proposed as an alternative for urban logistics due to its advantages 
in fast delivery, cost-efficiency, and environmental benefits. However, UAVs face limitations in battery capacity and 
payload, which make it challenging to meet the increasing demand for logistics services. Additionally, there are 
constraints in building new logistics facilities in urban areas. Underground logistics has emerged as an alternative 
solution to address these problems. By utilizing the subway network, the system can avoid urban traffic congestion 
and manage logistics flows efficiently. Moreover, it minimizes the cost of establishing new facilities by making the 
most of existing infrastructure. In this study, we propose a new urban delivery system that combines the existing truck-
drone hybrid model with the subway network. The established subway network and stations are used to transport 
goods from suburban areas to urban areas, where they also function as urban logistics hubs. A truck and drones handle 
the last-mile delivery to customers from the subway stations. Both the truck and multiple drones operate independently; 
the truck does not act as a mothership for the drones, and they perform deliveries across multiple logistics depots. We 
developed a mathematical optimization model for a multi-depot, multi-trip vehicle routing problem with time windows. 
The developed model was validated through numerical experiments, demonstrating its practical applicability to urban 
delivery services.

Abstract 
Scheduling plays a vital role in optimizing the performance of wafer fabrication facilities. Order Release Control 
(ORC) policy is a key scheduling component, as it determines the type, quantity, and timing of new orders released 
into the system. Over the years, several ORC policies have been developed specifically for semiconductor wafer 
fabrication. Evaluating these policies for their performance efficiency is essential, as it provides valuable decision 
support for practitioners. This paper compares the performance of 17 existing ORC policies designed for 
semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities, focusing on three due date-based performance measures: with the objective 
of minimizing Total Weighted Earliness/Lateness (TWE/L) and Total Weighted Tardiness (TWT) and maximizing 
the On-Time Delivery (OTD) rate. The MIMAC test bed dataset, also known as the Mini Fab or Intel Mini Fab, is 
used to develop the simulation model of wafer fabrication, and simulation experiments are conducted using Arena 
simulation software. The simulation results reveal that the Work-In-Process Load Control (WIPLCtrl) policy is the 
best-performing policy for minimizing TWE/L, while the Parametric Workload Regulating (PWR) policy is the best-
performing policy for each of the minimizing TWT and maximizing OTD rate. It appears that no single ORC policy 
emerged as the best-performing policy across all three performance measures. Therefore, an average ranking approach 
is employed to assess the overall effectiveness of each policy. The final rankings identify Starvation Avoidance (SA), 
Constant Work-In-Process (CONWIP), and Revised CONWIP (RCONWIP) as the best-performing policies, while 
Total Cycle Time (TOTAL_CT) and Constant Load (CONLOAD) are the worst-performing.

1. Introduction
The semiconductor manufacturing industry has become a key pillar of the global economy, experiencing rapid growth 
over the past few decades. Valued in billions of dollars, this industry plays a pivotal role in powering various 
technologies, from smartphones and computers to automotive systems and advanced industrial equipment. The 
semiconductor manufacturing process is arguably one of the most complex, comprising four key stages: wafer 
fabrication or processing, wafer sort or probe, assembly or packaging, and final testing. The wafer fabrication and 
probe stages are referred to as the front-end operations, while assembly and testing are considered the back-end 
operations of semiconductor manufacturing. The wafer fabrication stage is the most capital-intensive and 
technologically complex of four stages. The complexity of wafer fabrication arises from multiple factors, including 
the presence of unrelated parallel machines, different processor types (discrete and batch processors), uncertain 
process yields, re-entrant process flows, random equipment failures, and process variability (Li et al. 2014; Uzsoy et

5. Conclusion 
This study conducted simulation experiments to analyze the due date-based performance impact of ORC policies on 
the semiconductor wafer fabrication facility. A total of 17 ORC policies were evaluated, involving CONWIP, SA, 
WR, DEC, CONLOAD, PWR, TOTAL_CT, FRCP, DRCP, RCONWIP, Droll, EWIP, WIPLCtrl, EWC, CONSTWL, 
CONSTBWL, and SWC. Simulation results were discussed based on the three due date-based performance measures: 
TWE/L, TWT and OTD rate. The best-performing ORC policies were identified for each of the three performance 
measures, and their improvements over the other policies were evaluated. WIPLCtrl was the best-performing policy 
for the TWE/L measure, while the PWR policy emerged as the best-performing policy for both the TWT and OTD 
rate. The performance analyses revealed that no single ORC policy consistently outperformed others across all the 
three due date-based performance measures considered. Due to this, the average ranking of each ORC policy over the 
three due date-based performance measures was calculated to determine the overall best- and worst-performing 
policies. Accordingly, it was identified that policies like SA, CONWIP, and RCONWIP were the best-performing 
policies across all three performance measures, demonstrating their effectiveness in achieving balanced outcomes. 
Further, TOTAL_CT and CONLOAD were identified as the worst-performing policies. This study focused solely on 
ORC policies, while other shop floor control strategies, such as dispatching control, also play a crucial role in wafer 
fabrication. Evaluating ORC policies in integration with dispatching rules when applied to the wafer fab's different 
workstations, like lithography and diffusion furnace workstations, would offer a more comprehensive analysis of shop 
floor control strategies in wafer fabrication.

Abstract 
Automotive ergonomics deals with packaging human in the most convenient and effective way at an early stage in the 
vehicle architecture. Vehicle architecture comprises of numerous measurement variables which interact with each 
other and affect different functionalities like ergonomics, aerodynamics, safety, powertrain, etc. The purpose of this 
study is to identify unique drivers that influence performance of ergonomics in passenger cars and develop a structural 
model which will enable the car manufacturers to integrate these unique drivers in the early phase of vehicle 
conceptualization and development. An exhaustive list of drivers is identified based on the analysis of the existing 
literature and opinions from experts. Total Interpretive Structural Modelling (TISM) approach was utilized and 
constructed a structural model which shows the hierarchy of drivers of ergonomic performance. According to the 
proposed structural model, the drivers are classified into 2 levels based on their interaction and influence. The outcome 
of this research can assist researchers and automotive ergonomic practitioners to make decisions by appropriately 
prioritizing the drivers. This research is a novel approach, as it proposes a structural model considering the identified 
drivers using TISM approach in the field of automotive ergonomics for the first time and examines the 
interrelationships among the identified drivers for improving ergonomic performance in passenger cars.

1. Introduction
The auto industry is a major driver of global economic growth, supporting over 50 million jobs. It relies on various 
other industries like steel, aluminum, and electronics. If considered a nation, it would be the world's sixth-largest 
economy. Passenger cars are the most common transportation mode in advanced countries, offering independence and 
mobility. Recent trends show that comfort and safety are top priorities for car buyers. Further, with 67% of surveyed 
drivers from Germany, the US, and China 'comfort and convenience' as very important. Customer feedback, often 
shared via digital media, significantly impacts car sales. Independent surveys, like those by J.D. Power, assess 
customer satisfaction and are highly respected in the industry. Building on these insights, several studies have been 
published to analyze customer complaints and address them from an engineering standpoint, ensuring continuous 
improvements in vehicle design and performance (Ziolek et al., 2009; Pinkelman et al., 2006; Nayak et al., 2003). 
To meet these evolving customer expectations, the ergonomics, which is synonymously also referred to as Human 
Factors and Ergonomics (HFE), plays a crucial role. Ergonomics is the science of designing the job to fit the worker, 
rather than physically forcing the worker’s body to fit the job [OSHA, US Department of Labor, (2000)]. It ensures 
that products are appropriate for people. Driving a vehicle is a demanding task, even if it is not done as a profession.

the program team responsible for the development of passenger cars can focus on prioritizing Roominess (D1), 
Accommodation (D2) and Visibility (D3) while deciding the measurement variables of vehicle architecture. 
 
5.1 Theoretical Contribution 
This research explores four key drivers to improve ergonomics in passenger cars, establishing their contextual 
relationships using TISM and MICMAC analysis. Unlike existing studies in automotive ergonomics at early vehicle 
development stage, it categorizes drivers into autonomous, independent, dependent, and linkage drivers based on their 
drivability and dependency. Data from experts ranked these drivers and categorized them into four levels, helping 
vehicle platform managers understand their interconnections. This study provides methodological and contextual 
insights, aiding managers in comprehending driver relationships across various levels. 
 
5.2 Practical Contribution 
Vehicle architecture design often faces conflicting criteria between functional performance and ergonomics. For 
example, a low, sloping roof may look attractive and perform well aerodynamically but reduces head clearance for 
taller occupants, affecting ergonomic performance. Similar conflicts arise with safety, crashworthiness, powertrain, 
and suspension. Within ergonomics, prioritizing drivers like roominess versus visibility poses a managerial challenge, 
often based on intuition and experience. This research prioritizes ergonomic drivers identified from literature and 
expert opinions, modeling them hierarchically for better decision-making in early car development. Balancing 
engineering optimization with managerial prioritization aligned to customer preferences enhances ergonomic 
performance in passenger cars. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research identifies four ergonomic drivers in passenger car architecture: Roominess, Accommodation, Visibility, 
and Ingress/egress, based on literature analysis and expert opinions. Data from 33 participants were analyzed to 
establish interrelationships, influence, dependence, and drivability among these drivers. The structural model 
constructed using TISM illustrates direct and transitive relationships among the drivers, while MICMAC analysis 
highlights their relative importance and interdependence. This model aids vehicle platform managers in prioritizing 
the ergonomic drivers during the early architectural phase. In future, we intend to enhance the proposed structural 
model by including measurement variables under each of the identified ergonomic drivers and prioritize them to 
further aid the decision-making process in passenger car development.

Abstract 
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is software-based robotics which automates and offloads unnecessary processes 
performed by human workers. RPA was introduced by Hospital X primarily to support the operations team in making 
informed decisions about procurement as well as to notify vendors to bill for the consumed items. Before the 
implementation, the process was straightforward but tedious. After implementation, the process was considerably 
shortened. Instead of manually tracking and informing individual vendors, staff could simply submit a report to the 
RPA bot. However, inefficiencies remained in the procurement process. In this paper, we identify the operational 
inefficiencies that arise from RPA implementation using lean six sigma methodology. We map the current and to-be 
process and brainstormed for improvements. Finally, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of manual 
processes versus RPA to determine which one is more superior and analyzed the time savings from implementing 
RPA. RPA essentially automates some of the most mundane and repetitive computer-based tasks and processes in the 
workplace. It promises to boost efficiency by taking over tasks that were previously handled by humans. This paper 
contributes to the extant literature on RPA implementation and how lean six sigma and DMAIC methodology helped 
Hospital X to transition from manual to automated process and improve its procurement process.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Hospital X plays a vital role in Singapore’s healthcare system, striving to revolutionize healthcare delivery by offering
seamless, one-stop care. This approach reduces the need for patients to transfer between facilities or consult multiple
specialists. As part of its commitment to operational excellence, the 300+ bed hospital adopted Robotic Process
Automation (RPA) to enhance procurement efficiency. RPA refers to software-based robotics designed to automate
repetitive tasks to reduce human errors, improve efficiency, and ensure compliance with workplace regulations and
standards. Its primary function at the organization is to support the operations team in making informed decisions,
while its secondary function is to notify vendors to bill the hospital for items consumed.
The adoption of RPA coincided with the opening of a major new operating theatre specializing in complex surgeries, 
including total knee and cervical disc replacements. This addition significantly increased staff workload. To address 
this challenge and drive process improvement, Hospital X identified innovative automation as the key to maintaining 
operational excellence. Before implementing RPA, the procurement process was labor-intensive but straightforward. 
Staff manually tracked the utilization of items using Excel, monitored Purchase Order (PO) balances, and acted when 
PO utilization exceeded 65% - either by topping up contracts or raising new POs. Staff then emailed vendors to request 
billing for consumed items.

4.5 Control 
The RPA enhancement project is ongoing, with Hospital X emphasizing system monitoring and execution stability. 
The hospital is collaborating with its system partner, Tech Company “S,” for immediate support in addressing 
inefficiencies. As part of the improvement program, the hospital is focusing on addressing challenges related to 
updating records in Epic, particularly for the nursing team.  
 
Initial efforts involve assessing current difficulties and implementing a training plan to improve data input skills. The 
potential for significant time savings with RPA can depend on the extent that users are properly trained. Consequently, 
the Control phase emphasizes the implementation of a training plan, with its impact regularly assessed to ensure 
sustained performance improvements. 
 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
5.1 Conclusions 
This study aimed to evaluate the post-implementation efficiency of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), identify areas 
for improvement, and compare the performance of manual processes with RPA. 
 
• 
Objective 1 sought to assess whether the RPA system effectively streamlined processes and reduced 
workload. The findings revealed that the current RPA implementation fell short of expectations, failing to 
achieve significant workload alleviation. 
 
• 
Objective 2 focused on identifying solutions to overcome the challenges and limitations observed post-RPA 
deployment. To achieve the desired outcomes, the study explored opportunities for enhancing the RPA 
system and proposed a training plan tailored to address the specific needs of the nursing team. 
 
• 
Objective 3 compared the strengths and weaknesses of the manual process and RPA. Surprisingly, the manual 
process proved more effective in its current state, as the RPA system failed to deliver the anticipated workload 
reductions. Unlike artificial intelligence, RPA lacks adaptive learning capabilities. Its rigidity, while limiting 
in some aspects, also ensures it processes data according to predefined standards - a characteristic that can 
be advantageous with appropriate enhancements. 
 
5.2 Recommendations 
To improve the current system, key recommendations include: 
 
• 
Modifying the RPA system to provide informed procurement decisions based on usage balance and accurate 
purchase order identification. 
 
• 
Ensuring continuous system operability to avoid delays in procurement decision-making and invoice 
processing timelines. Proactive maintenance by Tech Company “S” is critical to preventing unplanned 
downtime. 
 
• 
One major limitation of RPA is that it requires human initiation in certain steps due to security constraints. 
Excessive human intervention, however, has hindered the system’s ability to achieve its full potential. 
Eliminating unnecessary user involvement is essential for maximizing efficiency. To address this, it is crucial 
to ensure the information in charge forms is accurate, complete, and consistent with data in Epic. Once a 
successful match is established between charge forms and Epic, the RPA system can generate and submit 
reports autonomously.  
 
• 
A verification layer within the Hospital X database can safeguard data accuracy, eliminating the need for 
manual checks, modifications, and reconciliations. This improvement will enhance process efficiency, reduce 
workload stress, and ensure the RPA system fulfills its intended purpose.

Abstract 
This study explores the relationship between supply chain integration (SCI) and supply chain resilience (SCRES), two 
critical concepts in supply chain management (SCM) literature. While SCI is widely recognized as a strategy to 
enhance firm performance and secure competitive advantage, SCRES has emerged as a crucial capability for firms to 
navigate disruptions in today’s interconnected global environment. However, both SCI and SCRES come with costs, 
such as investments in technology for integration and capability-building for resilience. Moreover, not all firms or 
situations warrant the pursuit of either integration or resilience, as they may not be suitable or beneficial in every 
context. Existing research has largely examined the impact of SCI or SCRES on performance individually, with 
limited attention to the relationship between these two concepts. Our study addresses this gap by investigating how 
SCI influences SCRES and vice versa. We employ two portfolio models—Kraljic’s Purchasing-Matrix and the Risk-
Probability-Impact Matrix—to provide a comprehensive understanding of when, where, and with whom to implement 
integration strategies to achieve resilience. These models offer insights into strategic decision-making, illustrating 
how collaboration, a fundamental mechanism of SCI, can enhance resilience by facilitating information sharing, 
knowledge exchange, and joint planning. Our research aims to contribute to SCM literature by presenting a nuanced 
perspective on the interplay between integration and resilience, helping firms identify optimal integration strategies 
to build resilient supply chains.

Abstract 
This research addresses the limitations inherent in current poultry weight prediction models. Existing models primarily 
rely on the age of chickens, resulting in inaccurate and insufficient predictions. As the industry evolves, precision in 
weight estimation becomes increasingly critical for stakeholders seeking to make informed decisions. Therefore, there 
is a growing demand for comprehensive models that incorporate additional variables beyond age. This study aims to 
enhance the accuracy of poultry weight predictions by employing machine learning techniques that utilize a diverse 
range of factors. By doing so, it seeks to provide more reliable estimates of chicken weight, thereby supporting better 
decision-making within the industry.

Abstract 
The primary objective of this research is to evaluate the vital enablers that significantly influence the adoption of Lean 
Production Systems (LPS) in Indian manufacturing Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME). Initially, 32 potential 
enablers that are expected to towards effective implementation of LPS were identified from the analysis of the closely 
related existing studies. Further, a Pareto analysis was applied considering the 32 identified enabler and obtained a list 
to 16 vital enablers. Subsequently, the AHP method was employed to prioritize these vital enablers, assigning weights 
that reflect their relative importance to LPS adoption within the SME context. In addition, the DEMATEL approach 
was utilized to analyze the interactive relationships between the enablers, mapping out causal relationships and 
identifying which enablers have the most significant influence on others. The proposed integrated AHP-DEMATEL 
approach suggests a general framework for SME managers and practitioners and providing them with strategic insights 
for both long-term and short-term decision-making. By understanding the prioritization and interrelationships of these 
enablers, decision-makers can create practical strategies that improve sustainability, boost productivity, and enhance 
operational efficiency within SMEs adopting lean practices. Overall, the findings from this study are especially 
valuable for developing adaptable strategies that not only promote the successful adoption of Lean Production Systems 
(LPS) but also optimize the management of critical enablers.

1. Introduction
In the fiercely competitive landscape of modern business, rapid technological innovations are driving numerous 
industries to enhance their production methodologies, ensuring superior-quality products are delivered at optimal 
costs. (Mohammad & Oduza, 2020). These swift advancements, combined with intensifying competition and growing 
customer expectations, are compelling organizations globally to embrace modern manufacturing strategies to sustain 
their competitiveness (Shahoo, 2020). Among various approaches, Lean Manufacturing (LM), also referred to as the 
Lean Production System (LPS), emerges as a pivotal strategy, enabling organizations of all scales to sustain their 
competitive advantage (Filho et al., 2016). The core goal of the LPS is to deliver high-quality products at the lowest 
possible cost by eradicating all non-value-added activities or waste. (Prasad et al., 2021). Although numerous success 
stories and well-documented advantages of LPS implementation exist in large enterprises (Shahoo, 2020), the adoption 
of LPS in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) remains considerably limited. (Belhadi et al., 2019; Saini & 
Singh, 2020). SME hold a crucial position in the economic landscape of both developed and developing nations. In 
India, the SME/MSME (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) sector has become a dynamic and integral force, 
driving socio-economic progress by promoting entrepreneurship, contributing significantly to GDP, and creating

5. Results and Discussion 
This research presents efforts to enhance LPS adoption in Indian SME. Vital enablers for LPS adoption in SMEs were 
evaluated based on insights from prior studies. Through AHP analysis, it was found that the Main enabler, ME1: 
Strategic Enabler, ranks highest among the five main enablers and belongs to the effect group, exerting significant 
influence over the others. The enabler hierarchy is as follows: Strategic Enabler (ME1) > Economic Enabler (ME3) > 
Technical Enabler (ME2) > Operational Enabler (ME4) > Human Resources Enabler (ME5). Importantly, the Strategic 
Enabler plays a critical role in initiating the lean journey within the SME manufacturing environment. 
 
Within this main enabler ME1, six sub-enablers (SE11 to SE15) were ranked based on their relative importance: 
Commitment and Support from Top Management (SE11) > Effective Leadership (SE13) > Organizational Cultural 
Change (SE14) > Continuous Improvement (SE15) > Shared Improvement Vision (SE12). The sub-enabler 
Commitment and Support from Top Management (SE11) holds the highest rank in the global column, proving 
essential for successful lean adoption in SMEs. Additionally, DEMATEL analysis shows that SE11 is part of the cause 
group, while SE12, SE13, SE14, and SE15 belong to the effect group. This result underscores the need to focus on the 
cause enabler to directly influence other favorable enablers. 
 
ME3: Economic Enabler, which ranks second, is crucial for advancing LPS adoption in SMEs. DEMATEL analysis 
positions this enabler in the effect group, with two associated sub-enablers: Financial Potential (SE32) and Availability 
and Allocation of Resources (SE31). Financial Potential (SE32) holds higher relative importance than Resource 
Availability (SE31) and occupies a cause position, while SE31 is in the effect position. 
 
The third-ranking enabler, ME2: Technical Enabler, is also classified in the effect group and has four sub-enablers: 
Training and Education (SE23) > Lean Consultant (SE22) > Skills and Expertise (SE24) > Understanding Lean Tools 
and Techniques (SE21). Sub-enablers SE21 and SE24 fall into the effect group, while SE22 and SE23 belong to the 
cause group, suggesting that targeted interventions in SE22 and SE23 could positively impact other technical aspects 
of LPS adoption. 
 
For the Operational Enabler (ME4), which ranks fourth, the associated sub-enablers (SE41, SE42, and SE43) are 
prioritized as SE41 > SE42 > SE43. SE41 and SE43 are in the cause group, while SE42 is in the effect group. 
 
Lastly, ME5: Human Resources Enabler holds the fifth rank, with Involvement of all employees (SE52) rated higher 
in importance than empowerment of all employee (SE51). DEMATEL analysis identifies ME52 as part of the cause 
group and ME51 in the effect group.  This research highlights the importance of prioritizing cause-group enablers to 
drive effective LPS adoption in SMEs, offering a structured approach to enhance lean practices through strategically 
targeted initiatives 
 
7. Conclusion  
LPS is a critical manufacturing strategy that enhances competitiveness across industries, regardless of size or sector. 
While significant emphasis has been placed on LPS adoption in large enterprises, implementing LPS in SME remains

particularly challenging. SME face fierce competition and must adopt LPS to maintain their market position. However, 
the process is complex and difficult to achieve due to the numerous enablers involved. A study by Sankar and 
Mathirajan (2023, 2024) addresses this issue by identifying vital enablers for LPS adoption in SMEs through a 
systematic approach. Pareto analysis was used to determine  the most vital enablers, and their relative importance was 
assessed using a combined AHP and DEMATEL approach. The AHP method allowed for ranking the enablers based 
on expert opinions from both industry and academia, though it lacked the ability to capture interrelationships among 
these enablers. To address this limitation, the DEMATEL method was employed, establishing cause-effect 
relationships among the enablers by classifying them into “cause” and “effect” categories. 
 
The study's findings reveal that the primary strategic enabler is of highest priority and belongs to the cause group, 
which has a significant influence on LPS adoption. This suggests that managers should focus on this enabler to 
improve LPS adoption in SMEs. Additionally, the study highlights that “commitment and support from top 
management” ranks highest in global importance and also falls under the cause group. These cause-group enablers 
directly impact LPS adoption, guiding managers on where to concentrate their efforts. The research outcomes not only 
help managers prioritize key enablers for LPS adoption but also provide insights into their interrelationships. This 
understanding equips SME managers to develop effective strategies, addressing both individual enablers and complex 
interactions among them for successful LPS implementation. This comprehensive approach can play a transformative 
role in enhancing competitiveness for SMEs through lean manufacturing strategies.

Abstract 
Increasing carbon emissions is the main problem behind the issue of global warming, which is one of the most profound 
issues for scientists and researchers today. This study illustrates the negative impact of motor vehicle emissions on the 
environment, with statistical data showing the significant contribution of the transportation sector to carbon dioxide 
emissions globally. In addition, it illustrates the calculation of the investment to be spent by investors in building a 
lithium-ion hybrid plant and supercapacitors. The cash flow shows that the project is feasible to proceed with positive 
financial results, including an IRR of 14.23%, NPV of USD 1.358.652 and NBC indicating a higher ratio of benefits 
than costs. Although it takes almost 10 years to break even, the sensitivity analysis shows that the project remains 
viable if production is < 263 units and raw material prices do not exceed USD 516.970. In addition, this plant has 
significant potential to reduce CO2 emissions, with an average reduction of about 68.29% per year, supporting the 
government's target of reducing carbon gas emissions by 43.20% by 2024. Therefore, this project not only promises 
financial benefits but also supports efforts to reduce carbon emissions in Indonesia.

The rapid use of electric motorbikes by 2024 can reduce CO2 emissions. This can be seen from the table above which 
explains the environmental feasibility of adopting an electric motorbike rather than a conventional motorbike illustrates 
the comparison of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions between conventional and electric motorbikes, as well as the CO2 
reduction that can be achieved if using an electric motorbike. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of the analysis that has been carried out in the research on the feasibility analysis of hybrid lithium-
ion batteries and supercapacitors for electric motorbikes in Surabaya, several important conclusions can be drawn: 
 
1. The combination of technology between the use of supercapacitors and lithium-ion needs to be done to 
overcome the shortcomings in lithium-ion batteries, namely in terms of price and durability of lithium-ion 
batteries to create cheap electric vehicles and also durable in terms of batteries by combining these two 
technologies. 
2. The combination of supercapacitors and lithium-ion can support to increase public demand so that with the 
increase in public demand for electric vehicles, it can also help to reduce CO2.

Abstract 
In this paper, we develop the stochastic inventory routing problem for last mile delivery of medical oxygen for 
hospitals during crisis. We include stochasticity in the inventory routing problem for both split and unsplit deliveries 
for different hospitals. During the COVID-19 crisis, the time for rebottling of liquid oxygen in jumbo cylinders and 
further distribution within city hospitals was one of the main reasons for oxygen shortage in smaller hospitals. This 
problem was faced by many hospitals in India. Further, the capacity constraints of cylinders, geographical limitations 
in terms of population density, and transportation infrastructure limitations within rural India were some other reasons. 
In this entire crisis, the Mumbai (India’s financial capital) model was applauded for the protocol of oxygen 
management, and training the hospitals to prevent oxygen wastage during the COVID-19 crisis. We develop a new 
inventory routing problem and specifically illustrate the importance of centralized planning and decentralized storage 
supply to mitigate crisis in the medical oxygen supply chain. The results depict that availability of oxygen can be 
enhanced through better replenishment policies. Managerial insights and policy implications are addressed through 
incorporation of resilience and agility in decision making during the crisis.

Abstract 
Currently, the criteria for determining the optimal order quantity and the holding quantity to achieve maximum cost-
effectiveness have not yet been applied in the inventory management of the factory in the case study. Therefore, to 
reduce the factory's costs and improve the efficiency of raw material management to meet demand, this research aims 
to study the improvement of inventory management in the factory by applying the theory of different order quantity 
methods and comparing them with the actual inventory costs from April 2022 to March 2023 using three heuristic 
methods: 1. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) 2. The Periodic Order Quantity (POQ) method, as per the Silver-Meal 
approach, found that all three heuristic order size determination methods had lower inventory costs than the actual 
inventory costs. The method that provided the lowest cost for this case study was the POQ method, which reduced the 
factory's inventory costs by 79.59%. Additionally, the calculation mechanism of the POQ method is not complex and 
is easy to implement in practice.

1.Introduction
Currently, many businesses emphasize the importance of material planning and control for production or various 
services, incorporating technology to assist in management. This involves planning and preparing materials, known 
as Material Requirements Planning (MRP). However, due to the relatively high cost of MRP systems, which are often 
complex, different businesses face various problems and limitations in their usage. This necessitates the continuous 
development of MRP systems to ensure they are easy to use, convenient, and highly efficient for each business's needs. 
A company that manufactures car compressors in Thailand is a business engaged in the production of automotive 
parts. By producing 100% of automotive air conditioning compressors for export, due to an increase in customer 
orders over the past 1-2 years and a significant rise in new models, driven by the global expansion of engine usage. 
This makes production planning and sourcing of raw materials increasingly important and significant. 
The researcher studied the general conditions of the case study company and found that the ordering of raw materials 
used in production is controlled by an MRP system for ordering, storing, and supplying raw materials into the 
production process. However, the raw materials still rely on outdated information that has not been updated in the 
MRP system for ordering. This has led to issues where the raw materials are insufficient to meet production demands, 
resulting in delays in delivering products to customers. At times, there have been excessive orders of raw materials 
into the warehouse, leading to insufficient storage space. These problems occur frequently. Additionally, it was found 
that the criteria for determining the appropriate and economical order quantity in the MRP system of the case study

Step 7: Period Order Quantity: POQ 
Determine the order size to cover the net demand for k consecutive periods, where k is found by dividing the Economic 
Order Quantity (EOQ) by the average net demand per week.

Each order cycle of the periodic order quantity method covers the net demand for 6 consecutive weeks. For 
example, the order size for cycle 1 covers the net demand for weeks 1 to 6, totaling 52,401 pieces.

Where A is the cost per order. (THB) 
H is the cost of storage per unit per month. (THB) 
 
3. Results and Conclusions 
This research demonstrates the application of MRP in determining the order quantity of raw materials for use in the 
production process of an automotive air compressor manufacturing plant. In this independent study, the researcher 
compared inventory order models using three heuristic methods: Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), Periodic Order 
Quantity (POQ), and Silver-Meal. The selection was based on the type of raw material demand: for constant demand, 
the EOQ method was used, while for variable demand, the POQ and Silver-Meal methods were employed. 
Subsequently, the total cost was calculated to compare the results and determine which method was most suitable for 
each type of raw material in the case study company, by calculating the VC to classify the demand types. 
By comparing the costs between the three heuristic methods, namely the (EOQ), (POQ), and Silver-Meal, with the 
actual ordering used in the current factory.

Figure 4. shows that the case study company's monthly inventory decreased after using the POQ method to determine 
the optimal order size. 
Recommendations 
3.1 Due to the uncertainty in the demand for raw materials each year, it is advisable to regularly review the 
appropriate order quantities to avoid mistakes in purchasing raw materials. 
3.2 The results obtained from calculating the Variability Coefficient (VC) should be consistently compared with 
the actual raw material demand behavior to conclude whether the method is truly appropriate. 
3.3 Should also study the inventory used as raw materials for other production processes.

Abstract 
The agro-export sector in Peru is crucial, especially fruit maquiladora SMEs, which face efficiency and 
competitiveness issues due to unproductive times in packaging and cooling processes. These challenges increase costs 
and reduce profitability, demanding urgent interventions. The study proposed a Lean Logistics model integrating tools 
like VSM, CONWIP, and 5S to optimize operations, enhance space utilization, and reduce waste. Key findings 
included a reduction in service lead time by 55.57%, cooling process wait time by 95.24%, and overall improvement 
in storage capacity by 41.04%, demonstrating the model's effectiveness. The research’s impact extends academically 
by providing a scalable model for similar sectors, while socioeconomically, it enhances SME competitiveness and job 
opportunities. The results underline the importance of continuous improvement and call for further research to expand 
and refine lean applications in agro-export and other critical industries.

1. Introduction
The importance of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) sector that provides fruit maquiladora services for 
export is fundamental in the global context, especially in Latin America and Peru. This sector not only significantly 
contributes to the local economy but also plays a crucial role in the international agricultural supply chain. Globally, 
SMEs represent approximately 90% of all companies and generate over 50% of employment, highlighting their 
relevance in the global economy (Freeman et al., 2012). In Latin America, SMEs are responsible for about 70% of 
employment and 40% of GDP, demonstrating their impact on regional economic development (Love & Roper, 2015). 
In Peru, the agro-export sector has grown steadily, and fruit maquiladora SMEs are essential to meet the international 
demand for fresh and high-quality products (Damoah, 2018). These companies not only generate income for their

Abstract 
Companies are more frequently employing projects daily to achieve business objectives. This study focusses on a 
small manufacturing company situated in Springs, Gauteng. At this recycle fiber plant approximately 10% of the 
projects launched did not yield the desired outcomes. Research indicated that the leadership focusses on deliverables 
with little emphasis on the employee well-being and concerns. The aim of the research is to highlight the gap of servant 
leadership, and to provide the critical success factors that would contribute towards the implementation of servant 
leadership. A survey and questionnaire were used to collect data from departments of operations, engineering, project, 
quality, and safety. The study received 33 responses from a total of 50 population, which represents a 66% response 
rate. The study discovered inefficient evidence supporting the presence of leadership empowerment in this 
manufacturing company. The study further identified collaboration culture, leadership empowerment, organizational 
culture, fostering learning culture, work engagement, and team effectiveness as critical success factors for servant 
leadership. It is highly recommended that the organisation adopts a strategy to address the absence of servant 
leadership and implement a strategy to deploy this form of leadership, to reap the benefits of servant leadership in the 
project.

Introduction
Organisations are starting to integrate projects into their daily operations to translate their corporate objectives into 
actual actions. The success of the project is heavily dependent on the leadership style (Ellahi et al., 2022). Leadership 
is defined as a process in which a follower and a leader collaborate to motivate and steer a specific group to complete 
tasks and responsibilities in accordance with the organization's stated aim (Wilson, 2022). A leader must ensure that 
his team is working in the same direction and create a culture that will support the effort (Wilson, 2022). That's why 
project management needs a leader. 
A relatively small company in Springs, Gauteng, operates in the manufacturing industry and has a functional 
organisation that includes dedicated personnel in areas such as operations, engineering, sales, marketing, training and 
development, quality, human resources, project management, and logistics. Engineering facilitates operations by 
managing processes, maintenance, and projects. This company focuses in producing family care goods such as bath 
tissues, kitchen towels, and medical towels using recycled and virgin fibers.In this company, senior leadership selects 
initiatives and allocates funds. Projects are then initiated and carried out by project departments headed by the project 
lead. The project department manages significant capital-intensive initiatives. Process technicians and engineers are 
also working on a continuous improvement project, which is overseen by operations and production managers.

6. Conclusion 
The study's primary objective is to identify the critical success factors for implementing servant leadership for project 
success. It will also identify the gap in manufacturing company to implement servant leadership style for project 
success effectively. This study used quantitative method to collect information needed to answer the research 
questions. An electronic questionnaire was distributed to the chosen participants to collect data from departments of 
operations, engineering, project, quality, and environmental health and safety. The research findings also indicated 
that while servant leadership has the potential to enhance project success, the organization's significant gap is in 
leadership empowerment. This gap is problematic because leadership empowerment is an important success factor for 
implementing servant leadership and completing projects successfully. A lack of leadership empowerment can lead to 
poor staff engagement, decision-making issues, project delays, and low team morale. The study also indicated that the 
positive aspects of implementing servant leadership at this manufacturing company include a more driven, inspired, 
and productive workforce. This will result in continuous project success for the company. Servant leaders prioritize 
assisting their teams, building trust, and encouraging positive relationships with team members and stakeholders, 
which leads to better solution-finding, quicker resolution of issues, and more effortless carrying out of projects.

Abstract 
This research aims to enhance the efficiency of the mold-changing process for lower suspension spring rubber 
injection molds in the DESMA ALPHA250 injection machine by applying Single Minute Exchange of Die (SMED) 
and Lean Manufacturing techniques. Initially, the mold-changing process required approximately 145 minutes, with 
49.60% classified as non-value-added (NVA) steps. Through the implementation of SMED, the mold-changing time 
was successfully reduced to 60 minutes, a 59% decrease. Additionally, the number of process steps was reduced from 
20 to 14 (a 30% reduction), and the total distance covered by personnel during the changeover decreased from 272.76 
meters to 133.16 meters, a 51% reduction. These improvements directly contributed to enhanced production 
efficiency, cost savings, and increased production capacity. To further support these gains, additional process 
improvements were introduced, including adopting hot mold preheating technology and designing efficient mold 
storage carts, reducing machine downtime. This study also applied ECRS (Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange, Simplify) 
principles to streamline operations continuously. The findings provide valuable insights for automotive manufacturing 
and present methodologies that can be adapted for other industrial production processes to optimize efficiency and 
reduce waste.

Figure 8 compares the mold change process layout before and after implementing the recommended mold parking car 
path. The left side illustrates the previous layout, where maintenance technicians and warehouse personnel had to 
transport molds over a longer distance (up to 80 meters) to complete a mold change. This path included multiple 
unnecessary movements across the workspace, leading to inefficiencies.The mold parking car's optimized layout on 
the right enables a more direct route. The use of this car reduces the distance traveled from approximately 80 meters 
to a shorter, more direct path. Maintenance Technicians (MT1 and MT2) can now position the molds closer to the 
machine area. At the same time, other personnel, including Warehouse (WH), Quality Control (QC), and Production 
(PD) staff, have designated locations, further streamlining the process.This improved layout minimizes mold 
transportation time, reduces operator fatigue, and enhances overall process efficiency by centralizing resources near 
the operational area, facilitating a quicker and smoother mold changeover. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This research highlights the significant benefits of applying SMED (Single Minute Exchange of Die) and Lean 
Manufacturing principles to enhance mold change efficiency in the rubber injection molding process for automotive 
suspension components. The study's findings underscore a 59% reduction in mold change time, achieved by 
systematically identifying and transforming non-value-added (NVA) activities into more streamlined processes, 
resulting in a decrease in both the number of operational steps (from 20 to 14) and movement distance (from 272.76 
meters to 133.16 meters). This level of improvement directly translates to higher production capacity, reduced machine 
downtime, and cost savings, which are critical factors for competitiveness in the automotive manufacturing sector. A 
key outcome of this study is the demonstration of SMED's effectiveness in converting internal setup tasks to external 
ones, allowing for a more seamless operation with less interruption to machine utilization. Integrating ECRS 
(Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange, Simplify) principles further optimized these setups by reducing redundant activities 
and reordering steps to maximize efficiency. For instance, combining temperature stabilization tasks with other setup 
activities effectively minimized idle time without compromising quality. 
 
The findings of this research not only offer immediate practical applications for rubber injection molding in the 
automotive industry but suggest broader implications. The methodologies outlined could be adapted for other complex 
manufacturing setups requiring frequent changeovers or equipment adjustments. Additionally, this study advocates 
for a proactive approach to continuous improvement, emphasizing that investments in advanced technologies (such 
as preheating stations) and well-structured training for staff can yield sustainable benefits.

Future studies could explore additional technological enhancements, such as real-time data tracking and predictive 
maintenance strategies, to optimize the mold change process further. Such advancements would help manufacturers 
achieve even greater precision and reliability in process execution. By adopting and building upon the methods 
demonstrated in this study, manufacturers stand to realize long-term gains in efficiency, flexibility, and cost-
effectiveness, thereby reinforcing their ability to meet evolving demands within the competitive automotive sector.

Abstract 
This review presents an overview of the advancements in Additive Manufacturing (AM), focusing on its applications, 
processes, materials, and evolving roles across various industries extracting the research from more than hundred 
research and/or review articles. With manufacturing technology continually spreading in the aerospace industry, this 
research focuses on exploring the ways in which adoption of AM technologies can bring improved flexibility of 
designs, optimization of waste, and productivity than conventional approaches to manufacturing. For instance, Laser 
Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM) processes are reviewed regarding the ability to 
strandline the mechanical properties of aluminum and titanium alloys that are used in aerospace engineering. It also 
discusses the difficulties related to the material homogeneity, process control and post processing which are crucial

1. Introduction
Additive Manufacturing (AM) can be defined as the family of processes that deposit material successively to build an 
object of desired geometry from a three-dimensional digital model. AM builds parts and structure by depositing layer 
by layer gradually, it is therefore capable of creating designs that are challenges in other ways. Cutting down costs are 
minimal thereby helping to control wastage which makes this approach to be useful especially when working on the 
aerospace, biomedical and electronics products. With the improvement of AM technologies, they are deployed on ever 
more difficult materials, particularly ceramics and metal matrix composites, thereby increasing the competencies of 
AM (Mahmood et al. 2021). Using plastics, metals, and ceramics the technologies of additive manufacturing have 
been adopted in aerospace, automotive, and medical industries. Because of its effectiveness in the minimization of 
waste, reduction in lead time, and enabling the creation of prototypes within the shortest time, it has become one of 
the crucial advances in the current manufacturing systems (Yılmaz 2021).

6. Conclusions 
The study presents a comprehensive investigation into the operational challenges faced by small and medium-sized 
automotive battery manufacturing companies, specifically in improving efficiency and reducing non-compliance rates. 
The findings reveal that the implementation of the proposed TPM-based maintenance model significantly improved 
operational efficiency and equipment reliability. Through the structured approach, the case study demonstrated a 13.85% 
increase in operational efficiency and a 25.58% reduction in non-conforming products, highlighting the model’s 
effectiveness in enhancing production processes. The autonomous and planned maintenance strategies were 
particularly impactful, empowering operators to take ownership of routine maintenance tasks while introducing a 
systematic framework for preventive actions. These improvements collectively contributed to a more reliable 
production environment and greater alignment with industry standards. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its focus on addressing specific operational inefficiencies prevalent in the 
battery manufacturing sector. By adapting Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) principles to the unique requirements 
of small and medium-sized enterprises, the study offers a practical solution to persistent issues such as high downtime 
and quality deviations. The findings underscore the relevance of autonomous and planned maintenance as effective 
methodologies for sustaining operational gains and ensuring long-term stability. Moreover, this research underscores 
the value of employee involvement in maintenance activities, which not only enhances equipment reliability but also 
fosters a proactive and engaged workforce, crucial for achieving sustained improvements in a competitive market. 
This research contributes to the field by filling a critical gap in the literature regarding the application of TPM 
methodologies in small and medium-sized battery manufacturers. Existing studies often focus on large-scale 
organizations or more established industries, leaving a void in understanding how these maintenance strategies can be 
adapted for smaller enterprises with limited resources. The study’s contributions lie in demonstrating how TPM tools 
can be tailored to fit the operational and financial constraints of SMEs while delivering significant improvements in 
key performance indicators. By providing a scalable framework that integrates autonomous and planned maintenance, 
this research offers valuable insights for other SMEs in the automotive sector facing similar challenges in maintaining 
production efficiency and quality standards. 
 
The findings and methodologies discussed in this study lead to several key observations and recommendations for 
future research. First, the successful implementation of the TPM-based model suggests that small and medium-sized 
manufacturers can achieve substantial gains by adopting structured maintenance approaches. However, it is essential 
to emphasize the role of continuous training and capacity building in sustaining these improvements over time. 
Without ongoing employee engagement and periodic reviews of maintenance practices, the initial gains may not be 
maintained. Future studies should explore ways to enhance the model’s adaptability to other manufacturing contexts, 
focusing on sectors with similar operational constraints and challenges. 
 
Additionally, the study highlights the need for more comprehensive metrics to assess maintenance effectiveness 
beyond traditional indicators such as operational efficiency and availability rates. The inclusion of metrics related to 
sustainability and resource utilization could provide a more holistic view of the model’s impact. Moreover, further 
research could investigate the integration of advanced digital tools, such as predictive maintenance algorithms and 
real-time monitoring systems, to enhance the proactive maintenance capabilities of the model. Such advancements 
would not only improve the accuracy of maintenance interventions but also align the model with current trends in 
Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing. 
 
In conclusion, this study presents a robust framework for improving the operational efficiency of small and medium-
sized automotive battery manufacturers through the tailored application of Total Productive Maintenance principles. 
The findings indicate that adopting autonomous and planned maintenance strategies can significantly reduce 
equipment downtime and enhance product quality, thereby boosting competitiveness in an increasingly demanding 
market. While the proposed model has shown promising results in the case study, its broader applicability to other 
SMEs in the automotive sector and beyond remains an area for further exploration. Researchers and practitioners are 
encouraged to build upon this study by refining the model and exploring its potential to drive sustainable 
improvements in different manufacturing contexts.

Abstract 
This study examines the transition from traditional paperwork to a paperless manufacturing system in a plastic 
company, aiming to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and enhance production performance. Utilizing the DMAIC 
methodology (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control), the study focuses on minimizing manual paperwork time 
and optimizing resource management through automation of order handling and production scheduling. During the 
Measure phase, data showed the company uses about 5,700 papers per month, leading to production delays of 21.43 
minutes per day and costing $4,310 per order. Analysis revealed that manual data entry and document transfers were 
the main causes of delays and errors. The Improve phase implemented electronic data capture (EDC), workflow 
automation, and integrated systems, which reduced cycle time by 25% and manpower by 52% in pilot projects. The 
control phase introduced key performance indicators (KPIs) and real-time dashboards, alongside regular audits and a 
continuous improvement framework, to monitor and sustain the system’s success. The results indicate that adopting a 
paperless system could save the company 21.43 minutes of production time, $4,310 per order, and 285 papers daily, 
leading to significant improvements in operational efficiency and environmental sustainability.

1. Introduction
In today’s fast-paced industrial environment, traditional paperwork is a significant bottleneck, consuming substantial 
time and effort and often leading to inaccuracies. The transition to a paperless manufacturing system is increasingly 
seen as a vital step toward improving operational efficiency, reducing waste, and enhancing overall production 
performance. Automation emerges as a crucial solution, offering a means to streamline processes, reduce the duration 
of jobs, and eliminate errors associated with manual data entry (Leibert 2020). 
The concept of a paperless organization extends beyond environmental benefits, profoundly impacting various 
departments within a firm. Real-time data systems, enabled by digital transformation, allow for more accurate 
inventory control, timely supplier communication, and precise delivery scheduling (Yao and Carlson, 1999; Porter et 
al. 2005). The advent of Industry 4.0, characterized by the integration of intelligent robots, data analytics, and 
cybersecurity, has further accelerated the shift towards digitalization in manufacturing (Karabulut 2020; Ege 2014).

to them to keep track and improve 
their paperless system. A special 
window for customer questions and 
suggestions will be provided and 
will be stored and analyzed by the 
marketing department. In addition, a 
tool for materials role will be 
provided to optimize the ordering 
process from suppliers this will 
improve the supplier ranking and 
extend the options where they can 
order materials from. Production 
role has the wide range of control 
due the diversity of needs and 
process need to control, for example 
machine 
learning 
will 
be 
implemented to improve and control 
the 
maintenance 
process 
and 
production planning. 
 
 
6. Conclusion 
As conclusion, the process of moving to paperless work will improve production line efficiently and effectively. This 
improvement will be optimized if they provide the shop floor workers with a smart board to enter and organize their 
work. Smart boards help in dealing with dynamic environments like shop floors where unnecessary stops may occur 
and delay the production process.  
 
Most of the workers in the company complain about the amount of paper they make, so switching to paperless will be 
a big advantage to them. However, some of the workers still believe that paper is essential, and they cannot deal with 
computerized systems for work. Resistance to change exists in their workers, and special training is required to ensure 
smooth transition to paperless. Another solution can be using hybrid paper system which contain paperless activities 
and paper based work, this can help with such changing resistance behavior among the employee.

Abstract 
Non-revenue water (NRW), also known as water produced but not billed or lost before reaching consumers, poses 
significant challenges for municipalities worldwide. In the Gauteng region of South Africa, water loss accounts for a 
substantial financial burden and resource waste. To address these issues, NRW management strategies have been 
developed to improve the efficiency of water utilities and reduce water loss in distribution systems. However, despite 
these efforts, the NRW rate remains higher than the recommended best practice. To better understand NRW 
management practices in metropolitan municipalities within Gauteng, a qualitative case study was conducted. Experts 
in the Water and Sanitation Department were interviewed to identify the strategies adopted by the municipalities to 
reduce water losses and address NRW, as well as the challenges they face when implementing these strategies. The 
study found that municipalities employ several best practices for NRW management, such as water infrastructure asset 
management, water metering systems, and collaborative partnerships for education and awareness. However, they 
also face significant challenges, including financial barriers, organizational issues, and technical constraints, which 
hinder their efforts to reduce water loss effectively. This study provides a comprehensive guide to enhance NRW 
management. By addressing these challenges, municipalities can significantly improve the efficiency of NRW 
management, reduce water losses, and contribute to sustainable water resource management while enhancing service 
delivery and reducing financial burdens on water authorities.

1. Introduction
Non-revenue water (NRW) is a matter of global concern as countries grapple with the loss of water that is produced 
but not billed or consumed. Water losses are generally categorized into three types: real (physical) losses caused by 
pipe bursts and leaks in the distribution system, commercial (apparent) losses attributed to meter inaccuracies and 
theft, and unbilled metered and unmetered consumption from emergency operations by water utilities or free water 
made available to specific consumers (Klingel and Knobloch, 2015; Jang, 2018; Kiptala et al., 2019; Murugan & 
Chandran, 2019). While apparent losses are significantly lower in volume than real losses, they are more costly 
because revenue loss is calculated based on the retail price rather than the production cost, as is the case with real 
losses (Arregui et al., 2018; Ncube and Taigbenu, 2019). 
The problem of NRW extends beyond mere water loss; it also represents a significant financial burden on water 
utilities and affects their sustainability. Moreover, it hinders their ability to provide adequate water services to 
communities. The Gauteng metropolitan municipalities, like many other water service authorities, face the challenge 
of providing water in both quality and quantity while promoting efficiency and sustainability. According to McKenzie

Abstract 
The food manufacturing industry, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), faces critical challenges 
related to operational inefficiencies and machine availability. Previous research has highlighted the need for Lean 
Manufacturing tools like 5S, SMED, and Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) to address these issues. This study 
aimed to improve equipment availability and reduce downtimes in a food processing SME in Peru, focusing on 
optimizing production through these methodologies. The proposed solution involved the application of Lean tools to 
restructure workplace organization, streamline machine setup times, and implement autonomous maintenance 
practices. Key findings demonstrated a significant improvement, with equipment availability increasing from 77.01% 
to 82%, and a reduction in setup times by 30.81%. The study’s contribution is both academic and practical, providing 
a replicable model for similar SMEs in the food industry. Future research should explore further adaptations of Lean-
TPM frameworks to enhance sustainability and long-term operational performance across various sectors.

1. Introduction
The importance of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the food manufacturing sector is undeniable, 
both globally and in specific contexts such as Latin America and Peru. This sector not only represents a crucial source 
of employment, but it is also essential for food security and economic development. According to the Food and 
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), SMEs in the food industry are responsible for a significant 
portion of global food production, contributing to the diversity and sustainability of food systems (Batista et al., 2021). 
In Latin America, SMEs represent approximately 99% of all businesses, and their role is even more prominent in the 
food sector, where it is estimated that they generate more than 50% of jobs (Beske et al., 2014). In Peru, SMEs are

to 82%, setup times were reduced by 30.81%, and machine downtime due to unplanned failures decreased substantially. 
These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Lean and TPM methodologies in addressing the critical challenges that 
small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the food sector often face, particularly in terms of operational 
inefficiencies and equipment reliability. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its ability to provide actionable insights for SMEs in Latin America, a sector 
where production efficiency and sustainability are paramount. SMEs are vital for food security and economic stability 
in the region, yet they face persistent operational challenges, including high downtime and inefficient processes. This 
study confirms that integrating Lean and TPM tools can directly address these challenges by optimizing production 
processes and enhancing equipment reliability, thus contributing to greater competitiveness and sustainability in the 
industry. The research’s emphasis on practical solutions for reducing inefficiencies offers valuable lessons for other 
SMEs facing similar issues. 
 
This study contributes to the broader field of Industrial Engineering by offering a replicable model for integrating 
Lean and TPM tools in small-scale food processing industries. While previous research has extensively covered the 
application of these methodologies in large enterprises, this study fills a gap by focusing on SMEs in the food sector, 
particularly in developing countries. The research highlights the importance of adapting Lean and TPM strategies to 
the unique challenges faced by smaller companies, such as limited resources and workforce capacity. By 
demonstrating how to implement these tools effectively in resource-constrained environments, the study provides a 
framework that can be adapted and applied in similar contexts worldwide. 
 
The final observations of this research suggest that the implementation of Lean Manufacturing and TPM tools not 
only improves operational efficiency but also fosters a culture of continuous improvement within the organization. 
Employees became more engaged in maintaining the equipment and following standardized procedures, which 
contributed to sustained improvements in both machine reliability and product quality. These findings underscore the 
potential long-term benefits of embedding Lean and TPM methodologies into the organizational culture, ensuring that 
improvements are sustained over time. 
 
Future research should explore additional applications of Lean and TPM tools in other sectors of the food industry, 
with a particular focus on the integration of digital technologies such as Industry 4.0. There is also a need to investigate 
the long-term sustainability of these interventions, particularly in how they contribute to environmental goals and 
resource optimization. Furthermore, future studies could analyze the scalability of the model developed in this research, 
determining its applicability to other regions and sectors. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of 
how Lean and TPM methodologies can be leveraged to enhance both operational performance and sustainability across 
a variety of industries. 
 
In conclusion, this study provides compelling evidence that Lean Manufacturing and TPM tools are highly effective 
in improving operational performance in SMEs within the food sector. By addressing machine downtime, setup times, 
and maintenance practices, the company not only achieved greater efficiency but also set a foundation for long-term 
sustainability. This research offers a clear roadmap for other SMEs in the region to follow, emphasizing the need for 
a strategic and well-structured approach to process improvement. As industries face increasing pressure to optimize 
both economic and environmental performance, this study serves as a timely and valuable contribution to the field, 
encouraging further exploration of Lean and TPM applications in diverse industrial settings..

Abstract 
Management concepts often oscillate between transient fads and enduring practices. Predicting their evolution remains 
a key challenge in management research. This paper applies Management Fashion Theory to analyze the lifecycle of 
'Agile Management,' a concept that originated in software development and has since permeated diverse organizational 
functions. Drawing on historical data, a literature review, and Google Trends analysis, this study identifies Agile 
Management's alignment with the characteristics of management fads: a catchy label, promises of performance 
improvements, interpretative flexibility, universality, and dissemination via rhetorical patterns. The analysis shows 
that Agile Management has risen rapidly to prominence, with evidence of its widespread adoption and 
institutionalization in education and practice. However, its trajectory mirrors the typical lifecycle of management fads, 
peaking in popularity before signs of decline emerge. Despite this, some indications point toward its potential to 
transition into a sustained management practice rather than fading completely. The results highlight the dual nature of 
Agile Management as both a compelling response to organizational challenges in a digital era and a concept vulnerable 
to overhyped expectations. The paper concludes by discussing the broader implications of management fads for 
organizations, emphasizing the need for critical evaluation to distinguish enduring value from transient appeal. 
Keywords 
Management Fashion Theory, Management Fad, Agile Management 
1. Introduction
New management concepts are regularly introduced. Some make their way into textbooks, spread through companies 
over decades, and become management classics. Others, however, experience a brief hype and are soon forgotten. The 
concept of ""Agile Management"" claims to help companies ""develop the ability to adapt to change in order to succeed 
in a turbulent environment"" (Agile Alliance, 2023). With this, the concept might have found the answer to the core 
question of all organizations: how to succeed with which type of organization. The idea of ""Agile Management"" 
became popular in the early 2000s, initially as a more narrowly defined method or tool in software development. Since 
then, the concept of Agile Management has evolved into a universal framework that impacts all areas of management. 
Today, we have Agile Marketing, Agile Human Resource Management, and Agile Leadership. More than that, we 
now live in an ""agile world"" or the ""agile era"" (Madsen, 2020). The interpretation of the concept ranges from open 
calendars or team meetings to claims of a fundamentally new principle of leadership and organization. In between, 
concepts like Agility, Scrum, Design Thinking, and Lean Management can be found. As broad as the understanding 
of agility is, the evaluations of the concept are equally diverse. Between enthusiastic reviews (Denning, 2018) and the 
prospect of a revolution (Kahan, 2018), there are also skeptical views urging caution in evaluating the management 
concept (Cram & Newell, 2016) or even predicting its end (Cagle, 2019). 
While only time will tell if Agile Management will become a lasting concept, this paper aims to take a meta-
perspective. Using the Management Fashion Theory, it seeks to answer how the concept of Agile Management 
emerged, which actors are involved, and where Agile Management might currently be placed in the lifecycle of 
544",,"Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

simultaneous changes in the workplace due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the understanding of work, technology, and 
strategy is shifting. Here, leaders can fulfill their need for security and demonstrate an awareness of societal, 
technological, and work-related challenges. 
 
4. Trend, Fad or Revolution? 
4.1 Summary 
The analysis of key characteristics shows that the concept of Agile Management exhibits several traits of popular 
management ideas, giving it significant fad potential. However, to make a final assessment of whether this concept is 
merely a fad or a game-changer, more time is needed. The popularity curve seems to follow an ideal pattern at this 
point in time. Whether it will eventually decline or continue to rise in the coming years remains uncertain. 
 
If the expected benefits of Agile Management fail to materialize over time, users may become disillusioned, and 
interest could wane. On the other hand, the phenomenon of ""sustained management fads"" (Perkmann & Spicer, 2008) 
is now being discussed. If agility succeeds in institutionalizing itself (e.g., through educational programs, conferences, 
specialized consulting firms, or certification), a management concept that initially appeared to be a fad could 
contribute to lasting development and transformation in the business world. 
 
4.2 Outlook: Should Management Fads be embraced? 
When considering whether a management concept is merely a fad or a long-term, success-driven development, the 
question arises: is the emergence of management fads a good or bad thing? Kieser (1997) offers an attempt to answer 
this. 
 
Management fads can be distinguished by effective rhetoric versus mere rhetoric. If leaders manage to actively and 
consciously use management fads to boost motivation and energy, a fad can become an effective leadership tool. 
At the same time, the potential benefit of a management fad also defines its limitation. Most people will eventually 
recognize the rhetorical strategy by the time the next fad arrives, leading, at best, to the feeling that ""old wine is being 
sold in new bottles,"" or, at worst, to a cynical attitude toward all new developments in organizations.

Anomaly Detection, Prognostics, and Diagnostics: Machine 
Learning for the Hadron Calorimeter at the CMS 
Experiment

Abstract 
Large complex systems often incorporate multiple systems and a multitude of sensors, and system monitoring is 
essential for discovering faults and facilitating diagnostics across systems and sensors. At the same time, exploring 
large systems with numerous multivariate data sets is challenging. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the 
most powerful high-energy particle collider ever built worldwide, is not just a scientific marvel but a beacon of human 
curiosity and ingenuity. It provides thousands of researchers with unparalleled opportunities for groundbreaking 
discoveries by colliding physics particles near the speed of light and unveiling new physics to answer the grandest 
questions about the nature of matter. The scientific discoveries and technological advances at CERN have made 
tremendous contributions to our daily lives; some notable examples are the touchscreen technology, hadron tumor 
therapy, PET scanners for medical imaging, and the World Wide Web. The LHC has recently undergone crucial 
upgrades, leveraging new technologies to achieve the high luminosity program; its components are growing more 
complex to support high radiation exposure, strong magnetic fields, and extreme particle acquisition rates.  Such 
extraordinary attributes pose tremendous challenges for the experiment and data processing of enormous amounts. 
Ensuring the quality of physics data requires timely monitoring and the resolution of system anomalies. Machine 
Learning (ML) tools have gained immense popularity due to the proliferation of sensor data for monitoring, and 
diagnostic applications in various industrial domains. The growing complexity of the system and the monitoring of 
data volumes of the LHC accentuate the need for automation through advanced ML tools. 
Detection, identification, and resolution of anomalies are essential to generate more physics collision data of the 
highest quality. Developing ML tools for complex systems often involves expensive data curation and modeling 
efforts; it requires adequate, cleaned, and annotated data sets, and addresses the challenges of heterogeneity and curse-
of-dimensionality of large data sets. The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment---one of the large general-
purpose colliders at the LHC---has dedicated substantial monitoring efforts for detector systems and particle data 
quality; the control and safety systems (DCS/DSS) actively monitor safety-critical problems, and the data quality 
monitoring (DQM) system mitigates data loss by identifying and diagnosing physics data problems. The existing 
monitoring systems need to incorporate a wide range of monitoring variables and adapt to the evolving conditions of 
the detectors.This dissertation focuses on the development of unsupervised anomaly detection (AD), anomaly 
prediction (AP), and root-cause analysis (RCA) on multivariate time series data sets. We have developed deep learning 
models for frontend electronics of the Hadron Calorimeter (HCAL) of the CMS detector using diagnostic sensors and 
high-dimensional particle acquisition channel-monitoring data sets. The research has enhanced deep learning 
advancement and tackled the challenges of monitoring complex systems with thousands of sensors through a divide-
and-conquer approach and modeling involving temporal, multivariate, explainable, adaptive, online real-time, and 
causal graph discovery methods. Our scientific contribution in tackling the challenges for complex system 
monitoring consists of the following: 1) enhancing multivariate sensor AD; 2) a promising AP approach; 3) context-
aware high-dimensional spatio-temporal AD; 4) transfer learning on multi-network deep learning models; 5)

Abstract 
This study focuses on designing an efficient layout for the operating room department at Wang-Noi Hospital. Given 
the hospital's strategic role as a Node Trauma Center and the increasing demand for surgical procedures, an optimized 
layout is critical to enhance patient care and operational efficiency. The research adopts a mixed-method approach, 
collecting data from fieldwork and documentation. The initial phase involves gathering requirements through 
interviews, assessing the existing space and layout, and proposing three alternative designs. These layouts are then 
simulated to evaluate key performance indicators such as workload, lead time, surgical case throughput, and patient 
waiting time. The final phase assesses the recommended layout's impact through user satisfaction surveys and 
evaluates physical and biological environmental standards. Simulation results highlight workflow and resource 
utilization improvements, demonstrating significant potential for reduced waiting times and increased operational 
capacity. This research provides a practical framework for optimizing hospital operating room layouts, aligning with 
healthcare standards, and enhancing overall service quality.

1. Introduction
Wong-noi Hospital is a small primary care hospital that has continuously developed its capacity to align with public 
health policies. These developments focus on improving both personnel and facilities. Currently, the hospital employs 
one orthopedic surgeon, one anesthesiologist, three operating room nurses, one anesthetist nurse, two nurse assistants, 
and one general service staff. The hospital also engages in ongoing collaboration by sending operating room nurses to 
train at Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Hospital to enhance their skills. Additionally, a collaborative healthcare approach 
has been adopted at the district level by integrating a referral system to provide comprehensive care. The aim is for 
Wong-noi Hospital to handle uncomplicated orthopedic surgeries without the need for referrals to Phra Nakhon Si 
Ayutthaya Regional Hospital. This initiative helps to reduce overcrowding at the regional hospital, decrease patient 
wait times, and reduce rates of death and disability from accidents. 
Regarding infrastructure, Wong-noi Hospital plans to construct three standard operating rooms, which are projected 
to be completed by the year 2025. Currently, there is an urgent need for two operating rooms (in compliance with the 
standards for a 60-bed hospital) to enhance the hospital's capabilities. Therefore, the Provincial Public Health Office 
of Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya has suggested establishing temporary operating rooms by modifying the existing service 
areas into an operating department.

5. Conclusion 
This study aimed to design an effective operating room layout for Wang Noi Hospital to address the growing need for 
orthopedic surgeries without relying heavily on external referrals. The project utilized Systematic Layout Planning 
(SLP) and simulations with Flexsim Healthcare to create and evaluate three layout alternatives for the temporary 
operating room. 
 
Results indicated that Layout Alternatives A and c had comparable efficiency, with both reducing unnecessary travel 
and workflow delays. However, Layout Alternative A was recommended due to practical constraints, such as limited 
staff availability, structural considerations, and budgetary restrictions. The proposed Layout met performance 
standards without requiring significant engineering modifications, thus ensuring efficient use of resources. 
 
The post-occupancy evaluations, conducted one month after the Layout's implementation, demonstrated that 
environmental conditions, including temperature, humidity, and air pressure, met WHO standards. Additionally, no 
pathogen growth was detected, confirming good air quality in the operating room. User satisfaction was also high, 
with an overall satisfaction level of 88.88% for Layout a, highlighting the Layout's suitability for efficient and safe 
operations. 
 
In conclusion, Layout A provides an effective solution for Wang-Noi Hospital's needs, optimizing the operating room's 
workflow and complying with healthcare standards without the need for significant infrastructural changes. This 
approach enhances operational efficiency and contributes to the safety and satisfaction of staff and patients.

Abstract 
The Fourth Industrial Revolution has transformed production processes, primarily through the integration of the 
Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), enabling real-time data exchange across the value chain. While large corporations 
often lead this transformation, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), especially in the mechanical engineering 
sector, face challenges in adopting IIoT due to limited resources and compatibility issues. This empirical study 
investigates the current state of IIoT adoption within SMEs in Germany in this sector, employing a mixed-methods 
approach that combines a systematic literature review with quantitative and qualitative data from surveys and expert 
interviews. Our research focuses on five core areas: implementation levels, driving forces, digital infrastructure 
readiness, potential benefits and challenges, and recommended measures. The findings reveal low IIoT adoption rates 
among SMEs, driven by internal motivators and hindered by factors such as insufficient digital infrastructure, lack of 
standardized interfaces, and complex bureaucratic barriers. The study highlights the potential of IIoT to enhance 
transparency and efficiency but underscores the need for targeted support to overcome adoption barriers. 
Recommendations include standardizing IIoT frameworks, improving access to funding, and fostering innovation. 
This study provides a nuanced understanding of the unique challenges SMEs face in implementing IIoT and offers 
actionable insights for stakeholders aiming to facilitate IIoT integration in this sector.

6. Conclusion 
This paper highlights the current state and challenges of implementing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solutions 
in SME´s in Germany. Despite its potential, the implementation level remains very low due to limited investment in 
IIoT-related research and development, driven by an imbalanced cost-benefit ratio. Internally, top management, IT, 
and sales teams act as key supporters, while external drivers are shaped by market trends, profitability, and availability. 
However, a significant obstacle lies in the digital infrastructure, where the abundance of diverse IIoT solutions leads 
to compatibility and integration challenges. IIoT offers promising opportunities, such as cost reduction and enhanced 
transparency in customer relationships, but it also faces various challenges. These include a lack of collaboration on 
the shopfloor, organizational hurdles like demographic changes and knowledge gaps, and difficulties in selecting 
suitable IIoT platform providers. To address these issues, several measures are recommended, including political 
support through simplified funding models, organizational initiatives like fostering innovation circles and training 
employees, and technological advancements focusing on the standardization of interfaces. In conclusion, unlocking 
the potential of IIoT requires coordinated efforts across political, organizational, and technological domains to 
overcome existing barriers and drive adoption.

Abstract 
Improving supply chain performance is crucial as it enhances responsiveness, adaptability, and efficiency of 
businesses in today’s unpredictable markets. Despite the amount of research, little effort has been made to categorize 
and summarize factors affecting supply chain performance. In addition, few studies developed system dynamics 
models revealing the interrelationships between information technology and other factors influencing supply chain 
performance. In this paper, two objectives are fulfilled. Firstly, several factors affecting supply chain performance are 
reviewed and categorized according to their definitions. Secondly, the interconnections between investment in 
information technology and various factors impacting general supply chain performance are examined through system 
thinking approach. An integrated causal loop diagram is developed to comprehend the relationships among numerous 
factors affecting supply chain performance. It encompasses five feedback loops which are related to different aspects 
of supply chain including customers, organization management, suppliers, and costs. The research revealed sixty-eight 
factors affecting supply chain performance from the reviewed literature. Based on developed loops, it was concluded 
that investment in information technology directly influences customer, employee, and supplier information sharing 
levels, and latency in real-time information. Furthermore, the key drivers to enhancing supply chain performance, 
beside information technology, are related to customer satisfaction and loyalty, brand value and competitiveness, real-
time information sharing, and inventory stockouts risks.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Supply chains are considered the backbone of modern industries, as it connects retailers, manufacturers, and suppliers
to effectively manufacture and deliver goods to end customers (Zouaghi et al. 2021). Effective management of supply
chain faces numerous challenges such as demand volatility, supplier relationships, data sharing, and delays. Those
challenges may have a negative impact on supply chain performance, which can lead to decreased customer
satisfaction, increased costs, and inefficiencies. Addressing these challenges needs innovative strategies and
approaches for improving coordination and decision-making throughout the whole supply chain, thereby enhancing

performance are related to customer satisfaction and loyalty, brand value and competitiveness, real-time information 
sharing, and stockout risks.  
 
The findings of this study could help practitioners and researchers in developing frameworks using identified factors 
as benchmarks to improve overall supply chain performance. In addition to exploring different factors and their 
interrelationships with other factors affecting supply chain performance, that have not been mentioned before in 
previous studies. Moreover, researchers can utilize the findings of this study as a basis for conducting quantitative 
research using surveys and questionnaires to investigate the results of this study. 
 
Despite the potential contribution to supply chain performance field, this study has some limitations. The used 
keywords and databases for collecting studies may have led to omission of relevant studies. In addition, the 
interrelationships between information technology and other factors related to different supply chain aspects not 
included in this study could be examined. Future research could address these limitations. Furthermore, the developed 
loops could be simulated using system dynamics, by creating stock and flow diagrams, to show a detailed analysis of 
behavior and interaction of different factors over time.

Abstract 
The use of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing the face of industrial automation 
through the use of predictive analysis and data analysis. The following paper proposes a new approach that 
integrates IoT and AI to improve prediction and control and improve the performance of industries. Some of the 
insights that have been established from the study are the design of a flexible architecture that can support the 
integration of the real-time IoT data with the AI analytics to support decision making. Our framework uses IoT 
sensors to gather large amounts of operational data that are analyzed using machine learning algorithms to 
identify possible system failures and inefficiencies. Through the use of predictive maintenance, which is 
informed by AI, industrial systems are able to reduce on the downtimes and increase on the production. To assess 
the efficiency of the proposed framework, we performed numerous tests in a realistically modeled industrial 
setting. Studies show that our model boosts decision-making precision by 25% and cuts system failure by 30% 
as opposed to conventional rule-based systems. Furthermore, the AI algorithms used in the framework were 
generally applicable across the industrial domains and hence the ability of the framework can be applied across 
different industries such as manufacturing and energy management. This work shows that IoT and AI integration 
in industry has the capability to enhance the industrial automation and can help to achieve a significant 
enhancement in the areas of predictive maintenance, operation, and decision making. Future work will involve 
the fine-tuning of the model for practical use, the investigation of new machine learning algorithms for higher 
accuracy of the prediction and the expansion of the framework to cover additional large-scale industrial systems.

1. Introduction
The combined use of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a notable innovation 
especially in the industrial processes (Rani et al. 2024; Subbiah et al. 2024).  IoT sensors provide the data that 
industries can use, and with the help of AI, they can make proper decisions that will help them improve efficiency, 
minimize downtime and support the use of predictive maintenance (Farouk et al. 2024; Jide-Jegede and Omotesho 
2024; Chakravarthi et al. 2024). However, although the advantages of IoT and AI integration are quite obvious, there 
are certain issues concerning the actual integration and optimization of such systems (Rafiq et al. 2024; Li et al. 2024; 
Kumar et al. 2024).  
The integration of IoT and AI has been discussed in different areas including home automation, condition monitoring, 
and industrial applications (Jamil et al. 2024; Attique et al. 2024; Alghuried et al., 2024; Singh and Khan 2024). For

Previous studies utilizing standard LSTM or GRU models, like those by Singh and Khan (2024), achieved downtime 
reductions of up to 25% with a focus on predictive maintenance in the energy sector. However, the PIAF framework, 
with its integration of edge computing for real-time decision-making, outperformed these approaches by reducing 
downtime by an additional 5% and achieving faster response times (100 ms compared to 200 ms in similar studies). 
The enhanced architecture of the proposed model, particularly its edge computing component, contributed to these 
superior results. 
 
Hybrid AI-IoT Approaches: 
Hybrid frameworks integrating AI with IoT, such as the system presented by Attique et al. (2024), reported 20-28% 
downtime reduction in industrial applications. Although these approaches showed promising results, they often lacked 
real-time processing capabilities and suffered from latency issues. The use of edge computing in PIAF addressed this 
gap, reducing latency and enabling real-time predictive maintenance, leading to better overall performance metrics. 
Table 5 shows the Summary of Comparative Analysis.

The proposed framework outperformed similar studies by achieving higher reductions in downtime and cost savings, 
primarily due to its advanced LSTM architecture and the incorporation of edge computing for real-time processing. 
This highlights the potential of the PIAF framework to set a new benchmark in predictive maintenance for industrial 
automation. 
 
4. Conclusions 
In this work, we developed and assessed an LSTM-based predictive analytics framework for enhancing decision-
making for industrial automation systems. In the case of using IoT data with AI-driven predictive models, some 
advantages were observed in both, the ability to predict and the system performance. After a large number of 
experiments, LSTM model beat the benchmarks like Rule based system, Decision tree, Random Forest in terms of 
precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy etc. In particular, the LSTM model provided the accuracy of 97. 5%, precision of 
95. 3%, recall of 93. This was followed by a precision of 95%, recall of 94% and an F1-score of 2%. 2 percent, so it 
can be considered as a very effective instrument for the predictive maintenance in industrial conditions. The 
comparative analysis showed that the traditional approaches were unable to handle long-term dependency in time 
series data which is very much essential in the industrial systems. The LSTM model was able to have a better 
performance in terms of time and accuracy when it comes to predicting system failures because of the memory units 
that is inherent to the model. This capability led to better operation efficiency with a decrease of downtime with 30% 
compared to 15% in conventional methods. The LSTM framework also resulted in significant improvement in the 
reduction of maintenance cost, which was cut by 25%. 4%, as well as response time that was enhanced from 250ms 
to 100ms proving the usefulness of real-time decision making. Furthermore, the LSTM model has been tested for 
various industrial applications and the generalization between the training and testing datasets suggest that it has the 
potential of being implemented in other fields. The proposed framework has a significant amount of operational 
advantages in that it decreases the probability of system failures and consequently decreases the costs of potential 
system downtimes; especially in industries where predictive maintenance is crucial for maintaining constant 
operations and cost effectiveness.

Abstract 
With the evolution of global production through Industry 4.0, the incorporation of digital technology into quality 
management systems, referred to as Quality 4.0, has become crucial for improving competitiveness. However, 
research on Quality 4.0 implementation in developing countries, particularly in Indonesia, remains limited. This study 
conducts an exploratory investigation of global trends in Quality 4.0 by analyzing 50 academic papers, identifying 
key themes such as the use of AI, IoT, and big data in quality control. The results highlight a significant gap in research 
related to developing economies, including Indonesia, where unique challenges like limited digital infrastructure, 
workforce skills, and financial constraints hinder the adoption of Quality 4.0. Based on these findings, this paper 
proposes a research agenda and conceptual framework tailored to the specific needs of Indonesian manufacturing 
firms, focusing on improving technological readiness, upskilling the workforce, and fostering government support to 
facilitate the transition to Quality 4.0.

1. Introduction
The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, is revolutionizing the global manufacturing sector via the integration 
of technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and the Internet of Things (IoT) (George, 
2024). These technologies are transforming quality management processes via Quality 4.0, utilizing real-time data 
analysis and predictive analytics to improve operational excellence (Fadilasari et al., 2024) . Although Quality 4.0 is 
becoming recognized worldwide, its implementation in developing economies like Indonesia is yet little examined. 
Quality 4.0 denotes the integration of modern technological advances with traditional quality methodologies. This 
integration enables firms to enhance efficiency and foster creativity, ultimately attaining superior optimization levels 
(Javaid et al., 2021). The development of artificial intelligence, mobile technology, and transactions has created new 
avenues for collaboration (Escobar et al., 2021). Quality 4.0 represents the digital evolution of total quality management 
(TQM) and its effects on individuals, processes, and technology (Escobar et al., 2024).

Abstract 
Recent years have been the start of research regarding the topic of Industry 5.0. One of the first fields that have been 
researched regarding this topic was the human factor since this next industrial revolution has its focus on human-
centred production. Due to that, the vision of the so-called Operator 5.0 was mentioned. Similar to its predecessor, the 
Operator 4.0, this vision contains some skills that are helpful during this revolution. Thus, the ongoing demographic 
trend of the aging workforce leads to some alternations in the average operators’ skills as well. The theoretical 
background elaborates fundamentals of the Operator 4.0 as well as the Operator 5.0 and already known findings for 
the skills of the aging workforce. This method shows an exploratory research of the required skills for the Operator 
5.0. A combined research question including the demographic trend will be defined in order to compare the results. 
The databases of Scopus, Science Direct, IEEE and Web of Science have been screened and the mentioned skills have 
been grouped. The qualitative results show synergies regarding resilience as well as conflicts regarding technology 
affinity as well as some uncertainties regarding other skills. Further, a comparison to the characteristics of the Operator 
4.0 as well as an outlook for future research is given.

1. Introduction
Dealing with an ageing workforce has become a major challenge for industrial companies since this demographic 
change is a long-lasting trend. On the one hand, it brings certain issues to different professions of a manufacturing 
plant, such as pro-duction management, industrial engineering or logistics. On the other hand, it cannot be said that 
this only leads to disadvantages, and it has no benefits having a higher average age across the shop floor associates.

Abstract 
Plastic waste is generally not properly sorted, collected and treated by local government due to lack of working 
facilities and financial constraints in the Philippines.  As a circular economy strategy, reusable packaging has the 
potential to reduce the environmental impacts of plastic packaging.  The purpose of this study is to determine the 
factors to establish the environmental value propositions (EVPs) of the current reusable PET packaging offering of a 
manufacturing company and their level of attainment in terms of circular economy principles.  The study also aims to 
recommend a framework to facilitate the evaluation of the EVPs of various packaging materials in the Philippines. 
The significant factors which were determined through an environmental impact assessment and were based on the 
environmental pillar of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 6, 9, 14) are the following: Proportion of total water 
resources used, Total Energy and Industry-related GHG emissions over value added, Proportion of terrestrial and 
marine protected areas.  From this, 14 EVPs were determined.  The level of attainment of the company in terms of 
these EVPs were verified through t-test.  The multivariate correlations shows that the company have a significant level 
of attainment in all four circular economy principles. The researcher is recommending the framework which was based 
on the process conducted throughout the study.  This can be used to assess the environmental impact of plastic 
packaging, which can then serve as basis to come up with action plans or programs to minimize the negative impacts 
driven by the result of the assessment.

Abstract 
An analysis of a production process, undertaken as part of a case study, revealed that a company was unable to 
meet its expected production capacity during the assembly process of wheelchairs. A deviation of 53% from the 
current production capacity resulted in a delay in product delivery. This investigation revealed that the company's 
calculation formula was not aligned with the current working condition, leading to extremely imprecise 
estimations of the production capacity and cycle time, due to the variations in the parts needed for each wheelchair 
model. To address this issue, this study centered on the Model A wheelchair, which shared 80% of its components 
with other models, as a benchmark for analyzing the standard assembly time and identifying key parameters. 
Simulation tools were also applied to support improvements, as bottlenecks and imbalances were observed in the 
production line. In this research, ECRS principles were applied to tackle these inefficiencies, resulting in a notable 
increase in production capacity from 35 to 46 wheelchairs per hour, representing an additional 143,000 baht per 
hour in revenue. The cycle time at Workstation 4 was reduced from 100.53 s to 60.41 s, while the production line 
efficiency rose from 64.70% to 107.65%, giving a 42.95% reduction in waste. A comparison between the actual 
system and the simulation indicated a minor difference in production capacity per hour, with a deviation of only 
1.57%, consistent with the initial hypothesis.

1. Introduction
Wheelchairs are essential devices that assist people with disabilities in their daily lives to overcome restrictions 
in challenging environments (Roulstone 1998). They are designed to be easily accessible, but only one in 10 
people who need assistive technology have access to them (WHO 2010). Modern technology has evolved to 
enhance the well-being of people with disabilities. A recent report from the United Nations Children’s Fund 
indicates that approximately 240 million children worldwide live with disabilities, representing one in 10 children

Table 3 compares the percentage relative difference between the real and simulated systems, and shows minimal 
variation in the production capacity per hour, consistent with the initial hypothesis. Hence, production data collected 
from January to September 2023 can reasonably represent the real system, since the simulated times align well with 
the actual conditions. This study highlights the importance of aligning theoretical calculations with actual conditions, 
in order to achieve realistic production goals. Future research may focus on refining these methods for other models 
or making similar improvements to additional processes. 
 
4. Conclusion  
This study analyzed the process of wheelchair assembly, and found that actual production levels were below the 
expected capacity. The company faced a shortfall in production of up to 53%, largely due to a calculation method that 
was not aligned with real-world conditions, leading to inaccurate values for the production capacity and cycle time. 
This issue was attributed to the variations in components used for the different wheelchair models. With a focus on 
Model A, it was found that the initial calculation of 55 wheelchairs per hour was an overestimate, with the actual 
output being 35 units per hour. To address this problem, ECRS principles were applied to reduce bottlenecks and 
inefficiencies in the process, and Excel VBA was used to standardize the time calculations. Moreover, simulation 
techniques were applied to statistically analyze and compare data with real system metrics. A data validation process 
showed a normal distribution with a P-value exceeding 0.05, and performance indicators showed that the percentage 
relative difference (real vs. simulation) had a minimal deviation, aligning with the initial assumptions. A new capacity 
model was developed, resulting in a production capacity of 46 wheelchairs per hour post-line balancing. This 
optimization led to a 31.43% increase in capacity and improved the line efficiency from 64.70% to 107.65%. As a 
result, the company’s income increased from 455,000 baht per hour to 598,000 baht per hour, a gain of 143,000 baht.

Abstract 
In this study, we employed the survey design to examine e-procurement implementation on the performance of small 
and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Ghana. We employed convenience sampling technique to choose a sample of 86 
respondents, including owners, managers and procurement officers. Our findings reveal that e-procurement is 
moderately used in firms, and its usage significantly enhances procurement efficiency, reduces costs, and fosters 
stronger supplier relationships, thereby positively influencing overall firm performance. Nonetheless, inadequate 
information technology (IT) infrastructure, a shortage of skilled personnel, high implementation costs, and security 
issues impede broader adoption. These obstacles demonstrate the necessity for targeted investments in technology and 
training initiatives to facilitate effective implementation. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into 
policymakers and practice within the SME sector.

1. Introduction
Procurement represents a strategic tool for effective and proficient resource management, covering purchases of goods 
and services (Lysons and Farrington 2020; Sarpong et al. 2017). For small and medium enterprises (SMEs)—
businesses with fewer than 250 employees and varying revenue thresholds, typically categorized into small enterprises 
(under 50 employees) and medium enterprises (50 to 250 employees), procurement enables them to acquire essential 
goods and services efficiently, optimize costs, and enhance competitiveness, thereby directly impacting their 
profitability and sustainability. Traditionally operated through manual processes, the dematerialization procurement 
(hereinafter, e-procurement) denotes a ground-breaking management initiative in today’s business community. 
Nevertheless, the adoption of this novel procurement arrangement by private sector companies remains very limited 
due to varied factors (Alomar and De Visscher 2019). E-procurement leverages electronic platforms during the 
procurement process for speed, accuracy, transparency and efficiency. The literature is replete with expected and 
actual benefits that occasion the transition to e-procurement. Additionally, e-procurement enhances the propensity to 
upscale the distribution of tenders, improve procedural transparency, protect the environment and limit corrupt 
practices. 
Like the rest of the world, Ghana has embraced this innovation in the procurement value chain for the abovementioned

security issues, aligning with Davila and Palmer (2014), who identified technology-related risks as major challenges 
to effective e-procurement utilization. Addressing these barriers is essential for successful implementation. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study investigated the extent of adoption and the impact of e-procurement systems on the performance of 
Ghanaian SMEs and discussed the associated challenges. Through an integrated survey, the study established that e-
procurement is partly adopted, significantly enhancing procurement efficiency, cutting costs, improving supplier 
relationships, and raising the firm’s overall performance. However, low levels of IT infrastructure, nonskilled 
personnel, high implementation costs, and perceived security issues stand in the way of broad diffusion. These findings 
emphasize the importance of targeted investment in technology and training in overcoming such barriers. We also 
identify that while e-procurement offers significant potential benefits for SMEs, addressing the challenges identified 
represents a vital opportunity to ensure full exploitation of these benefits. Generally, the study contributes to 
understanding the status of e-procurement in the Ghanaian context. Also, it provides practical insights into how SMEs 
could improve their procurement processes through technological solutions.

Abstract 
This study investigates the relationship between task load and job satisfaction among engineering faculty members in 
Cebu City. Utilizing surveys, interviews, and fuzzy cognitive mapping, the research quantifies task load components—
mental and physical demands, temporal pressures, and frustration levels—and their impact on job satisfaction, 
covering factors such as supervisor, colleague, work environment, job nature, compensation, benefits, and work-life 
balance satisfaction. Key findings include significant variations in task load and job satisfaction across different 
universities and demographic groups. Younger faculty members report higher mental (M=4.3) and temporal demands 
(M=4.1), whereas more experienced faculty face greater performance (M=4.5) and effort demands (M=4.2). Larger 
class sizes correlate with increased mental demand (r=0.62) and frustration (r=0.57). A significant correlation exists 
between student number and temporal demand (r=0.68), as well as faculty load and immediate head satisfaction 
(r=0.65). Fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) reveals bidirectional causal effects, indicating that faculty load and 
immediate head satisfaction significantly influence job satisfaction and physical stress. These insights call for tailored 
interventions to manage task loads and enhance job satisfaction, improving overall faculty well-being and 
performance.

Abstract 
The financial health of major corporations is essential for local and national economic stability. This study investigates 
financial distress among selected large corporations in Cebu City, Philippines, from both microeconomic and 
macroeconomic perspectives. It examines internal issues like operational inefficiencies and governance problems, 
alongside external economic influences, to identify key drivers of financial instability. Using financial metrics from 
the Philippine Stock Exchange (2022), Altman Z-scores were calculated to assess financial health, categorizing firms 
into ""distress"" and ""grey"" zones. Expert interviews helped establish causal relationships between economic factors 
and financial distress, analyzed using Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) to quantify each factor’s impact. The findings 
reveal that companies with poor operational efficiency are at significant risk. Improving Operational Efficiency and 
Cost Structure had the highest potential to reduce distress, with a change level of 25%. Industry-Specific and Global 
Economic Factors were also crucial, affecting distress reduction by 19%. The study recommends enhancing 
operational processes, adopting lean practices, and strengthening governance to build financial resilience. These 
strategies are vital for the long-term stability of Cebu's economic ecosystem.

Abstract 
This study represents mainly a compact literature review aiming at investigating research opportunities/needs in 
context of industrial systems. It explores the connections and integration of Industry 4.0 and Lean Manufacturing with 
the focus on a system view perspective instead of the focus on specific information technologies. Industry 4.0 offers 
a set of advanced technologies that can significantly enhance Lean Manufacturing methodologies, particularly in 
digitalizing Lean tools. By combining these two paradigms, businesses can leverage technological advancements to 
increase operational efficiency. The study focuses on examining the integration of Industry 4.0 and Lean 
Manufacturing, emphasizing the importance of a systematic approach. Lean provides a structured methodology that 
serves as the foundation for applying Industry 4.0 technologies in industrial settings. This research highlights the gaps 
in current research, demonstrating the need for a framework that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Moreover, 
this research focuses on developing an initial framework connecting both paradigms. Developing a further detailed 
framework that addresses the limitations of Industry 4.0 and can be applied in industrial settings would be a subject 
of interest in future research. This work aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of Industry 4.0, Lean 
Manufacturing, and the connections between them.

Digital Operations Management Level considers ERP 4.0 as the required digital Lean tool. The framework, which is 
proposed by (Liutkevičienė et al., 2022), serves as the basis for implementing digitally supported Lean-ERP system 
(ERP 4.0). It is divided into two main phases: setting the strategy and preparing for ERP and Lean capabilities, and 
managing improvement projects, which operates in repeating cycles. Figure 11 illustrates the steps proposed for 
implementing ERP 4.0. In the first step, setting the strategy for Lean and ERP includes identifying the maturity of 
Lean and ERP, aligning efforts with company’s strategic priorities, and planning the improvement initiatives. The 
second stage involves determining Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and targets for the improvement initiatives to 
monitor the progress. Then, executing digital ERP system requires training the employees, automating the repetitive 
tasks, and integrating operations. Finally, ERP capabilities are sustained and enhanced through repetitive cycles which 
involve monitoring performance and making adjustments if needed.

5. Conclusion 
In conclusion, this study focused on examining I4.0 and LM, and the shared connections between them. Moreover, 
the current research gaps were highlighted, representing challenges in both paradigms that should be addressed 
through further including case studies and the practical implementation of solutions. These gaps were grouped based 
on the relevance of the gap to I4.0 digital technologies or Lean digitalization, particularly in relation to Lean tools. 
Afterwards, a literature review was conducted, leading to developing and introducing an initial framework combining 
both paradigms and exploiting their strengths.

Abstract 
Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) are disorders of muscles, bones, joints, cartilage, tendons, and 
ligaments. These disorders are caused by overexertion, excessive load, vibration, etc. These factors lead to excessive 
muscle fatigue accumulation, hence WMSDs. Appropriate work design is needed to minimize or prevent these risks 
and provide sufficient rest periods to avoid muscle fatigue accumulation. While previous studies have shown that 
various tasks and industry activities lead to muscle fatigue, there is a notable gap in studies on the effect of rest 
intervals on muscle fatigue recovery time. Frequent rest breaks allow workers to recover and reduce the risk of 
WMSDs due to fatigue accumulation. However, taking overly extended breaks will most likely result in work 
disruption and loss of workers' performance. Accurate appropriation of rest intervals will solve this problem of muscle 
fatigue accumulation. This study developed a mathematical model to predict the muscle fatigue recovery time for a 
manual material handling (MMH) task using task characteristics – weight, duration, distance, frequency, and angle of 
lift – and drilling operation using drilling parameters – feed force, duration, drill bit diameter, and material hardness. 
The results show that the weight (p=0.0024) and duration (p=0.0131) significantly impacted the recovery time for the 
MMH task, while the feed force (p=<.0001), duration (p<.0001), and material hardness (p=0.0052), affected the 
drilling operation. The ANOVA show no significant difference between the actual and model-generated results for 
both studies. This study may be used for work design during MMH tasks and drilling operations to ensure muscle 
fatigue recovery.

Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic exposed significant weaknesses in global food systems, with urban centers like Metro 
Manila being particularly vulnerable to food supply disruptions. These challenges highlighted the urgent need for 
sustainable and resilient food production strategies. Urban agriculture has emerged as a potential solution to mitigate 
food insecurity in densely populated areas, providing a means to enhance food availability, reduce environmental 
impact, and support local economies. 
In Metro Manila, the expansion of urban agriculture has been driven by deteriorating economic and environmental 
conditions, prompting residents to turn to urban farming as a means of improving food security and livelihoods. 
However, sustainable urban agriculture requires effective technology management to optimize productivity, reduce 
costs, and minimize environmental impacts. This study explores the current state of technology management in urban 
farming within selected cities in the National Capital Region (NCR), focusing on the development of a sustainable 
technology management framework. 
The research aims to evaluate existing practices in urban agriculture, identify challenges, and propose a framework 
that integrates innovative technologies, such as hydroponics, aquaponics, and vertical farming. By addressing key

Abstract 
The fast fashion industry has surged in popularity due to the affordability and accessibility of trendy apparel, especially 
in the Philippines. This study investigates the factors influencing Filipino consumers' purchase intentions towards fast 
fashion, despite their awareness of ethical concerns related to environmental and labor practices. Using an extended 
Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model, this research explores the impact of social (Social Norms, Trends, Social 
Media, Social Status) and cognitive (Self-Perception, Impulse, Pleasure) factors on purchase intentions, with 
Awareness added as a construct. Data were gathered through a self-administered questionnaire completed by 580 
respondents, and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Results indicate that factors like Social Norms, 
Trends, Social Status, Self-Perception, Impulse, and Pleasure significantly influence purchase intentions indirectly, 
while Social Media and Awareness show no significant effect. This study provides insights for fast fashion companies, 
policymakers, and researchers aiming to understand consumer behaviors and develop strategies addressing the ethical 
challenges in fast fashion.

Abstract 
This study examines the effects of mismatched teaching and learning styles in an engineering education context, 
focusing on student coping strategies. Utilizing Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory as a framework, the research 
explores how engineering students at Adamson University adapt to discrepancies between their preferred learning 
styles and their professors' teaching approaches, particularly in Physics courses. A mixed-methods approach involved 
assessing 255 students' learning preferences via the Perceptual Learning Style Preference Questionnaire (PLSPQ) and 
comparing these to professors' teaching styles using the Perceptual Teaching Style Preference Questionnaire (PTSPQ). 
Findings indicate that mismatched students in lecture-based settings are more likely to struggle academically, with 
higher failure rates on quizzes, whereas laboratory-based collaborative environments appear to mitigate these effects. 
Key coping strategies identified among students include time management, technology use, peer support, and seeking 
guidance from instructors. This study underscores the need for adaptive teaching practices in engineering education 
to accommodate diverse learning styles and enhance student performance.

Abstract 
Research in the aviation sector has linked variation in national culture profiles to diverse incident rates and contributing 
factors across countries. While research has examined cultural differences globally, fewer studies focus on identifying 
specific behavioural indicators of how national culture might negatively influence aviation incidents. This study aimed 
to identify the key cultural dimensions contributing to aviation incidents and develop an index of observable 
behaviours reflecting these cultural factors that could be used to support aviation incident analysis. Findings from a 
systematic literature review on the influence of national culture on aviation safety, and interviews with 16 experienced 
aviation incident investigators from Indonesia and Australia, along with Hofstede’s Culture Dimensions were used to 
inform the development of the national culture index. The resulting national culture taxonomy includes nine key 
cultural indicators across three dimensions: Power Distance, Collectivism, and Uncertainty Avoidance, with 
corresponding behavioural examples for both general and aviation contexts. User testing with 30 postgraduate students 
revealed the taxonomy effectively helped participants identify national culture factors in incident reports. Usability 
results indicated that participants found the taxonomy user-friendly and were confident in using it for the analysis 
task. The unique element of the study lies in providing aviation incident investigators with a clear set of behavioural 
markers to promote culturally sensitive safety analyses and potentially develop culture-specific interventions. The 
research also has the potential to inform future studies on the impact of national culture on human behaviour across 
other transportation modes and industrial sectors.

Abstract 
Manufacturer’s encroachment and retailer’s reselling strategies are prevalent in the contemporary global supply chain 
operations.  In this backdrop, the simultaneous or sequential decision-making of the supply chain members can play 
an instrumental role in their pricing decisions and profitability. This issue motivates us to develop a game-theoretic 
model for a dyadic supply chain comprising one manufacturer and one retailer, where the manufacturer adopts an 
encroachment strategy, i.e., selling product through its direct channel apart from the other retailer’s outlet and the 
retailer follows a reselling strategy, i.e., setting a markup over the manufacturer’s wholesale price of the product and 
selling it to the market. Here, we consider the quantity competition between the manufacturer and the retailer. Using 
a game-theoretic approach, we investigate how the supply chain members’ simultaneous and sequential decision-
making impact the optimal supply chain members’ quantity decisions and profitability, along with the consumer 
surplus. The comparative analyses signify that sequential decision-making leads to higher supply chain members’ 
profits and consumer surplus than simultaneous decision-making.  
Keywords 
Game theory, Encroachment, Simultaneous decision-making, sequential decision-making. 
1. Introduction
1.1 Background and motivation
In the last two decades, e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, etc., have transformed the supply chain
operations. Many of the product manufacturers, who earlier used to sell their products through their own channels, are
currently selling their products through these e-commerce platforms. The e-commerce-platforms follow reselling and
agency strategies for collaborating with these manufacturers. Also, the manufacturers often sell their products through
other retail outlets. Reselling strategies can be defined as setting a markup over the product’s wholesale price set by
the manufacturer and selling it to the market. The e-commerce platform charges a fraction of manufacturer’s revenue
as a commission under the agency model. Further, there are several examples of organizations selling their products
through both their own outlets and other retailers’ outlets. For instance, electronic tech giants such as Apple, Dell,
etc., deliver their products to customers through their own channels and others’ outlets (Huang et al., 2018). This
operation can be defined as the manufacturer’s encroachment. In this context, as the manufacturer engages in either
price or quantity competitions with the retailer or e-commerce platform, the timing of their decision becomes crucial,
i.e., whether they should devise their pricing or quantity decision simultaneously with the retailer or e-tailer or they
should take first mover’s or late entrant’s advantage through sequential decision-making. In the context of the digital
goods market, the simultaneous move of Amazon Prime and Netflix in the Indian market and their sequential decision-
making in Germany signify this phenomenon (Adhikari et al., 2022)

6. Conclusion  
In the contemporary global supply chain operations, manufacturer encroachment become prevalent. In this backdrop, 
the simultaneous or sequential decision-making of the supply chain members can add more complexity. Motivated by 
this issue, here we develop a game-theoretic model for a dyadic supply chain comprising one manufacturer and one 
retailer, where the manufacturer sells the product through the retailer as well as direct channel. Here, the manufacturer 
is involved in a quantity competition with the retailer. We consider the supply chain members’ simultaneous and 
sequential decision-making and compute the optimal solutions of supply chain members’ prices, quantity, and profits, 
along with the consumer surplus. Our comparative studies reveal that sequential decision-making yields more 
profitability for the supply chain members and consumer surplus than simultaneous decision-making. From the 
perspective of future research avenues, the same modeling framework can be extended to retailer’s agency strategy. 
Also, considering demand uncertainty, information asymmetry, supply chain members’ fairness concerns, etc., in 
model formulation can bring forth practical implications.

Abstract 
 
This study focuses on improving the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) in the packaging process of cattle feed at 
an animal feed production facility. The primary objective was to analyze the causes of speed losses in the process and 
identify key factors affecting machine efficiency. OEE data, comprising Availability, Performance, and Quality 
metrics, were collected and analyzed using Pareto diagrams, fishbone diagrams, and Why-Why analysis. The findings 
revealed that frequent machine stoppages, caused by feed sacks getting stuck during conveying, were the main factors 
reducing efficiency. This research implemented an improvement by adding an inner plastic layer to the sacks, 
increasing their thickness from 6.7 millimeters to 9.7 millimeters. This modification significantly reduced the 
incidence of sack blockages, leading to fewer stoppages and a measurable increase in OEE. 
Keywords 
Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), root cause analysis, machine performance improvement
1. Introduction
The animal feed production industry operates in a dynamic and competitive market driven by growing consumer 
demand and stringent product quality requirements. Production facilities must continuously enhance their operational 
efficiency, minimize costs, and maintain high-quality output to remain competitive. Within this context, machine 
performance in production processes plays a pivotal role, particularly in the packaging stage, which often acts as a 
bottleneck in ensuring overall productivity. 
Overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) is a key performance metric used to evaluate machinery efficiency in this 
industry. OEE comprises three main components: Availability, Performance, and Quality, each offering insights into 
specific areas of operational effectiveness. However, many facilities face challenges in achieving optimal OEE due to 
frequent machine downtimes, improper settings, or substandard materials (Intanon, 2013; Sitthichai, 2017). These 
inefficiencies hinder production and contribute to increased operational costs and diminished product quality. 
The packaging process in cattle feed production, a critical phase in ensuring timely delivery and product integrity, 
often suffers from suboptimal OEE. Observations in the field have highlighted frequent machine stoppages caused by 
factors such as feed sacks getting stuck during the conveying process. This issue disrupts production flow, reduces 
machine availability, and ultimately impacts production efficiency. Addressing these challenges requires a systematic 
approach to identify root causes and implement targeted improvements to enhance machine performance. 
Previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of structured methodologies in improving OEE. For instance, Intanon 
(2013) utilized root cause analysis tools such as the Pareto diagram and Fishbone Diagram to identify and mitigate 
losses in availability and performance in a plastic production facility. Similarly, Sitthichai (2017) employed Total 
Productive Maintenance (TPM) strategies to enhance machine reliability in a sauce packaging process, resulting in

The improvement involved modifying the bag design to add an inner plastic layer, which increased the bag's thickness 
from 6.7 mm to 9.7 mm. This modification effectively reduced the tendency of bags to curl and jam during transport 
on the conveyor, thereby minimizing downtime and improving machine performance. The comparison graphs 
demonstrate clear improvements in the Availability and Performance Efficiency metrics, major contributors to the 
previously low OEE. 
 
Analysis of Other Issues 
While the primary focus of this study was to reduce downtime caused by feed bags getting stuck, there were several 
other issues, such as pallets not flowing, feed bags falling in the machine, improper attachment of bags, and 
adjustments in the bag stitching machine. Due to time constraints, these issues were not addressed comprehensively 
in this study phase. Therefore, the current improvement effort was limited to addressing the loss of time caused by 
feed bags getting stuck before reaching the packaging station. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The study aimed to improve the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) of animal feed packaging machines by 
increasing the thickness of the feed bags from 6.7 mm to 9.7 mm to reduce issues related to bag jamming. Data 
collected over four months (May to August 2024) showed that initial OEE values were low, 
with Availability at 83%  Performance Efficiency at 84% and an overall OEE of 71%. The root cause analysis, using 
tools like the Pareto chart, Fishbone Diagram, and Why-Why Analysis, identified key factors causing inefficiencies, 
leading to targeted improvements. After implementing these measures, subsequent data collection indicated significant 
progress—Availability increased to 94%, Performance remained consistent to 84% , and OEE improved to 79%, 
representing an overall increase of 8%. The study suggests further research to reduce losses, emphasizes the need for 
detailed data collection by operational employees, and recommends training on productivity improvement for staff to 
sustain these enhancements.

Abstract 
This study examines the mediating role of dynamic capabilities in adopting Industry 4.0 technologies and its impact 
on manufacturers' operational and innovation performance, adopting the micro foundational theoretical perspective of 
dynamic capabilities. Using survey data across multiple countries ranked in the top quartile of the Global 
Manufacturing Risk Index, the proposed model was empirically tested through multivariate analysis methods. The 
findings reveal that I4.0 adoption enhances innovation performance for manufacturers in developed countries and 
improved operational performance for those in developing countries. It is found that dynamic capabilities serve as a 
key mediator in both cases. However, I4.0 adoption does not significantly impact innovation performance in 
developing countries or operational performance in developed countries. The study concludes that manufacturers can 
maximize the benefits of I4.0 investments through a strategic focus on leveraging dynamic capabilities. The outcomes 
vary by economic context, enabling operational excellence in developing countries and driving innovation leadership 
in developed countries.

1. Introduction
In today’s highly competitive manufacturing landscape, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has revolutionized production systems by 
integrating cyber-physical systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and big data analytics. 
This shift has transformed manufacturing from a machine-centric model to a digitally interconnected ecosystem, 
enabling firms to achieve greater agility, efficiency, and innovation (Kumar et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020; Olsen & 
Tomlin, 2020). Prominent industry leaders have embraced I4.0 technologies to drive operational excellence. For 
instance, Siemens’ digital factory leverages robotics and real-time analytics to ensure comprehensive data integration 
across development, production, and supplier networks. Similarly, Bosch Automotive’s Wuxi, China plant uses IoT 
and big data-driven systems to detect bottlenecks in diesel system manufacturing, optimizing production processes. 
Another example is Fast Radius’ Chicago facility, recognized by the World Economic Forum as a top-tier smart 
factory, which has pioneered additive manufacturing capabilities. These cases underscore how I4.0 enables firms to 
enhance their manufacturing intelligence, process automation, and decision-making capabilities. 
However, the adoption of I4.0 requires significant investment, prompting firms to evaluate its tangible benefits before 
implementation. One critical aspect that practitioners and policymakers must assess is whether I4.0 adoption translates 
into improved operational and innovation performance. While firms adopting I4.0 technologies often report enhanced 
efficiency and productivity, the impact on innovation performance remains ambiguous, particularly in different 
economic and technological contexts. Some studies indicate that developed economies benefit from increased R&D

6. Conclusion 
Building on dynamic capabilities (DC) theory, this study examines the role of DC in Industry 4.0 (I4.0) adoption 
across separate samples from developed and developing countries. The findings, derived from direct and mediation 
effect analyses, highlight the critical role of DC in enhancing both operational and innovation performance. 
Furthermore, the results validate the core concepts and assumptions of DC microfoundations in manufacturing 
contexts, emphasizing their importance in fostering the development of smart factories. 
 
The results of mediation analysis highlight the pivotal role of dynamic capability (DC) formation in achieving 
performance outcomes across both developed and developing economies. For instance, in a developing economy, a 
manufacturing firm focused on building DCs might prioritize initiatives such as employee training programs to 
enhance skills in data analysis and technology utilization, thereby equipping the workforce to effectively adapt to the 
changes brought by Industry 4.0.

Abstract 
Supply chain managers consistently face the conundrum of battling the severe and unpredictable impacts of Black 
Swan events in recent decades. These disruptions highlight the limitations of traditional risk management approaches, 
which often fail to address the fat-tail risks inherent in complex systems. This study provides actionable insights to 
help supply chain managers manage disruptions from Black Swan events by adopting a Complexity Science 
perspective. By analysing the dynamics of fat-tail risks in multi-echelon Global Supply Chain Network, this research 
offers a foundational understanding of how these networks behave under extreme conditions. Simulation results reveal 
that the frequency and magnitude of disruptions follow a power-law distribution, signifying their scale-invariance and 
universal nature properties also observed in other complex systems, such as earthquakes and financial markets. 
Building on this foundation, the study derives the scaling exponent, enabling the determination of Expected Maximum 
Risk over future time horizons. The scaling exponent is validated through a case study using real-world data on global 
bankruptcies during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating its practical utility in projecting worst-case disruptions. 
Additionally, a conceptual Vulnerability Index is introduced, guiding supply chain managers in identifying and 
prioritizing critical nodes within the network for targeted risk mitigation. By bridging theoretical insights with 
practical applications, this study presents supply chain managers with an actional insight to mitigate the severe impacts 
of Black Swan events.

1. Introduction
Supply chain managers today face unprecedented challenges in addressing the severe and unpredictable impacts of 
Black Swan events. These rare and catastrophic disruptions, such as the 2011 earthquake in Japan and the 2020 
COVID-19 pandemic have exposed critical vulnerabilities within the global supply network (GSN). Despite their low 
frequency, the high-impact nature of such events has consistently overwhelmed traditional risk management 
frameworks, which rely on assumptions of normality and Gaussian distributions. Fat-tail risks, arising from these 
events, deviate significantly from conventional expectations, as they occur rarely and have a disproportionate impact 
compared to predictions based on normal distributions. 
The GSN operates as a highly interconnected and interdependent system, where disruptions propagate in nonlinear

Abstract 
The effectiveness and efficiency of vacuum cleaners largely depend on the performance of their motors. As the core 
component, a motor's power, durability, and energy consumption directly impact the overall functionality of the 
vacuum cleaner. Selecting the right motor is thus crucial to meeting consumer expectations and maintaining a 
competitive edge in the market. Ranking vacuum cleaner motor alternatives is a complicated multiple criteria decision 
making (MCDM) problem since it involves various potentially competing qualitative and quantitative criteria. In this 
study, a MCDM approach is presented for the assessment of vacuum cleaner motors for a company of electric motors 
in Turkey. Here, first fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) is utilized to determine criteria weights and then, 
fuzzy Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enriching Evaluations II (F-PROMETHEE II) is applied to 
determine the ranking of vacuum cleaner motor alternatives, using these weights. 12 maximization criteria are 
determined with the help of 3 managers/coordinators of the electric motors company acting as decision makers (DMs) 
in the process to assess 4 vacuum cleaner motor alternatives.

1. Introduction
In today's rapidly advancing technological landscape, the efficient performance and sustainability of household 
appliances such as vacuum cleaners are of paramount importance. For Senur Elektrik Motorları San. ve Tic. A.Ş., 
commonly referred to as Senur, a leading electric motors company in Turkey, selecting the best motor alternative to 
meet consumer demands for higher efficiency, lower energy consumption, and greater reliability is crucial. Founded 
in 1962, Senur has significantly advanced the small electrical household appliances sector in Turkey and has been 
instrumental in enhancing the country’s international standing in this industry.  
This study aims to evaluate various vacuum cleaner motor alternatives specifically for Senur, utilizing a fuzzy MCDM 
method, F-AHP-PROMETHEE II. By incorporating fuzzy logic into the MCDM framework, this research addresses 
the inherent uncertainties and subjective judgments involved in the decision-making process. The findings of this 
study will provide valuable insights for Senur, enabling the company to make informed and effective choices in the 
selection of vacuum cleaner motors that align with contemporary demands for performance and sustainability. 
In this research, for assessment of vacuum cleaner motor alternatives, F-AHP and F-PROMETHEE II are combined 
to have both methods’ advantages. F-PROMETHEE II method is easy to apply with stable results (Moradpour  et al. 
2011; Velasquez and Hester 2013; Samanlioglu and Ayağ 2016, 2017, 2020; Burak et al. 2022), however it does not 
provide an instruction to calculate criteria weights. Therefore, a method such as F-AHP is needed to calculate criteria 
weights beforehand. On the other hand, utilizing F-AHP for both assessment of criteria and ranking of alternatives

Afterwards, in F-AHP-PROMETHEE II, DMs evaluate alternatives with respect to each criterion using the linguistic 
terms in Table 2 as seen in Table 5. They are converted to TFNs with the scale in Table 2 and averaging these TFNs 
of 3DMs, the “fuzzy evaluation matrix” 𝐷𝐷
~
 is attained. Defuzzifying 𝐷𝐷
~
 with Eq. (2) and the defuzzified “decision 
matrix” D in Table 6 is attained. “Gaussian criterion” is selected for the criteria and “aggregated preference index 
matrix” for the alternatives is presented in Table 7. Utilizing the “aggregated preference indices”, the “positive, 
negative and net outranking flows” are obtained as in Table 8. Alternatives are ranked with the “net outranking flows” 
and the ranking is also presented in Table 8. As a result, with F-AHP-PROMETHEE II, the ranking of alternatives 
from best to worst is KingClean vacuum motor (A2), Domel vacuum motor (A1), Cinderson vacuum motor (A3), and 
Yongji vacuum Motor (A4). The best alternative is determined as KingClean vacuum motor (A2) since it has the 
highest “net outranking flow”. 
       
  
 
 
  
 
5. Conclusion 
In this paper, F-AHP-PROMETHEE II is applied to assess vacuum cleaner motor alternatives for a electric motors 
company in Turkey, Senur. Initially, criteria importance weights are calculated with F-AHP and next employing these 
weights, F-PROMETHEE II is executed to rank motor alternatives. Presently, in the literature, there is no research 
paper that targets assessment of vacuum cleaner motors with a MCDM method. Employment of fuzzy numbers in F-
AHP-PROMETHEE II mirrors the ambiguity and uncertainty of assessments of DMs and integration of F-AHP and 
F-PROMETHEE II reflects the benefits of both methods. 
 
F-AHP-PROMETHEE II ranking results are presented to the company and suggestions are made towards the best 
vacuum cleaner motor alternative, KingClean Vacuum Motors (A2). As future research, “inner/outer dependence”, 
“feedback”, and “correlation” relations between criteria can be taken into account and FANP and correlated F-AHP 
can be applied and these methods can also be integrated to F-PROMETHEE II for numerous MCDM problems.

Abstract 
This study evaluated the ergonomic analysis and evaluation of nursing stations in a Tertiary-Care Hospital in the 
Philippines, emphasizing lighting levels, noise, temperature, workstation design, and anthropometric measurements. 
A series of ergonomic assessments were conducted across five nursing stations (Obstetrics-Gynecology, Pediatrics, 
Surgical, Coronary, and Medical) utilizing digital light meters, digital sound level meters, digital thermometers, and 
anthropometric measuring devices.The findings recommend essential design improvements for more flexible 
workstations as the evaluation shows that there is nonadherence to ergonomic standards. The lighting was insufficient 
in some areas, with specific areas resulting in 13 lux. The noise levels were too high, reaching 73 to 80 dB, which is 
above the limit set by the WHO. The design of the workstations made it hard to move and feel comfortable from space 
limitations. While the temperature was within the optimum level of 23-25°C, busy areas resulted in temperature 
fluctuations. Additionally, the study found that the furniture in use was not adjustable for different body sizes. Making 
these changes is important to lower the risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), improve the well-being of nurses, 
and boost their efficiency. In general, the study highlights the need for designs that can be customized to create safer 
and more effective healthcare work environments, which will ultimately improve patient care. Consequently, poorly 
designed nurse workstations result in physical and psychological stress, increasing the risk of musculoskeletal 
disorders (MSDs) and lowering job satisfaction, which could ultimately affect healthcare performance.

1. Introduction
Filipino nurses are known to deliver high-quality healthcare services all over the world, with over 300,000 nurses 
scattered across the globe (Valdez et al. 2024). However, their journey in providing quality healthcare has some 
challenges, both physically and mentally. Nurses are frequently susceptible to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) as a 
result of the physical demands of their jobs, their comfort, productivity, and mental health. In the Philippines, research

6. Conclusion 
The ergonomic assessment of nurse stations in this study reveals essential areas for improvement to support nursing 
staff's well-being, efficiency, and safety. Current lighting, noise, temperature control, spatial layout, and furniture 
arrangements at the nurse stations significantly differ from established ergonomic standards. Low lighting in some 
parts of the hospital makes it difficult to perform specific tasks; high noise levels, fluctuating temperatures, lack of 
space, and inadequate furniture design lead to physical stress, reduced work output, and a higher likelihood of MSDs 
among nursing professionals. 
 
Improvements in lighting intensity, noise reduction measures, temperature stability, adjustable furniture, and 
optimized workstation layouts are all recommended to address these issues. These changes would go beyond 
improving the comfort and efficiency of the nurses to benefit patient care by making the nurses' work safer and more 
effective. Hospitals that ergonomically align nurse stations will reduce occupational health risks to workers and 
promote increased job satisfaction among healthcare workers. Ultimately, this commitment to ergonomic 
improvements will help grow a healthy, safe, and productive work culture for staff and patients in the long run.

Abstract 
Advanced technical solutions known as ""smart warehousing systems"" use a variety of automation components to boost 
warehouse efficiency and accuracy. Modern technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning, edge 
computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) have the potential to improve smart warehouse operations by boosting 
output, lowering errors, and boosting efficiency. As the demand for prompt and effective order fulfillment increases, 
businesses are turning to smart warehouse solutions to boost overall efficiency and streamline processes. Due to the 
exponential growth of data generated in modern warehousing processing, cloud-edge-terminal (CET) computing—
which represents a paradigm shift in the way data is processed and managed, particularly in the context of the Internet 
of Things (IoT)—has become the dominant trend for warehousing information technology. In order to maximize 
cloud-edge-terminal computing speed, data compression is essential. In situations where bandwidth is scarce and data 
redundancy is high, edge devices can preprocess data by compressing it before transmission, which not only lowers 
the volume of data transmitted over the network but also improves the effectiveness of data processing in the cloud. 
Particularly in mission-critical applications, the use of sophisticated compression methods can greatly reduce the data 
footprint while guaranteeing the preservation of important information. The main objective of this study is to examine 
the test bed for a smart warehousing system, particularly for e-fulfillment centers, using databases, sensors, 
communication protocols, and generally accessible development platforms. The smart warehousing system's 
information and communication technology (ICT) will be examined, with a focus on areas like computation, data 
transfer, and imaging processing that might profit from data compression. The results have several ramifications: they 
can be used to develop ICT for SMEs using easily accessible technologies, establish a paradigm for future research 
into the smart warehousing system, and enhance ICT performance in general, including data processing and transfer 
in smart warehousing environments.

Abstract 
This study investigates the effect of training period length on the detection accuracy of accounting fraud detection 
models, focusing on Japanese companies. Using data from companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange from 2008 
to 2018, models were constructed using three classification algorithms: logistic regression, random forest, and 
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The training periods were set from 3 to 7 years, and the detection accuracy 
was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), area under the precision-
recall curve (PR-AUC), and Recall@k. The results showed that a 4-year training period yielded the best ROC-AUC 
across all models. However, no clear trend was observed between the training period length and accuracy for the other 
durations. For PR-AUC and Recall@k, all models showed low performance with a 3-year training period. Extending 
the training period to 4-5 years improved performance, whereas further extension to 6-7 years led to a decrease in 
accuracy. The optimal training period varied from model to model: 5 years for logistic regression and XGBoost, and 
4 years for random forest. A key finding of this study is that training periods that are too short provide insufficient 
data for effective learning, whereas training periods that are too long can cause noise from older data, which reduces 
the accuracy. These results underscore the importance of selecting an appropriate training period to improve model 
performance and provide practical insights into the development of accounting fraud detection models.

years, achieving high values of 0.074 at both 5 and 6 years. However, at 7 years, it dropped to a value comparable to 
that observed at 4 years (0.065). 
 
These results indicate that the training period of the model affects the detection accuracy for fraudulent accounting 
samples, with the PR-AUC tending to decrease when the training period is either too short or long. Furthermore, it 
was confirmed that the optimal training period varied depending on the classification model: 5 years for CS-LR, 4 
years for CS-RF, and 5 or 6 years for CS-XGB, which gave the highest PR-AUC values. 
 
Finally, we examined Recall@k. In the context of audit practice, one possible scenario involves using the probability 
of fraud estimated using an accounting fraud detection model to prioritize companies for additional audit planning, 
starting with those with the highest probability of fraudulent accounting. Considering that the proportion of fraudulent 
accounting samples in the dataset used in this study is approximately 1%, Recall@k was calculated by designating the 
top 1% of the samples with the highest fraud probability as the predicted fraudulent accounting firms (k=1%). 
 
First, for CS-LR, Recall@k improved as the training period increased from 3 to 5 years, reaching its maximum value 
(1.78%) at 5 years. However, for training periods of 6 years or more, a decreasing trend in Recall@k was observed. 
For CS-RF, Recall@k was 9.91% with a training period of 3 years but increased to 11.47% with a training period of 
4 years, which was the highest value observed. In contrast, Recall@k decreased for training periods of 5 years or 
more. For CS-XGB, Recall@k improved as the training period increased from 3 to 5 years, peaking at 14.67% with a 
5-year training period. However, for training periods of 6 or 7 years, Recall@k decreased. Based on these results, the 
training period that maximized Recall@k was 5 years for CS-LR, 4 years for CS-RF, and 5 years for CS-XGB, 
indicating that the optimal training period differs depending on the classification model. Furthermore, both shorter 
and longer training periods could lead to a decrease in Recall@k. 
 
Next, we compared Recall@k across the classification models. First, CS-XGB maintained higher Recall@k values 
than the other models for training periods of 5 years or more. Furthermore, CS-XGB achieved the highest Recall@k 
value of 14.67%, outperforming the other classification models and demonstrating the highest detection accuracy for 
fraudulent accounting samples. CS-RF, on the other hand, showed higher Recall@k values than the other models 
when the training period was short (3 to 4 years), suggesting that it could improve the detection accuracy for fraudulent 
accounting samples even with only 3 or 4 years of data available. By contrast, CS-LR had Recall@k values ranging 
from 0.53% to 1.78%, which were lower than those of the other classification models. Moreover, even with optimized 
training periods, its performance improvements remained limited. These results highlight the importance of selecting 
classification models based on the available training period (or sample size). For example, CS-XGB was more 
effective when a longer training period was available, whereas CS-RF was more effective for shorter training periods. 
 
Based on the validation results for the three evaluation metrics, when the training period was too short, the low 
detection accuracy was likely due to insufficient training data, which prevented the model from adequately capturing 
the characteristics of fraudulent accounting samples in the test data (e.g., for CS-XGB, Recall@k was 6.77% at 3 years 
but increased to 14.67% at 5 years). When the training period was too long, the test data were more likely to differ 
from the samples in the training data in certain aspects, leading to inadequate learning of relevant characteristics for 
detecting fraudulent accounting samples and a subsequent decrease in model accuracy (e.g., for CS-RF, Recall@k 
decreased from 11.47% at 4 years to 8.32% at 7 years). These results suggest that maximizing the detection accuracy 
of accounting fraud detection models requires consideration of the available training period and the characteristics of 
the samples in the data. In particular, the finding that the optimal training period varies depending on the classification 
model highlights the importance of selecting appropriate learning models to build accounting fraud detection models. 
 
5. Conclusion 
In this study, we investigated the optimal length of the training period that maximized the detection accuracy of 
accounting fraud detection models using rolling window validation, focusing on companies listed on the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange from 2008 to 2018. The results showed that a 4-year training period produced the best ROC-AUC value. 
However, no specific trends were observed between the length of the training period and the detection accuracy for 
other durations. For PR-AUC and Recall@k, all classification models showed the lowest values when the training 
period was set to 3 years, indicating that detection accuracy may decrease when the training period is too short. In 
contrast, extending the training period improved the PR-AUC and Recall@k for certain lengths, which varied

depending on the classification model. However, when the training period was extended to 6 or 7 years, the detection 
accuracy deteriorated. 
 
This study makes three major contributions to the literature. First, it examines the effect of the training period length 
on the detection accuracy of accounting fraud detection models and demonstrates that the optimal training period 
varies by classification model. This finding provides important guidance for selecting models for auditing practices 
based on the amount of available data. Second, it highlights that detection accuracy decreases when the training period 
is either too short or too long, emphasizing the need to set an appropriate training period to maximize model 
performance. Third, it demonstrates the applicability of rolling window validation, a method that has gained increasing 
attention in recent studies, and underscores the importance of adopting more realistic construction and validation 
methods in accounting fraud detection model research. 
 
However, this study had several limitations. First, in auditing practice, it is conceivable that the constructed detection 
model can be used over multiple years of audits. In this study, a specific training period was set, and the model was 
validated using test data from the immediately following year. However, in practice, if the training data span from 
2018 to 2022, the same model would likely be applied not only to 2023, but also to subsequent years, such as 2024 
and 2025. Second, the duration of the training was limited. The available data spanned only 11 years, from 2008 to 
2018, making it difficult to extend the training period beyond 8 years because of the need for multiple years of test 
data within this timeframe. A longer training period enables the model to learn more diverse characteristics, potentially 
improving the accuracy of accounting fraud detection. However, this aspect was not fully explored in the present 
study. 
 
Future research should address the following two issues. First, further validation is required for extended training 
periods. Previous studies have employed training periods longer than those in this study (e.g., Cecchini et al. 2010; 
Dechow et al. 2011; Bao et al. 2020; Bertomeu et al. 2021), and it is necessary to analyze how the detection accuracy 
for fraudulent accounting samples changes when longer-term training data are utilized. Second, a comparison between 
rolling window and expanding window validation is required. Expanding window validation uses all available data 
for training, which can enhance the diversity of samples in the training data and potentially improve the model's 
detection accuracy compared with rolling window validation, where the training period is fixed.

Abstract 
Business Intelligence (BI) tools are essential in transforming data into actionable insights, aiding decision-making 
processes in SMEs across various industries. The study aims to fill a knowledge gap by examining generational 
differences in BI tool adoption intentions among Filipino decision-makers in SMEs. Specifically, it explores how 
generational differences affect attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control regarding BI tool 
adoption, utilizing the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behavior (DTPB). A total of 111 responses were analyzed in 
the study. A descriptive analysis was conducted to establish a baseline understanding of Filipino decision-makers 
across demographics. PLS-SEM via SmartPLS4 was used to analyze the relationships among constructs. The 
measurement model evaluated reliability and validity using PLSc-SEM Algorithm, while the structural model tested 
the hypothesized relationships using PLSc-SEM Bootstrapping. The PLS-SEM analysis validated eight out of 15 
hypotheses. It was found that generation moderates the relationship between Attitude towards BI Usage and the 
Intention to Adopt BI, but not the relationships involving Subjective Norms and Perceived Behavioral Control. The 
R-squared value for BI adoption intention was 0.887, indicating a significant influence of the independent variables.
Generational direct effects were significant, showing a positive impact on BI adoption intention.

Abstract 
The study investigates the relationship between Emotional Intelligence (EI) and Employee Adaptability (EA) in Retail 
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Cebu, Mandaue, and Lapu-Lapu City, focusing on the mediating role of 
digital workplace transformation (DWT). Emotional intelligence is associated with dimensions such as self-awareness, 
relationship management, self-management, and social awareness. Employee adaptability involves adjusting to 
changing tasks and environments, which can be measured by job performance, skills in conflict resolution, work 
engagement, leadership effectiveness, and work productivity, especially during the rapid digital transformations of 
Industry 5.0. This study included 122 respondents who were selected through purposive sampling. Using PLS-SEM, 
the research analyzes data using a 7-point Likert scale survey assessing EI, EA, and perceptions of DWT. The findings 
highlight several key conclusions. First, there is a significant positive relationship between EI and EA, indicating that 
emotionally intelligent employees are better at adapting to digital workplace changes. Second, EI significantly 
influences the success of DWT, suggesting that emotionally intelligent employees are more proficient in adopting 
digital tools and technologies. Third, effective digital transformation initiatives lead to improved employee 
adaptability. Finally, mediation analysis shows that DWT significantly mediates the relationship between EI and EA. 
The insights support organizational and HR strategies in evaluating digital workplace initiatives and change 
management. By fostering EI and supporting digital transformations, organizations can enhance EA, improving 
overall performance and resilience.

background, have access to the necessary resources to improve their digital skills. The findings from this study 
underscore the importance of considering demographic influences on employee adaptability to DWT. By using the 
demographic insights provided by the study, organizations can make more informed hiring decisions that consider 
potential candidates' likelihood of adapting to digitalization in the workplace. This approach can lead to more effective 
recruitment strategies aimed at building a workforce that is well-equipped to navigate and thrive in a digitally 
transformed environment, SMEs in Cebu Tri-cities can optimize their workforce for digital readiness and cultivate a 
culture of continuous adaptation and innovation in the evolving digital landscape.

Abstract 
The rise of Southeast Asian pop music, particularly P-Pop, has created a dynamic shift in consumer behavior, with 
idolization significantly influencing impulsive purchasing decisions among fans. This study analyzes the impulsive 
buying behaviors of K-pop and P-pop fans from Generation Z in the National Capital Region (NCR). The primary 
objective is to identify the psychological and marketing factors that drive impulsive buying, particularly regarding 
merchandise purchases. Using a quantitative research approach, data was gathered from about 400 respondents 
through a structured questionnaire. The analysis employed Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to examine the 
relationships between idol influence, psychological factors, and marketing strategies. The findings reveal that K-pop 
and P-pop fans exhibit significant impulsive buying behaviors, primarily driven by emotional attachment to idols and 
effective marketing techniques. Notably, K-pop fans showed higher brand loyalty than their P-pop counterparts, 
influenced by social media marketing and community dynamics. The study concludes that emotional connections to 
idols are crucial in driving impulsive purchases, suggesting marketers should focus on strategies that enhance fan 
engagement. For future research, it is recommended to explore the long-term impact of fandom on consumer behavior 
and investigate how cultural differences affect purchasing decisions. Expanding the demographic scope beyond 
Generation Z could provide further insights into the evolving trends in pop culture consumption.

1. Introduction
In the past few years, the surge of pop music from Southeast Asia has attracted international attention. P-pop 
(Philippine Pop) has proved to be a solid alternative to its much older rival, K-pop (Korean Pop). Both music styles 
tempt the audience with attractive melodies and colorful dances and develop jealous emotions from devoted fans who 
employ distinctive engagement methods. This study compares and contrasts the fandom of P-pop and K-pop cultures 
among Generation Z, which is reputed to use digital technology and promulgate trends. 
However, as both markets evolve in a more globalized environment, the impact of sales and consumption of 
merchandise becomes more strategically important in determining cultural relevance and advertising efforts. The

Abstract 
Hydroponic farming has emerged as an efficient and sustainable agricultural method, particularly suitable for urban 
and resource-constrained environments. This study integrates Internet of Things (IoT) technologies with automated 
control systems to optimize the growth of Red Oak lettuce. Key environmental parameters—temperature (maintained 
between 20°C and 30°C), humidity (averaging 52.5%), and nutrient solution pH (kept between 6.6 and 7.2)—were 
precisely controlled using an IoT-enabled system. Experimental results demonstrated a 15% improvement in plant 
yield and a 10% reduction in water and nutrient usage compared to traditional methods. By employing the Nutrient 
Film Technique (NFT) with LED lighting and automated monitoring, the system achieved consistent plant growth and 
resource efficiency. This research underscores the transformative potential of IoT in hydroponic farming, providing a 
scalable solution for modern agriculture.

1. Introduction
Hydroponic farming, a soil-free cultivation method, has gained popularity due to its efficient control over growth 
factors like pests, nutrients, and environmental conditions, reducing chemical use and appealing to health-conscious 
consumers. Achieving optimal yields requires farmers to understand key variables such as pH, electrical conductivity, 
temperature, humidity, and light. Recent studies have advanced hydroponic techniques, covering areas such as 
automated nutrient detection, controlled-environment systems, and consumer responses to pesticide-free crops. The 
Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming hydroponic agriculture by providing real-time environmental monitoring, 
remote management, and data-driven analysis, which enhance efficiency. IoT-enabled systems—such as climate-
controlled greenhouses and wireless sensor networks—help conserve resources, maintain stable conditions, and boost 
productivity. With continuous technological integration, hydroponics presents a promising solution for sustainable, 
precise, and consumer-friendly agriculture in the modern era.

Abstract 
Transport services such as ride-hailing services have recently impacted the urban mobility system in places such as 
Metro Manila creating options for traditional public transportation in heavily populated and traffic areas. This study 
aims to assess the factors that determine the adoption of ride-hailing applications by students of Higher Education 
Institutions in Quezon City integrating the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and the 
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM).  The key factors include perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and 
social influence as having a major influence on students' intention to use such applications. A total of 212 participants’ 
responses were gathered using convenience sampling and analyzed using tools SPSS and AMOS. The results indicate 
respondents' preferences, their experience, and how outside factors affect their ride-hailing decisions. The study 
reveals that perceived privacy, perceived usefulness and ease of use improve students' behavioral intention to use ride-
hailing apps. However, students are influenced by convenience and social influence while making their decisions. The 
study shows the need for ride-hailing firms to adapt service quality and user experience to fit the needs of this group. 
The findings derived from this study offer useful prescriptions for both subsequent research and improved marketing 
communication and service customization for the benefit of student consumers.

1. Introduction
Arguably the biggest disruption to the urban transportation industry in the last ten years has been ride-hailing 
applications. Millions of individuals use online programs on their phones to book personalized trips to locations for a 
range of travel needs in cities all over the world. Southeast Asia is the cradle of ride-hailing applications like Grab, 
Angkas, Joyride, Moveit, and many more in urban transportation. The rise of these services has not only addressed 
gaps in public transportation but also provided commuters with more flexible and efficient alternatives. These 
platforms allow users to bypass traditional barriers such as lengthy queues for taxis or the challenges of navigating 
complex public transportation routes. For countries with heavy traffic congestion, such as the Philippines, ride-hailing 
apps offer timely and convenient solutions.

Abstract 
Mass gatherings(MGs) are crowded events that attract enough people to exceed the capacity of routine health and 
public safety measures. WHO defines MGs as ‘events attended by a sufficient number of people to strain the planning 
and response resources of a community, state or nation. MGs pose serious health risks for attendees, organisers and 
citizens of the venue city. For effective public health management for all the stakeholders engaged in MGs, the role 
of psycho-social factors in managing the health-related behaviour of attendees needs to be investigated. Previous 
research suggests that health risk perception plays a crucial role in shaping individuals’ responses to hygiene, 
sanitation and crowd dynamics. These responses shape health-related behaviour in special reference to infectious 
diseases. This paper explored the general health-related behaviour among the attendees of one of India's largest 
religious mass gatherings held post-COVID outbreak- The Kumbh Mela 2021. It examined the role of shared identity 
among attendees and its impact on health-related behaviour through perceived risk perception within the special 
context of Kumbh Mela. A multivariate analysis of a survey study of attendees of Kumbh Mela (N=400) showed that 
shared social identification leads to better-perceived health and well-being through undermining health risk 
perceptions in mass gatherings. These findings have important implications for understanding how crowd dynamics 
may aggravate health risk behaviours in mass gatherings. The present research should contribute to efforts to 
understand the nature and scope of social identity processes in aggravating and mitigating health behaviour in mass 
gatherings.

Abstract 
This paper proposes a predictive maintenance framework based on Federated Learning to address the challenges of 
data privacy and efficiency in Industry 4.0 manufacturing. The framework employs a combined network called a one-
dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network 
(1DCNN-BiLSTM) model for predictions, enabling cross-client collaborative training without sharing raw data. Using 
the Microsoft Azure Predictive Maintenance dataset, our experimental results demonstrate that Federated Learning 
can achieve 81% prediction accuracy, representing a 27% improvement over individual models. The federated model 
maintains at least 71% prediction performance even with 50% reduced training data or 25% client participation while 
showing excellent generalization ability on unseen data. These results validate the framework's effectiveness in 
balancing data privacy, efficiency, and model performance in real-world applications.

1. Introduction
In the manufacturing industry, predictive maintenance has emerged as a crucial strategy for reducing operational costs 
and enhancing competitive advantage. However, implementing effective predictive maintenance faces significant 
challenges, particularly in data acquisition and privacy protection. The performance of predictive maintenance systems 
heavily depends on large volumes of high-quality historical data, yet individual organizations often struggle with 
limited failure records (Wan, Tang et al. 2016, Budach, Feuerpfeil et al. 2022). While centralized cloud computing 
could address data limitations through cross-firm integration, it raises serious concerns about data security and privacy, 
as equipment data often contains sensitive business information that companies are reluctant to share (Weber, Xu et 
al. 2016). 
This research seeks to establish a predictive maintenance framework that balances data privacy, data volume, and 
model performance. We propose combining federated learning with a supervised fault prediction model called one-
dimensional convolutional neural network (1DCNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network 
(combined as 1DCNN-BiLSTM) to address these challenges (Ahn, Lee et al. 2023). The framework aims to facilitate

6. Conclusion 
The application of federated learning in the smart manufacturing industry has attracted more and more attention. 
Predictive maintenance as an Industry 4.0 development. The core areas are easily limited by the process of 
accumulating data over a long period of time, making it difficult to obtain enough data for effective predictive analysis 
and model building in the early stages. At the same time, equipment maintenance data may contain sensitive business 
information, making companies reluctant to share it with other companies. The federated predictive maintenance 
architecture constructed in this study hopes to use the advantages of federated learning to allow multiple clients to 
collaboratively train models without sharing data to solve data privacy and sharing issues, and benefit from the 
historical experience of other clients to improve model performance. 
 
The results validated the efficacy of the proposed federated learning framework in addressing predictive maintenance 
challenges. Key findings include 1) Federated learning enhances predictive accuracy by integrating insights from 
multiple clients. 2) The federated model maintains high performance even with limited training data per client. 3) The 
federated model is resilient to reductions in client participation during training. 4) The federated model demonstrates 
strong generalization to new, unseen data. Based on these findings, the framework's ability to balance data privacy, 
efficiency, and model performance underscores its suitability for real-world smart manufacturing deployments. 
 
In future work, federated predictive maintenance will not only require continued improvements in predictive model 
performance. It is necessary to consider the communication costs caused by information exchange during the 
aggregation process of the model, and reduce unnecessary information transmission to improve communication 
efficiency. In addition, the collaborative process of federated learning is vulnerable to attacks by malicious participants 
or tampering with information, leading to system paralysis or errors. Therefore, the implementation of strong security 
protection mechanisms such as encryption technology is also one of the important tasks in the future. Through these 
efforts, the practical application value of federated learning can be further enhanced and ensure its widespread 
application in the field of smart manufacturing.

Abstract 
The cooking process consists of various processes, one of which is filtering. The strainer can be used on various solid 
materials such as flour, cocoa powder, sugar, and liquid materials such as oil. The strainer can separate coarse particles 
into finer particles. However, when using a strainer, the user must prepare other tools, comprising a container and 
spoon. This process is time-consuming and inefficient, and none of the recent designs accommodates this issue. To 
deal with these problems, this study aimed to solve them by designing a tool that can combine these various functions 
into a product. To reduce the time for preparing tools, the design intended to combine the functions of the tools needed 
in one product. Multifunctional strainers include the strainer, container, measurement glass, and spoon in one product. 
There is also a removable handle on the strainer that can make it easier for users to filter. The way to use this strainer 
is to open the strainer lid and insert the material to be filtered. The results of the strainer can be stored or measured 
directly using the product. If a spoon is required, the user only needs to take a spoon from the product's lid. By using 
the product, users do not need to perform many inefficient movements and minimize the distance between the tools 
that need to be reached.

The process required to perform screening activities involves the use of hands. The hand dimensions taken as product 
anthropometric data based on the previous are hand length and hand width. In order for the product to be used by 
many people with various hand sizes, the anthropometric data for both dimensions use the 5th percentile for hand 
length and the 95th percentile for hand width. The diameter of the ladle is designed according to the diameter of the 
strainer to ensure optimal fit. In Figure 6, the height of this strainer is 212 mm. This strainer can hold up to 1.48 liters 
of water. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the research conducted, it was found that many users still rely on strainers as an essential kitchen tool. On 
the other hand, the absence of an accurate measuring spoon, a proper container for the material being strained, and a 
sturdy handle often hinders the efficiency of the cooking process. A multifunctional strainer designed to address these 
issues by integrating a built-in measuring spoon, an attachable measuring cup with measurement marks, and a 
removable lid. In addition, this strainer is equipped with a sturdy handle that enhances user comfort and safety. This 
multifunctional strainer not only improves usability by providing accurate measurements, but also optimizes kitchen 
space efficiency by reducing clutter. The design of the strainer container is ergonomically made according to the 
dimensions of the human body, namely the length and width of the hand. The design of the strainer container is 
ergonomically made according to the dimensions of the human body, namely the length and width of the hand. With 
an ergonomic design on the strainer container, users will find it easier to use this strainer. Cost calculations were also 
carried out to determine the feasibility of making this multifunctional sieve.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath have sparked a shift in how Higher Education Institutions approach the 
use of emerging digital tools to enhance student engagement and experiences. Among these tools, virtual reality is 
frequently highlighted in the literature for its potential to significantly improve the student experience. However, 
limited research has explored its effectiveness in teaching operations management, particularly in comparison to 
traditional physical reality methods such as guided site visits. To address this gap, we developed an innovative 
experiment incorporating both ""virtual reality"" and ""physical reality"" sessions aimed at enhancing operations 
management education. The experiment began with testing virtual reality headsets in a classroom setting with MSc 
students in Supply Chain and Logistics Management, focusing on specific scenarios to identify potential technical 
issues. Subsequently, 34 volunteers from the Business Analysis and Consulting MSc program at Strathclyde 
University were recruited for the main study. Our analysis showed that integrating virtual reality and physical reality 
in teaching operations management can significantly enhance the learning experience. However, it is essential to 
address health-related concerns associated with virtual reality to ensure an inclusive classroom environment. 
Additionally, some technical difficulties encountered during the use of virtual reality could impact its seamless 
implementation.

Abstract 
The cement industry is a significant contributor to global carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions. To reduce these emissions, 
the industry is increasingly utilizing municipal solid waste (MSW) and turning it into Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) as 
an alternative fuel source in cement kilns. This initiative not only seeks to reduce the need for traditional fossil fuels 
but also addresses critical waste management challenges. This paper develops a mixed integer programming (MIP) 
model to optimize the cost-benefit ratio associated with processing, transporting, and utilizing MSW as fuel across 
multiple cement plants. The model aims to minimize logistics costs while addressing the complexities of waste 
processing and transportation, offering a systematic approach to decision-making. 
The collaboration with a cement company, which receives urban waste from the government for use as fuel, highlights 
the importance of efficient operations. While the plants have the capacity to process the waste, logistics have 
historically been managed manually. To improve efficiency, a mathematical model was created to minimize both 
logistics costs and CO₂ emissions through deterministic multi-objective optimization.

6. Conclusion 
With increasing concerns about achieving sustainability in highly polluting industries like cement manufacturing, it 
becomes crucial to incorporate these aspects into daily operations. Moreover, implementing semi-automated decision-
making processes is essential for companies with complex operations, as finding optimal solutions without 
optimization tools can be extremely challenging. This is particularly relevant when evaluating economic and 
environmental impacts in scenarios involving numerous variables. 
 
In this study, a mathematical model was developed to address both economic and environmental factors. A significant 
focus was placed on the practical application of the research, analyzing a cement company's operations and its 
integration of circular economy principles by repurposing waste as an alternative fuel. Key findings from the model's 
use and validation include the following: 
- 
The model effectively reduces costs, demonstrating that a well-optimized process with designated software 
could lower operational expenses compared to current practices. This was especially true when RDF plants 
operated at a higher utilization. 
- 
The optimization of the current operation successfully reduces the CO₂ emissions throughout the complete 
process, highlighting the environmental benefits of these practices. 
- 
The model´s results indicate that under current constraints, CO₂ emissions are not highly sensitive to the 
optimization process, so the primary focus should remain on minimizing costs, as this approach has the 
biggest impact.  
- 
Validation results showed that the model’s results were consistent with actual outcomes but with higher 
efficiency. For example, the model’s optimization in transportation and processing capacities led the 
company to reduce the number of trucks required, which translates to significant cost savings and improved 
resource utilization.

Abstract 
Food system is susceptible to disruptions that influence multiple locations within the system where the existence of 
COVID-19 unveiled the system's pain points. Food system is vulnerable to multifaceted uncertainties specifically on 
stress exerting on resources, environment that rendered food system stability in jeopardy. Magnitude of complexity 
involving food products is heightened because of perishability, safety concern and resiliency. Machine breakdown or 
scrap generation in production floors are irreversible, the emphasis of lean manufacturing as an initiative to enhance 
efficiency is staggering in the manufacturing domain. Manufacturing firms demand survivability and error prevention, 
a concept of antifragility showcasing how to prosper from disruption as a strategy. With respect to the VUCA and 
BANI environment, the capacity to absorb and recover to the pre-disruption state is inadequate. With the capability to 
learn and develop further after a disruption fulfil the antifragility feature. Quick reconfiguration of operations and 
agility requires capabilities development to respond to disruption, emergence of resilience characteristics is correlated 
with response capabilities. Capabilities as the determinant of operational performance in a disrupted production floor, 
greater degree of adaptability is required to remain technically viable. Within a disrupted production floor setting, the 
dynamic capabilities driven performance differential. One size fits all strategy appears inadequate to enable the 
capabilities, the production system must be reinvented, reconfigure, revamped to being tiptop in dealing with turbulent

Abstract 
In this era of Industrial Revolution 4.0, adaptation to the IoT is becoming a must to maintain competitiveness in 
logistic operation. SMEs in Malaysia must deal with problems in logistic operations, such as the inability to track the 
location of delivery accurately and monitor racking status. These cause logistical problems that include excessively 
expensive costs from inefficiencies in task management and workflow processes, overstocking, and frequent 
disruptions in the supply chain due to delayed or misplaced items. Therefore, to design a user-friendly, secure, and 
cost-effective IoT system focused on delivery monitoring and racking that could provide SMEs with in-transit real-
time visibility and control of their logistic operations. The provided solution was developed through the exploitation 
of Google's suite of web-based software for its development: Google Sheets to host the database, Google AppSheet to 
provide the functionality for a mobile application, and Looker Studio as a business intelligence tool for visualization

Abstract 
Previously, production management in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) relied on traditional, paper-based check 
sheets, which were labor-intensive and prone to error. This research was conducted to develop the Cost-Effective IoT 
Control System For Digital Check Sheet as a solution to improve production management among Malaysian 
manufacturing sector SMEs in the Industrial Revolution 4.0 era. The integration of the CEICS involves AppSheet for 
mobile applications, Google Sheets as a database platform, and Looker Studio as a business intelligence tool in 
visualizing the implementation results. CEICS replaces the traditional manual documentation processes with a 
digitalized process, real-time tracking, and registration of the item record structure. It also provides an intuitive 
dashboard and mobile app for real-time monitoring, having much higher productivity and accuracy of data. The system 
was implemented and tested with the help of an Malaysian SME. The results comprise reduced manual data errors, 
smoother and faster procedures at work, and efficiency in management. This solution is practical, scalable, and can 
enable SMEs to achieve Industry 4.0 standards in meaningful, desperately needed affordable digital transformation; 
this will be achieved with the power of automation driven by IoT to advance operational effectiveness in the 
competitive manufacturing landscape.

5. Conclusion
The digital check sheet system, using AppSheet, has been good at transforming manual and paper-based processes 
into streamlined and efficient digital workflows. It offers accuracy, adds organization, allows real-time data entry, 
automates transfer of data, and makes printing simple—unlike most of the manual processes with human error that 
steals time. With its versatility, this system is suitable for various industries that are still manual in their operations, 
such as manufacturing, schools, pharmacies, and other sectors needing reliable data tracking and keeping. The benefits 
of the platform can be furthered if the company invests in training the employees on the AppSheet platform and 
customizes it to meet the specific operational needs of the organization. Large-scale data use may also mean 
investments in extra storage or data capacity, just like purchasing more data in Google Sheets, to ensure the system 
works well with increased volumes of data. These will ensure that the organizations step up in productivity, improve 
access to data, and maintain accuracy at high standards, which are quite important in determining success today.

Abstract 
This study presents a framework centered on machine learning and deep neural networks (DNN) designed to develop 
a robust system to detect power theft and electrical anomalies in next-generation telecommunication base stations. 
Using a labelled dataset of non-fraudulent power consumption records with 11 features, this research employed 
supervised machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, and DNN. Comprehensive data 
preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and optimization were carried out to ensure effective 
model performance. The results demonstrated the superiority of the Random Forest model, achieving perfect accuracy 
(100%) and zero root mean squared error (RMSE) across datasets with outliers injected at 25%, 50% and 75%. The 
DNN model achieved comparable performance on cleaner datasets (100% accuracy and 0% RMSE on the 25% outlier 
dataset) but showed reduced robustness as noise levels increased, with accuracy dropping to 83.32% and 75.11% on 
the 50% and 75% outlier datasets, respectively. Logistic regression, while simpler and interpretable, struggled to 
handle datasets with high levels of outliers, achieving 74.92% accuracy on the 75% outlier dataset with an RMSE of 
0.5008. The paper also provides information on the potential of hybrid models and advanced preprocessing techniques 
to enhance future anomaly detection systems.

1. Introduction
The power grid experiences losses broadly categorised into technical and non-technical losses. Technical losses occur 
due to inherent power dissipation in the physical components of the power system, such as internal electrical resistance 
in generators and transformers, as well as through transmission lines and other connecting elements. These losses are 
a natural consequence of electrical resistance and inefficiencies within the system infrastructure (Smith, 2024).

7. Future recommendations  
For future work, several recommendations can enhance the performance and applicability of the models evaluated. 
Hyperparameter tuning should be prioritized, including optimizing parameters like tree depth and the number of 
estimators for Random Forest, as well as learning rates, batch sizes, and network architectures for Deep Neural 
Networks (DNNs). Incorporating explainability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) or LIME (Local 
Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) can help identify the most influential features and build trust in model 
predictions. Clustering techniques such as k-means or DBSCAN can be employed to preprocess datasets, identify 
patterns in outlier distributions, or detect noise, further improving data quality before training. Furthermore, the 
development of hybrid models, such as random forest stacking and DNN, could balance their respective strengths, 
achieving robust performance under diverse conditions. Practical implementation should consider leveraging Random 
Forest for high-stakes tasks requiring robustness while utilizing DNNs for applications that demand generalization on 
complex patterns. Finally, integrating AutoML pipelines for automated hyperparameter tuning and exploring 
advanced outlier detection methods like Isolation Forest or Elliptic Envelope could significantly improve model 
performance and reliability. 
 
8. Conclusions   
 
This paper delves into comparative analysis of logistic regression, random forest, and DNN on datasets with varying 
levels of outliers provided significant insight. This study aims to prototype a highly effective data-driven DNN-based 
approach for early detection of power theft and electrical anomalies in the new generation telecommunications base 
stations. Random Forest emerged as the most reliable model in terms of accuracy across all outlier levels, while DNN 
showed competitive performance with lower RMSE in noisier datasets than logistic regression. Logistic regression, 
being a simpler model, struggled with the complexity introduced by outliers. The study highlights the importance of 
the selection of electrical theft and anomaly detection models based on the characteristics of the dataset, and 
underscores the potential benefits of hybrid models and advanced preprocessing techniques. Future work can focus 
on optimizing these approaches and exploring new methodologies to further enhance model robustness and accuracy.

Abstract
Shipping companies have played a significant role during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. 
However, they face challenges in terms of data visibility and transparency within the complex shipping network. This 
paper conducts a systemic review of the challenges including real-time visibility issues, fragmented data, limited 
information sharing, complex regulations, cybersecurity risks, lack of standardized processes and technologies, and 
trust issues. This paper also details the explored solutions to resolve the challenges and details the trending 
technologies evaluated for adoption. This paper uses the PRISMA technique to explore the challenges and blockchain 
adoption in the supply chain industry. Qualitative content analysis is performed on the collected articles. The paper 
extensively discusses the integration of blockchain technology into current research solutions, encompassing 
conceptual models and real-life case studies. Furthermore, these articles provide insight into the inherent constraints 
of existing frameworks and assist in pinpointing areas that can be addressed through the implementation of the new 
blockchain framework which seems to be missing from the existing literature. This paper will be a valuable input for 
future researchers as it summarized the existing technologies and implementations. Research gaps identified in the 
existing market will be helpful for future research to resolve the industry challenges.

1. Introduction
A supply chain is a system that facilitates the movement of goods and services between a company and its suppliers. 
The global market for supply chain management surpassed a value of US$15.5 billion in 2020 (Statista 2021).  It is 
projected to exceed US$30 billion by 2026 (Statista 2021). It is anticipated to reach US$42 billion by the end of 2027 
(Globe Newswire 2022). Over the last few decades, major companies have restructured their operations to include

5. Conclusion 
On performing a systemic review of the challenges with the shipping supply chain, it is evident that transparency and 
data visibility have been major concerns in the industry. It also exposes the issues with a lack of transparency in the 
shipping supply chain. The existing research papers present gaps like low precision, cost, and compatibility in existing 
frameworks and technologies which results in non-transparency.  
 
Few of the researchers went the extra mile to find various solutions that will help resolve the transparency issue and 
increase data visibility across the transitions of the goods from origin to destination. It is evident that most of the 
findings revolve around utilizing new technology to overcome the associated challenges. Researchers explored 
different technologies like Barcode, NFC, GPS/GIS, WSN, RFID, IoT and Blockchain, and a few of them explored 
the combination of technologies to design a solution for transparency issues. 
 
Blockchain has proven to be a robust and effective framework and has positive characteristics. Hence much of the 
focus was on exploring its potential in this area which benefits the industry in adopting. There are surveys that expose 
the interest rate in adopting the blockchain into the supply chain. Some articles have even conducted thorough analyses 
of various solutions and frameworks which adds more value to Blockchain adoption. Though there are many processes 
to be adopted by the supply chain industry to improve transparency, the industry is still lacking with demonstratable 
or adaptable framework. 
 
It is evident that none of these research papers presented a functional prototype or framework specifically tailored for 
the shipping supply chain in recent years. Considering the complexity of the shipping supply chain, the development 
and implementation of a new technology or framework in the Shipping industry is always problematic and has budget 
constraints. A prototyped application or a framework could help the industry in trailing Blockchain adoption to resolve 
transparency issues.  
 
Understanding that the existing research papers haven’t provided a working prototype, the future work of this research 
naturally shifted towards embracing blockchain adoption as a viable solution and developing a blockchain-based 
application that can be adopted by the Shipping industry. Conducting interviews with industry experts will help gather 
more information that can be used as inputs for framework development or enhancement. Evaluating the developed 
framework could be the future research path to enhance the transparency and visibility of data.

Abstract 
Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs) play a crucial role in national economies and employment worldwide. As these 
businesses rapidly adopt technology and cloud services to stay competitive, they become prime targets for cyber 
criminals. SMBs are particularly more vulnerable to cyber-attacks due to limited awareness and resources for 
implementing cybersecurity measures. This research aims to address these challenges by providing practical guidance 
to SMBs on implementing Cloud Security controls. By focusing on understanding the security responsibilities as 
Cloud Service Consumers and targeting quick wins and easy-to-implement strategies for various aspects of cloud 
security, SMBs can establish a robust security posture and excel in this dynamic environment. The implementation of 
these strategies also facilitates the creation of a baseline for potential future compliance with Service and Organization 
Controls 2 (SOC 2) requirements or adherence to cybersecurity frameworks.

1. Introduction
Small and Medium Businesses (SMBs) are pivotal in driving economic growth globally, and their adoption of 
technology, mainly cloud services, is accelerating. Cloud Computing offers numerous benefits, such as easy 
deployment, flexibility, scalability, and cost savings, making it an attractive option for businesses of all sizes. 
However, with these benefits come new complexities and security challenges. 
According to recent research, the global cloud computing market is projected to reach USD 947.3 billion by 2026, 
underscoring the widespread adoption of cloud services (ThreatModeler 2023). However, alongside this growth, there 
has been an increase in cloud security incidents, with 80% of companies experiencing at least one incident last year 
(Harris 2024). According to the Verizon DBIR report, almost half of all cyberattacks are aimed at small businesses, 
and a staggering 60 percent of those hit end up shutting down within just six months of the attack. The evolving threat 
poses additional risks to SMBs, with cyber adversaries ranging from amateurs to sophisticated nation-state actors 
targeting businesses of all sizes. Recent testimonies before the House Select Committee have highlighted the threat 
posed by cyber actors, particularly those linked to state-sponsored campaigns targeting critical infrastructure and 
supply chain vulnerabilities, including small businesses.  
SMBs encounter significant challenges in implementing cybersecurity. Limited resources, such as smaller budgets 
and fewer IT staff, make it hard to allocate sufficient resources. Additionally, there is often a lack of awareness among 
SMB owners and managers about cybersecurity risks, leading to complacency. The complexity of cyber-security, 
coupled with technical barriers and cost concerns, and shared responsibility for cloud security further complicates 
matters. The absence of formal cybersecurity policies and procedures and limited employee training leaves SMBs

Abstract 
Fast food industries in the Philippines are engaging in a significant transformation as it increasingly 
embraces self-service and modernized service for their customers. These industries are introducing 
technological advancements like self-service kiosks in their service. This study aims to assess the factors that 
contribute to achieving perceived satisfaction of the customers who utilized self-service kiosks in the fast-food 
chains in NCR, Philippines. Additionally, it aims to utilize the Value Based Technology Acceptance Model 
(VBTAM) with added variables such as Customer's Individual Characteristics (CIC), Navigability (N), and 
Time Saving (TS). 386 customers in fast food responded in the online survey which consisted of 63 questions. 
Structural equation modeling (SEM) shows that out of 27 hypotheses, 17 are supported, 10 are not significant, 
and one correlation is added which is Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU). The 
results show that CIC positively influences Functional Value (FV), Emotional Value (EV), and Time Value 
(TV), TS, and N. FV, and EV, positively influences PEOU while TV positively affects both PEOU and PU. PU 
and PEOU positively affect each other. PU and PEOU positively affects Behavioral Intention (BI) which 
subsequently led to Perceived Satisfaction (PS). N positively affects TS, vice-versa which leads to PS. Lastly, 
this study is the first one who utilized VBTAM in analyzing customer’s perceived satisfaction in utilizing self-
service kiosks in the Philippines. For future works, future studies can do comparative analysis to Traditional 
Ordering Methods and Longitudinal Study on Customer Satisfaction using other models like TAM, UTAUT, 
etc.

Abstract 
There are major challenges in accident management in Bisha city, due to the large population growth and safety 
infrastructure, which leads to negative impacts on individuals and communities, including casualties and property 
damage, as well as psychological effects on victims and their families, which contributes to increasing pressure on 
health infrastructure and emergency services, which negatively affects sustainable development and the local 
economy. To address this problem, an intelligent accident management and handling system was proposed based 
on sensor technology and geographic information systems and the result of a survey conducted on a sample of Bisha 
residents. These studies showed that the spatial distribution of traffic accidents shows the presence of high-risk 
areas concentrated in the central region in particular, followed by the southern and western regions of the city. The 
survey results also showed that response times ranged on average from 30 to 60 minutes, which is classified as 
ineffective times and a major factor affecting accident management. The proposed system helps detect accidents in 
real time and transmit location data and accident severity to emergency services. The system uses several sensors 
including vibration sensors, ultrasonic , GPS and GSM. The system and circuit simulations were also conducted in 
Arena and Proteus software and showed a significant reduction in response times based on a number of scenarios, 
achieving an average response time as low as 11-15 minutes. This research highlights the potential of integrating 
spatial data analysis and advanced sensing technologies to improve road safety and emergency response in Bisha. 
By adopting this approach, Bisha can enhance its traffic management system, align with the goals of Saudi Vision 
2030, and contribute to the development of safer urban environments.

1. Introduction
Road traffic accidents are one of the main causes of high mortality rates in Saudi Arabia and globally. According to 
the World Health Organization data for 2018, road traffic accidents are the eighth leading cause of death worldwide 
and are expected to rise to fifth place by 2030 (WHO, 2018). According to a report issued by the Ministry of Health, 
between 2018 and 2020. 16,159 people died and 89,050 people were injured due to road traffic accidents in Saudi 
938","Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

automated system, real-time sensors and communication units also reduced the time required for operations, 
as Arena simulation revealed that automating the deployment of resources and alerts saves up to 71.03% of 
response time compared to traditional systems, through the following equation: 
 
Time Efficiency Improvmenet = Average real time −Average simulate time
Average real time 
 
Time Efficiency Improvement = 
46.67−13.52
46.67
× 100 = 71.03% 
The above equation measures the percentage reduction in response time achieved by the automated system compared 
to the traditional system. The average real time for the traditional system was 46.67 minutes, while the average 
simulated time for the automated system was 13.52 minutes. 
This calculation demonstrates that the automated system reduces response times by 33.15 minutes on average at a rate 
of approximately 71.03% , representing a significant improvement over the traditional system. The intermediate values 
in the calculation further highlight the substantial efficiency gains of the automated system, making it a highly effective 
solution for accident detection and emergency response. 
9. Conclusion 
 The design of a smart system to manage car accidents in Bisha City represents a significant advancement in urban 
safety and traffic management. This study confirms three key findings: traffic accidents in Bisha City are concentrated 
in high-risk areas, particularly in the central and southern regions; delayed emergency response times significantly 
hinder effective traffic accident management; and real-time accident detection and automated systems are proven to 
significantly reduce these response times. 
 
The proposed smart system addresses these challenges by integrating cutting-edge technologies such as real-time data 
analytics, GPS tracking, and automated emergency response protocols. This approach not only mitigates the immediate 
consequences of traffic accidents but also aims to identify and address their underlying causes through comprehensive 
data collection and analysis. 
 
Successful implementation of this system requires collaboration among local government agencies, emergency 
services, and technology providers. Public awareness campaigns will also be essential to educate citizens on effectively 
using the system for their benefit. As Bisha City continues to grow, adopting such innovative solutions will not only 
enhance road safety but also foster a culture of proactive accident prevention. 
 
Ultimately, deploying a smart accident management system in Bisha City sets a precedent for other cities in Saudi 
Arabia and beyond, showcasing the potential of smart technology to enhance urban living. By prioritizing safety and 
efficiency, Bisha can lead the way toward a future where traffic accidents are minimized, thus enhancing the quality 
of life for all its residents.

1. Introduction
The employability of graduates is a pressing concern for Higher Education Institutions (HEI) in the country. This is a 
particularly important issue in the Philippines as it directly affects the growth of the country's youth employment as 
well as the overall economic environment. More industry-academic collaboration is needed, as evidenced by studies 
conducted locally by researchers like Ahmed and Fattani (2022), who have shown that there is a common gap between 
corporate expectations and academic preparedness. By bridging the gap, these collaborations may guarantee that 
graduates possess the necessary knowledge and abilities that employers value. By systematically analyzing these 
career trajectories, educational institutions can refine their curriculum and programs to better align with the evolving 
needs of the job market, ultimately boosting employability rates. In this, leveraging advanced tools like the Waikato 
Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) becomes essential. WEKA can assist in predicting job market trends 
and tailoring education to meet those demands, providing a data-driven approach to enhancing graduate employability.

Abstract 
Previous research is inconsistent and narrowly focuses on defining environmental management capability (EMC) and 
the outcomes of its relationship with sustainable performance. This study aims to focus on a broader range of issues 
while considering different perspectives on logistics operations. We first defined EMC and examined its relationship 
and sustainable performance from contingency and configuration perspectives. We define the EMC concept as a 
second-order latent construct that encapsulates the synergy among three primary EMC components: Environmental 
Management System (EMS), Supplier Environmental Management (SEM), and Internal Environmental Monitoring 
(IES). Additionally, leveraging the theory of performance frontiers, we developed differentiated strategies based on 
survey data collected by the Global Manufacturing Research Group, which represents developed, emerging, and 
developing economic regions. Manufacturers may initially observe limited direct impacts of EMC on sustainable 
performance. However, our findings reveal that firms in emerging economies exert the most effort in implementing 
environmental management capabilities compared to those in developed and developing nations. Firms in developed 
countries are increasingly reaching the “diminishing point” of their performance, investing just enough resources in 
EMC to maintain their competitive position as order qualifiers rather than order winners. Meanwhile, firms in emerging 
economies are rapidly advancing in both environmental and business performance, while those in developing countries 
are striving to close the gaps. This insight is crucial for managers, especially in multinational corporations, highlighting 
the need to adapt to varying economic conditions and development stages, and to allocate resources appropriately and 
effectively.

Abstract 
In a business environment characterized by accelerated digital transformations and growing global demands, leaders 
must be equipped with soft and technological skills to effectively address contemporary challenges. This study 
develops an innovative business model that integrates tourism and experiential learning experiences to enhance 
essential competencies in leaders and professionals, fostering their personal and professional growth. The proposed 
approach seeks to bridge the gap between the skills demanded by the market and the often theoretical and 
decontextualized traditional training programs. 
The research adopts a mixed-methods methodology, combining qualitative and quantitative approaches. A 
comprehensive literature review and case analysis were conducted to identify deficiencies in current soft and 
technological skill training. Subsequently, tools such as Buyer Person, empathy mapping, and surveys targeting 
business professionals were designed to validate the identified needs. Additionally, macro environment analysis 
(PESTLE) and competitive environment analysis (Porter's Five Forces) informed the development of a robust value 
proposition and a business model tailored to market conditions. Creating and validating a Minimum Viable Product 
(MVP) was critical to testing the model's acceptance and refining its elements. 
Key findings reveal that more than traditional training programs are needed to meet the current demands of the 
business environment, particularly in sectors affected by rapid technological advancements. Interviewed leaders 
emphasized the need for practical, flexible solutions that integrate experiential learning with developing critical skills. 
The validation of the MVP demonstrated strong acceptance of the experiential tourism model, confirming its potential 
to enhance participants' competencies while addressing gaps in existing programs. Furthermore, critical adjustments 
in design and implementation were identified, ensuring alignment with market demands and strengthening the initial 
proposal.

Abstract 
The Australian government introduced a superannuation scheme to provide workers with savings for retirement. 
Superannuation is one of the most valuable assets of the majority of Australians.  The scheme requires employers to 
set aside superannuation funds to provide their employees with a dignified retirement. However, some employers 
failed to make the required contributions to their employees’ superannuation funds. Moreover, some did not make 
correct payments or debit the incorrect funds in violation of legal obligations. To prevent fraud and to ensure both 
employers and their workers have access to employer contributions information, a robust superannuation system is 
essential. This paper aims to assess the suitability of blockchain technology for addressing the challenges of detecting 
and preventing superannuation fraud. Prior studies suggest that blockchain technology has not yet been used in the 
superannuation sector. The proposed research will involve reviewing the literature on disruptive technologies to 
determine the most compatible ones for these tasks. The results of the research will contribute to the disruptive 
technology models literature and support the superannuation industry by improving accuracy in superannuation 
contribution and budgeting.

1. Introduction
Pension systems are based on the idea that they reduce income during the working years and provide retirement 
benefits for retirees (Koomen and Wicht 2022). Superannuation, sometimes known as ""super"" in Australia, is a scheme

4. Conclusion 
Superannuation payment frauds are still present, and government officials and business professionals have introduced 
a number of solutions to prevent and identify unpaid superannuation. The literature review also discusses the current 
method of identifying unpaid superannuation and the implementation of blockchain technology as a remedy for 
superannuation payment fraud. 
 
This research-in-progress paper presented the literature review results. However, blockchain application is yet to be 
presented to demonstrate its suitability in preventing superannuation fraud. As this study used the Australian 
Superannuation problem as a case, this concept will therefore be restricted to the Australian business environment. In 
conclusion, the proposed solution will be useful in determining whether the superannuation contribution was 
successful when using dependable and durable technology like blockchain. Overall, this research shows that although 
blockchain technology has the potential to completely transform a variety of industries, it is crucial to be aware of its 
limitations and give serious consideration to its use cases before putting it into practice.

Abstract 
Colombia, a country renowned for its cultural, historical, and natural wealth, offers a wide range of tourist attractions 
that connect its unique heritage and landscapes with travelers' expectations. The Cartagena de Indias-Santa Cruz de 
Mompox tourist route exemplifies this richness, combining colonial charm, biodiversity, and cultural traditions. This 
study focuses on analyzing this route's tourism value chain, aiming to identify key areas for optimization, enhancing 
regional competitiveness, and fostering inclusive and sustainable tourism. 
The main objective of this research is to explore the components of the tourism value chain, prioritize strategic 
localities, and evaluate factors that improve processes and sustainability within the region. The study utilized an 
exploratory and descriptive methodology, which included documentary analysis, surveys with key stakeholders in the 
tourism sector, and digital mapping to identify and rank locations based on their tourist appeal. Furthermore, the 
“Scoring” multicriteria decision-making method was employed to construct a prioritization matrix that evaluated 
factors such as infrastructure, accessibility, promotion, population density, and visitor volume. 
The findings present a promising outlook for the region's tourism development. The study revealed that the 
infrastructure and essential services along the route are well-developed, supporting an enjoyable visitor experience. 
The prioritized localities showcase a wealth of natural and cultural attractions, providing a strong tourism foundation. 
However, significant gaps were identified in destination promotion, with many stakeholders indicating insufficient 
marketing efforts to attract potential visitors. Additionally, there needs to be more training for local residents in 
providing tourism services, limiting their ability to deliver high-quality experiences. While global trends such as 
sustainable tourism, eco-innovation, and wellness tourism align with the region's strengths, safety concerns persist 
among certain visitors. Despite these challenges, the region's potential remains significant, particularly with 
opportunities to integrate community-based tourism initiatives, strengthen marketing strategies, and invest in 
infrastructure that caters to emerging global trends. Furthermore, leveraging digital tools like mobile applications and 
augmented reality can modernize the visitor experience and attract tech-savvy travelers. 
The conclusions emphasize the necessity of developing robust promotional strategies to enhance the route's visibility 
and strengthen its competitive edge. Simultaneously, efforts to train local communities in tourism services are vital to 
ensure the delivery of exceptional experiences, creating an inclusive and sustainable tourism model that benefits both 
residents and visitors. Additionally, incorporating global trends such as regenerative tourism, which aims to restore

Abstract 
Group decision-making plays a crucial role in organizational management, yet there is limited research focused on 
systematically identifying and quantifying its key dimensions. This research aims to explore the essential performance 
dimensions of group decision-making and develop a scale to measure these components. A comprehensive literature 
review identifies critical factors influencing group decision-making, such as individual factors, group dynamics, and 
decision-making performance. Based on these findings, a structural equation model is designed for empirical analysis. 
Using AMOS 24.0 software, confirmatory factor analysis is conducted to assess the validity and reliability of the 
measurement scale. The analysis suggests that individual factors impact group dynamics, while group decision-
making performance is influenced by both individual and group factors. Path analysis reveals significant relationships 
among the performance dimensions, offering theoretical insights into effective group decision-making management. 
The research concludes with practical recommendations to help organizations enhance the efficiency and quality of 
their decision-making processes.

1. Introduction
In group decision-making management, the effectiveness of collective choices depends on various performance 
dimensions such as communication, coordination, leadership, and conflict management. Despite the significance of 
these factors, there is limited research on systematically identifying and quantifying these dimensions in a way that is 
both comprehensive and applicable across different organizational settings. This paper explores the composition of 
these performance dimensions and aims to develop a robust scale to measure them. By examining how these 
dimensions influence group performance, the study seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of the processes that 
underpin successful decision-making in groups. The scale developed through this research is intended to serve as a 
practical tool for assessing and improving group decision-making processes, with potential applications in both 
academic research and organizational practice. Through this work, the paper highlights the importance of considering 
multiple performance factors and offers a methodological framework for evaluating group decision-making 
effectiveness. In addition, this paper uses Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to conduct path analysis, revealing 
the significant relationships between the various performance dimensions and providing empirical support for the 
development of the scale.

• 
Team Communication and Coordination Ability has a significant positive impact on Group Decision 
Efficiency, with a standardized path coefficient of 0.855. This indicates that the higher the team's 
communication and coordination ability, the less likely team decision-making discussions are to deviate from 
the topic, with greater focus on achieving a unified decision goal, making the decision-making process more 
efficient. 
• 
Willingness to Innovate and Explore New Solutions has a significant negative impact on Group Decision 
Quality, Group Decision Efficiency, Satisfaction with Decision Process and Results, Consensus Reached in 
the Decision Process, and Acceptability of the Decision Process, with standardized path coefficients of [-
0.406, -0.307, -0.424, -0.452, -0.47], respectively. This suggests that if a team becomes overly divergent, 
focusing on innovation and exploring new solutions, the decision-making efficiency will significantly 
decrease. Additionally, the diverse range of opinions will make it difficult to reach a consensus, ultimately 
affecting decision quality, satisfaction, and acceptability. Therefore, group decision-making needs to manage 
the team's willingness to diverge and explore innovative solutions. 
• 
Willingness to Share Knowledge has a significant negative impact on Group Decision Efficiency, with a 
standardized path coefficient of -0.257. This suggests that if a team places excessive emphasis on knowledge 
sharing, it can lead to inefficiency in decision-making. Therefore, the extent of knowledge sharing among 
team members should be controlled. 
 
For those potentially significant paths with p<0.05 but not below 0.01, such as ‘Group Decision Efficiency <--- 
Interdisciplinary Team Leadership’, ’Decision Process and Result Satisfaction <--- Team Communication and 
Coordination Ability’, ’Group Decision Quality <--- Willingness to Share Knowledge’ and so on. This does not mean 
that there is no significant path relationship between them, which may be due to “insufficient sample size” or “biased 
sample (mainly in engineering)”. This may be due to ‘insufficient sample size’ or ‘biased sample (mainly focusing on 
the engineering field)’, which needs to be further discussed and researched in the future. 
 
Limitations worth mentioning are that since the vast majority of the sample population was from an engineering 
background, the conclusions may be specific to decision-making processes and decision-making tasks in engineering 
only, and decision-making processes in other domains may not be applicable, and team decision-making of different 
sizes is not discussed in this study. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study developed a scale to measure individual factors, group factors, and group decision-making performance in 
group decision-making, and validated the scale’s effectiveness through confirmatory factor analysis and structural 
equation modeling. The findings not only provide a new perspective on the dimensions of group decision-making 
performance, but also offer both theoretical and empirical support for organizations to optimize their group decision-
making processes in practice. Future research could further explore the impact of other potential factors on group 
decision-making performance, as well as how to apply this scale for broader evaluation and improvement in different 
organizational settings.

Abstract 
This study explored friction stir spot welding (FSSW) of Al6061-T6 and copper alloys with silicon carbide (SiC) 
particle reinforcement. The impact of these particles and process parameters on metallurgical and mechanical 
properties was examined by assessing intermetallic layer thickness and temperature increase. Results showed that SiC 
particles increased the intermetallic layer thickness by 9.52%, enhancing the properties of the welded joints. Cross-
sectional analysis was done using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) 
confirmed the presence of SiC particles in the weld. Additionally, Al4Cu9, Al2Cu, and α-Al phases were detected in 
welds without SiC reinforcement, whereas Al4Cu9 was absent in welds with SiC particles. This suggests that SiC 
particle reinforcement not only improves mechanical properties but also alters the development of intermetallic 
compounds in the welded region.

1. Introduction
The increasing demand for weight reduction in the aeronautics and automotive industries has led to the widespread 
use of lightweight alloys like aluminum and copper (Gassa et al., 2023). Aluminum alloys, such as AA6061-T6, offer 
an excellent strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance, while copper alloys are valued for their superior thermal 
and electrical conductivity. However, welding these dissimilar materials is challenging due to their differing melting 
points, which complicate fusion welding and promote the formation of brittle intermetallic compounds (Chaudhary et 
al. 2024). Traditional alternatives like riveting help avoid fusion-related issues but add complexity, weight, and 
potential stress concentration points (Babu et al., 2018). To overcome these challenges, Friction Stir Spot Welding 
(FSSW) has emerged as a promising solution. As a solid-state process, FSSW prevents melting, reduces intermetallic 
formation, and minimizes residual stresses, enabling strong, reliable joints with minimal distortion. Its ability to 
enhance material intermixing while preserving mechanical properties makes it a highly effective technique for 
lightweight, high-performance applications in transportation and aerospace engineering (Chaudhary and Singh 2023).

• 
Percentage contribution of aluminium and copper decided the formation of type of inter-metallic compound. 
• 
Intermetallic compounds formed in AL-Cu FSSW weld without SiC were AlCu, CuAl2, Al4Cu9.  
• 
With addition of SiC particles in welded zone of Al-Cu FSSW welds reduced the percentage contribution of 
aluminium and copper that eliminated the condition of activation of Al4Cu9 compound. Therefore, the inter-
metallic compounds formed were α-Al, AlCu and CuAl2. 
 
Inter-metallic layer thickness increased after addition of SiC particles, due to increased frictional heating between SiC 
particles and FSSW tool.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to improve the sample registration management at the Central Analytical Laboratory 
(CAL) of Johor Plantations Group Berhad by introducing a change in the existing system from a manual to a paperless 
system. The primary aim is to enhance operational efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction. The PDCA (Plan-
Do-Check-Act) method incorporates Lean and Kaizen strategies to eliminate waste in the current manual system. The 
team also utilized other tools such as Ishikawa Diagrams, Multi-Voting, and Value Stream Mapping (VSM) in problem 
identification and solution development. After some pilot studies, the Excel-based digital registration system was 
implemented and tested through a pilot trial, followed by training and feedback collection from the users. The 
transition to a digital system significantly improved process efficiency, reducing the Value-Added Time (VAT) from 
151.32 minutes to 64.35 minutes and Non-Value-Added Time (NVAT) from 2643.18 minutes to 0.92 minutes, 
achieving a Process Efficiency (%PE) increase from 5.41% to 98.59%. User feedback indicated high satisfaction with 
the new system, citing improvements in data accuracy, turnaround time, and overall operational efficiency. The 
implementation of a paperless sample registration system at CAL has led to substantial improvements in operational 
efficiency and customer satisfaction. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of digital transformation in laboratory 
settings, aligning with sustainability goals and contributing to cost savings and corporate social responsibility. The 
findings underscore the importance of continuous improvement and the potential for further enhancements through 
integration with advanced laboratory information systems.

5. Conclusion 
The transition from a manual to a digital sample registration system at the Central Analytical Laboratory (CAL) of 
Johor Plantations Group Berhad has been a significant beginning step towards enhancing operational efficiency and 
accuracy. The manual system was exposed to issues such as human errors, material damage, methodological 
inefficiencies, equipment shortages, and environmental concerns. These challenges necessitated a shift to a more 
reliable and efficient system. 
In the “Plan” phase, the team identified the key issues and developed a comprehensive strategy to address them. The 
“Do” phase involved implementing a digital registration system using Microsoft Excel, integrating it with existing 
laboratory instruments, and conducting extensive staff training. Pilot testing and feedback collection were crucial in 
refining the system before full-scale implementation. 
The “Check” phase focused on evaluating the system’s performance through data analysis, user feedback, and 
comparison with industry benchmarks. This evaluation helped identify successes and areas for further improvement. 
Finally, in the “Act” phase, the team standardized the new processes, rolled out the system across the laboratory, and 
established continuous training and feedback mechanisms to ensure ongoing improvement. 
 
The adoption of the digital registration system has led to significant improvements in data accuracy, turnaround time, 
and user satisfaction. By standardizing processes and incorporating continuous feedback, CAL has created a more 
efficient and user-friendly sample registration process by standardising processes and incorporating continuous 
feedback. This transition not only enhances operational efficiency but also aligns with the organization’s sustainability 
goals, contributing to cost savings and corporate social responsibility. The Value-Added Time (VAT) was reduced by 
57.47% from 151.32 minutes to 64.35 minutes and the Non-Value-Added Time (NVAT) by 99.96% from 2643.18 
minutes to 0.92 minutes. CAL enhanced percentage process efficiency from 5.41% to 98.59%. Physical activity also 
has been removed, saving time, decreasing strain, increasing accuracy, boosting accessibility, simplifying procedures, 
and promoting sustainability.  
 
Through the adoption of the Kaizen mindset, CAL is committed to implementing lean operating principles. Ongoing 
discussions with JPG’s Digital Division team aim to enhance the sample registration system to new levels. 
Additionally, discussions have begun on developing an in-house Laboratory Information System (LIS). This new 
system will be integrated with existing ecosystems, such as SAP S/4HANA (financial planning, budgeting, and 
reporting), SAP Ariba (purchasing and contract management), and KPlant (operation data platform), among others. 
This initiative highlights CAL’s and JPG’s commitment to continuous improvement and operational excellence.  
Overall, the successful implementation of the digital registration system at CAL demonstrates the importance of 
embracing digital transformation in modern laboratories. It highlights the benefits of systematic planning, thorough 
evaluation, and continuous improvement in achieving long-term operational excellence.

Abstract 
This study aims to explore the differences in people's situational awareness, trust, and acceptance of automation 
technology across different degrees of human-machine collaboration. It intends to provide valuable insights for the 
design and implementation of human-machine collaboration in future automation technology, ultimately enhancing 
operational efficiency, safety, and achieving effective human-automation system collaboration. Based on the 
OpenMATB experimental platform, 32 participants were recruited to complete tasks in four distinct levels of 
automation engagement. Comprehensive data on participants' situational awareness, trust, and acceptance of the 
automation system were recorded and then processed and analyzed to confirm the variations in the impact of different 
degrees of human-machine collaboration. The investigation showed a significant effect of human-machine 
collaboration on situational awareness. Initially, as system automation increased, situational awareness scores rose 
and then declined. Moreover, higher levels of human-machine collaboration were found to substantially boost trust 
and acceptance, as reflected by the corresponding score increases.

1. Introduction
With rapid progress in information technology such as artificial intelligence, deep learning, and big data, machines 
have transformed from mechanization and automation to intelligent entities in recent decades. Human-machine 
collaboration is an extension and enhancement of human-machine interaction in concept and scope. It has surpassed 
traditional interaction, redefining the human-machine relationship. Instead of a master-slave model, it promotes a 
partnership for achieving common goals(Hoc, 2000). This change is observable in multiple fields, from intelligent 
logistics and education to advanced manufacturing and co-driving systems. Consequently, human-machine 
collaboration has spread to various applications, substantially affecting our work and daily lives. 
Although machines are essential in advancing artificial intelligence, they still require human oversight to operate 
independently. Intelligent systems, while highly capable, do not fully replace the need for human involvement.(Xiong 
et al., 2022; Xu, 2019). Excessive automation may engender heightened risk factors (Barber, 1983). For instance, in 
highly collaborative scenarios, operators may become less vigilant regarding the prevailing situation, leading to a loss 
of situational awareness (Finomore et al., 2009)，Loss of situational awareness (Salmon et al., 2008).Over-reliance

experiences(Hoff & Bashir, 2015). Our results suggest that operators' increasing familiarity with the system 
strengthens their trust and acceptance, as observed in other studies (Bi-han & Fang, 2020). The Technology 
Acceptance Model (TAM) provides additional insight into this trend. According to TAM, perceived ease of use and 
perceived usefulness are critical factors driving user acceptance of technology (Davis, 1989). The decrease in cognitive 
load and increase in task efficiency with higher levels of automation align with these factors, suggesting that 
automation's perceived utility and ease of operation play significant roles in fostering operator trust and acceptance. 
These findings support hypothesis H2, which posits that varying levels of automation involvement significantly affect 
individuals' trust and acceptance of automated systems. 
 
Therefore, when designing human-machine collaborative systems, it is crucial to balance increasing trust and 
acceptance with maintaining situational awareness. System design should prioritize clear operational feedback and 
comprehensive status visualization to build user confidence in the system's capabilities. Additionally, providing 
appropriate training and guidance is essential to ensure operators fully understand the system's functions and 
limitations, thereby reducing the risk of misinterpretation and error. 
 
5.3 Discussion of the impact of human-machine collaboration degree on task performance 
Previous research on the relationship between human-machine engagement and task performance has produced 
varying results. For instance, studies by Baker et al. found a significant positive correlation between machine 
engagement and task performance(Baker & Keebler, 2017). In contrast, Onnasch et al.(2014) suggested a potential 
negative correlation(Onnasch et al., 2014). In this study, task performance was assessed through three metrics: 
accuracy, number of false alarms, and reaction time. Our findings indicate that task performance improved as the level 
of machine engagement increased in human-machine collaborative tasks. 
 
Intelligent systems streamline task flows and operational steps, thereby reducing the cognitive load on operators and 
enhancing the efficiency and speed of operations. Simplified and intuitive task processes enable operators to 
understand and complete tasks more quickly, resulting in reduced reaction times. The integration of intelligent systems 
allows for precise application of rules and logic, minimizing variability in task execution, increasing accuracy, and 
decreasing the number of false alarms. Thus, task performance generally improves when situational awareness is high, 
and operators have a reasonable level of trust and acceptance of the system. In such scenarios, operators effectively 
leverage both their own perceptions and the assistance provided by intelligent systems to accurately assess task 
demands and make informed decisions. For example, in the Cooperation mode2, characterized by high situational 
awareness and a solid level of trust in the system, task performance is notably high, with accurate task completion, 
fewer false alarms, and quicker response times. 
 
In summary, our study highlights that human-machine collaboration significantly influences situational awareness, 
trust, and acceptance. To optimize the design and application of automation technologies, it is crucial to balance the 
level of automation with human involvement. Avoiding over-automation helps ensure that operators maintain a proper 
awareness of their task environment. Additionally, fostering user trust in automation systems through transparent and 
reliable operation and feedback is essential for enhancing user confidence and acceptance. These strategies will 
improve user experience, acceptance, and advance the development and implementation of human-machine 
collaboration technologies. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper aims to investigate the influence of varying degrees of human-machine collaboration on situational 
awareness and explore differences in trust and acceptance of automation at different levels of automated collaboration. 
The results show: The degree of human-machine collaboration has a significant impact on situational awareness. 
Initially, more automation boosts situational awareness but further increases in automation lead to a decline. This 
implies excessive reliance on automation can harm an individual's task environment awareness. There is a remarkable 
correlation between the degree of human-machine collaboration and trust and acceptance levels. As automation grows, 
individuals' trust and acceptance of automated systems increase, suggesting higher automation may enhance users' 
trust and receptivity. With the increase in the degree of human-machine collaboration, the overall performance of the 
subjects improves significantly.

Abstract 
To explore a more reasonable way of displaying information on the page of the VDT control system, the way of 
displaying information on the page is the object of study, and it is divided into three types of pages according to 
different types of information display, which are: complete page, information-graded page, and block-separated page. 
This paper adopts a combination of subjective evaluation (scale data: NASA TLX scale) and objective evaluation 
(behavioral data, physiological data: EEG, eye movement) to compare the reaction time, correct rate, cognitive load, 
and cerebral load of the subjects when they perform target search on the three types of pages, and concludes that the 
use of information-graded pages is the most effective, followed by complete pages, and the effect of the page with 
separate blocks of diagrams is less effective. The results of the study suggest that either the full page or the 
information-graded page can be used when designing the page, both of which can ensure high search efficiency and 
at the same time enable the manipulator to maintain relatively low cognitive and mental load and reduce human 
errors. The results of the study can provide a certain reference basis for the optimization of information presentation 
in VDT control systems.

1. Introduction
At present, with the rapid and extensive use of digital technology in large-scale control systems, the main control 
room information interface with the emergence of a ""huge amount of information and limited display"" 
contradiction(Li Z 2020). This problem require the optimization of the system page information display mode and

Experiment 2, indicating that the subjects had a higher brain load when using the block-separated pages in 
Experiment 3. Since the brain map activation was higher in Experiment I than in Experiment 2, and the activation 
was higher in Experiment 3 than in Experiment 1, the subjects in Experiment 3 had the highest brain map activation. 
It shows that the subjects' brain load was the highest in Experiment 3, and the page use in Experiment 3 was less 
effective compared to the other two pages. Blocks separate pages increase subjects' brain load, which increases 
fatigue and affects task performance.The experiment focuses on visual search, with the prefrontal, parietal, and 
occipital regions being the main brain areas involved. The data showed a significant difference in higher activation 
in temporal lobe areas on both sides. It was initially thought that external noise factors were interfering with the 
laboratory environment, which may have contributed to this result. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper presents an exploratory study on page display in VDT control systems. The aim is to investigate the 
relationship between the manipulator's search efficiency and the way pages are displayed in VDT control systems. 
The study draws the following conclusions. In a VDT control system, complete information is displayed on a single 
page when space permits. Although the manipulator is presented with a large amount of information, familiarity 
with the page increases over time, leading to improved search efficiency and reduced cognitive load. The increase in 
pages for the information-graded page did not reduce the total amount of information. Categorizing the information 
on different pages was an improvement in search efficiency based on behavioral data. Based on the eye-movement 
and EEG data, it can be concluded that compared to the other two display methods, the cognitive and brain load on 
the manipulator is lower when the information-graded page is used. Therefore, the information-graded page is the 
most effective display method among the three. Based on the feedback from the subjects, the block separation page 
is impractical and difficult to use. Based on the information provided on the block separation page, it appears that 
this page may not be ideal to create informational target search tasks. Instead, it may be better suited to display 
graphic or icon search tasks. Further investigation is recommended. In summary, when designing the page for a 
VDT control system, one can either concentrate all the information on a single page or integrate and design 
information with a large amount of data and regular type of information as a information-graded page. Both of these 
pages can ensure high search efficiency, enable the user to maintain a low cognitive and brain load, reduce human 
error and improve work efficiency.

Abstract 
The low productivity levels in the metalworking industry, particularly in casual and small industries, are often 
attributed to the long times it takes to carry out a changeover, the recurrent machine downtime as well as overexertion 
of rework tasks. Prior research studies undertaken have shown the usefulness of lean manufacturing tools such as 
SMED, regular maintenance and formatted work in eliminating such wastages. Hence, this study sought out to solve 
these issues by looking at the design and application of a new production model in a chrome roller making SME. 
Some of these included employing SMED, so as to reduce changeover processes; great or increased reliability of 
equipment through preventive maintenance; and the reduction of operational variability through standardized 
operating procedures. The results obtained were significant change; a 22.9% reduction in change over time, a 65.4% 
reduction in rework and a massive 76.4% reduction in machine downtime which resulted into a 30.9% increase in 
productivity levels. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of the model to be effectively employed for 
improvement of other business parameters in a company. Further studies that incorporate complex technologies are 
welcomed, aimed at developing effective and unique solutions for different manufacturing environments.

1. Introduction
Regarding the sector to which the company under study belongs, it is the metalworking industry. According to the 
Ministry of Production, during the years 2017 and 2022, the production of the metalworking industry experienced an 
average annual increase of 7.0%, even though there were declines in the years 2017 (-1.6%) and 2020 (-27.6%). The 
latter was mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic that affected all economic activities, and the strict quarantine 
imposed during the months of March, April and May. However, in 2021, the metalworking industry experienced a

6. Conclusion 
This research reveals that substantially increased productivity and operational effectiveness were achieved as a result 
of the introduction of the SMED, the preventive maintenance programs and the standardized work practices in one of 
the metalworking SMEs. These measures tackled the significant challenges of long changeover times, machine 
breakdowns and high rework levels. Among the notable improvements were a reduction in changeover time from 429 
to 331 minutes, in rework time from 179 to 62 minutes and equipment downtime due to breakdowns from 246 to 58 
minutes. Besides, productivity registered a marked improvement as the time needed to produce the chrome-plated 
roller was minimized from 25.25 to 17.45 hours. These improvements indeed attested to the potential of the proposed 
production model in improving resource and process reliability. 
 
The findings bring to the fore the need to embed the application of lean tools within the operational setting of SMEs, 
especially in diverse and complex environments. Through process rationalization and the culturing of continuous 
improvement, the author shows how such measures can turn operational problems into growth opportunities. Emphasis 
on application and provision of workers with standardized methods not only minimized the chances of errors but 
optimized their flexibility and willingness to meet greater production targets. Such an all-rounded view 
‘operationalizes’ the dichotomy between abstract models and their actual use in everyday life, thus reaffirming the 
practicality of lean approach in pursuit of excellence in operations.  
 
Looked at more broadly, the results are of great importance to the branch of industrial engineering as they serve as a 
distinct evidence-based literature on the impact of lean type production tools in a small-scale manufacturing context. 
The research strengthens the need for SMED and standardized work as fundamental of being able to respond quickly 
and effectively to changes while avoiding unnecessary work that adds no value. In addition, the preventive 
maintenance program enhances continuous operational integrity by mitigating unforeseen downtimes, reducing 
maintenance expenses in the end and increasing the operational life period of significant assets. Such insights are 
critical for industry and researchers in a bid to make SMEs enhance their productivity and competitiveness in such 
environments. 
 
Reliably, the publication presents a well-structured theory that can be modified and used in different industries to 
combat the challenges that impede productivity. Further studies could look into the possibility of including more 
cutting-edge technologies like IoT based predictive maintenance or predictive simulation-based maintenance software 
to increase the range of these activities. Also, longitudinal studies focusing on the sustainability and the possibility for 
the further commercialization of the used tools would help to better understand their benefits over time. In those 
relationships between the business activities and institutions further development of lean practices can be expected 
which would guarantee constant enhancement in the ever-changing environment of the manufacturing sphere.

Abstract 
Using virtualized assets to improve planning and control is becoming increasingly popular. Digital twins are a way to 
achieve this idea in various application fields. The concept of digital twins goes beyond asset virtualization and aims 
to utilize this virtual replica for contextually driven action planning. In addition to the time taken to make decisions, 
the accuracy of the decision-making process is crucial. Though the idea seems novel and represents the future of asset 
management, decision-makers should thoroughly evaluate certain aspects before embarking on this transformational 
journey. The complexity of the decision-making scenario, the capabilities to be built in the twin, the development 
process, the process of deployment, the required change mindset and readiness level, along with the post-deployment 
maintenance, and management of the ""Asset-Twin"" along with the ""Asset"", are some of the pointers to look up to. The 
current work aims to develop a framework that accounts for these facets to support decision-makers while choosing 
the ""Digital Twin"" way.

Abstract 
Efficient maintenance of feedwater heaters in industrial facilities is essential for optimizing energy 
consumption and minimizing operational costs. This project addresses the logistical and cost challenges 
associated with managing inspections, repairs, and preventive maintenance across multiple feedwater 
heaters. The objective was to develop a cost-optimization model using a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) 
approach to streamline crew dispatch and route planning. The system integrates predictive maintenance 
techniques to prioritize tasks based on real-time equipment health, ensuring timely interventions and reducing 
downtime. Scenario-based testing demonstrated significant improvements, including annual cost savings of 
up to 89.9% during peak demand periods and emission reductions of 84.4% for new heaters. The model's 
adaptability to various scenarios highlights its robustness and potential for scalability. The findings suggest 
that integrating AI for real-time data processing and scaling the system to larger networks can further enhance 
operational efficiency. This work establishes a framework for sustainable and cost effective maintenance 
management in complex industrial environments.

Abstract 
As air travel demand increases, passengers often face long wait times, especially during peak periods, leading to 
frustration and decreased satisfaction. Efficient queue management is crucial, as each passenger must be individually 
screened at security checkpoints. Optimizing operations can minimize delays and enhance service quality. This study 
aims to improve queue management, focusing on hand-baggage inspection at King Khalid International Airport ( 
KKIA)’s security checkpoints. A simulation model was initially developed based on data from the airport to manage 
the hand baggage inspection queue. The results of this simulation will be used to implement a machine learning model 
to predict waiting times and allocate passengers to specific queue IDs, optimizing the inspection process and reducing 
waiting times. The proposed methodology promises to improve service quality, reduce delays, and maintain passenger 
engagement during the screening process. Expected outcomes include reduced passenger wait times through better 
resource allocation, improved operational efficiency via optimized real-time data integration, enhanced passenger 
experience with transparent, real-time queue updates, and the adoption of advanced technologies like the Internet of 
Things (IoT), Artificial intelligence (AI), and simulation-based tools at the airport. Additionally, this initiative will 
position KKIA among the best global practices. A scalable prototype of the system will also be developed, adaptable 
to other airports facing similar challenges, ensuring long-term operational benefits and applicability. Implementing 
this system at KKIA will likely boost operational efficiency, improve satisfaction, streamline baggage handling, and 
serve as a model for future airport optimization efforts.

Figure 7.  Histogram of Actual VS Predicated Waiting Time          
 
Figure 7 is a histogram comparing the actual and predicted values. This illustrates that the model captures the 
general distribution of waiting times, particularly within the 200–400 second range, where the predictions align 
closely with the actual values. However, there exist some deviations when predicting higher waiting times, 
particularly around 1200 seconds.  That suggests that the model accuracy tends to decrease when predicting longer 
waiting times. The model is considered effective in capturing the pattern seen in the data however there is still 
room for improvement. Enhancing the model’s performance may require further refinement, such as handling data 
imbalances, or exploring more advanced prediction algorithms to reduce errors in extreme cases. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This research provides an innovative solution to the challenges of queue management in baggage inspection at KKIA. 
By integrating data analysis, queuing theory, simulation, and machine learning, the project addresses inefficiencies in 
traditional queue systems, such as prolonged waiting times and resource misallocation. The study utilized data from 
the airport, including passenger arrival patterns, service times, and queue lengths. Simulation techniques ensured the 
realism of the data, and a machine learning model was developed to predict waiting times based on key parameters 
like queue count and service times. The results demonstrate that peak congestion occurs between 12:00-18:00 and 
18:00-24:00, with waiting times correlating directly with queue size. The machine learning model achieved an accuracy 
of 88%, effectively predicting waiting times in most cases, though some deviations were observed for higher durations.  
By implementing this smart queue management system, the airport could significantly reduce waiting times, optimize 
resource allocation, and improve passenger satisfaction. Real-time queue updates, priority-based scheduling, and 
adaptive allocation of resources are some of the key features that enhance operational efficiency. Furthermore, the 
proposed system is scalable and adaptable to other airports, providing a long-term, sustainable solution to queue 
management challenges. Future work aims to further enhance the model accuracy and scope of the proposed system, 
making it adaptable to different environments with further refinement to enhance efficiency and customer experience 
in high-demand environments.

Abstract 
Effective distribution of resources such as testing kits and vaccines are crucial in epidemic control. However, these 
resources are often limited, necessitating their optimal allocation to maximize their impact on disease mitigation. This 
work proposes a resource allocation framework that integrates network epidemiology models and multi-armed bandits 
(MAB). The network epidemiology part consists of a stochastic block model network in which each block represents 
a population group, and each node represents an individual. Disease dynamics are simulated on this network, capturing 
the spread of infection across and within population groups. An empirical Bayesian model is used to estimate the 
prevalence of each block daily. The daily allocation of resources is modeled as an MAB problem in which prevalence 
is the deciding factor. Three widely used MAB algorithms -Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling, and 
Gittins Index - are implemented to solve the resource allocation problem and determine the optimal distribution of 
resources among the population blocks. Following each allocation decision, the disease dynamics are simulated for 
one day, and the resulting observations are used to update the prevalence estimates for the next day. This iterative 
process continues until the epidemic subsides. The disease evolution statistics such as peak infection numbers, total 
number of infections, and endemic states are used to evaluate the efficacy of the method. A comparative analysis is 
performed against three baseline methods - random allocation, uniform allocation, and demand-based allocation. The 
results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance across the selected evaluation metrics.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to timely understand how passenger needs have changed and what is more important 
during their journey to enhance airline service quality. In a new era of aviation, where airline customer perceptions 
have changed as they have gone through the certain crisis, it is necessary to understand the changing of customer 
requirements that have changed over time according to the environment they are in. Delivering the satisfied customer 
experience by understanding the dynamic changes of customer requirement is the key to enhance satisfaction. In order 
to meet customer expectations and achieve highest quality levels, the aim of this research article is to identify in-flight 
customer experience that is aligned with customer’s needs along with in-flight service capabilities from providers to 
deliver the customer service experience. Ethnography is employed to understand the dynamic changes of customer 
requirement. Kano model is applied to analyze in-flight service attributes by customer perception surveying to 
determine their satisfaction. Quality function deployment and DEMATEL are research tools to link the relationship 
between customer requirement and service capabilities to sustainably enhance in-flight service quality. The result 
implies significance of hygiene as service dimension in post-Covid. In-flight cleanliness and hygiene, hospitality and 
service minded and complimentary high-speed Wi-Fi are the most attributes required from customer when travelling. 
Meanwhile, sufficient rest before next duty for physical recovering, mitigating intensity of cabin and service tasks 
including comfortable facility of aircraft features are determined as in-flight service capabilities from service providers 
to achieve the customer requirements.

response and safety procedures including in-flight services throughout customer journey, requires a sufficient rest, 
manageable workload and comfortable aircraft environment to maintain and improve their in-flight performance 
required by customers. To achieve an exceptional customer experience and empower sustainable service quality, cabin 
crew’s satisfaction, feeling and positive attitude are also significant in delivering their performance. Thus, the key 
finding of this study seeks first to understand customer and also aims to understand service providers to enhance 
customer experience. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study proposes Ethnography with an integrated Kano and QFD to analyze customer satisfaction in airline service 
quality. The findings of this study provide several managerial implications and make a valuable contribution for 
improving in-flight service quality. Through a comprehensive literature analysis and Ethnography method, 12 in-flight 
customer requirements are identified. CVR enables the six qualified experts to validate the in-flight customer 
requirements and service capabilities for questionnaire development. Kano questionnaires are developed for 368 airline 
passengers to determine the satisfaction. QFD with DEMATEL method to translate customer requirements into 
technical requirements. Significant in-flight service capabilities gathered and validated from six qualified experts by 
in-dept interview are prioritized in house of quality to indicate their important ranks for service enhancement. The 
results of this study reveal that Cabin cleanliness and hygiene” is the most important attribute required by customer 
when travelling onboard. This is given the first priority to airline representatives to pay attention to hygiene and 
cleanliness in order to enhance their in-flight service quality. The second most important barriers are “cabin crew’ s 
hospitality and service-minded”. cabin crew, who are the frontline representatives of the airline, are responsible for 
delivering an exceptional customer experience while prioritizing customer safety and security. Therefore, their 
hospitality and service-minded contribute to significantly to overall customer travel experience. The third most 
important is and “complimentary high-speed Wi-Fi onboard”. This indicates the necessary for network and technology 
implementation in the aircraft. Additionally, from service providers’ point of view, the result shows that a sufficient 
rest, manageable workload and comfortable aircraft environment are the most important capabilities of cabin crew to 
perform their in-flight service tasks. In conclusion, this study significantly contributes to the field of airline service 
quality by enhancing the airline’ strategies to retain customers and strengthen relationships with dedication and 
application for an aviation resilience. In the realm of future research, this study suggests that it would be interesting to 
enhance over all airline service quality. Future research should discover the examination of service quality starting 
from ground services to enhance customer experience.

Abstract 
Traditional warehouse operations are often inefficient and prone to risks. This research offers a cutting-edge system 
that integrates drone technology to overcome these challenges. Traditional practices rely heavily on manual methods 
or handheld devices, which are labor-intensive, prone to human error, and time-consuming. Additionally, manual 
inspections expose workers to hazardous environments, leading to inefficiencies and safety risks. The proposed system 
employs drones equipped with high-resolution cameras and advanced technologies such as Optical Character 
Recognition (OCR) and 3D scanning. These drones perform periodic inventory scans, reading barcodes and QR codes 
to update inventory data in real-time. Simultaneously, they monitor infrastructure conditions, identifying issues like 
cracks, rust, or misaligned shelves, enabling proactive maintenance and reducing risks of structural failures . A core 
feature of this project is the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) for data analysis. AI algorithms identify patterns 
in inventory discrepancies and infrastructure wear, facilitating rapid decision-making and actionable insights.  The 
inclusion of collision avoidance systems and intelligent navigation ensures safe and efficient drone operation within 
complex indoor environments. Preliminary results demonstrate that the system can enhance operational efficiency by 
up to 60%, reduce labor costs, and improve data accuracy in Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). The project 
aligns with the Industry 4.0 paradigm, offering a scalable, sustainable solution to modernize logistics and supply chain 
management. Successful implementation addresses challenges in unstructured environments while advancing the 
transition to smart warehouses. This research underscores the potential of drones to redefine warehouse operations, 
providing safer, faster, and more efficient alternatives to traditional methods. Future work will focus on real-world 
testing, refining flight paths, and incorporating advanced AI models to further optimize performance and scalability.

Abstract 
The decline in battery voltage during drone (UAV) flights poses a critical challenge, impacting flight safety, 
operational range, and efficiency. As battery voltage drops, motor performance diminishes, increasing the risk of 
crashes or failure to return to the launch point. This issue requires innovative solutions due to its implications for 
safety, performance, cost reduction, and sustainability. This research proposed the development of an intelligent 
system using live data and the machine learning algorithms to predict the state of drone’s battery. The model uses 
historical flight data, incorporating key variables such as battery voltage, wind speed, flight time, and environmental 
conditions to predict battery discharge during the operation. The proposed research is consisted of multiple phases, 
starting with problem definition and exploratory data analysis (EDA), followed by correlation analysis to understand 
the relationships between variables. The final phase will involve developing an interactive intelligent system that 
integrates the predictive model for real-time monitoring, proactive maintenance, and improved power management 
strategies. The current study will reduce operational costs, extend battery lifespan, and enhance safety across various 
drone applications.

Abstract
 
Enhancing storage efficiency became crucial for attaining long-term success in the logistics industry given the 
growing obstacles it faces, including growing demand and product diversity. Advanced inventory management 
techniques are necessary in this dynamic setting, which calls for a close examination of performance metrics. The 
primary objective of our study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the key performance indicators (KPIs) in 
Logexa warehouses, with a specific focus on those related to perishable goods. To achieve this, we plan to utilize 
various methodologies, including Fuzzy AHP and SNORM. Based on the identified issues, we propose corrective 
actions and provide recommendations for improvement. Perishable goods are sensitive to changes in the 
environment, storing them in warehouses can be quite difficult. To preserve their quality and safety, these items need 
to be stored under exact conditions. Thus, when used properly, KPIs are regarded as one of the most important 
instruments for enhancing the management of the storage of perishable goods.

Abstract 
Globally, the drastic upsurge in technological innovation to fulfil the needs of the fast growing information age has 
resulted in early obsolescence of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). This phenomenon has led to e-waste 
becoming the world’s fastest growing waste stream. The value of desirable metals present in e-waste is understood 
to be worth around $14bn worldwide. However, over 50% of these precious metals are often not recovered. 
Australia is a significant importer of EEE and the 4th highest generator of e-waste in the world. Presently, substantial 
quantities of e-waste generated in Australia are diverted to landfills and less than 40% are recycled. The 
responsibility of appropriately managing and recycling e-waste rest on all stakeholders such as state and federal 
governments, local councils, the electrical and electronics industry, e-waste importers, manufacturers, retailers, 
recyclers, collectors, consumers and regulatory agencies.  By working together, stakeholders can help ensure that e-
waste is managed safely and responsibly to reduce the environmental and health impacts associated with 
inappropriate disposal of e-waste to preserve our planet for future generations. This paper examines the role of the 
various stakeholders in managing e-waste in Australia, their level of involvement/participation in e-waste 
management, identifies the problems and challenges confronting the various stakeholders; and recommends 
innovative strategies and approaches to address e-waste collection and recycling practices in Australia. A 
quantitative research method employing online survey questionnaires is adopted. The study surveys e-waste

Abstract 
In recent years the world has seen unending economic and technological development which has resulted in the 
generation of enormous quantities of electronic waste (e-waste). Consequently, e-waste has become both a global 
and a local challenge due to the huge amounts of e-waste being generated yearly and the existence of both harmful 
and valuable materials contained in e-waste. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) reported that around 44 
million tons of e-waste will move into Australia’s e-waste stream by 2035. As the quantities of e-waste generated in 
Australia are intensifying, local governments particularly those in the regions are concerned about how to safely 
dispose of e-waste across Australia and at the same time, recover valuable resources. Although the Australian 
government is attempting to collect and dispose of e-waste through various policies and schemes, e-waste is still 
being diverted to landfills. Presently, the amount of e-waste recycled is less than 40% and the rest ends up in 
landfills. This study investigates the e-waste management practices and consumer disposal behaviour of a local 
government in Queensland. The study identifies the issues faced by the local government in managing e-waste, 
explores consumers’ willingness/intensions to participate in e-waste recycling and suggests several strategies and 
recommendations for improving e-waste management practices.  To achieve this goal, “valence theory” (VT) and 
“norm activation theory” (NAT) is adopted as the theoretical foundation for studying the e-waste management 
practices and consumer behaviour of a local government in Queensland. This study adopts these theories based on

Abstract 
Throughout Australia Photovoltaic (PV) systems which include solar panels, inverters and batteries are increasingly 
being installed in homes and business premises in astonishing numbers. According to Sustainability Victoria, more 
than 100,000 tons of discarded solar panels, inverters and batteries is anticipated to enter Australia’s waste stream by 
2035 creating enormous social, environmental and health risks as a result of inappropriate recycling and disposal 
practices in the communities.  Although Australian states and territories have recognized the ongoing issues of solar 
panel (PV) systems waste and introducing policies and regulations that can help manage  this waste stream, large 
quantities of discarded solar panels still go unaccounted for and are mounting up in landfills mostly in regional 
areas. Currently, local governments are concerned about discarded solar panel disposal to landfills and are struggling 
to come up with appropriate disposal strategies and approaches. Adding to the growing issue of waste generated 
from PV systems is the absence of committed processing facilities in Australia with capability and technological 
innovation to recover valuable materials contained in PV products. The purpose of this research is to critically 
examine environmental and health risks associated with solar panel (PV) systems waste disposal to landfills, create 
awareness and develop innovative approaches to address the ongoing issues on solar panels collection and recycling 
in Australia. This study is conducted in collaboration with Australian regional councils and an online survey 
questionnaire is used for collecting the required data.  The findings of this study contributes to an emergent body of

Abstract 
In Indonesia, electric vehicles are considered a strategic solution to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and air pollution. 
Although the use of electric vehicles is essential for a sustainable transportation system, individual acceptance must 
be considered to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles. This study aims to assess individual acceptance of electric 
vehicles using the UTAUT3 model. The factors causing individual behavioral intention and use behavior used in this 
study are performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, 
price value, habit, and personal innovativeness. Two hundred thirty respondents participated in an online survey 
through social media and messaging. The requirements to be a respondent are to own and use an ICE (Internal 
Combustion Engine) car, have a driving license, know electric vehicles, and come from the Surabaya and Jabodetabek 
areas (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi). This study shows that behavioral intention strongly determines 
electric vehicle use behavior. Based on this study, the factors strongly influencing the intention to adopt electric 
vehicles are effort expectancy, habit, hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, and personal innovativeness. The 
behavioral intention of electric vehicle adoption is not influenced by price value, facilitating conditions, and social 
influence factors. Understanding the complex aspects of Indonesian society’s view of electric vehicles can provide 
information on the reasons that drive the use of electric vehicles and provide guidance for more effective 
implementation strategies.

Meanwhile, facilitating conditions and social influence have coefficient values of -0.025 and -0.010 (p > 0.05), 
indicating a negative and insignificant relationship with the intention to buy an EV.  If facilitating conditions have a 
negative and insignificant relationship with behavioral intention, it indicates that the availability of supporting 
facilities does not enhance users' behavioral intention and may even act as a barrier. Users may feel that the available 
supporting facilities are irrelevant or do not meet their needs. A lack of public awareness about the infrastructure 
supporting electric vehicles can reduce the influence of facilitating conditions on behavioral intention. If the general 
public does not fully understand how electric vehicles or new technologies work, they may not prioritize facilitating 
conditions because they fail to see their relevance. Furthermore, uneven infrastructure distribution makes respondents 
perceive this factor as less significant (Axsen et al. 2012). Facilitating conditions may be more relevant when 
individuals are in the use behavior stage rather than when they are still considering adopting the technology. The 
strategy to address public perceptions of facilitating conditions is to provide education on electric vehicles, as well as 
their supporting facilities and systems. By ensuring that these facilities are available, easily accessible, and well 
understood, the public will become more familiar with electric vehicles and their associated infrastructure. 
 
Social influence has a negative and insignificant relationship with the behavioral intention to use electric vehicles. 
This condition suggests that social pressure or influence from others is not enough to encourage individuals to intend 
to use electric vehicles. In fact, this social influence may even have the opposite effect. Negative information or 
experiences from others about electric vehicles can affect an individual's perception. The influence of social factors 
decreases when individuals have greater autonomy in decision-making (Venkatesh et al. 2003). When the adoption of 
electric vehicles is still low in a society, individuals may not feel the need to follow social trends. For consumers with 
limited understanding of technology, practical factors become more important than social influence. A lack of 
adequate information about new technologies can diminish the impact of social factors. If respondents do not see 
promotions or support from influential figures, social influence becomes minimal, especially for new technologies 
(Wang et al. 2021). Addressing public perceptions of social influence requires an approach that focuses on the 
influence of individuals, communities, and institutions. Educational campaigns should be conducted to raise public 
awareness of the benefits of electric vehicles, and periodic surveys should be carried out to understand the public's 
perceptions of electric vehicles and social influence. 
 
A limitation of this study is the inclusion of respondents who are not EV users. These respondents rely solely on 
perceptions shaped by information from the media or others, struggle to evaluate technical aspects, and often exhibit 
a more conservative viewpoint. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study confirms that behavioral intention strongly determines electric vehicle usage behavior. While facilitating 
conditions, personal innovativeness, and habit are expected to have a direct relationship with EV usage, the results 
indicate these factors do not significantly influence this context. Instead, the most decisive factors influencing the 
intention to adopt electric vehicles are effort expectancy, habit, hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, and 
personal innovativeness. The findings also reveal that price value, facilitating conditions, or social influence do not 
significantly affect behavioral intention. Understanding the complex factors driving the Indonesian public’s attitude 
toward electric vehicles provides valuable insights into the motivations behind EV adoption. These insights can inform 
strategies for more effective implementation, addressing the practical and emotional drivers influencing consumer 
decisions.

Abstract 
Markaz Souvenir is a business that produces various types of souvenirs, including ceramic mugs. However, there is a 
significant production failure problem. This study aims to identify and minimize product defects at Markaz Souvenir 
using the Six Sigma method and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) analysis. The results showed that the 
defect data was normally distributed with a failure rate of 482 units, a Defect Per Million Opportunities (DPMO) value 
of 22790, and a sigma level of 3.5, which is still at the Indonesian industry average. FMEA analysis identified three 
main types of defects: surface scuffing, logo fading, and surface unevenness, with the main causes being suboptimal 
machine conditions and low-quality raw materials. The highest Risk Priority Number (RPN) value was 112 for the 
logo fading defect. Suggested improvements include regular machine inspections, the use of better quality raw 
materials, and increased lighting intensity in the production area. In addition, the application of the Kaizen method 
with 5-S is proposed for continuous improvement. The 5-S steps involve organizing work areas, cleanliness, and 
consistent application of standards to improve product quality and production efficiency.

1. Introduction
The souvenir industry in Indonesia has experienced rapid growth alongside the increasing number of domestic and 
international tourists (Mayuzumi 2022). This surge in tourism has significantly boosted the demand for souvenirs, 
with ceramic mugs being one of the most popular items (Hitchcock and Teague 2019). Ceramic mugs are not only 
functional but also serve as promotional tools, reflecting local culture and identity (Ao et al. 2024). The customization 
potential of ceramic mugs, with designs that reflect unique regional features or specific events, has contributed to their 
widespread appeal (Choudhari et al. 2024). Furthermore, these mugs are effective promotional media due to their 
frequent use in daily life, providing high exposure for businesses (Hervet and Guitart 2022).

6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the Six Sigma analysis at Markaz Souvenir revealed that the defect data followed a normal distribution, 
with a DPMO of 22,790 and a sigma level of 3.5, indicating an average industry standard. The FMEA analysis 
identified critical failure points, such as machine maintenance issues causing faded logos (RPN 112) and poor material 
quality causing uneven surfaces (RPN 90), with recommendations for regular machine checks and better materials. 
Additionally, inadequate lighting was identified as a factor contributing to defects (RPN 75), with a solution to 
improve lighting. The implementation of the Kaizen method, through 5-S practices, focused on improving efficiency, 
cleanliness, and organization in the production process to reduce defects and enhance overall quality and productivity.

Abstract 
The world was almost being disintegrated by the COVID 19 pandemic whose peak saw Information and 
Communication Technology (ICT) based solutions standing out as one of the best methodologies to counter the 
numerous challenges that were witnessed. These challenges ranged from job losses, reduced accessibility to health 
services, shutdown of education service delivery, shutdown down of major transportation modes, closure of religious 
worshipping places and International boarders, reduction in Justice Dispensations among others. ICT is anchored in 
UN SDG goals 9 and 11, however, a closer look at the other 15 UN SDG goals, shows that ICT is fully needed for 
full realization. Even though ICT has continuously been embraced worldwide over the years, some notable gaps still 
exist especially in developing countries. A brief focus on Africa indicates that 18% of the population have no access 
to a mobile broadband network, despite a 21% increase in 4G coverage since 2020 according to International 
Telecommunications Union (ITU). These constraints among many others are major impediments to deployment of 
ICT services in combating the pandemic and spearhead economic growth in Africa. This paper’s objectives are geared 
towards showing how ICT can be incorporated in various Engineering projects designs, using applicable simulation 
tools and relevant desktop research, for the purpose of achieving UN SDG goals with a clear emphasis on the potential 
economic recovery and growth benefits for Kenya, East Africa and Africa at large. 
Keywords 
Economic growth, ICT, Mobile network, Internet, UN SDGs. 
1. Introduction
The United Nations sustainable goal (SDG) 9 aims at ensuring that by 2030, there is a robust industry, innovation and 
infrastructure worldwide. The goal aims at having a reliable, sustainable, resilient, universally accessible and 
outstanding infrastructure across boarders for enhanced economic development and growth in addition to the well-
being of people. The goal also targets achieving an all-inclusive and sustainable industrialization with accessibility to 
affordable financial credits and markets. This will increase employment opportunities as well Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) and to some extent double GDP in the least developed countries. Another target is achieving innovations by 
focusing on development of sound technological advancements across borders with an enhanced focus on developing 
countries. Technological advancement is key driver of innovations and this calls for enhanced and diversified domestic 
and international legal, financial, technological and technical support to developing countries (United Nations). 
SDG 11 aims at achieving Sustainable Cities and Communities by 2030. It targets universal and inclusive access to 
sustainable, safe, affordable basic amenities including housing, health, education, transportation, waste management 
among others. As this happens, the goal aims at strengthening all efforts to preserve, mitigate and safeguard cultural 
and natural heritage worldwide as well as prevent occurrence of disasters and vulnerable situations while adapting to 
1103","In Figure 7 above, the system is using power from 350 kVA Generator. This implies that power is unavailable from 
solar, and Kenya Power and the load demand is less than 350 kVA. This scenario is likely to take place at night since 
the solar system was not meant for or storage.  
 
The simulation of Power supply system was based on assumption that the load will be adequately balanced, there 
would be reliable supply of power from Kenya Power and there would be sufficient sunlight to provide required power 
levels. These limitations pose a challenge of simultaneous use of power from two sources like Solar and Mains supply 
from Kenya Power.  
 
The simulations for the packing system as shown in Figure 8 below demonstrated how the system senses the available 
parking slots, displays them promptly when the vehicle arrives or exits the premises while capturing the number plate 
registration details of the vehicle and transferring them to the Data storage. The tool illustrated the system’s override 
and idle mode mechanisms especially during failure, emergency or maintenance. The system was also designed to be 
user friendly since the users only interact with system thrice during entry, online payment via mobile phones and exit.

5. Conclusion And Recommendation  
In order to achieve the UN SDG goals, ICT has to be applied at all stages of Engineering designs. Despite the existing 
gaps and variance between ICT deployment in Africa and the rest of the world, there is need for Africa to fully embrace 
ICT and the fruits that come with it. Engineering professionals are the heartbeat of this dream and we should be 
number one on the list. Incorporation of ICT in engineering designs as demonstrated above will yield optimum results 
and will save the client some significant costs. Engineers should embrace ICT in all their designs for the benefit of 
Africa and the entire world. This paper recommends the use of ICT in all engineering designs especially in modern 
day designs of green buildings.  The paper also calls upon the nations and the entire world to close all the existing 
gaps in the ICT sectors despite the milestones made. This will lay down a solid foundation for enhanced application 
of ICT in economic recovery, Growth and combating effects of climate change as well as any unforeseen 
pandemic(like COVID 19) that may arise in the future. The simulation results above were able to bring out the 
visualization of how technology will be used in energy management system and parking system. The results have 
demonstrated the important role played by ICT in running systems. Further exploration of the study can be enhanced 
to include various aspects of the systems especially uncertainties and unreliability in mains power supply, system 
maintenance and increased load demand.

Abstract 
Indonesia is one of the countries with the largest Muslim majority population in the world with a percentage of around 
87%. This supports the potential development of the halal market in various economic sectors, including Small and 
Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the food industry. Where the global halal food market has also experienced significant 
growth,. For Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the food industry, navigating the complexities of the halal 
supply chain is critical to success. This paper explores the multifaceted influence of halal supply chain management 
(HSCM) on SMEs' production performance. Research was conducted to analyze the factors of halal certification, 
materials and production processes on production performance in the SME sector. Data analysis was conducted by 
Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Model (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS statistical software tool. With the results 
of the R2 output and significance test with the bootstrapping process to see the significance of the influence of halal 
supply chain, quality of human resources and marketing on production performance.

1. Introduction
Based on Global Religious Futures data, in 2010 Indonesia was one of the countries with the largest Muslim population 
in the world with a percentage of around 87% (Hidayatullah, 2020). This supports the potential development of the 
halal market in various economic sectors, including Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). In Yogyakarta, food 
SMEs are widespread and play an important role in the regional economy. 
One of the SMEs in Yogyakarta that is known for its bread production is Brownies C, which is located in the Kotagede 
area. This SME is one of the SMEs in the food industry sector that has high prospects. Having 6 agents spread around 
Surakarta, Yogyakarta and Magelang, Brownies C is able to sell 300 to 1000 products by day. In certain periods, the 
number of sales can increase to 1500-2500 products. Seeing this potential, SME Brownies C needs to implement a 
supply chain management process as a strategy that can improve SME performance (Kristiana et al., 2020). One of

Visualization of SmartPLS running results from constructs and indicators Figure 2 is then evaluated as Figure 3. The 
initial design (Figure 1 and Figure 2) shows that each indicator is represented by 4 constructs. Then the evaluation 
results show that each indicator is not fully valid and reliable, so that construct X1 (Halal certification) has three 
indicators S2, S3, and S4. X2 (Material) has three indicators M1, M2, and M3, and construct X3 (Production process) 
is represented by indicators P1, P3 and P4. The value of each indicator network is a visualization of the loading factor 
output in Table 1. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
This study has limitations that may be overcome in future studies. The measurement of variables in this study was 
carried out at one point of the object, which may affect the results of the study due to the increased risk of bias from 
the method. In future research, it is recommended to collect more varied data not only as cross-sectional in certain 
regions in Indonesia. Thus, the results may be a limited generalization for Muslim consumers nationwide. 
 
5.4 Validation  
Although many previous studies have discussed the effect of supply chains on SME production performance, studies 
related to the implementation of halal supply chains at the scale of food SMEs are still relatively limited (Rajendran 
et al., 2024). This study aims to fill this gap by analyzing the extent to which halal supply chain management can 
affect the production performance of food SMEs, especially in improving production efficiency. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of data analysis from research on the influence of the Halal Supply Chain on Production 
Performance conducted at Brownies C, the following results can be concluded, the halal supply chain indicator that 
has the most significant influence on the production performance of SME Brownies C is halal certification with a 
Tstatistic value of 4.215 and an original sample of 0.399. Furthermore, the integrity of the implementation of the Halal 
Supply Chain with indicators of certification, material, and production processes according to halal standards has a 
significant influence on production performance at UMKM Brownies C, this can be seen from the coefficient of 
determination R2 value of 0.712. Based on the analysis of the PLS-SEM algorithm, the influence of the Halal Supply 
Chain in UKM Brownies C has a significance of 71%, which is obtained from the correlation value between indicators 
and constructs of halal certification, materials and production processes. In addition, based on the estimated value of 
the path coefficient, the RSquare value is 0.712> 0.67 and is included in the strong category.

Abstract 
In the emergency area of a public medical center, the project, using the DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, 
Control) methodology, focuses on reducing patient waiting times. Simulation using the ARENA software was the 
validation methodology chosen to evaluate the impact of the proposed changes. As a result, a significant reduction 
was obtained in the Average Waiting Time (AWT) for patients, from the moment they arrive at the health facility until 
they are seen by the corresponding doctor.

DMAIC, Medical Services, Waiting Times 
1. Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (s.f.), quality care must be people-centered, as well as safe and effective. 
However, it is a reality that patients have negative experiences and face problems every time they go to a health service 
expecting quality care; Peru is no stranger to this reality. 
The health system in Peru is made up of two sectors: public and private. Regarding the public sector, it is subdivided 
into the direct and indirect contributory sector. Within the direct contributory public system is EsSalud, which includes 
primary care medical services that correspond to the first level of contact with the population (Ministry of Health of 
Peru 2019). Within this first level of care there are different categories of health establishments. Category I-3 mainly

Confidence interval for average total waiting time 
Original 
[67.4152, 78.1768] MINUTES 
Proposal 
[23.9337, 30.2003] MINUTES 
As can be seen, there is no overlap in the confidence intervals of the AWT of the original and improved scenarios, so 
it is concluded that there are significant differences. Finally, in the Control component, the planning of periodic 
surveillance audits, monitoring of indicators and creation of quality groups was proposed. 
For the economic evaluation of the project, being a public establishment, this improvement would not generate any 
flow of greater income because of the care provided. It is also important to mention that the investments made in this 
medical center are limited by the assigned budget, so for the economic evaluation, the main benefits of the project will 
be calculated in the form of productivity gained and investment for improvements. 
The main benefit of this project lies in its impact on the social sphere, since by significantly reducing waiting times 
the quality of service provided to the patient is improved. However, reducing waiting times not only means greater 
efficiency in the medical center, but also has a positive economic impact. By minimizing the average waiting time, 
the total time that patients remain inside the establishment is reduced and therefore a lower economic impact than 
previously calculated. This productivity is shown in Table 9, resulting in a reduction of the economic impact by 
44.91%.

It is worth mentioning that the man hours gained were calculated as the difference between the AWT of the simulation 
of the current state with the proposed future state. This proposed improvement would represent 0.17% of the national 
GDP considering 1,713 medical centers nationwide according to the Ministry of Health of Peru and taking into account 
that the national GDP amounted to 936,965 M PEN. 
5. Conclusion
The proposed solution met the expectations of the initial motivation of the project: to reduce the average waiting time 
of patients in the emergency area, from the moment they arrive at the establishment until they are seen by the 
corresponding doctor, following the DMAIC methodology. Based on the literature, the implementation of this tool is 
feasible because they have international success stories, but it is not widely used in the health sector, so the contribution 
of this project is the demonstration that waiting times can be improved by using engineering tools in a particular sector 
such as the health sector, and that is adaptable to any context and/or problem that arises in future research. 
Finally, as a conclusion to the research carried out, it is possible to boost interest in this topic, which, although it is 
new in foreign countries, in Peru it is a topic with very poor or no antecedents, so having carried out this research can 
generate opportunities for other future research on topics that complement the scope of this project.

Abstract 
Occupational safety has been the highest priority in industrial environments among all other concerns within any 
enterprise, specifically in industries that handle hazardous and poisonous gases. Despite numerous advancements in 
safety measures, serious injuries, fatalities, work stoppages, and significant financial losses still occur due to gas 
exposure incidents. Many of these incidents stem from gaps in safety enforcement, inadequate monitoring of toxic gas 
levels, and failure to ensure strict compliance with safety procedures. These shortcomings highlight the need for a 
more comprehensive and reliable approach to safety management in high-risk environments. The Safety Access Point 
(SAP) system enhances worker safety in hazardous industrial environments by ensuring only authorized, safety-
compliant individuals access restricted areas. It systematizes access control and safety monitoring, reducing manual 
intervention and costs related to accidents and insurance. In addition, the system provides data for safety audits, 
promoting continuous improvement in safety protocols which aims to create a safer workplace that boosts worker 
confidence, morale, and productivity, reinforcing a strong safety culture. The SAP system represents a transformative 
approach to industrial safety combining real-time monitoring, advanced detection technologies, and automated access 
control. It ensures a safer, more efficient workplace while minimizing human error risks. This solution protects 
workers, reduces operational costs, and enhances safety compliance, contributing to a sustainable, safety-focused 
industrial environment. This project redefines safety standards in hazardous industries, paving the way for a future 
where workplace safety is proactively managed.

Abstract 
In recent years, the fast-food restaurant sector has experienced significant growth, driven by the fast pace of life and 
the demand for quick and affordable options. However, this growth has been accompanied by high competition and 
increased customer expectations for efficiency and service quality. In this context, order preparation times and 
customer experience have become key factors in maintaining competitiveness in the market. Given this scenario, it is 
essential to improve kitchen activities to have better delivery time. Thus, an improvement model based on work 
standardization tools and Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) is proposed, with the objective of reducing order 
preparation times in a fast-food restaurant. The proposal was validated through a pilot test in the case of the SLP tool 
and a simulation in Arena software in the case of standardized work. The results obtained show a reduction of more 
than 30 % in preparation times and an increase in monthly service capacity of up to 50 %.

1. Introduction
The restaurant industry plays a key role in the global economy, contributing significantly to employment and income 
generation in several countries. 
In Spain, for example, the sector reached a turnover of more than €25.34 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 
2.6 % over the previous year, and providing employment to more than 1.3 million people (Statista, 2023). However, 
the COVID-19 pandemic severely affected this sector, causing massive business closures and the loss of thousands of 
jobs, with more than 80 % of staff being laid off in some cases to reduce costs (Dube et al., 2020).  
In Latin America and the Caribbean, more than one million people were affected, demonstrating the social and 
economic importance of this industry (ECLAC, 2020). 
In Peru, the impact of the pandemic was also significant. The contribution of the restaurant sector to Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP) went from 4.4 % in 2019 to a contraction of -50 % in 2020, reflecting an unprecedented crisis in the 
sector (INEI, 2024). However, the restaurant industry, particularly fast food, has shown resilience, driven by the

6. Conclusion  
This research demonstrates that improving order preparation times through standardization and SLP is feasible and 
profitable in the context of fast-food restaurants, offering a replicable model to improve competitiveness in the sector. 
A reduction of more than 30% in preparation times was obtained, achieving a better order delivery time to customers. 
This reduction contributed to a significant improvement in operational efficiency, reflected in an increase in customer 
satisfaction by receiving a better level of delivery service. 
 
On the other hand, the validation of the improvements through simulations demonstrated the viability and 
sustainability of the changes made, which allows to anticipate and mitigate possible inconveniences before their actual 
implementation. Thanks to this improvement, the reduction of delivery times allows to meet around 50 % more than 
the current demand, according to the simulation in Arena. 
 
These results confirm that the combination of standardization and SLP tools presents an effective approach for 
operational improvement in fast food restaurants, establishing a more robust business model, capable of meeting 
increasing customer demands without compromising quality and efficiency, and positioning the restaurant favorably 
in a competitive environment.

Abstract 
This study examines the impact of digital procurement transformation on sustainability, focusing on how digitalization 
enhances procurement efficiency, while addressing sustainability challenges. A case study of PT XYZ, a financial 
services company, explores the increasing complexity of procurement, as it faces challenges in navigating complex 
regulatory requirements, dynamic operational demands, prevention of bribery and corruption, and necessary risk 
mitigation. By proposing the digitalization of sustainable procurement, this study offers value by reducing complexity 
and promoting inclusive economic growth. Data were collected from interviews with employees at a financial services 
company, utilizing semi-structured discussions with procurement professionals, sustainability officers, and 
operational stakeholders, including focus group discussions, to capture collective insights. This study applies the 
Kraljic Matrix framework and ABC Classification to define procurement categories and activities based on two 
primary factors: profit impact and supply risk.  The analysis identified key themes and patterns, assessing three 
analytical matrices: efficiency gains from e-procurement systems, reductions in environmental impact from data-
driven decisions, and challenges in integrating sustainability with digital platforms. The qualitative findings indicate 
that procurement digitalization enhances stakeholder experience while streamlined procurement process benefits small 
and medium enterprises, allowing business users to procure directly through a sustainability digital platform without 
needing approval from the procurement department. The results show that 96% of stakeholders reported positive 
impacts, particularly in terms of cost, innovation, flexibility, and social responsibility. This study offers valuable 
insights into the effects of digitalization on sustainable procurement.

1. Introduction
1.1.  Background
The global insurance industry has experienced significant growth since the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in 2023. 
According to a vital insurance report, the international insurance market will increase by 7.5% by 2023, marking the
highest growth rate since 2006 (Allianz Global Insurance Report, 2024). This growth results from an increase in
premium income across all insurance segments including life, general, and health. Overall, both the global and
Indonesian insurance industries show signs of recovery and growth in the post-pandemic landscape.
The rise in business activities in the insurance sector has significantly impacted company operations, particularly in 
the procurement department.  This study reviews procurement operations at a financial services company (PT XYZ) 
to analyze procurement complexities resulting from an annual increase in procurement demand ranging from 14% to 
16% over three years. Table 1 highlights the expense growth aligned with the company’s strategic objectives to invest 
in business technology, digitalization, and automation projects/systems for enhanced operational efficiency.

Implications for Practices 
Based on these findings, this study suggests that managers should enhance procurement efficiency while achieving 
sustainability goals by prioritizing digital procurement transformation. Implementing a digital procurement platform, 
especially platforms endorsed by the government, can streamline sourcing processes, reduce administrative burden, 
and foster greater transparency. Companies should also adopt the trace-hold procurement method, allowing business 
users to purchase directly for low-value transactions, accelerate procurement cycles and reduce operational 
bottlenecks. Additionally, integrating ESG scoring and carbon footprint tracking into procurement decision-making 
can help businesses align their operations with sustainability objectives, while maintaining compliance with regulatory 
standards. 
 
Furthermore, procurement managers should focus on supplier engagement strategies that support MSMEs and local 
vendors by leveraging digital platforms to expand their access to corporate procurement networks. By categorizing 
procurement activities using the ABC-Kraljic Classification Matrix, organizations can allocate resources more 
efficiently, prioritize strategic suppliers and develop tailored risk-mitigation strategies. Companies should also 
establish real-time procurement monitoring dashboards to enhance their cost control, compliance tracking, and risk 
management. These initiatives improve operational efficiency and reinforce a company’s commitment to 
sustainability, stakeholder inclusivity, and long-term value creation. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Business users’ decision to order through the digital platform PADI presents an option for advancing procurement 
digitalization transformation towards sustainability. The implementation of traceability leads to greater procurement 
efficiency and optimization. By digitizing procurement processes, organizations can better manage supply chain risks, 
improve transparency, and foster stronger and more sustainable relationships with suppliers. Qualitative impacts, such 
as improved risk management, increased supplier accountability, and better decision making, help companies achieve 
their sustainability goals while maintaining a robust procurement strategy. 
 
This study will help procurement to focus more on value-added activities to achieve cost efficiency, budget control, 
and sustainability. The revamp of procurement procedures aims to increase efficiency, improve compliance, and align 
the procurement processes with sustainability goals. This revamp focuses on modifying the ordering threshold flow 
and leveraging digitalization to optimize procurement sustainability. 
 
While the findings offer valuable insights, this study acknowledges several limitations. First, this study examines a 
single case study of PT XYZ, which limits the generalizability of the findings to other industries with different 
procurement regulations and challenges. Second, this study focuses on short-term efficiency gains instead of long-
term sustainability impacts of digital transformation, such as supplier resiliency or carbon footprint reduction. Future 
studies could enhance the findings by longitudinally examining the impact of digital transformation on more

Abstract 
Clustering algorithms are critical in data analysis and optimization, particularly for segmenting datasets in practical 
applications. This study proposes an improved variant of K-means clustering algorithm and do evaluation on the 
performance of nine popular clustering methods—DBSCAN, HDBSCAN, Spectral Clustering, Hierarchical 
Clustering, OPTICS, Mean-Shift Clustering, Self-Organizing Map (SOM), K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model 
(GMM), and the proposed Improved K-Means algorithm—using Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) dataset. 
Implemented in Python, the methods are compared using the Calinski-Harabasz Index and Silhouette Index to assess 
cluster quality. Results show that the proposed improved K-Means algorithm, with its optimized parameter 
configuration through the initialization process of the parameter K and cluster centroid set, performs exceptionally 
well compared to other methods. These findings highlight the importance of parameter tuning and algorithm selection 
in clustering tasks, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners. This work provides practical guidance

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
As shown in Figure 7, the improved K-means algorithm demonstrates significant as evidenced by an average 8% 
improvement in S index and a 10% improvement on CH index compared to original K-Means. Figure 6 illustrates the 
well-separated and cohesive clusters generated by the proposed method. Future work will focus on integrating 
advanced clustering techniques such as density-based clustering to handle non-linear separations. Additionally, we 
propose testing the algorithm on larger datasets to assess scalability and robustness.""

5.4 Validation 
This study validates the clustering structure using internal validation. We run the K-means clustering (Scikit-learn) 
and compare its performance with our proposed improved K-means clustering algorithm on two metrics: S index and 
CH index. The proposed algorithm enhances S index 8% and CH index 10% improvement compared with the well-
known K-means algorithm of Scikit-learn. Besides, we propose the three versions of improved K-means clustering 
algorithm, as shown in section 5: Improved K-means (Silhouette), Improved K-means (CH) and Improved K-means 
(Combined) to validate the effectiveness of the combination of S index and CH index in parameter initialization. The 
datasets “Golden et al. 1998 – Set 2” and “Augerat 1995 – Set A"" are well-established in the field of vehicle routing 
problem (VRP). Their reliability can be assessed based on their origins and VRP-REP Repository quality control. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The proposed Improved K-Means Clustering Algorithm successfully fulfills all research objectives, demonstrating 
significant advancements in clustering accuracy and robustness. By integrating the 𝑆𝑆 Index and 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 Index, the 
algorithm achieves a well-balanced optimization of intra-cluster cohesion and inter-cluster separation. The adoption 
of K-Means++ for centroid initialization further enhances parameter optimization, resulting in improved clustering 
quality and computational efficiency. Extensive experimental evaluations on diverse datasets, including highly 
complex and noisy scenarios such as the ""Golden"" datasets, illustrate the superior performance of the Improved K-

Means algorithm. It consistently outperforms the original K-Means and other benchmark clustering methods, 
achieving higher S and CH indices across varied clustering tasks. These results underscore the adaptability and 
reliability of the proposed approach in addressing real-world challenges. 
 
The unique contribution of this research lies in the development of a novel dual-metric optimization framework 
combined with an enhanced centroid initialization strategy. This innovative approach not only improves clustering 
outcomes but also provides a robust and scalable solution for practical applications, such as the Vehicle Routing 
Problem. The findings of this study contribute to advancing clustering methodologies and offer valuable insights for 
future research and practical implementations in the field.

Abstract 
Freight transport is one of the most significant activities in the Peruvian economy. This project focuses on optimizing 
logistics operations using industrial engineering tools to reduce truck dwell time within facilities and enhance workers' 
occupational safety. The proposed model was based on the application of SLP (Systematic Layout Planning) to ensure 
the proper layout of the company's areas, reducing distances and improving workflow. Appropriate machinery and 
equipment were also implemented for the loading and transportation processes to reduce variability by standardizing 
activities. Finally, an ergonomic analysis using the NIOSH method was conducted, allowing the identification and 
mitigation of risks associated with manual handling of goods. Simulations using Arena and Ergosoft Pro software 
validated the model, achieving a reduction in truck dwell time from 7.55 hours to 5.01 hours on average. Additionally, 
the risk level decreased by 69.38% from 5.78 (very important risk) to 1.77 (medium risk). These improvements, 
alongside productivity gains, enabled the company to establish a competitive advantage in operational efficiency.

1. Introduction
Land freight transport plays a crucial role as it enables the distribution of goods across different regions and fosters 
economic development. According to Mordor Intelligence (2024), an annual weighted growth rate of 6.50% is 
projected for this sector in the Peruvian market, thus generating a promising opportunity. However, this sector faces 
significant challenges, including inefficient time management, high ergonomic risks, and inadequate operational space 
distribution, which limit the competitiveness of companies in an increasingly demanding market. 
Transmauri S.R.L., a company with extensive experience in this field, is currently facing critical challenges in its daily 
operations. The average truck dwell time at the company’s facilities is 7.55 hours, significantly higher than the industry 
standard of 5.70 hours, leading to delays and reduced operational capacity (Iskanderani et al. 2023). Key contributing 
factors include improper spatial distribution, variability in the merchandise loading process, and worker fatigue. To 
address the first issue, the implementation of Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) is recommended, as Kumar and

In the ergonomic analysis, as shown in Figures 17 and 18, the risk level has significantly decreased, moving from a 
very high level, with a value of 5.78 on the ergonomic risk index, to a medium risk level, with a value of 1.77. This 
reduction represents an improvement of 69.38% in the index. On the other hand, the implemented improvement 
proposals have resulted in a significant reduction in the time trucks spend at the Transmauri company’s facilities. In 
the initial simulation scenario, the average stay time was 6.14 hours, with a lower limit of 5.2 hours and an upper limit 
of 7.19 hours (see Figure 22), representing 80% of the total merchandise. In the real situation, considering all the 
merchandise, trucks stay an average of 7.55 hours at the facilities. After the improvements were applied, the new 
scenario in the simulation shows an average stay time of 4.01 hours, with a lower limit of 3.78 hours and an upper 
limit of 4.2 hours. Therefore, the average stay time of the vehicles, considering the entire merchandise, is 
approximately 5.01 hours.

6. Conclusions 
Thanks to the field work, a new layout was designed for the company that optimized the flow of materials, reduced 
the distance between the warehouse and the loading area, and improved vehicle access. The standardized work allowed 
the integration of specialized machinery and equipment, streamlining loading operations and considerably reducing 
the time that trucks were in transit. In addition, ergonomic improvements were implemented that created a safe and 
comfortable work environment, complying with safety regulations and boosting operational efficiency. 
 
The proposals position the company above the industry average, increasing shipping capacity and enhancing 
profitability. Likewise, a favorable work environment reduces employee turnover and boosts operational efficiency. 
Additionally, delivery times are optimized, goods are better protected, and service quality is elevated, strengthening 
the company's image among current and potential clients. 
 
In upcoming research, the improvement of merchandise management will be explored through advanced inventory 
management technologies, such as automation, integration with IoT, Warehouse Managemente Systems (WMS) and 
predictive analysis. These technologies will allow for more precise control over the company's needed for each activity 
and avoiding downtime and unused capacity. This will be possible thanks to real-time monitoring of resources, both 
human and equipment, which will facilitate a quick and efficient response to operational needs.

Abstract 
The current volatility in the marketplaces, complexity in technology, and fluctuations in customer demand motivate 
us to understand the dynamics involved in a complex system. This study focuses on analyzing the steel bar production 
system and its performance. This study uses system dynamics modelling (SDM) to model a steel plant production 
system and demonstrate a decision-making approach to improve steel bar production. This study uses simulation to 
incorporate key factors identified from existing research, including those that influence steel production. A causal 
loop diagram (CLD) and stock-flow diagram (SFD) are used to analyze the involved qualitative and quantitative 
features. In addition, sensitivity analysis was performed to analyze how the production grows with time in various 
scenarios of input variables. This model can be customized for specific steel plants. Industry practitioners can use this 
framework to make data-driven decisions regarding steel production. Additionally, practitioners can leverage this 
study to determine the essential variables and identify the factors that negatively or positively impact steel production.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing creates wealth and increases a country’s prosperity by adding value to raw materials (Adane et al., 
2019). Resource security is a very critical issue for natural resources; among all key mineral resources, iron and steel 
are the key raw materials for several industries such as vehicles, road & building construction, manufacturing tools & 
equipment, etc. (Hao et al., 2024). 
A production system like a steel plant has multiple input and output variables. There are various feedback loops in 
this system, and the behaviour of the system may change in a linear or nonlinear manner. Analyzing this behavior may 
be complex and time-consuming. Hence, a practical framework is needed to analyze multiple scenarios, aid decision-
making, identify suitable action points, and understand the interaction and evolution of various variables over time.

This work contributes to the existing literature by applying CLD and SFD to analyze a steel plant's qualitative and 
quantitative production features. It can be challenging to understand how the variables interact with each other and 
how they affect production. CLD helps to visualize these relationships by incorporating arrows and polarity to indicate 
the complex interrelationships between these variables. Some critical reinforcing and balancing loops that influence 
steel production dynamics have also been identified. Decision-makers can use this model to determine where to focus 
resources to increase steel production. Thus, this framework can allow managers to make data-driven steel production 
decisions. For example, suppose a steel plant manager's objective is to increase steel production. In that case, they can 
apply this model in their plant to identify which factors significantly affect their production. If the most significant 
factor affecting production is the investment in automation/better technology, policies can be made to increase 
investment in implementing automation and better technology. 
 
Additionally, practitioners can leverage this study to identify the factors that negatively or positively impact steel 
production. This work has certain limitations. It doesn’t take into consideration specific steel plants and any unique 
factors that may play a key role in their production. For example, steel plants from different countries may have 
different factors (such as currencies) that affect their production. Decision-makers can use this model to understand 
how steel production varies with other variables. 
Future work will be proposed to include the experts' input and real-time data to be collected from a specific 
steel plant and plugged into this model. Discussion with experts may bring up other variables of interest that may 
impact steel plant production (for example, the exchange rate of the country's currency, etc. can be considered). 
Insights of experienced decision-makers knowledgeable in the steel industry can be gathered to identify the key 
variables influencing steel plant production. Based on their feedback, new variables could be added, and existing 
variables can be removed.

Abstract 
This study investigates the differential impact of intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity on an individual’s intention to start 
a social enterprise through subjective norms. Even though entrepreneurs have started exploring the role of religion in 
starting a social enterprise, research has yet to examine how different religious motivational dimensions — intrinsic 
and extrinsic religiosity — might influence one’s social entrepreneurial intention. Using structural equation modelling 
on a valid sample of 210 respondents from India, results show that extrinsic religiosity positively influences social 
entrepreneurial intention via subjective norms. However, intrinsic or extrinsic religiosity does not directly influence 
social entrepreneurial intention. Our model indicates that individuals’ intention to start a social enterprise partly 
depends on their extrinsic religiosity and subjective norms. Our findings present interesting theoretical implications 
for social entrepreneurship literature and practical implications for organizations that seek to promote 
entrepreneurship.

social entrepreneurial intention through subjective norms suggests that intrinsic dimensions of religion, such as values 
and beliefs, may act as deterrents towards starting a social enterprise in India. Our findings contribute to the limited 
literature that suggests the extrinsic dimension of religiosity, which focuses on belonging to one’s community and 
focusing on fulfilling social religious obligations, has a more positive influence on starting a social enterprise than the 
intrinsic dimension of religiosity, which focuses on beliefs, values, and rituals (believing and behaving) (e.g., 
Giacomin et al., 2022).  
 
5. Conclusion 
The main goal of this research is to explore and predict social entrepreneurial intention, focusing on two motivational 
aspects of religiosity—intrinsic and extrinsic—as well as subjective norms. The proposed model demonstrated a good 
fit. Among the five hypotheses tested, only two were not supported, while the remaining three received strong support. 
This research has theoretical and pragmatic implications too. First, it shows that extrinsically motivated religious 
individuals adhere to subjective norms related to social entrepreneurship and are more prone to start a social enterprise.  
Second, we provide an empirical contribution by testing our model in an Eastern context that includes an understudied 
country, such as India, with a focus on non-Abrahamic religious affiliations. Thus, we add to the very limited literature 
on religion and entrepreneurship, which has focused on Western developed countries with their dominant religion as 
Christianity (Rietveld and Hoogendoorn, 2022). Third, this paper, with its multi-focus on intrinsic and extrinsic 
religiosity and subjective norms, fulfils the calls of past researchers to consider multiple psychological determinants 
simultaneously to develop a holistic and deeper understanding of social entrepreneurial intentions (Balog et al., 2014). 
It also contributes theoretically towards a limited literature that emphasizes a simultaneous focus on religiosity and 
norms while understanding individual occupational decisions (e.g., Cai and Shi, 2019).

Abstract 
Toll roads are critical public infrastructure that drive economic growth and regional development. However, due to 
Indonesia geographical location which is characterized by its position on the Pacific Ring of Fire, toll roads are 
vulnerable to natural disasters, particularly landslides. Despite the government's efforts to improve infrastructure 
resilience, research focused on toll road resilience remains limited. This study aims to develop a methodology to 
investigate several factors that affecting toll roads resilience to landslide in Indonesia using quantitative approach. The 
data collected using a Likert scale through a structured questionnaire based on purposive sampling technique. 
Respondents involved in this research are professionals which have experience in the planning, construction, and 
management of toll roads. Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) is used to uncover and classify the variables into several 
key factors impacting toll road resilience. In addition to the research methodology, this paper presents a preliminary 
survey result of the research by determining relevant variables that have been identified from literature. According to 
the preliminary survey, 18 variables were considered relevant for this research and will be used in the main survey. 
This research provides a theoretical framework for enhancing toll road resilience in Indonesia by understanding critical 
factors which influence to toll road resilience to recover from landslide hazard. The results offer practical insights and 
policy recommendations for improving disaster risk management and infrastructure sustainability.

Abstract 
This study explores the intricate relationship between gender equity and diversity in academia, arguing that these two 
goals are not mutually exclusive or independent, but rather intricately intertwined. While existing discourse on gender 
equity in academia primarily focuses on the obstacles women face within the academic system, and discussions on 
diversity in academia concentrate on barriers preventing underrepresented groups from entering academia, this study 
contends that an intersectional framework is crucial for understanding and addressing inequalities within academic 
institutions. 
Drawing on the concept of intersectionality (Crenshaw, 1989), our research applies process mining methodology (Van 
der Aalst, 2016) to examine the inequalities prevalent among tenured academic staff in Israel. We collected data from 
one university and one college sites, encompassing 371 tenure-track members, and utilized the Celonis software to 
create a dashboard for comprehensive data analysis and visualization. Building upon prior research (Gigi, Nagar-Ron, 
Yehuda, and Razi, 2020), which highlighted the importance of intersectional analysis in understanding gender, 
ethnicity, and nationality dynamics among academic staff, we further expose the ethno-gendered and national-
gendered nature of inequality.  
By mapping the composition of the academic workforce and their promotion processes based on intersecting factors 
such as gender, ethnicity, and nationality, our study offers unique insights and demonstrates the potential of new 
measures in the Israeli context and worldwide. The application of process mining techniques, combined with the use 
of the Celonis software, enables a detailed review of the collected data, providing measures as advancement path and 
period of time between ranks in combination with demographic data. It enables comprehensive understanding of the 
power dynamics and obstacles hindering true and sustainable equality in academic institutions. Additionally, our 
findings shed light on disparities in representation and advancement between first-tier academic institutions 
(universities) and second-tier ones (colleges).

The representation of Arab faculty members remained disproportionately low across all faculties, falling far short of 
their 15% share in the broader working society. Most Arab faculty members were concentrated in the Faculty of 
Humanities and Social Sciences, with limited progression to higher academic ranks. At Ben-Gurion University, Arab 
faculty comprised only 5% of associate professors, with no Arab professors at Sapir College. These findings 
emphasize the need for proactive measures to ensure equitable opportunities for Arab academics. 
 
Longitudinal analysis of promotion timelines further illuminated disparities in career advancement. Women at Ben-
Gurion University faced significant delays, averaging nearly two years longer than men to achieve associate professor 
status. These delays highlight the persistence of gender-based barriers hindering career progression. 
 
Similarly, Mizrahi faculty members experienced substantial delays in reaching senior lecturer positions, particularly 
at Sapir College, where the delay was nearly two years compared to their Ashkenazi counterparts. These findings raise 
concerns about ethnicity-based inequities within the academic system, underscoring the need for institutional reforms 
to promote fairness in career advancement. 
 
Overall, this study reveals the intersecting dimensions of gender, ethnicity, and academic progression, offering a 
comprehensive understanding of the systemic barriers within Israeli academia. Addressing these disparities requires a 
multifaceted approach, including data-driven policy interventions, mentorship programs, and institutional 
commitment to diversity and inclusion. By implementing these measures, academic institutions can foster a more 
equitable and thriving environment that benefits both faculty members and the broader academic community. 
 
8. Conclusion 
This study highlights the significant influence of demographic factors such as gender, ethnicity, and religion on 
academic promotion processes, revealing systemic barriers that hinder equity. By employing process mining 
techniques, we identified prolonged promotion timelines for women and Mizrahi faculty, demonstrating the utility of 
innovative analytical tools in uncovering hidden disparities. The research successfully met all its objectives, including 
the development of a novel database, dynamic dashboards, and an equality index to evaluate diversity within academic 
institutions. 
 
The project achieved its primary goal of creating a robust platform for data collection and analysis. This platform 
integrates a comprehensive database with dimension and fact tables, designed to support future expansions to include 
additional institutions. Using the Celonis software, we developed an interactive dashboard capable of detailed, real-
time analysis of promotion processes, facilitating the identification of gaps and opportunities for equity improvements. 
 
A key outcome of this work is the development of an equality index that compares the demographic composition of 
academic staff with the broader workforce. This tool provides academic institutions with actionable insights to assess 
and enhance their diversity efforts. It also offers a comparative framework for tracking progress toward inclusivity at 
both institutional and national levels. 
 
While this study is limited to data from two institutions—Ben-Gurion University and Sapir Academic College—it 
establishes a scalable foundation for future research. Expanding the database to include more institutions will enable 
broader evaluations of diversity in Israeli academia, contributing to the development of national strategies for equity 
and inclusion. 
 
The tools, insights, and indices generated by this research offer significant potential for driving institutional reforms 
and fostering a more inclusive academic environment. By addressing the disparities identified, academic institutions 
can enhance fairness, support underrepresented groups, and strengthen the broader academic community.

Abstract 
The integration of Circular Economy (CE) practices with Industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies has significant potential for 
advancing sustainability goals across various industries. This study explores the synergies between CE and I4.0 
technologies, focusing on their role in enhancing waste reduction, resource efficiency, and sustainability. While CE 
aims to decouple growth from resource consumption and close loops adopting I4.0 technologies such as Big Data, 
Artificial intelligence, and Robotics can optimize operational processes and improve decision-making. However, 
research on the systematic integration of these concepts remains limited. This study proposes a conceptual framework, 
developed through a comprehensive literature review, that bridges the gap between CE and Sustainable Performance 
(SP), moderated by I4.0 technologies. By highlighting their combined potential, the framework provides a structured 
approach to achieving sustainability across the micro, meso, and macro levels of CE, as well as the economic, social, 
and environmental dimensions of SP. This paper contributes to the literature by providing new insights into how I4.0 
technologies can enhance CE practices and foster long-term sustainable outcomes while addressing critical gaps in 
integrating these concepts within various industrial sectors.

Abstract 
This paper evaluates the effectiveness of manufacturing systems operating under random failures and quality 
disturbances. Each manufactured part was inspected to be good or non-conforming. The non-conforming parts can be 
scrapped or reworked, considering its implications on system effectiveness. Three quality strategies are considered 
depending on specific industrial contexts: 1- reworking non-conforming parts until they meet specifications, 
2- reworking parts with the possibility of scrapping them, and 3- scrapping parts even when they could be reworked.
To analyze and evaluate the dynamic and stochastic behavior of these manufacturing systems, the paper presents
analytical formulations based on a Markov chain approach. Simulation models replicating the real dynamic and
stochastic behavior of these production systems were developed to validate the accuracy of the proposed analytical
formulations. Finally, comparative studies, based on system effectiveness and economic aspects, were carried out
between these considered quality strategies.

1. Introduction
Given that the manufacturing ecosystem has become increasingly competitive over the past ten years, numerous 
corporations must adopt Industry 4.0 technologies, that involve AI, IoT, simulation, flexible manufacturing systems 
(FMS) with autonomous robots, AGVs, AS/RS, and Additive Manufacturing machines, in an effort to enhance their 
productivity and the quality of their goods (Abdullah et al. 2022; Ghobakhloo 2018; Dhouib and Ait-Kadi 1994; Wang 
et al. 2016). In this context, achieving high manufacturing effectiveness is crucial for meeting market demands and 
maintaining competitiveness. However, inherent imperfections in production processes, such as non-conforming parts, 
pose significant challenges (Soares et al., 2021). Once detected, these non-conforming parts require critical decisions: 
either they are rejected as scrap or reworked to meet required standards. To address these challenges, companies need 
strategies that not only resolve immediate issues but also optimize resources, reduce waste, and ensure long-term 
sustainability.

This analysis supports strategic decision-making by comparing unit costs and effectiveness while considering quality 
and cost parameters. For example, in additive manufacturing or process molding, reworking a defective part is cost-
effective when the defect is small and can be easily fixed, such as in the case of surface polishing. However, for larger 
defects, like a crack in an engine part or a misalignment in a mold (Figure 7), reworking may require expensive 
procedures like welding and testing. In such cases, rejecting the part and making a new one is often cheaper.

7. Conclusion   
This study evaluated the effectiveness of unreliable manufacturing systems by examining different approaches 
considering quality issues, including rework and scrap. A new Markov chain model was proposed to assess the system 
effectiveness where non-conforming parts are scrapped even when rework is possible. This model was validated 
through comparison with simulation results. The proposed approach is also compared against strategies that prioritize 
rework. 
 
The results reveal that systems employing rework consistently outperform those relying solely on scrap in terms of 
effectiveness, regardless of the quality parameters α and β. Interestingly, under certain conditions, the rework-with-
scrap approach exhibited effectiveness levels comparable to the scrap-only strategy. 
 
Although rework theoretically offers significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, it also incurs additional costs 
that, in some cases, may exceed the costs associated with rejection of non-compliant products. 
 
These findings highlight the need to align the chosen approach with the specific objectives of the manufacturing 
system, whether it is to maximize effectiveness or optimize costs. Future research could delve deeper into the cost 
implications of these strategies and expand the models to address more complex production environments, including 
multi-products, multi-machines, and buffer stocks. Adding environmental considerations could further enhance the 
models by addressing sustainability challenges, balancing resource use and material consumption, and reducing 
emissions. This aligns global sustainability goals and promotes eco-efficient manufacturing systems.

1. Introduction
Indonesia's creative industry, encompassing 16 sectors, including crafts, is pivotal in the nation's economy. The craft 
sector, in particular, has demonstrated a significant economic impact. During the pandemic, local craft products 
contributed approximately 14.9% to Indonesia's Gross Domestic Product or GDP (International Binus, 2024). This 
underscores the sector's resilience and importance in sustaining economic stability. Moreover, the creative industry 
has substantially contributed to Indonesia's non-oil and gas exports. Between 2014 and 2015, exports from the creative 
industries accounted for 6.60% of the country's non-oil and gas exports (Husin et al., 2021). This highlights the global 
demand and competitiveness of Indonesian craft products.

6. Conclusion 
Based on the web scraping results, UMKM X achieved the highest rating of 4.6, with 442 visitors. This rating is 
relatively superior to that of other MSMEs in the Kasongan tourism village. The 7P analysis further reveals that 
product and physical evidence are the most dominant elements highlighted in customer reviews. Regarding the 
product, the innovation of workshops that provide a meaningful and memorable experience for visitors emerged as 
the most frequently mentioned aspect in customer reviews. Meanwhile, in terms of physical evidence, the key 
highlights include clean and comfortable facilities and aesthetic and Instagram-worthy decorations. 
 
Additionally, a correlation was observed between the product and physical evidence elements, indicating their mutual 
influence and strong appeal to customers. Furthermore, a correlation was also identified between the place and process 
components. These 7P analysis and correlation study findings offer valuable insights for other MSMEs. For instance, 
in the product-physical evidence relationship, businesses can balance their focus on product quality and facility 
aesthetics by ensuring that product quality—such as design, durability, and functionality of pottery—remains the top 
priority while enhancing facility aesthetics. This should be supported by strict quality control measures to maintain 
customer satisfaction. Similarly, in the place-process relationship, businesses can optimize facility layouts by 
providing clear signage or directional guidance, making it easier for customers to access specific services or products.

Abstract 
This article presents the design and evaluation of an improvement proposal to optimize productivity in the warehouse 
of a tissue products company by applying 5S, SLP, and TPM tools. Issues such as waiting times, outdated signage, an 
inefficient cleaning schedule, delays in product transfers, and packaging process failures were identified. These 
deficiencies hinder productivity improvements, increase operational costs, and reduce the overall efficiency of the 
warehouse. After diagnosis, the implementation of the 5S methodology was proposed to instill a culture of order and 
cleanliness, reducing waiting times and improving product transfers. A warehouse layout restructuring using SLP 
aimed to optimize transfer times. Additionally, TPM integration sought to minimize errors and failures in dispatch 
and supplementary packaging activities, encouraging active employee participation in maintenance tasks and ensuring 
equipment operates in optimal condition. The combined implementation of these methodologies achieved a reduction 
in idle time to 7%; audit compliance increased to 82.40%; the average product transfer time decreased by 9%; 
interruptions in supplementary packaging dropped from 3 to 1, and issues with transfer equipment reduced from 4 to 
2 within a two-month period.

1. Introduction
Several factors contributing to operational inefficiency in the warehouse were identified. One issue was the higher-
than-usual delay rates compared to other industry warehouses, as demonstrated by a similar study (Ramadhan et al., 
2021). This condition resulted in increased waiting times and operational inefficiencies. Additionally, inadequate 
signage within the warehouse led to worker disorientation, delays in locating and handling products, disrupted 
workflow, and a heightened risk of operational errors. 
Another significant issue was excessive transfer times for high-rotation products. These delays not only slowed the 
order preparation process but also increased operational costs and limited productivity during dispatch operations. 
Furthermore, identifying a periodic preventive maintenance program highlighted the opportunity to improve it by 
implementing a continuous maintenance schedule with greater commitment and participation from warehouse 
management and operational staff.

5. Discussion 
When comparing the obtained results with other findings, we observe, firstly, that for the 5S component, Veres et al. 
(2018) in their research propose acceptable levels of compliance—those above 80%—demonstrating that such 
values positively impact productivity incrementally from 90%. 
 
On the other hand, Ramadhan et al. (2021), in their study conducted with their research team, applied tools similar to 
the SLP method used in our work and calculated a 10% reduction in times with their proposed layout for the Baruna 
Trayindo Jaya plant, dedicated to the production of support components and cable accessories. This result is 
comparable to our study's 9% reduction. 
 
It is important to note that for both the 5S and SLP components applied to a warehouse with a high number of 
transfers, the significance of the improvement becomes evident due to the cumulative effect of small time savings 
across a large number of repeated operations, as noted by L. Wilson (2010) in their publication. 
 
Finally, the results obtained for the TPM component, by reducing interruptions due to defects or errors, ensure 
operational continuity. This methodology allows for sustained improvement of Overall Equipment Effectiveness 
(OEE) values, as highlighted in Canahua's (2021) study. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The integrated implementation of the 5S, SLP, and TPM models constitutes an effective strategy for optimizing 
warehouse productivity by creating a more organized, efficient, and safe working environment, promoting the efficient 
use of available resources. The 5S methodology, by encouraging cleanliness and order, contributes to an appropriate 
organization of the workspace, resulting in a significant reduction in idle times and errors during storage and picking 
processes. 
 
Additionally, the optimized layout proposed through the SLP approach reduces product transfer times to the picking 
area, thereby increasing daily dispatch productivity. Adopting a continuous maintenance plan based on the TPM 
approach improves the availability of machinery, such as packaging machines and transfer equipment, by reducing 
failures and operational errors while fostering a preventive maintenance culture that ensures long-term operational 
sustainability. 
 
These results align with findings reported in specialized literature, validating the initial proposal, and reinforcing the 
effectiveness of this integrated approach to improving warehouse management. 
 
Finally, this research opens the door to exploring technological initiatives such as digital twin emulation or 
representation for innovation in warehouse management.

Abstract 
Service sector companies face operational challenges such as prolonged waiting times and failures in critical 
equipment, which impact service quality and customer service capacity. These inefficiencies, often stemming from 
poor resource allocation and reactive maintenance management, result in high operational costs and reduced user 
satisfaction. This study proposes an integrated approach that combines queueing theory-based simulation, hybrid 
metaheuristic optimization tools like OptQuest, and the implementation of a preventive maintenance program. 
Through modeling in Arena software, various operational configurations were evaluated, identifying practical 
solutions that significantly reduce waiting times, enhance operational efficiency, and ensure service continuity. This 
article contributes to the development of replicable strategies for service companies, emphasizing the importance of 
integrating simulation, optimization, and preventive maintenance as pillars to increase service capacity and quality in 
various contexts.

1. Introduction
Resource optimization and the reduction of inefficiencies are priorities for service sector companies, especially in 
healthcare, where responsiveness and service quality are critical. According to Gómez et al. (2021), proper 
management of resources and medical equipment can minimize operational disruptions, directly impacting customer 
care quality. Additionally, Chatwin and Klein (2020) emphasize that preventive strategies in equipment maintenance 
not only ensure operational continuity but also optimize long-term costs. 
In this context, simulation emerges as an effective tool for modeling and analyzing complex processes in dynamic 
environments. Kelton et al. (2015) highlight that discrete event simulation enables the evaluation of stochastic systems 
and the testing of multiple configurations before implementation. Moreover, tools like OptQuest, which are based on 
hybrid metaheuristic techniques, optimize resource allocation and improve operational efficiency (Andersen et al., 
2019). The integration of these technologies with a preventive maintenance program has proven particularly useful in 
the healthcare sector, where equipment reliability is crucial for ensuring continuous service (Nacarino Guevara, 2022).

6. Conclusions 
Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that optimizing operational processes at Servimedic is feasible 
through the implementation of strategies based on simulation, preventive maintenance, and metaheuristic 
optimization. These tools have proven effective in addressing critical issues such as prolonged waiting times and 
recurring failures in medical equipment, significantly improving system efficiency, profitability, and stability. 
The integration of preventive maintenance with simulation modeling ensured the operational continuity of critical 
equipment, while resource optimization using OptQuest facilitated efficient personnel allocation and queue reduction. 
This comprehensive approach not only resolved major operational deficiencies but also strengthened service capacity 
and quality. 
In summary, this research utilized simulation models and optimization techniques to enhance operational management 
in the service sector, proposing a replicable framework that fosters efficient and sustainable practices in organizations 
facing similar challenges.

Abstract 
While temporary medical facilities play a critical role in earthquake preparedness and immediate response, they remain 
underexplored in research on facility location problems. Addressing this gap, we present a decision support system 
(DSS) designed to assist local municipalities in positioning emergency treatment sites (ETS), which are temporary 
medical facilities set up near destruction zones to provide immediate care for minor injuries. These temporary sites 
aim to manage minor injuries (accounting for over 80% of casualties) and alleviate the burden on hospitals 
immediately after an earthquake. The proposed DSS integrates a location network characterization with a hybrid 
simulation/optimization model to determine the number and optimal locations of ETSs. It delivers recommendations 
within seconds, making it suitable as both an emergency response and a preparedness planning tool. Key components 
of the DSS include a GIS-based database, a decision engine, and a user-friendly interface. A preliminary feasibility 
study conducted with a local municipality demonstrated encouraging results. The mathematical model identified 
optimal locations for emergency treatment sites, while simulations validated these choices across various destruction 
scenarios. This collaboration not only strengthens the DSS’s practicality but also lays the groundwork for broader 
implementation as a scalable solution for improving earthquake response.

Abstract 
Process improvement is a critical endeavor for organizations seeking to achieve sustainable performance in today's 
competitive market. However, a high failure rate of about two-thirds of process improvement projects remains a 
significant concern, negatively affecting organizational resources and undermining performance. Leadership emerges 
as one of the most vital factors influencing the success or failure of these initiatives. This study explores the role of 
leadership in contributing to process improvement project failures and highlights the technical and non-technical skills 
essential for reducing such failures. To achieve this objective, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 
process improvement practitioners from the manufacturing and service sectors. The findings reveal key leadership 
roles in failures, including lack of interest and support, ineffective communication, poor understanding of team 
dynamics, and inappropriate leadership styles. Additionally, the study identifies skills such as statistical analysis, 
structured problem-solving, communication, adaptability, and emotional intelligence, which are critical to driving 
process improvement teams toward success. Organizations can use the insights from this study to assess the 
competencies of their process improvement teams and design skills development training programs to bridge any gaps, 
focusing on the specific skills needed for successful improvement outcomes.

4. Discussion and Conclusion
This study highlights the critical role of leadership in shaping the success or failure of process improvement projects. 
The findings highlight several leadership deficiencies contributing to failure, including lack of active involvement and 
visible support, misalignment of process improvement initiatives with organizational strategy, and insufficient 
alignment of process improvement and long-term goals. This aligns with (Antony et al., 2022; Bader et al., 2023), 
who identify such deficiencies as critical failure factors. Inadequate communication and a failure to empower teams 
were identified as critical leadership shortcomings that undermine motivation, creativity, and accountability. Hence, 
effective leadership extends beyond simply guiding teams; it involves aligning organizational priorities, fostering 
collaboration between operational and improvement teams, and ensuring sustained interest in process improvement 
initiatives. Leaders need to adapt their leadership styles according to the situations and challenges they face. This 
underscores the need for leaders to be dynamic, aware, and responsive, ensuring their approach aligns with both the 
immediate challenges and long-term objectives of their organization. 
To address these challenges, the study emphasizes developing technical skills such as statistical analysis and problem-
solving and non-technical skills such as communication, collaboration, and team building for effective process 
improvement implementations in accordance with (Netland, 2016). Still, our findings underscore a shift towards more 
holistic, adaptable, and people-centric skills in process improvement roles. The study emphasizes the importance of 
understanding the specific industry in which process improvement project is applied to tailor the methodologies to the 
unique challenges and processes within a sector. Proficiency in software tools like Minitab and SPSS is essential for 
data-driven decision-making, allowing practitioners to conduct advanced statistical analysis, monitor process 
performance, and generate actionable insights to drive improvements. As process improvement projects often involve 
uncertainty, the ability to assess, mitigate, and manage risks is becoming increasingly important to anticipate potential 
issues, create contingency plans, and minimize the impact of unforeseen challenges. Adaptability is crucial in today’s 
fast-paced business environment. A mindset of continuous learning is essential for both personal and organizational 
growth. Process improvement practitioners must be committed to staying updated on new methodologies, tools, and 
best practices to drive ongoing process improvements and ensure long-term success. Beyond problem-solving, 
practitioners need the ability to think critically and innovatively. This allows them to approach complex challenges 
from multiple angles, find creative solutions, and drive forward-thinking improvements.  
This study serves as part of a larger effort to address process improvement project failures, contributing to the broader 
field by offering insights into the intricate relationship between leadership and project success. By integrating these 
findings, organizations can focus on equipping leaders with the necessary competencies to overcome common failure 
factors, enhance team performance, and achieve sustainable improvements. However, the study’s findings are based 
on qualitative data from interviews that are subjective and may reflect participant biases. The limited sample size and

Abstract 
Despite the provisions of the Maternity Benefits Act of 1961, which was revised in 2017 to improve gender equality, 
Indian women contract workers still encounter legal obstacles while trying to obtain maternity benefits. The 
experiences of eleven contract nurses working at a tertiary hospital in Karnataka, India, are investigated in this study. 
Focus group interviews were used to collect the data, and NVivo software was used to facilitate thematic analysis 
and improve data display. The results highlight important problems, such as monetary, legal, and procedural 
difficulties made worse by organizational behaviors including unauthorized service outages and document 
falsification. Cluster analysis demonstrates how systemic defects impede workers' rights by highlighting interrelated 
issues including employment verification, contractual duties, and legal restrictions. Despite the existence of statutory 
benefits, insufficient enforcement measures uphold disparities and put women in hazardous working environments. 
The report emphasizes how urgently policies must be put into practice. By offering practical suggestions for 
increasing maternity leave, guaranteeing fair treatment of contract employees, and promoting workplace diversity, 
the findings add to the conversation on labour rights.

1. Introduction
India has a huge number of employees who work on contract. There are still often denied things like maternity 
benefits. The Maternity Benefit Act of 1961 is quite progressive; yet there are multiple ways the organized sector has 
always distorted it. Hence, such institutional restrictions and informal pacts through which employers exploit contract 
workers by denying them their legal rights are more likely to afflict them. And these moves deny contract workers 
benefits that the act entitles them to, such as paid time off. Contract employees do not have employment protection 
and no medical bonus on childbirth (Gethe and Pandey 2023). 
Earlier the Act provided for (Sec 12 A) 2017 amendment of the act increased maternity leave to 26 weeks from 
original 12 week reflecting progressive policy changes. This increases alongside several of the other improvements–
such as nursing breaks, childcare services, and work-from-home opportunities. Its aim to promote equality between 
genders as well as the welfare of mothers in business world. Notably, this is regardless of the fact that all businesses 
in the formal sector with ten or more employees are completely covered (K Mahalakshmi S 2023). However, they 
still face enormous gaps in execution. 
Judgments like Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Female Workers (Muster Roll) have stressed on the fact that a 
person's entitlement to maternity rights cannot be impacted based on their nature of employment. Challenging the

6. Conclusion 
This research reveals that systemic issues exist regarding contract workers entitlement to maternity leave benefits 
under the scheme of female employees. The cluster analysis of the themes shows the interconnected procedural, 
financial and judicial hurdles; thus, a proper evaluation of barriers to worker’s labour rights become possible. 
The findings emphasize the need for policy reforms, organizational accountability, and further research to fill the 
gap between policy and practice. With the removal of systemic barriers identified, employees can work towards a 
more equitable and supportive environment for working women, especially those in precarious employment.

1. Introduction
Supply chain refers to the network of organizations, activities, resources, and technologies involved in producing and 
distributing goods and services from raw materials to end consumers. The supply chain covers all the processes 
required to design, source, manufacture, and deliver products or services. The key components of a supply chain start 
with the suppliers who provide the raw materials needed for production next comes the manufacturers who convert 
the raw materials into the finished products, and then going to the distributors who handle all the logistics of

Abstract 
This study explored the factors that contribute to the adoption of E-Wallet transactions among Micro Enterprises in 
Metro Manila, Philippines. The target businesses are Micro Enterprises in Metro Manila. The chosen participants are 
limited only to 145 chosen Micro Enterprises which are determined by using stratified simple random sampling. The 
study adopted the framework from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology Model (UTAUT) 
containing variables: Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating Conditions, 
Behavioral Intention, and Use Behavior. Results showed that 64.8% of the businesses fell into the revenue bracket of 
less than Php 500,000 while 75.2% of the responses have been in business for 3 years and below 60% of the responses 
are in the accommodation and food services industry and 72.4% of the responses are single proprietorship. 
Furthermore, it was revealed that the Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, Facilitating 
Conditions, Behavioral Intention, and Use Behavior, have significant moderate and positive relationships on the 
adoption of E-wallets, with p-values below 0.05. Lastly, the adoption of E-Wallet has significant difference found in 
terms of the Business Profile, particularly between Sole proprietor and Partnership. These results were utilized in the 
formation of recommendations, specifically, in the formation of Tailored Strategy for Micro Enterprises, Strategic 
Framework for policymakers, and Roadblocks Mitigation Recommendations.

their shopping process. Digital payments have undergone a transformation unlike any other industries, resulting in a 
wide range of options and benefits. Cash is the established and widely used payment method in the Philippines, as it 
is in many other countries. In any event, the fact that noncash payments are rapidly increasing, especially those made 
via electronic or digital methods, is reassuring.   
Cashless transactions are an exchange between individuals, businesses, or organizations through electronic or online 
platforms. A cashless transaction is considered as a digital transaction wherein no physical cash is used to accomplish 
a transaction. Digital transactions have various courses of action such as purchasing products through e-commerce 
platforms, purchasing prepaid load, and concert tickets with the use of a mobile application. These services are

use the advantages offered by E-wallets, thereby enhancing the overall transaction system within their business 
operations. As a business entity, it is strongly encouraged to align with the prevailing consumer preferences and 
demands to remain competitive in the market. This study offers valuable insights for businesses, enabling them to 
comprehend the prevailing consumer preference for upcoming trends. Specific strategies are therefore recommended: 
• 
Adoption of E-wallets by these micro enterprises to reduce dependencies on the cash payments, hence 
improving financial tracking and transparency and to ensure adoption, cash back strategies should be offered 
to entice new users. 
• 
Leverage on E-wallet features such as QR codes to simplify payments by printing and displaying cards at the 
counter for easy access and payment. 
• 
Transaction history should be leveraged to improve and/or streamline financial tracking, specifically the cash 
flow and inventory tracking. This can be worked side-by-side with various analytics platforms, for easy 
analysis of operations and sales of these micro enterprises. 
• 
Another key feature that can be maximized is the In-App marketing tool dedicated to businesses, helping 
these micro enterprises to optimize sales activities by leveraging discounts, cashbacks, as well as push 
notifications for proactive promotion. 
 
Strategic Framework for Policymakers: 
Given the findings, both the national and local governments should spearhead the task of E-wallets integration by 
these micro enterprises to ensure the attainment of high scale adoption by society, attaining a digital society. Specific 
strategies are therefore recommended: 
• 
Strategic implementation of tax incentives to the micro enterprises who will integrate E-wallets into their 
system. This requires the help of the Business Processing and Licensing Office (BPLO) by actively 
monitoring these micro enterprises.  
• 
Government agencies and arms such as BLPO, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), and other bureaus 
under the Department of Finance (DOF), should spearhead the task of organizing regular webinars and 
workshops, aimed at promoting digital financial literacy and inclusion, to ensure the widespread adoption of 
E-wallets from both the businesses and the consumers. 
 
Roadblocks Mitigation Recommendations: 
The goal of this recommendation is to improve the level of trust as well as digital literacy, pivotal in reinforcing the 
adoption rate of E-wallets. 
• 
Overcoming Cost Barriers:  
o 
Consortium should be made between the fintech firms digital payment providers to offer fee waivers 
such as transfer fees for first few quarters for MSME who integrated the E-Wallet for the first time.  
o 
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) should provide 
incentives and subsidies such as transaction volume-based tax rebates for the MSMEs, specifically 
in the form of refundable tax credits which depend on the volume of digital transactions by these 
businesses.  
• 
Security & Fraud Prevention:  
o 
Launch monthly webinars to improve the digital literacy of both MSMEs and consumers, regarding 
the most common as well as new fraud schemes such as phishing via SMS high-jacking, and fake 
payment confirmations which can be mobilized primarily by the Department of Information and 
Communications Technology (DICT). 
o 
Implement a dedicated fraud support helpline by institutionalizing a 24/7 fraud hotline to cater to 
the specialized needs of MSMEs. This will allow the businesses to promptly report suspicious and/ 
or anomalous transactions. This will potentially increase the consumers’ confidence in using the 
digital payment platforms. 
As a direction for future research, this study can serve as a valuable resource for future researchers seeking to 
advance the understanding and development of e-wallet use in various enterprises, including Small Enterprises, 
Medium Enterprises, or MSMEs in general. Future researchers may consider examining the potential benefits of 
increasing the sample size and focus their research on alternative regions within the Philippines that exhibit a 
substantial concentration of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), such as Region 4A - 
CALABARZON and Region 3 - Central Luzon, and more based on the 2022 List of Establishments (LE) of the

Abstract 
Reverse logistics (RL) activities carried out by informal businesspeople are growing very fast. Even though improve 
the welfare, but they are often labeled as reducing environmental quality. For environmental reasons, they often 
become targets for extortion by irresponsible government officials. This research aims to determine the most possible 
engagement model for this business group to implement RL activities, so that business performance, especially 
environmental factor, increases. In this research, the model is divided into three groups, namely involvement, 
collaboration, and empowerment. Meanwhile, business performance is measured using six dimensions, namely 
financial, internal business processes, innovation and growth, stakeholders' value, social and environment. Using the 
structural equation modeling and applying second order confirmatory analysis, this research succeeded in identifying 
models to engage in green RL activities. The best indicators that describe each dimension are: for involvement model, 
first, the purpose of doing business is for profit, save the environment, and positive social impact; second, only carry 
out safe processing methods; third, minimize direct contact to e-waste. The best collaboration that can be implemented 
between businesspeople and the government or electronics manufacturers is professional business development; 
provision of affordable simple technology machines; and profit-sharing system in cooperation. All empowerment 
indicators meet the loading factor requirements, but the best two illustrate this dimension are investing in component 
shredders and smoke filter machines. By running SmartPLS software, this research has proven that the engagement 
models in RL activities formulated in this research has a positive effect in improving the performance of e-waste 
processing businesses.

1. Introduction
The electronic waste (e-waste) processing business boomed in 2010 – 2015 and continues to run today (Maheswari et 
al., 2017). This business growth is in line with the growth in the amount of world e-waste which has reached 53.6 
million tons and is predicted to increase by 38% by the end of 2030 (Forti et al., 2020). Indonesia as the highest 
contributor of e-waste in Southeast Asia, reaching 1,618 kilotons/day, has undoubtedly become a very fertile place for 
the growth of this business (Rahmanda et al., 2023). Another factor that is driving the rapid growth of this business is 
the low level of education and limited skills of marginalized community groups, so that it is difficult for them to work 
in the formal sector and some are forced to choose to work in the informal sector to engage in this business.  
As is known, electronic waste still contains a lot of high-value metals such as PCBs from computers, cellphones, 
processors, RAM, mother boards/main boards, hard disks, computer sockets, ICs, chip cards, memory, electrical

A high R-Square value does not guarantee a fit model to measure the influence of exogenous constructs on endogenous 
constructs. Therefore, it is still necessary to conduct a goodness of fit test by calculating the SRMR and NFI. Based 
on the results shown in Table 9, the SRMR value is 0.027 < 0.08 and the NFI is 0.948 > 0.70. Thus, the research model 
is truly fit and the final stage, path coefficient estimation, can be carried out, by looking at the P-values and T-values.

From Table 10, it can be explained that the engagement model has a positive and significant effect on business 
performance of 80.9%. This means, if the e-waste processing business applies predetermined engagement models 
(involvement, collaboration, empowerment), then business performance as measured by financial, internal business 
processes, innovation and growth, stakeholders' value, social and environmental will increase.

6. Conclusion  
This study aims to prove that the engagement of e-waste processing businesses in the form of involvement, 
collaboration, and empowerment when running reverse logistics activities can improve business performance. The 
business objectives of seeking profit, protecting the environment, and providing a positive social impact are sought to 
be balanced by all business actors. Some of them are also trying to reduce direct contact by independently making 
traditional component e-waste shredding machines. Although there is one indicator of the environmental dimension 
that must be removed from the model. The existence of a business is identical with a dirty and messy place. However, 
the results of the structural model second stage testing have proven that the engagement model has a large and 
significant positive influence on the performance of e-waste processing businesses.

Abstract 
One of the primary solutions to reduce carbon emissions is to increase the adoption of electric vehicles. Electric 
motorcycle conversion workshops play a crucial role in facilitating this transition. However, customer satisfaction 
often suffers due to a lack of understanding of customer needs and expectations. This study aims to utilize the 
Customer Journey Map (CJM) as a strategic tool to enhance customer satisfaction within electric motorcycle 
conversion workshops. The research methodology involved collecting data through in-depth interviews, observations, 
and questionnaires administered to both customers and workshop staff. Data analysis focused on identifying the stages 
of the customer journey (awareness, consideration, decision, service, post-service), pain points, and opportunities for 
improvement at each stage. The results demonstrate that the CJM effectively identifies key issues, such as a lack of 
clear initial information, uncertainty during the conversion process, and minimal post-sales service communication. 
By leveraging the CJM, strategies such as enhancing information transparency, developing a more responsive 
communication system, and providing education on the benefits and usage of electric motorcycles are recommended. 
Implementing these strategies not only improves customer satisfaction but also fosters stronger customer loyalty to 
workshop services.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Indonesia faces an urgent need to transition to electric vehicles (EVs) as part of its commitment to reducing carbon
emissions and achieving sustainable transportation (Pambudi & Juwono, 2024). With millions of conventional
motorcycles contributing to air pollution and fuel dependency, the government has introduced various regulations to
accelerate the adoption of electric mobility (Setiawan et al., 2022). One key initiative is the conversion of conventional 
motorcycles into electric motorcycles, which offers a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to

create a more seamless, transparent, and customer-friendly conversion process, ultimately increasing adoption rates 
for electric motorcycles. 
 
5.3 Connection to Survey Results 
The results of the customer satisfaction survey reinforce the need for a well-structured customer journey. From the 35 
surveyed customers, key issues were identified, including long processing times (average 3-4 weeks), lack of clear 
instructions for document submission, and inadequate communication regarding conversion status. Additionally, 
customers reported difficulties in accessing after-sales support, leading to frustration post-conversion. These findings 
highlight the disorganized nature of the current process, making it evident that a systematic approach like CJM is 
needed to enhance service delivery and improve customer trust. Addressing these issues through process 
standardization, automated status updates, and better customer support will significantly enhance customer satisfaction 
and loyalty. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Customer Journey Mapping serves as a strategic tool to identify and resolve service inefficiencies in electric 
motorcycle conversion workshops. The survey results indicate that a lack of structured processes and poor 
communication are major barriers to customer satisfaction. By implementing CJM-driven improvements, workshops 
can enhance transparency, reduce waiting times, and provide a more seamless customer experience. Ultimately, these 
enhancements will not only improve customer trust and retention but also contribute to the larger goal of accelerating 
Indonesia’s transition to electric mobility.

Abstract 
This study introduces an innovative approach to enhance marketing and sales processes within an energy services 
company operating in Colombia. Through the integration of Lean Six Sigma and System Dynamics simulation, we 
aimed to optimize efficiency and drive impactful improvements. Lean Six Sigma principles were applied to existing 
marking and sales operations, identifying bottlenecks, and an improved process was proposed. System dynamics is 
utilized to simulate and evaluate the potential impact of the proposed process, and found that sales can be increased 
by 50.84%, revenue can increase by 60.19%, and closing effectiveness can increase by 70.22%. The results indicate 
the benefit of utilizing engineering management tools in sales environments and provides a framework for 
decisionmakers to adopt and further enhance business environments thus fostering sustainable practices.

1. Introduction
In a globalized and changing world, the market has evolved day by day with the inclusion of various tools that have 
been developed throughout history to help companies grow and improve their processes. However, when it comes to 
sales and marketing processes, a paradigm has been generated based on the belief that if the sales team continues to 
provide an acceptable profit and reasonable commercial growth, there is no need to change. This thinking has made it 
impossible for sales organizations to understand their true potential and achieve extraordinary results. 
Due to the accelerated changes and competitiveness of the markets, today the value proposition must go beyond the 
delivery of a tangible good, given that the customer not only goes through the usual sales tunnel but also their needs 
are dynamic and diversified. This situation has posed new challenges for companies, which, in addition to delivering 
a product that meets the customer's needs, have also involved constant support and assistance on its use. For this 
reason, it is imperative to innovate so as not to stay in traditional and habitual practices that slow down processes and 
undermine organizations (Sancho 2013). 
In various organizations, sales are considered as an independent dependency, reflecting the specialized requirements 
necessary in this area to operate in an increasingly competitive and demanding environment (Vaid 2020). The term 
sales specifically refer to the set of activities that focus on the tactical management of groups of customers (Homburg 
et al. 2012), with the aim of exchanging a good, product, or service for a tacit benefit for the organization.

5. Conclusion 
This paper presented a hybrid model, combining Lean Six Sigma's DMAIC methodology and System Dynamics, as a 
tool to solve the problems identified in company’s sales process. The proposed improvements focused on the recovery 
of requests, the follow-up of failed sales and the improvement of marketing strategies. Then, through the System 
Dynamics simulation model, it was possible to validate these improvements and their impact on the company. The 
model can be replicated by other service companies interested in making strategic decisions around continuous 
improvement processes. The simulation results indicated that the best improvement strategy is to implement all three 
strategies that were proposed as they will lead to increased revenue and increased number of customer requests. To 
construct an effective model, it is important that the model accurately represents the characteristics of the studied 
system and that the model remains simple so that it is manageable.

Abstract 
This study examined the effects of Job Stressor, Job Resources, and Organizational Culture on Job Performance and 
Intention to Quit of 491 Account Managers (AMs), in the context Software as a Service (SaaS), using Covariance-
based Structural Equation Modelling (CB-SEM). Demographic results showed that majority of respondents fall into 
the 30-34 age bracket at 116 or 34%. In terms of gender, majority are female respondents at 248 or 51% of the total 
while there are 177 respondents that have 1-3 years of experience or 36% of total. CB-SEM results first showed the 
covariances among latent independent variables. First, Job Stressors have a significant moderate negative correlation 
with Organizational Culture. Also, Job Resources have a significant moderate negative correlation with Job Stressor. 
Then, Job Resources have a significant moderate positive correlation with Organizational Culture. Furthermore, the 
causal effect of independent variables on dependent variables were examined. First, it was revealed that Job Stressors 
have significant effects on both Job Performance and Intention to Quit. Also, Job Resources have significant effects 
on both Job Performance and Intention to Quit. Meanwhile, Organizational Culture has no significant effect on both 
Job Performance and Intention to Quit. It was further revealed that Job Resources is the strongest predictor of Job 
Performance and Intention to Quit while Job Stressors showed the least effect on Job Performance. These formed the 
basis of tailored Job Resources Integration and Well-Being programs aimed at addressing the structural issues 
surrounding the job performance and retention of AMs.

1. Introduction
Sales, as a cross-functional domain, is deemed to be a strategic and pivotal part of every organization’s organic revenue 
growth, acting as a barometer of their future success. Specifically, it enables the organization to ramp up their products 
and services offering through active pursuit of the prospective consumers. Although, it is undeniably one of the most 
demanding professions, regardless of the organization and industry, given that the professionals working in this respect 
are dealing with the tall order to constantly attain sales targets, handle rejections, and work in a highly fast-paced 
environment, which might compromise the well-being and the overall atmosphere of the organization.  
Given its existence across industries, this study’s focal point is the Software as a Service (SaaS), as one of the thriving 
industries in the Philippines. SaaS, as a cloud-based solution, focused on the delivery of software applications through 
the internet, typically on a pay-for-subscription business model. In fact, Statista postulated that the overall “SaaS’s

As observed from the conceptual CBA above, the benefits are primarily intangibles such as reduced stress and burnout 
as well as intention to quit, improved motivation, job satisfaction and job performance. On the other hand, the costs 
are primarily tangible such as the financial costs, trainers, external providers, as well as software and tools. Hence, in 
the absence of quantitative data that should fill this CBA, it still provides meaningful insights for the organizations to 
understand the viability of the recommendations of this study. 
 
Finally, future researchers should explore the potential of latent IVs to be used as mediators and moderators in the 
examination of Job Performance and Intention to Quit. Also, this study can be examined on other loci, or in other 
industry, given the potential differences in the societal dynamics, utilizing not only the cross-sectional data, as this 
study used, but also longitudinal or panel data, to provide deeper insights into the intertemporal changes in the 
dynamics.

Abstract 
With the proliferation of social media, the actions of companies during a socio-political controversy are under 
intense scrutiny by the public. Studies have been done showing that brand transparency is crucial to building 
consumer relationships. A gap was evident regarding the relationship of brand transparency regarding socio-political 
issues on the effect of brand perception in the purchase intention of consumers. 378 tertiary-level students from the 
five (5) college departments in LPU-Manila were asked to rate using a 4-point Likert scale each statement related to 
brand perception and brand transparency. To measure the respondents’ brand perception, the variable was 
subdivided into four identifiers derived from Keller’s brand equity model which are: Identity, Meaning, Response, 
and Relationship. To analyze brand transparency, it was subdivided into three descriptors: Opaqueness, 
Translucency, and Clarity. Linear regression was utilized and the interaction terms of the independent variables, 
brand perception and brand transparency, particularly opaqueness, translucency, and clarity, was added into the 
model. At a 5% level of significance, the results of the study revealed that as a moderator, brand transparency 
regarding socio-political issues does not play a significant role in the effect of brand perception on the purchase 
intention of customers. The findings suggest that companies must prioritize providing positive brand experiences as 
it can lead to forming positive signals in the consumer’s mind which trigger them to make a purchase intention. 
Moreover, findings suggest that brands should implement effective communication strategies that anchor on 
company values and mission to appeal and gain trust of Generation Z consumers.

1. Introduction
It has been disputed whether brands should be transparent regarding their stances on particular socio-political issues 
(Isaza, 2023). Taking a side in socio-political matters is deemed as a “double-edged sword” that could make or 
break the business (Bhagwat et al., 2020; Cammarota et al., 2023). To avoid risking their reputation, violating 
expectations, and causing a divide, brands choose to stay silent altogether (Oakes, 2023). They would rather cater to 
everybody equally than veer toward one side of the conversation and lose customers (Bailey, 2020). Moreover, 
brand perception emerges from the availability of information, and is vulnerable to misinterpretation and 
inaccessible to some (Kim, 2020; Yang & Battocchio, 2021; Sansome et al., 2024). To gauge brand perception, the 
researchers utilized Keller’s Brand Equity Model which shows the hierarchical process of building a strong brand

Abstract 
Computerized Provider Order Entry (CPOE) systems are vital in healthcare but often lead to alert fatigue due to 
excessive notifications. This research presents an adaptive alert management strategy using a fluid optimization 
model to dynamically adjust alert thresholds based on pharmacists' cognitive capacity. By tailoring alert 
presentation to reduce non-critical notifications, the approach aims to balance the trade-off between minimizing 
alert fatigue and maximizing patient safety. This strategy leverages real-world hospital data to refine decision 
thresholds, reducing the alert burden while maintaining clinical relevance. The findings offer a pathway to more 
efficient, effective, and sustainable alert management in healthcare systems, improving workflow and decision 
support.

Abstract 
This review examines the reliability challenges faced by the Texas power grid, particularly during extreme weather 
events such as the February 2021 winter storm. The analysis identifies key technical shortcomings, including 
inadequate weatherization, limited reserve margins, and insufficient grid interconnection, as well as policy gaps that 
prioritize cost efficiency over reliability. Using a modeling approach, resilience strategies such as weatherization of 
critical infrastructure, expansion of reserve margins, enhancement of grid interconnection, and integration of energy 
storage and demand response programs were assessed for their impact on grid reliability. Cost-benefit analysis, 
sensitivity analysis, economic trade-offs, and implementation challenges were also evaluated. The results indicate 
that weatherization and grid interconnection are the most effective short-term and long-term strategies, respectively 
in reducing energy deficits and preventing outages. Reserve margin expansion is an effective mid-term strategy to 
complement weatherization. While energy storage and demand response programs offer additional flexibility but 
have less impact on long-term reliability. The study concludes that an integrated approach combining multiple 
strategies is essential for improving grid resilience and ensuring reliability during extreme weather events. Future 
research should focus on optimizing these strategies and exploring the long-term policy and economic implications 
of implementing these measures.

Abstract 
The study conducted an investigation of supplier selection criteria for hotpot restaurants in Chiangrai, Thailand, 
focusing on improving supplier management practices. Surveys were administered to restaurant managers and owners 
to gather data. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was utilized to systematically prioritize the criteria, ensuring 
an accurate and comprehensive analysis. Maintaining high standards in food safety, quality, and reliability is crucial 
for hotpot restaurants, as these factors are vital for ensuring customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.The 
results of the study indicated that food safety, quality, and reliability were the most significant criteria in supplier 
selection. These factors outweighed cost and delivery performance, highlighting the importance of prioritizing food 
quality and safety over economic factors. The AHP analysis further revealed that food safety held the highest priority, 
with a weight of 0.3720, followed by quality (0.2340) and reliability (0.1560).By adopting these prioritized criteria, 
hotpot restaurant owners can make more informed decisions in their supplier management strategies. By focusing on 
food safety, quality, and reliability, restaurants can improve customer satisfaction, operational resilience, and 
ultimately, increase revenue. The study provides actionable insights that can help hotpot restaurants achieve better 
income through optimized supplier selection processes. This research emphasizes the importance of a robust supplier 
management system, which is essential for the long-term success and sustainability of hotpot restaurants in Chiangrai, 
Thailand.

I．Introduction 
The Thai food service industry plays a significant role in the country's economy, contributing both to GDP and 
employment. Statista (2021) and Siam Commercial Bank (2022) reports that in 2019, the food service sector accounted 
for approximately $2.5 trillion of Thailand's GDP, representing 4.5% of the total and supporting nearly 12 million 
jobs. In addition to its economic impact, the sector also supports local agriculture and attracts foreign investment.The 
Thai food service sector has witnessed a remarkable surge in recent years, with over 20,000 new restaurants opening

Other criteria, such as Reputation (0.082), Pricing (0.081), Variety (0.041), and Flexibility (0.035), were considered 
less significant in the overall ranking. 
 
These results underscore the importance of food safety, quality, and reliability in the supplier selection process for 
hotpot restaurants in Chiangrai. The high priority given to food safety aligns with the region's tourism-driven economy 
and the heightened awareness of health and hygiene among consumers, particularly in the post-COVID-19 era. 
 
5. Conclusion and Discussion 
5.1 Findings 
From the results, it was evident that Food Safety, Quality, and Reliability were the top three criteria for supplier 
selection in hotpot restaurants. Food Safety held the highest priority with a weight of 38%, followed by Quality 
(23.4%) and Reliability (15.6%). Other criteria, such as Reputation, Pricing, Variety, and Flexibility, were considered 
less significant in the overall ranking. 
 
5.2 Discussion 
Why Food Safety is Paramount in Chiangrai 
The dominance of food safety as the top criterion for supplier selection in Chiangrai’s hotpot restaurants is shaped by 
a confluence of regulatory frameworks and cultural values, further amplified by post-pandemic consumer behavior: 
 
Regulatory Factors 
Thailand’s national food safety regulations, including the Food Act B.E. 2522 (1979) and subsequent amendments, 
establish strict hygiene standards for food handling, storage, and preparation. In Chiangrai, these regulations are 
rigorously enforced by the Provincial Public Health Office, which conducts unannounced inspections and mandates 
certifications for suppliers (Kongnim et al., 2023). Hotpot restaurants, due to their communal dining nature, face 
heightened scrutiny. For instance, suppliers must provide traceability documentation for raw ingredients, such as meat 
and seafood, to comply with post-pandemic amendments requiring transparency in supply chains (Yang et al., 2020). 
Non-compliance risks penalties ranging from fines to operational suspensions, compelling restaurants to prioritize 
suppliers with robust safety protocols. 
 
Cultural Factors 
Thai culinary culture places immense emphasis on “safety through freshness” (Yu et al., 2014), particularly in 
communal meals like hotpot, where shared ingredients symbolize trust and social cohesion. A lapse in food safety not 
only endangers health but also disrupts “samakki” (harmony), a core Thai cultural value. Furthermore, Buddhist 
principles of “metta” (compassion) and “ahimsa” (non-harm) implicitly influence consumer expectations, driving 
demand for ethically sourced and hygienically handled ingredients. Surveys indicate that 76% of Chiangrai diners 
associate food safety with a restaurant’s “moral integrity,” linking it directly to repeat patronage (Sittivangkul & 
Tiwong, 2022). 
 
Market Realities 
In Chiangrai’s tourism-dependent economy—where foodservice contributes 18% of local GDP (Statista, 2021)—a 
single foodborne illness incident could tarnish the city’s reputation. Post-COVID-19, 82% of tourists rank food safety 
as their primary concern when dining out (Chiangrai Tourism Authority, 2023). To differentiate themselves, 
restaurants increasingly advertise suppliers’ certifications (e.g., Thai FDA approval or Global G.A.P.), turning safety 
compliance into a competitive asset. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle where regulatory compliance, cultural 
expectations, and market competition collectively elevate food safety as the foremost supplier criterion. 
 
Analysis 
The prioritization of Food Safety reflects the critical importance of ensuring the safety and hygiene of ingredients in 
the food service industry, particularly in the post-COVID-19 era. For hotpot restaurants, where customers directly 
handle raw ingredients, maintaining high food safety standards is essential to prevent health risks and build customer 
trust. Similarly, Quality and Reliability are crucial for delivering a consistent and enjoyable dining experience, which 
directly impacts customer satisfaction and repeat business.

Implications 
The findings suggest that hotpot restaurant owners should prioritize suppliers who demonstrate strong adherence to 
food safety protocols, provide high-quality ingredients, and offer reliable delivery schedules. Suppliers, on the other 
hand, can differentiate themselves by obtaining relevant certifications, implementing rigorous quality assurance 
processes, and establishing robust distribution networks.  
 
While Reputation, Pricing, Variety, and Flexibility were less significant in the overall ranking, they may still play 
a role in niche markets or for restaurants targeting specific customer segments. For example, high-end restaurants may 
prioritize suppliers with a strong reputation for premium or organic ingredients, while budget-conscious 
establishments might focus on cost-effective solutions. Additionally, restaurants offering diverse or themed menus 
may value suppliers with a wide variety of products and flexible delivery options. By addressing these criteria, 
suppliers can better serve niche and emerging markets, helping restaurants differentiate themselves and meet evolving 
customer demands.

Figure 4. Proposed Framework for Green Computing in State Higher Education 
5.4 Validation  
To validate the proposed framework for green computing in HEIs, a comprehensive process was undertaken. Expert 
reviews were conducted through structured interviews with sustainability specialists, IT professionals, and university 
administrators to assess applicability and alignment with international standards. A pilot implementation was carried 
out in three HEIs with different levels of green computing adoption, measuring outcomes such as energy consumption 
reduction and stakeholder engagement. 
 
Stakeholder feedback was gathered via surveys and focus groups to evaluate ease of adoption and identify challenges. 
Additionally, a comparative analysis was conducted, comparing data from HEIs implementing the framework with 
those that had not, assessing improvements in sustainability metrics like energy efficiency and policy adherence. The 
validation confirmed the framework's effectiveness but highlighted areas for further improvement, particularly in 
faculty training, student engagement, and securing funding for green technology initiatives. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study successfully evaluated the current adoption and implementation of green computing practices in state HEIs, 
revealing varying levels of awareness, engagement, and technological integration. The findings highlighted that while 
many institutions have adopted sustainability measures, challenges such as limited funding, resistance to change, and 
a lack of technical expertise remain prevalent. The research also identified key challenges and opportunities in 
integrating green computing with engineering management strategies. The comparative analysis showed that 
institutions with structured frameworks demonstrated better sustainability outcomes, emphasizing the need for 
strategic planning and stakeholder involvement. Additionally, policy gaps were identified, reinforcing the importance 
of setting measurable sustainability goals. To enhance the sustainability of smart campus initiatives, a strategic 
framework was proposed and validated through expert review, pilot implementation, and stakeholder feedback. The 
validation confirmed its effectiveness in reducing energy consumption, improving policy adherence, and increasing 
stakeholder participation. However, continuous improvement in faculty training, student engagement, and funding 
allocation is necessary for long-term success. Overall, this study underscores the importance of integrating green 
computing into HEI operations. By addressing the identified challenges and leveraging opportunities for technological 
advancements, institutions can significantly contribute to sustainable development while enhancing their operational 
efficiency and environmental impact.

Abstract 
Lean Six Sigma, a methodology designed to eliminate waste and improve efficiency, has gained significant traction 
across various industries. However, much of the existing literature focuses heavily on leadership, strategic planning 
and empowering frontline, with limited attention given to the operational roles of frontline employees and the 
practical use of visual management tools. This paper aims to bridge this gap by highlighting the critical 
contributions of frontline employees and visual boards in achieving and sustaining organizational objectives. 
Through case studies, analysis, and practical experience, this research explores how frontline employees, when 
equipped with visual boards and performance huddle practices can uniquely contribute to Lean Six Sigma initiatives 
by identifying and eliminating waste, leveraging their proximity to operational processes. Collecting and analyzing 
data to drive informed decision-making. Promoting a culture of continuous improvement through innovation and 
problem-solving. In addition, the paper emphasizes the role of visual boards in fostering transparency and a data-
driven decision-making culture. While visual boards are often discussed in isolation, their combined use with 
frontline engagement remains underexplored in literature. To unlock the full potential of frontline employees, 
organizations must empower and engage them through a supportive environment and inclusive Lean Six Sigma 
practices. Provide training and development to enhance their skills and confidence in applying Lean Six Sigma 
tools. Implement visual boards as an integral part of operational improvements. Recognize and reward their 
contributions to sustain motivation and participation. By addressing these dimensions, this paper provides a 
comprehensive perspective on the underappreciated roles of frontline workers and visual management tools in Lean 
Six Sigma, contributing to both theory and practice.

1. Introduction
In today's highly competitive business environment, organizations are constantly seeking ways to enhance 
operational efficiency, improve quality, and deliver superior customer value. Lean Six Sigma (LSS) has emerged as 
a powerful methodology that combines the principles of Lean manufacturing and Six Sigma to achieve these goals. 
While much attention has been given to the strategic and managerial aspects of LSS implementation, the critical role 
of frontline employees—those who are directly involved in the day-to-day operations—often remains 
underappreciated. 
Frontline employees possess unique insights into the intricacies of organizational processes, making their 
involvement crucial for the identification and elimination of waste. Their hands-on experience and proximity to the 
operational workflow enable them to detect inefficiency and suggest practical, actionable improvements. However, 
despite their potential to drive significant enhancements, many organizations fail to fully leverage the capabilities of 
their frontline workforce in LSS initiatives.

5.3 Validation 
The validation of our study’s findings leverages a robust approach that includes surveys, focused group discussions, 
and a thorough review of relevant literature. This multi-faceted approach ensures that our insights are not only 
grounded in empirical data but also resonate with established research in the field. 
 
Empowering Frontline Workers - Our study underscores the importance of empowering frontline workers, a theme 
strongly echoed by Melanie Schallow (2009), who highlights the necessity of engaging these employees directly to 
realize continuous improvement goals. The significant improvements in operational efficiency and decision-making 
capabilities observed in our study align with Schallow's insights, demonstrating that direct engagement enhances the 
effectiveness of continuous improvement initiatives. 
 
Effectiveness of Visual Boards - The transformative impact of visual boards on communication and problem-
solving, documented through our surveys and focus group discussions, is supported by the work of Ken Fledman 
(2024). He identifies visual management boards as critical for linking and displaying key metrics effectively, 
thereby facilitating a data-driven culture. Our findings confirm this perspective, revealing that visual boards 
substantially aid in tracking progress and fostering accountability among teams. 
 
Survey and Focus Group Insights - The surveys and discussions highlighted that after receiving targeted training in 
Lean Six Sigma methodologies, frontline employees showed a marked improvement in their problem-solving skills 
and decision-making abilities. These results are validated by 6Sigma.us (2024), which stresses the role of visual 
tools in promoting transparency and operational excellence. 
 
Case Study Corroboration: - Our focused group discussions revealed that training and engaging frontline employees 
led to tangible improvements in operational metrics such as cycle time and error rates. This is corroborated by the 
Grossman Group’s case study, which demonstrated similar outcomes in employee engagement and operational 
excellence through frontline involvement. 
 
By integrating these perspectives from the literature, our study not only reaffirms the critical role of frontline 
employees in Lean Six Sigma initiatives but also provides a validated framework for organizations seeking to 
enhance operational efficiency through employee empowerment and visual management tools.  
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on insights derived from various articles, journals, and authoritative findings, as well as the survey conducted 
with industry leaders and focused group discussions, it is evident that the active engagement of frontline employees 
and their upskilling in Lean Six Sigma methodologies significantly contributes to operational gains. These 
improvements are realized through enhanced process efficiencies, reduced waste, and increased employee 
ownership of improvement initiatives. 
 
For instance, Valspar's implementation of Rapid Action teams (Rapid action case study) resulted in 59 teams 
deploying 354 solutions, engaging 325 employees, and achieving $2.1 million in annualized savings. 
However, for these efforts to achieve their full potential, they must be complemented by effective tools and practices 
that facilitate communication and collaboration. Visual boards, when strategically implemented, serve as dynamic 
information hubs that enable real-time tracking of key performance indicators and foster transparency across teams. 
Regular huddles, in turn, provide the platform for addressing challenges, sharing updates, and aligning goals in a 
structured and timely manner. 
 
Together, this combination of frontline empowerment, Lean Six Sigma training, and robust visual management 
practices creates a synergistic framework for driving continuous improvement and sustaining operational excellence. 
Organizations that embrace this holistic approach stand to benefit not only in terms of measurable performance 
outcomes but also in cultivating a culture of innovation and accountability at every level of their operations. 
There are some specific areas which still need to be studied as dynamics are changing very fast, below are some 
recommendations for further studies:  
 
• 
Cross-Industry Comparisons - Comparative studies across industries, such as healthcare, manufacturing, 
and IT services, can help identify industry-specific challenges and best practices in frontline engagement 
and visual management. 
• 
Integration of Digital Technologies - Investigate how advancements in digital tools (e.g., AI-powered 
dashboards, augmented reality visual boards) can enhance the effectiveness of Lean Six Sigma practices.

• 
Behavioral Impact Analysis - Research on the psychological and behavioral impact of empowering 
frontline employees, such as increased motivation, job satisfaction, and innovation, could provide a more 
holistic understanding of the benefits of these interventions. 
• 
Hybrid and Remote Work Settings - With the rise of hybrid and remote work environments, future studies 
should explore how visual management tools and frontline skilling can be adapted to these contexts while 
maintaining their effectiveness. 
 
These recommendations not only extend the scope of current research but also aim to provide actionable insights 
that can be adopted by practitioners in diverse organizational settings.

Abstract 
This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing urban traffic flow using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Traditional 
traffic control systems, such as fixed-timing signals, often fail to adapt to real-time traffic conditions, leading to 
congestion, delays, and increased fuel consumption. By leveraging real-time data from the New York City Department 
of Transportation (NYC DOT) and modeling traffic signal control as an RL problem, we hypothesize that RL can 
outperform fixed-timing systems in reducing vehicle wait times, traffic congestion, and overall fuel consumption. 
Using the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) platform, we simulate traffic flows and compare the RL system to 
a rule-based, fixed-timing system. The RL system reduces average queue lengths by 25%, decreases vehicle wait times 
by 18%, improves traffic throughput by 12%, and reduces fuel consumption by 15%. These results suggest that RL 
offers a scalable and adaptive solution for managing urban traffic more efficiently.

1. Introduction
Urban traffic congestion is a significant challenge faced by cities worldwide, leading to increased travel delays, fuel 
consumption, and environmental pollution (Papageorgiou et al., 2003). According to the United Nations (2018), by 
2050, 68% of the world's population is expected to live in urban areas, intensifying the demand on infrastructure, 
particularly transportation networks. Congestion not only delays commuters but also results in substantial economic 
losses and environmental impacts. Schrank et al. (2015) estimate that traffic congestion in the United States alone 
costs over $160 billion annually in lost productivity and wasted fuel. 
Traditional traffic management systems, such as fixed-timing signals, operate on predefined schedules and fail to 
adapt to real-time traffic conditions. This lack of adaptability results in inefficient traffic management, particularly 
during peak hours or unexpected traffic surges (Papageorgiou et al., 2003). Advanced systems like SCOOT (Split 
Cycle Offset Optimization Technique) and SCATS (Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System) have sought to 
address these shortcomings by adjusting signal timings in response to real-time traffic data (Hunt et al., 1982; Lowrie, 
1992). However, these systems remain limited by rule-based logic and require extensive manual calibration, restricting 
their effectiveness in complex urban environments. 
1501","Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Singapore, February 18-20, 2025 
 
The RL system recorded an average wait time of 3,700 vehicle-seconds (SD = 600), while the fixed-timing system 
had 4,500 vehicle-seconds (SD = 800), a reduction of 18%. The Z-score was 2.15, with a p-value of 0.032. The effect 
size (Cohen's d) was 1.11. 
Traffic Throughput 
The RL system processed 950 vehicles (SD = 110), whereas the fixed-timing system processed 850 vehicles (SD = 
120), an improvement of 12%. The Z-score for traffic throughput was 1.96, with a p-value of 0.050. Cohen's d was 
calculated as 0.85. 
Fuel Consumption 
The RL system consumed 110 liters of fuel (SD = 15), while the fixed-timing system consumed 130 liters (SD = 20), 
representing a 15% reduction. The Z-score was 2.00, with a p-value of 0.046. The effect size (Cohen's d) was 1.11. 
To further strengthen the statistical evaluation, 95% confidence intervals were calculated for all mean differences. 
They were derived from repeated simulation runs by applying standard formulas for differences between two 
independent groups. In all cases, the confidence intervals for the difference between the RL-based system and the 
fixed-timing system did not cross zero, reaffirming that the RL-based approach consistently outperformed the baseline. 
Below are the 95% confidence intervals for each metric: 
Average 
Queue 
Length 
Difference 
(RL 
− 
Fixed-Timing): 
95% 
CI 
= 
[−12,−6][-12, 
-6][−12,−6] 
This interval indicates the RL system effectively reduces queue lengths by 6 to 12 vehicles on average. 
Total Vehicle Wait Time Difference (RL − Fixed-Timing): 95% CI = [−1,100,−500][-1{,}100, -500][−1,100,−500] 
vehicle-seconds 
This suggests the RL system reduces total vehicle wait time by 500 to 1,100 seconds. 
Traffic Throughput Difference (RL − Fixed-Timing): 95% CI = [40,160][40, 160][40,160] vehicles 
This interval shows the RL system processes 40 to 160 more vehicles than the fixed-timing approach. 
Fuel Consumption Difference (RL − Fixed-Timing): 95% CI = [−27,−13][-27, -13][−27,−13] liters 
The RL system uses 13 to 27 fewer liters of fuel compared to fixed-timing operation. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study demonstrates that a Reinforcement Learning-based traffic signal control system can improve urban traffic 
flow compared to traditional fixed-timing systems. The RL system reduced average queue lengths by 25%, 
decreased vehicle wait times by 18%, improved traffic throughput by 12%, and reduced fuel consumption by 15%. 
These findings suggest that RL-based systems have the potential to provide scalable, adaptive solutions for 
managing traffic congestion in urban environments. 
 
By leveraging real-time data and advanced machine learning algorithms, RL offers a promising approach to urban 
traffic management. The implementation of RL systems could lead to economic benefits, environmental sustainability, 
and improved quality of life for urban residents. As cities continue to grow, adopting innovative technologies like RL 
will be essential in addressing the complex challenges of urban transportation.

Abstract 
WEDM is used chiefly for machining Titanium and its alloys with good dimensional accuracy and surface finish. The 
research work has been done with the BBD of the RSM technique, and further multi-response optimization was done 
through the desirability function. The results of the research work shows that the effect of input variables pulse on-
time (POT), pulse off-time (POFT,) spark gap voltage (SGV), and concave profile radius (CPR) on the output variables 
surface roughness (SR), and geometric error (GE) have been investigated. It observed that POT is the primary 
significant factor affecting the SR, and GE. With increases in CPR, Geometric error also increases. CPR is the most 
critical factor for the geometric error, with an 82.83% contribution. Experiment results also shows that POT and POFT 
significantly affected the surface integrity with the formation of pockmarks, overlapping craters, micro-cracks, and 
recast layer.

1. Introduction
With the increasing the number of research on titanium and its alloys, the applications of these alloys are increasing 
day by day in the area of aerospace, naval and automotive industries, also in various industrial areas like shipbuilding, 
and biomedical sectors due to its unique capability of anticorrosive, highly in strength /weight ratio. Titanium is a 
silvery gray metal, ductile with 22 elements in the model periodic table with an atomic weight of 47.9 and density of 
4.67g/cm3. Along with the heat resistance, it possesses high strength too, which makes it difficult to machine material, 
which became difficult to process by conventional machining processes. Machining titanium offers many challenges 
to engineers in how easily and economically titanium is machined. Due to the unique properties of titanium, it has

Craters and overlapping cracks are high at high discharge energy level. The melting material was then connected with 
the dielectric fluid, reducing the temperature of the material and causing a quenching effect on the melting surface 
(Singh et al. 2019, Garg et al. 2012). As a result of this quenching, voids, cracks, and globules are found on the 
machined surface. It was observed that some amount of the discharge energy always presents in every discharge cycle, 
so the complete reduction of the voids and craters was impossible. The same effect of the SEM was also examined on 
the material sample's flat surface as in Figure 7. The SEM image (Figure 8) of the machined surface (Figure 8(a)) has 
small cracks due to an intermediate amount of discharge energy. In Figure 8 (b), the discharge energy is smaller (POT 
115µs, POFT 45µs, SGV 40V, and CPR 3mm); thus, craters and pockmarks are observed.  
 
6. Conclusions 
The present research applied the RSM approach to the WEDM process to find the best solution for SR, and GE of 
pure titanium. From the study, the important conclusions are as follows: 
• 
SR is varied from 1.35µm to 2.61µm. POT was the most influential factor, whose contribution for evaluation 
of SR is 47.83% followed by POT and SGV with 8.30% and 4.72% respectively.  
• 
For GE the CPR shows the most important factor with 82.83% contribution. However, the SGV shows the 
significant (3.75%) effect on the GE. 
• 
ANOVA shows that POT is main remarkable factor for SR and GE. CPR plays the pivotal role followed by 
POT.  
• 
Cracks, voids, and globules of debris were found in SEM analysis. These irregularities on the machined 
surface, was observed at high discharge energy parameters.

Abstract 
The electronics industry in Thailand heavily relies on machinery for large-scale production to enhance efficiency and 
reduce costs. As a result, a dedicated maintenance department is crucial to ensure proper machine upkeep, which 
includes maintaining a record of maintenance history. A study conducted at an electronics printer production unit, part 
of the plastic parts manufacturing department at an industrial plant in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, identified 
inefficiencies in managing maintenance data for 21 types of machinery, totaling 833 machines. The maintenance data 
recording process was found to be time-consuming and lacked a systematic management approach, resulting in 
operational inefficiencies. This paper aims to improve the process and method of data entry to enhance efficiency and 
reduce recording time. A Fishbone Diagram was used to identify the root causes of these inefficiencies. Improvements 
were implemented based on the principles of Eliminate, Combine, Rearrange, and Simplify (ECRS). Microsoft Access 
was chosen to replace Microsoft Excel for maintenance data recording, as it is better suited for managing complex 
datasets. After implementation, the average data recording time per session decreased from 66 minutes to 30 minutes, 
representing a 54.55% reduction. Additionally, the time to record individual machine maintenance data was reduced 
from 15.1 minutes to 7.2 minutes per session, a reduction of 52.32%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of 
the proposed approach in optimizing maintenance data management within the electronics industry.

5.2 Conclusions 
The development of a database system to support preventive maintenance for machines demonstrates that an efficient 
database system can enhance the management of maintenance data, reduce process steps, and decrease data recording 
time as per the objectives. Additionally, the system provides valuable information for decision-making in machine 
repair processes and minimizes the risk of production disruptions in the electronics industry. The application of 
information technology through this database system effectively supports preventive maintenance and meets the needs 
of the industrial sector. 
 
However, this research was limited to a single sample factory, which may not fully represent the context of other 
industries. Future research could focus on developing systems adaptable to various industrial contexts or integrating 
advanced technologies such as AI and Machine Learning to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of 
maintenance processes.

Abstract 
This study contributes to the design of a biomass manufacturing network in Central Thailand, focusing on establishing 
an efficient biomass supply chain. The objective is to propose an optimal supply chain framework using Integration 
Definition for Function Modeling (IDEF0) and the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model. Current 
challenges include disjointed supply chain activities, high transportation costs, inadequate centralized agricultural 
residue collection, lower thermal energy yield of biomass compared to fossil fuels, and significant storage space 
requirements. The proposed model introduces community-based biomass collection centers to minimize transport 
distances from agricultural sites to production facilities, while ensuring compliance with government regulations. 
These centers facilitate efficient residue collection and storage, with subsequent processing into biofuel and carbon 
credits to meet market demands driven by carbon targets and trading opportunities. Additionally, the framework 
designs five core activities—plan, source, make, deliver, and returns—critical to biomass factory operations. Solutions 
include a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) storage system, strategic biomass supply planning, location optimization via 
mathematical modeling, and biomass densification technologies to reduce transport costs. The torrefaction process is 
highlighted for efficiency gains, supporting sustainable fuel production through a streamlined, integrated supply chain 
tailored for Thailand.

1. Introduction
Globally, the energy sector is undergoing a significant transition as countries strive to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, 
which are the primary sources of carbon dioxide emissions that drive climate change and contribute to global warming. 
Fossil fuels, including coal, oil, and natural gas, are responsible for over 75% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, 
significantly impacting the Earth’s atmosphere and accelerating climate risks such as extreme weather and rising sea 
levels (International Energy Agency 2023). In response, many countries are implementing policies to increase the 
adoption of renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and biomass, which have far lower carbon emissions and are 
more sustainable in the long term.

5. Conclusion 
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the biomass supply chain in preparation for establishing a torrefied 
biomass production facility in Thailand. Using the IDEF0 and SCOR models, it addresses key challenges and 
opportunities related to agricultural waste utilization. In the central region, farmers often burn residues like rice straw, 
sugarcane leaves, and corn stalks, which harm the environment. Inconsistent biomass supply complicates production, 
exacerbated by high transportation costs and the seasonal nature of agricultural by-products. The long growth cycles 
of wood chips further affect biomass fuel’s competitiveness compared to solid fuels like coal. 
Empowering community enterprises offers a sustainable solution, as farmer collectives engaging in value-added 
activities can enhance bargaining power and improve market access, although strong leadership is crucial for their 
success. Establishing community biomass centers can stabilize the supply chain by collecting biomass at fair prices 
and implementing storage solutions to prevent decomposition. High transportation costs require strategic location 
planning to optimize efficiency. Additionally, increasing demand for high-quality biomass fuel, driven by CBAM 
regulations and AEDP 2018 commitments, emphasizes the need for fuels with calorific values comparable to coal.  
The key supply chain factors, including raw material availability, logistics challenges, processing requirements, and 
market demand for sustainable energy. The proposed solution includes a coordinated production and procurement 
plan based on customer demand, shared across departments to ensure efficient operations. Establishing community-
run biomass centers is essential for centralizing residue collection, reducing waste, and maintaining a steady supply. 
A mathematical model is recommended to optimize the placement of plants and collection centers, reducing transport 
costs and enhancing supply chain efficiency. Seasonal and decomposition challenges will be addressed through a First 
In, First Out (FIFO) storage system, and supplier assessments will ensure consistent quality. The production process 
will use torrefaction, aligning with renewable energy goals and mitigating transport and moisture issues through drying 
techniques. Efficient delivery planning will maintain legal transport limits, while strategic plant locations will reduce 
customer costs. Quality issues will be managed collaboratively by sales and production teams, offering credits to 
minimize return costs and maintain customer satisfaction. This framework fosters a sustainable, efficient, and resilient 
biomass supply chain, supporting Thailand’s renewable energy goals and contributing to global emissions reductions.

Abstract 
As the world faces pressing environmental challenges, the transition to sustainable trans- portation solutions has 
become imperative. One significant shift is the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), which offer a promising pathway 
to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. Bangladesh, a country contending with energy security and 
environmental concerns, has witnessed a growing acceptance of electric mass transportation and electric autos, notably 
in urban areas such as Rajshahi City. This evolution highlights the urgent need for sustainable EV charging 
infrastructure and presents a unique opportunity to explore the integration of renewable energy sources, particularly 
solar power, into the charging ecosystem. 
This thesis centers on the vital exploration of the feasibility and economic viability of standalone solar-powered EV

5. Results and Discussion  
In this section, we present the results of our study on the performance investigation and eco- nomic viability analysis 
of standalone solar-powered EV charging stations in Bangladesh. The results are organized into subsections to 
address key aspects of our research. 
 
5.1 Economic Viability Analysis 
1. 
Life Cycle Cost (LCC): The life cycle cost analysis was performed to assess the total cost of owning and 
operating standalone solar-powered EV charging stations over a 10-year period. The LCC was calculated to be 
128,282.5 BDT. 
2. 
Unit Electricity Cost (UC): The unit electricity cost, representing the cost per kilowatt- hour (kWh) of 
energy, was computed as 8.17 BDT or approximately 0.0817 USD. This value provides insights into the cost-
effectiveness of the charging stations. 
3. 
Charging Cost and Monthly Income: Charging cost comparisons between the grid and the proposed solar-
powered system were conducted for Easy Bikes and Auto-Vans. The proposed system demonstrated significant cost 
savings, with Easy Bike users benefiting from monthly savings of 3549 BDT, while Auto-Van users experienced 
savings of 1862.7 BDT. 
 
5.2 Performance of Solar-Powered Charging Stations 
1. 
Solar Panel Configuration and Energy Capture: Our investigation revealed that a solar panel system 
consisting of three solar panels connected in series was chosen for the charging stations. These panels had a maximum 
power output (Pmax) of 300 watts each. The panels were effectively positioned and oriented to maximize solar energy 
capture, achieving an overall total power output of 1800 watts (1.8 kW). 
2. 
MPPT Charge Controller: The Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) charge con- troller was employed 
to optimize the efficiency of the solar panel system. This controller successfully ensured that the panels operated at 
their maximum power output, thus max- imizing energy conversion efficiency. 
3. 
Battery Bank: A battery bank composed of four 12-volt lead-acid batteries was utilized to store the generated 
DC electricity. This battery bank served as an energy buffer, allowing for continuous power supply even during periods 
of insufficient solar energy generation. 
  
4. 
Solar Power Inverter: The solar power inverter effectively converted the 24-volt DC current from the battery 
bank into 220-volt alternating current (AC), making it compatible with standard electrical devices and systems. 
5. 
Battery Charger: A battery charger was employed to charge the Electric Auto Van at a current rate of 5.1 
Amperes. This charger was connected to the inverter output to facilitate the necessary AC-to-DC conversion for the 
charging process. 
6. 
Charging Time and Efficiency: Our measurements indicated that the time required for solar panels to charge 
the battery bank (from solar panel to battery) was 6 hours, while the battery bank to Electric Auto Van charging time 
was established at 7 hours. These charging times were optimized for efficient use of solar energy. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In this thesis, we have conducted an extensive investigation into the feasibility and economic viability of standalone 
solar-powered electric vehicle (EV) charging stations in Bangladesh, with a particular focus on urban areas such as 
Rajshahi City. The study has provided valuable insights into the technical aspects and economic considerations of 
adopting renewable energy sources in the EV charging infrastructure.

address key challenges, including demand planning, voice-of-customer (VOC) management, and customer feedback 
analysis using the SERVQUAL model to assess satisfaction with products and services. Online data integration 
through cloud systems enhanced interdepartmental coordination, enabling real-time data visualization to facilitate 
faster and more accurate corrections. Supplier evaluation was optimized by prioritizing suppliers based on both 
quantitative and qualitative data, ensuring the selection of the best supplier for each product while enhancing digital 
supply chain resilience during crisis situations. Predictive maintenance management leveraged AI algorithms and IoT 
devices to detect potential operational instabilities through sensor analysis, minimizing downtime and maximizing 
productivity. Additionally, improvements were proposed for international transportation, real-time delivery tracking, 
and defective product handling in the returns process, ensuring a more efficient and responsive supply chain. The 
authors proposed adapting this business model to other industries using the IDEF0 and SCOR model framework, 
simplifying task understanding across processes. The study concluded with a comprehensive flowchart summarizing 
the supply chain, aiming to make complex operations more manageable and easier to visualize. It is hoped that this 
study will serve as a valuable resource for progressive cavity pump manufacturers, helping mitigate risks and improve 
production efficiency. In future research, the authors plan to enhance voice-of-customer (VOC) management in 
Thailand as a first step, with a subsequent expansion to Southeast Asia. This will involve developing a survey and 
gathering feedback from end-users, focusing on service quality and customer satisfaction. This could help the business 
better understand how customers perceive the brand and enable the company to maintain a strong marketing presence.

Abstract 
The increasing demand in the semiconductor industry highlights the crucial role of lead frames in electronic 
components. Among various manufacturing techniques, silver electroplating is a key process to ensure optimal 
performance and reliability of lead frames. This study investigates the influence of electroplating parameters on 
coating thickness by applying the design of experiment (DOE) methodology. The main objectives are to identify and 
validate the key electroplating parameters that influence silver coating thickness and to quantify their effects. A 
combination of Hull cell tests, DOE and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to evaluate the importance of 
parameters such as current density, plating time, silver concentration and plating temperature. The results show that 
current density and plating time are the most important factors affecting the coating thickness, as shown by their high 
F values and p values less than 0.05. While silver concentration and plating temperature also have an influence on 
layer thickness, their influence is comparatively less significant. This study establishes a clear relationship between 
electroplating parameters and coating thickness and provides valuable insights for process optimization in silver 
electroplating, which can improve the quality and efficiency of lead frame production.

1. Introduction
The semiconductor industry is critical to modern technology and influences a wide range of applications including 
consumer electronics, medical devices, automotive systems and home appliances. As demand for electronic devices 
continues to rise, the global semiconductor market is expected to witness steady growth, driven by advancements in 
technologies such as 5G networks, artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and electric vehicles (EVs), 
Healthcare, Defense, Transportation and Renewable Energy (Global Semiconductor Lead Frame Market 2024-2032). 
Lead frames are a crucial component in the semiconductor package. They represent the electrical interface between 
the silicon chip and external connections and thus ensure reliable signal transmission. Lead frames are typically made 
from thin metals such as copper, iron, nickel or copper alloys and usually undergo galvanic processes. Electroplating 
involves depositing a thin layer of conductive metal such as silver, gold, palladium or nickel on the surface of the lead 
frame. This process uses electrochemical ionization, in which an electrolyte solution and electrical current drive metal 
deposition (Gamburg & Zangari, 2011). The main objective of electroplating in lead frame manufacturing is to provide 
corrosion resistance, maintain a smooth surface finish, and achieve uniform coating thickness, all of which are 
essential for reliable wire bonding, forming, and soldering processes. 
However, quality issues during the electroplating process, particularly variations in coating thickness, have led to 
increased customer complaints. The thickness of the coating is influenced by a number of plating parameters, including 
current density, plating time, electrolyte composition, and the geometry of the plating surface (Schlesinger & 
1543","Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Singapore, February 18-20, 2025 
 
© IEOM Society International 
corroborate previous studies that demonstrate a direct relationship between higher current densities and increased 
plating thickness, driven by enhanced deposition rates. The results indicate that current density significantly 
accelerates the deposition process, leading to thicker silver layers. Similarly, extended plating times are directly 
associated with increased plating thickness, reinforcing the dual importance of current density and plating time in 
controlling the electroplating process. 
 
The optimization of both current density and plating time is crucial to achieve a balance between deposition rate, layer 
thickness, and electrical resistivity, as noted by Lin and Lin (2004). Bayramoğlu et al. (2008) further confirmed that 
increased current density correlates with thicker plating, although excessive current density can lead to adverse effects, 
such as poor uniformity and defects. This observation contrasts with theoretical expectations based on Faraday’s Law, 
which suggests that mass deposition should be linearly proportional to current density. The results of this study suggest 
that while higher current densities enhance deposition rates, they must be paired with optimal electrolyte 
concentrations to maximize plating quality. This aligns with findings from Izamshah et al. (2022), who distinguished 
that increasing electrolyte concentration improves current efficiency up to a certain threshold. 
 
Interestingly, in this study, silver bath concentration was not a dominant factor influencing plating thickness. This 
discrepancy may arise from the operating conditions of the existing production line, where silver bath concentrations 
were not varied beyond typical levels. Under these conditions, variations in bath concentration did not exhibit 
significant effects on plating thickness, which contrasts with the findings of previous studies that identified 
concentration as a critical parameter in electroplating (Le et al., 2015). 
 
5.4 Recommendations for Industry Application 
Based on the results of this study, several key recommendations are proposed to optimize the electroplating process 
and improve operational performance. They are; wider range of silver bath concentrations, use of advanced 
characterization techniques, real-world validation in production environments and comparative analysis with 
alternative plating methods. It is recommended that future DOE experiments examine a broader range of silver bath 
concentrations, including extremely high and low values. This would enable a more comprehensive understanding of 
the influence of electrolyte concentration on coating thickness and current efficiency. Furthermore, implementing a 
three-level approach (low, medium, high) for each factor would allow a more detailed understanding of its effects 
under different operating conditions. To better assess the microstructure and quality of the plated layers, it is 
recommended to use advanced analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy 
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). These methods will provide valuable insights into the surface morphology, 
uniformity and elemental composition of the electroplated layers and enable a deeper understanding of the factors that 
contribute to the quality of the coating. Future research should focus on conducting experiments in production 
environments to evaluate additional performance metrics such as adhesion strength, solderability, and wire bonding 
reliability. These factors are critical to the functional performance of electroplated components in end applications, 
particularly in high-performance sectors such as automotive electronics and telecommunications. A more 
comprehensive comparative study using different electroplating processes and materials (such as gold, palladium or 
copper) could provide valuable insights into the applicability of the optimization strategies identified in this study 
(Zhang et al. 2023). This would facilitate the development of universally applicable electroplating techniques and 
enable the industry to adopt the most effective strategies for specific applications. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, this study successfully achieved its primary objectives: to identify and validate the coating parameters 
that affect silver coating thickness in the lead frame manufacturing process at ABC Manufacturing. By applying 
Design of Experiment (DOE), it was found that silver bath concentration, current density, plating bath temperature 
and plating time have a significant influence on plating thickness. Current density and coating time were identified as 
the most influential parameters, with a high proportion of both factors contributing to increased layer thickness. The 
ANOVA analysis and Pareto chart confirmed the statistical significance of these factors, while the regression model 
validated through confirmation runs provided a reliable prediction of coating thickness with an acceptable percentage 
error. These results support the practical application of focusing on current density and plating time to achieve more 
consistent and higher quality plating results. The results also highlight the importance of understanding the interactions 
between these and other factors in the electroplating process. By leveraging this knowledge, ABC Manufacturing can 
improve quality control, optimize production efficiency, and reduce variability, thereby improving overall operational 
performance. In terms of objectives, this study highlights the utility of DOE in optimizing key electroplating

Abstract 
This study addresses process optimization in a microenterprise specializing in dressmaking in Peru, which faces 
high levels of material waste and inefficient production methods. The company had an average monthly material 
waste rate of 18%, exceeding the values observed in other companies in the sector, impacting costs and 
sustainability. The PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) methodology was used to identify the root causes of 
inefficiencies, such as the lack of standardized work methods, improper use of tools, and suboptimal cutting 
templates. The implemented improvements included transitioning from paper templates to rigid templates, 
standardizing tracing and cutting processes, and eliminating unnecessary steps in the production process. These 
interventions reduced production time per dress from 236 to 189 minutes (19.8%), increased annual production 
capacity by 24.6%, and decreased material waste from 29kg to 16kg (55.6%), resulting in a 44.6% reduction in 
costs associated with waste from S/7,908 to S/4,380. The findings highlight the effectiveness of lean tools and 
continuous improvement methods in increasing productivity and reducing waste, offering a scalable model for 
other microenterprises in the textile sector.

1. Introduction
The sale of clothing items is constantly increasing, reaching $1.5 trillion in 2022 and projected to reach $2 trillion 
by 2027 (Statista 2022). The apparel sector represents more than 60% of total textile production, with expectations 
that this trend will continue (Larios 2019). Specifically in Peru, the garment industry provides new opportunities 
for small entrepreneurs in a constantly growing sector, with the added value of the high quality of local fabrics 
and the use of the Peru brand for potential exports. Likewise, the industry supports job creation, contributing 
approximately 0.8% to Peru’s GDP (Ministerio de la Producción 2020). Nevertheless, it should be considered that 
textile waste pollution amounts to 47,500 metric tons per year, approximately 130 metric tons per day, according 
to OEFA (Grupo La República 2022). Following the industry's growth trend, it is estimated that by 2050, the 
demand for clothing will triple (Okafor et al. 2021), leading to annual pollution of 91,200 metric tons or 250 
metric tons per day. In Peru, micro and small enterprises (MSEs) account for more than 99% of all businesses 
(Bonilla 2015), making the dissemination of sustainable practices even more challenging. 
1.1. Objectives 
The case study evaluated in this research involves a Peruvian textile microenterprise with 23 years of experience, 
dedicated to dressmaking. The business faces elevated costs and excessive material waste during production. The

Step 3: Check 
Considering an 8-hour workday, the operator initially had a maximum capacity of 2 dresses per day. Extrapolating 
the annual production of dresses per operator yielded a total of 586 dresses per year, assuming 6 working days per 
week and 4 weeks per month. 
 
Each dress in the standard line required 2.5 meters of fabric, weighing 275 grams. Initially, the waste accounted 
for 18% of the fabric's weight, resulting in a total waste of 49.5 grams per dress. With the fabric cost at PEN 30 
per meter, the waste cost per dress was PEN 13.50. Annually, this waste translated to a cost of PEN 7,908, which 
represented 8.0% of the company's annual production costs for the standard line dresses. 
 
After implementing the improvements, the production time per dress was reduced to 189 minutes. This allowed 
the operator, working an 8-hour day, to produce 730 dresses annually. 
 
The improved manufacturing method reduced fabric usage per dress to 2 meters, resulting in waste of 22 grams, 
equivalent to 10% of the new fabric weight (220 grams). The new waste cost per dress was PEN 6, bringing the 
annual waste cost for the projected dress production to PEN 8,760. Despite the increased annual waste cost in 
absolute terms, the proportion of waste costs decreased to 4.4% annually, achieving a reduction of -3.6 percentage 
points compared to the initial scenario. 
 
The following comparative table (Table 5) presents the initial state of the dress production process and the state 
after applying the improvements:

Reviewing the previous table revealed that the indicators experienced a favorable percentage variation, achieving 
reductions in waste and production time per dress that exceeded the company’s target. 
 
• 
Step 4. Act 
Based on the results presented, the company was advised to adopt the improvements implemented in the case 
study. To facilitate this, the company’s operators were trained in the new manufacturing methodology. 
 
Case studies conducted by Tahiduzzaman (2018) and Erceg (2017) support these findings, demonstrating how 
tools like Lean methodologies can achieve both operational improvements and cost reductions in the garment 
industry. Additionally, a case study by Perez (2017) highlights the effectiveness of the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-
Act) methodology in cost reduction, achieving a 7% decrease in rework levels through a similar approach. 
 
Furthermore, Távara (2017) emphasizes the importance of training and manuals in garment workshops as a 
strategy for increasing productivity. Therefore, it is proposed as a next step to apply the described methodology 
to evaluate the synergy between using training/manuals and Lean tools. 
 
5. Conclusion 
After conducting the pilot test and comparing it to the initial recorded state, it is concluded that implementing 
improvements to the dress production process through method enhancement is an effective tool for increasing 
productivity and reducing waste. The results show a 21.25% improvement in production time per dress and a 
55.56% reduction in waste per dress produced.  
 
The scalability of the implemented solutions is partially limited, particularly the improvement involving rigid 
templates. This is because, in larger-scale production processes, more efficient alternatives are typically chosen, 
replacing manual cutting with machines or cutting dies. On the other hand, the other two implemented 
improvements focus on optimizing the process and eliminating non-value-adding activities, making them more 
scalable due to the flexible nature of the method. In terms of sustainability, embedding continuous improvement 
within the company through an improvement project provides a powerful tool that can be used to address future 
challenges, further reducing waste within the company.

However, this study faced certain limitations. First, there was a lack of records within the business, including the 
absence of waste data from previous years, and the failure to log incidents that occurred during production. As a 
result, the study was based on limited information, which made it difficult to identify and support additional areas 
for improvement that could have a positive impact on production times. On the other hand, the study did not 
consider the effect of environmental humidity or the impact it might have had on the fabric used, causing variations 
in density and, therefore, increasing the variability of the recorded waste data. Given that only one operator was 
involved in the study, there is a possibility that the positive impacts recorded may not directly translate to other 
situations on otherwise similar SMEs in the sector or may have a smaller impact on the indicators than those 
observed in the current study. 
 
Due to these limitations, a future study could place greater emphasis on historical data and detailed records of the 
process, enabling a more precise comparison with the improved process and providing a more comprehensive 
view of the company’s areas for improvement. This could potentially highlight issues such as the machinery used 
or the raw materials, which were not addressed directly in this study. Additionally, the possibility of introducing 
automation tools could be evaluated, and their impact on this and other SMEs in the sector could be assessed, 
potentially reducing production times and increasing efficiency. The administrative areas of apparel producing 
SMEs could also be investigated, evaluating if inefficiencies similar to those identified in this investigation are 
present, and determining the impact they have on KPIs.

Abstract 
Over the past several decades, considerable changes have taken place which have not only impacted the economy but 
have also transformed the supply chain. With the supply chain being revolutionized, demand for products has 
escalated, leading to a simultaneous increase in production. This has led to an increase in the utilization of raw material, 
energy and water consumption as well as adverse GHG emission, all resulting in detrimental environmental issues 
and climate change. The transport and logistics industry are known to account for a significant amount of GHG 
emissions globally. As such, knowledgeable consumers, together with government, non-government organizations 
and stakeholders have added pressure on logistics service providers to implement green strategies to mitigate their 
carbon footprint. However, the extent to which LSPs have heeded the call is unknown. Hence, the objective of this 
study is to investigate the green strategies implemented by LSPs and their impact on performance. A descriptive 
survey research design was followed. Data was collected from people working for LSPs in South Africa. Route 
planning and load consolidation were two most implemented green strategies among LSPs. The implementation of 
the green strategies was found to be positively correlated with economic, environmental, and operational performance 
of LSPs. In addition, implementation of the green strategies accrues benefits such as high asset utilization, customer 
satisfaction and reduced GHG emissions. The study reveals that green strategies implemented by LSPs are in nascent 
stages in emerging economies compared to those in developed economies.

1. Introduction
The advent of globalization and technological advancement has not only resulted in complex and fragmented supply 
chains but has also fostered an environment whereby goods and services are procured internationally, ensuing a surge 
in international trade (Bullock, et al. 2024, Ishaya, et al. 2023). Technological evolution has created a global economy 
that is characterized as competitive, intricate and increasingly unpredictable (Glowik 2017, Omotayo 2018). 
Technology has allowed consumers to be more knowledgeable and as such there is an increasing demand for variety 
of products and services leading to a need for changes in processes within the supply chain in order to accommodate

Abstract 
This research develops a theoretical framework to demonstrate how a self-organized global supply network can 
transition from a critical to a sub-critical state using a diversification-based risk mitigation strategy. In self-organized 
critical systems, the critical state represents a fragile equilibrium where small disruptions can escalate into 
disproportionately large avalanches due to interconnected dependencies and heightened sensitivity. In contrast, a sub-
critical state signifies a more stable regime where disruptions are effectively contained, and large-scale failures are 
curtailed. Transitioning to this state reduces the system's inherent fragility while preserving its operational dynamics. 
We integrated two foundational concepts from Complexity Science: the Bak-Sneppen model and the Barabási-Albert 
model and perform Discrete Event Simulation and Agent-Based Modelling to simulate diversification strategy that 
increases the number of alternate suppliers and limits production capacity to the most vulnerable nodes for events with 
major disruptions. The strategy is applied continuously and adaptively to address the network's natural tendency to 
evolve back into a critical state. The results demonstrate that this approach effectively transitions the network to a sub-
critical state, reducing the Vulnerability Index of critical nodes and curtailing the scale of dynamic disruptions. The 
findings underscore the efficacy of SOC-Based approach in stabilizing the network and mitigating dynamic failures. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
The complexity and interconnectedness of global supply chain have heightened their susceptibility to dynamic 
disruptions, particularly in systems that have evolved into a state of Self-Organized Criticality (SOC). In such systems, 
small disruptions occur frequently, while large, systemic failures are rare but probable. This unique behaviour stems 
from the interdependencies and feedback mechanisms intrinsic to such networks.  
Traditional supply chain models, which focus on localized and linear risks, fail to account for these emergent, network-
wide dynamics. Consequently, supply chain managers are often ill-equipped to address both the minor and catastrophic 
effects of disruptions. Historical events such as the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have 
exposed the limitations of conventional approaches to mitigating dynamic disruptions (Carvalho et al., 2012). These 
crises revealed critical vulnerabilities, particularly in supply chains overly dependent on single-source suppliers or 
centralized production hubs. The dynamic nature of these disruptions often amplifies their impact, further underscoring

Third, the continuous and adaptive nature of the framework aligns with the dynamic characteristics of SOC systems. 
Supply chain networks naturally evolve, and their state of criticality can re-emerge over time. The framework’s 
iterative process, analysing network configurations, prescribing interventions, and reassessing outcomes ensures that 
RM strategies remain relevant and effective. This adaptability is crucial for long-term resilience, allowing managers 
to respond proactively to emerging risks. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the proposed framework demonstrates a robust and practical approach to managing disruptions in SOC-
driven supply chains. By shifting the network from a critical to a sub-critical state, it addresses both the frequency & 
magnitude of disruptions and the VI of critical nodes, providing actionable insights for supply chain managers. The 
results not only advance the theoretical understanding of SOC systems but also offer a scalable solution for mitigating 
risks in complex, interconnected networks. This dual contribution highlights the framework’s potential to transform 
risk management practices in GSN. 
 
This study bridges the gap between theoretical insights and practical applications, offering supply chain managers 
actionable tools for enhancing resilience. Future research could build upon this foundation by providing full visibility 
of network connectivity, with the goal of enhancing inter-collaboration between business enterprises, further 
improving resilience and efficiency. Additionally, integrating real-time data analytics and machine learning techniques 
could enable predictive risk management, allowing for dynamic adjustments to evolving network conditions. 
Exploring sector-specific applications, such as in healthcare, technology, or automotive supply chains, could validate 
its effectiveness further. Finally, incorporating sustainability metrics into the framework could address the growing 
need for environmentally conscious supply chain practices, ensuring relevance in addressing both operational and 
societal challenges.

Abstract 
The construction industry, marked by significant environmental impacts and inefficiencies in resource utilization, 
necessitates innovative approaches to achieve sustainable resource management.  This study presents a novel 
framework towards addressing these challenges by improving resource allocation at the preliminary or mobilization 
phases of construction projects by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) 
principle. The proposed framework comprises a systematic four-phase methodology: initial analysis, AI-driven 
resource allocation modeling, implementation and monitoring, and ongoing assessment. This integration enhances the 
effectiveness of value engineering by leveraging AI’s capabilities to process complex dataset and develop optimal 
resource allocation strategies. The framework emphasizes practical applications while aligning with sustainability 
goals towards advancing operational and environmental efficiency of construction projects.

6.  Limitations and future directions 
While this study offers a comprehensive framework, several limitations warrant further exploration to enhance its 
robustness and applicability. Future research can focus empirically on validating the proposed framework through 
extensive data collection from real-world building projects. Such validation would provide deeper insights into the 
framework's benefits and highlight areas for potential improvement. Conducting detailed case studies across diverse 
project types, scales, and geographic regions is essential to ensure the framework's broad applicability and 
effectiveness. Additionally, structured interviews and surveys with industry experts can improve the practical 
feasibility of implementing the framework. Such interactions can help identify potential barriers to adoption and gather 
valuable feedback for refining the framework to meet industry needs. 
 
Future research efforts should also prioritize the development of specialized AI models tailored to specific components 
of the system, particularly within the prediction module and optimization engine. These models should include 
advanced algorithms for predicting resource requirements, estimating waste generation, and optimizing multiple 
objectives relevant to the early stages of construction projects.  
 
Furthermore, integrating emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and blockchain into the 
framework presents a promising avenue for future work. IoT sensors could enhance real-time monitoring capabilities, 
while blockchain could provide secure and transparent data verification, improving the framework's reliability and 
operational efficiency. By addressing these limitations and exploring these research directions, future studies can 
significantly contribute to advancing the practical and theoretical development of the proposed framework.

Abstract 
The main objective of this research is to increase productivity in a metalworking company in Peru, through the 
implementation of plant layout tools such as SLP and Lean tools, such as 5S and SMED. It is important to highlight 
that, in 2023, the metalworking industry represented 1.5% of the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP), contributing 
a value of 567,390 million soles, or 151,860 million of U.S. Dollars. The issue identified in the workshop area, where 
cable trays are manufactured, is that productivity is 0.1831 finished products per man-hour. This corresponds to a 
manufacturing order of 200 linear meters of finished product. For the validation of the model, Lean methodology was 
used, applying the 5S and SMED tools to reduce non-productive activity times, such as area cleaning, tool and material 
selection, and equipment setup. Additionally, the SLP tool was used for plant redistribution, aiming to propose a new 
layout for the workshop area that included a raw material warehouse and a finished product warehouse. The results 
obtained from the simulation of the proposed model with Arena software showed that, by implementing a plant 
redistribution with two warehouses (one for raw material and one for finished product), and reducing activity times, 
productivity increased to 0.2168 trays produced per man-hour, with a simulated production time of 12.14 days.

1. Introduction
Currently, the metal-mechanic industry is of utmost importance for Peru's economic development, in that context, 
according to the economic studies office, it is estimated that this industry represented in 2023 1.5% of the national 
GDP, that is, it contributed with a value of 567,390 million soles (Ministerio de la Producción [PRODUCE] 2023). It 
is also important to note that, according to the September 2023 summary plan, during 2017 and 2022, the production 
of the metal-mechanic industry increased at a rate of 7.0% on average per year. On the other hand, in 2023, the 
metalworking industry experienced a 1.4% drop in production compared to 2022 (Instituto de Estudios Económicos 
y Sociales [IEE] 2023). In contrast, the production divisions that maintained the highest growth were companies 
engaged in manufacturing machinery, equipment, and common metals, representing 5.5% of the industry.  
Due to emerging economic opportunities in Peru, such as the development of new mining, industrial and infrastructure 
projects, the demand for products in the Peruvian metal-mechanic sector has increased significantly. As pointed out 
by Quiroz-Flores and Collao-Diaz (2022), the industry under study faces productivity problems due to long idle times, 
long preparation processes and a high percentage of defective products. These factors have been an important part of 
the development of a proposed solution based on the deficiencies of the Peruvian metal-mechanic industry. 
The metalworking sector faces significant challenges regarding productivity and prolonged operational times, directly 
impacting its competitiveness. The implementation of methodologies such as SMED has proven effective, achieving 
an average reduction of 42% in setup times and a 35% increase in productivity (Davalos-Roman et al., 2023).

Figure 10. Simulation of the proposed model implementation in Arena software 
 
A total of 12.14 days was obtained for the cable tray manufacturing process. In the current scenario, the productivity 
is 0.1831 trays manufactured per man-hour. After the implemented improvement, productivity increases to 0.2168 
trays per man-hour, which represents a 18.41% improvement in productivity. With the implemented improvement, 
expenses are significantly reduced. As a result, there are higher profits, since delivery response times are shorter, and 
this means an increase in production. The expenses that will no longer be counted after the implementation of the 
model consist of personnel overtime expenses, food expenses, transportation expenses for raw material freight and 
expenses for leisure hours. All this means savings of US$2,391.42 per month, which means US$28,698.48 per year. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The improvement proposal made in this research of the SLP, 5S and SMED tools, in a company of the metal-mechanic 
sector, were successful and generated profitability, because through the simulation in the Arena software, an increase 
of 18.41% in productivity was determined, which led to a redesign of the distribution of the workshop area of the 
production plant, to optimize the setup times of the equipment and to a better organization of the tools used for the 
manufacture of cable trays. Through the SLP and Lean tools, it was possible to reduce the manufacturing time of an 
order of 200 linear meters of cable trays from 114.95 hours of ordinary work and 27 hours of extraordinary work, 
having a total time of 141.95 hours of work for the manufacture of this, to have a total manufacturing time of 115.33 
hours of work without hours of extraordinary work, there was a reduction of 15.52% in manufacturing times. 
 
The proposed solution was validated by means of a simulation in the Arena software, this helped to obtain relevant 
information for the research without the need to affect the company on the changes made, it is recommended to collect 
all the information of the company to have results in different scenarios.

Abstract 
Manual lifting tasks are a leading cause of workplace injuries, necessitating reliable methods to evaluate and mitigate 
associated risks. Accurately identifying lifting stages is a critical step in ergonomic risk assessment tools such as the 
Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE), which requires precise determination of the lifting action's origin and 
destination points. This study addresses the challenge of lifting stage identification by developing a hybrid deep 
learning model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) 
networks. Using a dataset of 117 videos, representing single lifting actions, 75,920 labeled frames were generated and 
classified into four stages: ""ready,"" ""start,"" ""processing,"" and ""end."" Data augmentation and class balancing techniques 
were employed to handle label imbalances. The proposed model achieved a robust 99% accuracy in 5-fold cross-
validation, effectively distinguishing between lifting stages, even in asymmetric lifting scenarios. Misclassification 
primarily occurred between visually similar stages such as ""ready"" and ""processing"". The results highlight the model's 
potential to automate lifting stage identification, a key requirement for implementing ergonomic assessments like 
RNLE. By providing accurate and scalable predictions, this approach offers a practical solution for improving 
workplace safety. Future work could expand this model's applicability to diverse lifting conditions and real-time 
analysis.

stages. On the other hand, the “start” and “start_A” labels show the least misclassification, which is particularly 
important as these stages are critical for identifying lifting actions (Figure 5).

6. Conclusion 
This study developed a video-based deep learning model to automate the identification of lifting stages in manual 
lifting tasks, supporting ergonomic risk assessments like the Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE). The hybrid 
CNN-LSTM model demonstrated high accuracy, achieving an average of 99% across training, validation, and test 
datasets during 5-fold cross-validation. The use of SMOTE effectively addressed class imbalances, ensuring reliable 
classification of the five lifting stages: ""ready,"" ""start,"" ""start_A,"" ""processing,"" and ""end."" 
 
This research highlights the potential of deep learning models to improve the scalability and accuracy of ergonomic 
risk assessments by automating complex processes like lifting stage identification. The integration of temporal and 
spatial features in the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture provides a scalable solution that minimizes human intervention 
and enhances consistency in ergonomic evaluations. 
 
Future work could explore applying the model to diverse lifting conditions and scenarios. Additionally, incorporating 
advanced techniques for feature extraction and dataset expansion could further enhance the model’s performance and 
adaptability, making it an even more robust tool for workplace safety and health assessments.

Abstract 
The level of maturity of Fakfak nutmeg (Myristica Argantea Warb) is still determined traditionally, namely by looking 
for signs of golden-brown skin, cracking and revealing blackish brown seeds with red membranes (fuli). When 
harvesting, farmers usually don’t wait for all the fruit to open. They will pick all the fruit from the tree and then cut it 
in half at a time to take the seeds and mace from the color of the fruit. Judging the level of ripeness of nutmeg from 
the color fruit’s skin is difficult. Through experiments on 50 fruits by two people, the average error in guessing the 
level of ripeness was 39%. This may also be the reason why the farmers have inherited the habit of slitting the nutmeg 
directly under the tree when harvesting, and the rest is thrown away the economic value of nutmeg has been increased 
to become candied products, syrup, soy sauce, jam, balm and soap. So that all parts of the nutmeg can be utilized, it 
is very important to sort the Fakfak nutmeg before it is split. In this study we introduce Nutmeg Sorting Innovation 
(NSI) as an innovative method that utilizes RGB sensors to sort nutmeg in real-time without splitting them. NSI will 
be integrated with Arduino Uno. This breakthrough allows farmers to avoid waste disposal and nutmeg product 
entrepreneurs to improve the quality of their raw materials.

During testing, two main problems were identified. First, the sensor used is only capable of reading 5 data points and 
producing 5 appropriate outputs. This indicates a lack of sensor ability to capture more comprehensive information. 
Second, only one sensor was active during testing. In fact, to get more accurate and representative results, ideally all 
available sensors should function and participate in the data collection process (Table 4)

By implementing these revisions, it is hoped that the device can function more optimally and produce more accurate 
predictions. Using two sensors will provide more complete information, while simplifying the output into one category 
will make data analysis easier. However, further testing may be required to ensure that the device actually functions 
as expected and achieves the desired level of accuracy. 
 
After revisions were made to the device and a second experiment was carried out, the device was able to produce 
output in one category. However, the level of accuracy has decreased. Of the 9 trials carried out, only 4 trials produced 
correct answers, while the other 5 trials produced wrong answers. This resulted in a decrease in the accuracy rate to 
44.44%. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Based on the results of the NSI research, it was categorized as successful in guessing the ripeness level of nutmeg 
based on the color of the nodules when compared with guessing directly using the eye , however, there are several 
obstacles, including 1. the initial condition of the nutmeg 2. there is no global category for the maturity level of 
nutmeg based on color. 3. Limited nutmeg samples because the research was carried out after the harvest season

Abstract 
This study evaluates the investment feasibility of Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) technology for Nuclear Power Plants 
(NPPs) in Bangka Belitung through the Value at Risk (VaR) method. It examines the economic viability of MSR-
based NPPs and identifies critical risks affecting investment parameters. The analysis integrates primary and 
secondary data, employing a discounted cash flow financial model and Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000 iterations 
at a 95% confidence level. The findings indicate that MSR NPPs are economically viable, with a project Net Present 
Value (NPV) of $338.7 million, an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 13.06%, a Profitability Index (PI) of 1.40, and a 
Discounted Payback Period (DPP) of 11.19 years. Key risks identified include extended construction timelines, public 
perception issues, fuel supply disruptions, policy changes, and thermal efficiency reductions. The VaR analysis using 
Monte Carlo simulations further highlights the potential for significant investment losses if these risks materialize, 
particularly impacting critical financial factors such as Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) and Overnight 
Construction Costs (OCC). This research provides valuable insights into advancing nuclear energy development in 
Indonesia, supporting the nation’s energy demand growth and resilience.

1. Introduction
Indonesia’s energy demand is growing rapidly, driven by industrial expansion, urbanization, and population growth. 
Electricity demand is projected to increase by 4.9% annually, highlighting the critical need for a reliable and efficient 
energy supply (PT PLN [Persero], 2021). Currently, Indonesia’s energy mix is heavily reliant on fossil fuels, with new 
and renewable energy contributing only 12.3% as of 2022, falling short of government targets (METIIRES, 2023; 
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources [ESDM], 2022). 
Nuclear energy has been proposed as a potential solution to address Indonesia’s growing energy demand while 
diversifying its energy portfolio (Kanugrahan & Hakam, 2023). Despite several plans, Indonesia has yet to establish 
a nuclear power plant (NPP), and nuclear energy remains absent from its current energy mix (Permana, Trianti, & 
Rahmansyah, 2023). Advocates of nuclear power cite its benefits, including low operational costs, efficient land use,

5.4 Validation 
The model's validity is ensured through Monte Carlo simulations with 10,000 iterations, capturing a wide range of 
outcomes and reducing outlier influence. The integration of normal and empirical distributions reflects key 
uncertainties, while Spearman correlation coefficients confirm alignment with economic principles, such as the strong 
link between PPA and NPV/IRR. This paper parameters and results also confirmed and validated to experts. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Through the integration of discounted cash flow analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, this study successfully 
assessed the financial feasibility of a renewable energy investment project under various uncertainty factors. The 
research objectives outlined at the beginning of the study were fully achieved, including identifying critical risk factors 
and quantifying their impacts on key financial indicators such as NPV, IRR, and LCOE. 
 
The study demonstrated the utility of Value at Risk (VaR) as a comprehensive risk assessment tool, providing 
stakeholders with actionable insights into the financial risks and potential returns associated with the project. By 
incorporating a robust analytical framework, this research uniquely contributes to the understanding of financial 
feasibility in renewable energy investments, particularly under scenarios of uncertainty. 
 
These findings not only validate the viability of the proposed investment but also highlight the importance of 
incorporating probabilistic methods to enhance decision-making. The study's innovative approach and detailed 
analysis serve as a valuable reference for policymakers, investors, and researchers in advancing renewable energy 
development.

Abstract 
Globally, railroads are embracing digitalization to improve their operations. The next generation of digital 
transport systems must incorporate railway data with technological enhancement. Bangladesh Railway 
industry operates and the network as a whole may come to a complete stop if the central traffic management 
system fails.Blockchain technology emerges as a disruptive solution, promising greater transparency, trust, 
and operational efficiency. This abstract examines how blockchain technology may be used to decentralize 
the railway administration system, emphasizing the main advantages and useful factors from transparency to 
transformation. The fundamental principles of blockchain, namely distributed ledger technology and 
immutability, present a novel strategy for decentralizing systems across several industries. This study 
presents a moderate overview of the literature on the implementation of blockchain technology across several 
industries, specifically in the context of the railway industry which disclose the application and 
implementation barriers of block chain in Bangladesh perspective. The blockchain technology's potential 
benefits and the limitations of usages for the railroad sector have been described. A simple hypothetical 
analysis of the time required to manually transmit data in the railway industry is calculated and it is also 
discussed how the data transmission rate can be significantly reduced if the tasks are done using block chain. 
Since blockchain technology is still in its infancy in Bangladesh, this paper outlines the potential applications

This line graph displays the year-by-year distribution of train accidents in Bangladesh Railway, which are 
classified into five types: collisions, derailments, fire in trains, train into obstruction, and total accidents, 
from 1974-1975 to 2020-2021. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Further integration of AI for predictive analytics and the use of renewable energy for blockchain operations can 
enhance scalability. 
Integrating blockchain technology into the railway business offers multiple avenues for improvement, as outlined 
in various scholarly works: 
 
1. Digital Ticketing Systems: Blockchain can streamline ticketing by producing secure, tamper-
proof digital tickets, boosting passenger convenience and decreasing fraud (Joe Preece 
September, 2018). Talk about digital ticketing systems that use Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. 
2. Management of the Supply Chain and Logistics: The technology makes it possible to track parts and 
supplies transparently, guaranteeing authenticity and effective management. VeChain is mentioned 
as a possible technique to improve supply chain operations in the railroad industry. 
3. Data Distribution and Interoperability: Blockchain enables secure and decentralized data sharing 
among various stakeholders, improving system integration and decision-making. 
4. Decentralized Railway Control: By implementing smart contracts and blockchain, railway control 
systems can be decentralized, improving operational efficiency and safety. Investigate a blockchain-
based prototype for decentralized railway control, guaranteeing safe and conflict-free operations 
(Michael Kuperberg 2019). 
5. Rail Freight Operations: Blockchain can improve service quality, efficiency, and organization in rail 
freight by providing transparent and immutable records of cargo movements. The International 
Railway Journal discusses how blockchain opens new opportunities for rail freight (Morant 2018). 
6. Maintenance and Asset Management: Blockchain's immutable ledger can record maintenance 
histories and asset conditions, facilitating predictive maintenance and extending asset lifecycles. A 
progress report on scaling a blockchain-based railway control system prototype for mainline 
railways, highlighting its potential in condition-based monitoring and predictive maintenance. 
(Michael Kuperberg 2019). 
 
5.2 Validation 
The prototype’s success demonstrates blockchain’s viability for decentralized management. Statistical tests 
confirm significant improvements in operational metrics. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The railway sector in Bangladesh has a tremendous chance to change operations and improve efficiency and 
transparency through the adoption of blockchain technology. Through the utilization of blockchain technology's 
decentralized, immutable, and secure characteristics, the railway industry can effectively tackle persistent issues 
including asset monitoring, inefficient supply chains, and ticket fraud. 
 
Although there are obstacles to be addressed, like technological complexity and regulatory issues, blockchain 
technology has a lot of potential advantages for Bangladesh's railway sector. The nation may put itself at the 
forefront of contemporary railway infrastructure and enhance the entire experience for freight and passenger 
consumers by adopting this cutting-edge technology. This complete research looks at how Blockchain can be 
implemented and what its benefits can be. With the acquired knowledge, the application of Blockchain and 
enabling smart contract is capable of real-time data updates, streamlining the system and some aspects of security. 
Which can be taken to another level in the future by sophisticated Blockchain developers. Although our research 
is able to highlight some branches of Blockchain but if this concept is implemented on a large scale then the 
railway management of the country will lead to a lot of improvement. Now let's discuss the effective functionality 
of Blockchain. The railway sector in Bangladesh has a great deal of potential to improve in terms of efficiency 
and transparency thanks to blockchain technology. Supply chain management, ticket sales, asset management, 
financial transactions, and data management can all be enhanced by the industry by utilizing blockchain's 
decentralized structure, secure data storage, and smart contract capabilities. This may result in lower expenses, 
more effectiveness, and happier clients.

Abstract 
Rapid growth in the transport sector in Surabaya, especially in the use of electric vehicles, has increased the need for 
efficient supporting infrastructure. With the increasing number of electric vehicles, the government is facing 
challenges in providing charging stations (SPBKLU) to reduce user concern regarding the limitations of charging 
facilities. The optimization results identify 14 strategic locations in East Surabaya that can serve the needs of electric 
vehicle users effectively. These locations are selected based on coverage and capacity criteria, ensuring that every 
area with high demand gets adequate access to a common electric vehicle charging station (SPBKLU). The results 
showed that 14 optimal locations in East Surabaya could cover the needs of electric vehicle users effectively. 14 points 
are in Barata Jaya village, gubeng, gunung anyar, gunung anyar tambak, keputih, klampisngasem, semolowaru, pacar 
kembang, rangangan, dukuh sutorejo, Kedung Baruk, medokan ayu, wonorejo. These locations have been selected to 
ensure even distribution and easy access for users. This study provides practical guidance for the development of 
electric vehicle infrastructure in Surabaya, as well as offers models That can be applied by other cities that face similar 
challenges in improving facility distribution efficiency and adoption of electric vehicles.

Abstract 
Health insurance plays a crucial role in ensuring universal health coverage, particularly for foreign students studying 
in India. The study compares the satisfaction levels of students at Health Promoting University (HPU) and Other 
Universities (Non-HPUs) in Pune, India. It examines factors such as including service range, quality of healthcare 
providers, premium cost, claims process, information accessibility, and accessibility to healthcare facilities. This 
research aims to investigate the factors influencing satisfaction levels of health insurance among foreign students in 
HPU with emphasis on comparing the satisfaction levels of health insurance with Other Universities (Non-HPUs) in 
Pune, India. The study focuses on Health Promoting Universities (HPU) as the primary location, with a comparative 
analysis of other Universities (Non-HPUs) in Pune, India. A semi-structured Likert scale questionnaire was 
administered to foreign students in India from both group of universities. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, and Chi-square 
analysis were used to analyse the data in order to explore satisfaction levels and identify disparities between the two 
study groups. The sample size for the study was 412. Results showed comparable overall satisfaction levels between 
HPU (Mean=32.38±4.885) and Non-HPUs (Mean=32.42±4.885). Significant variations were found across gender 
(χ²=27.895, p<0.001) and academic disciplines (χ²=17.891, p=0.007). Male students reported higher satisfaction levels 
than females, while medical science students showed higher satisfaction compared to other disciplines. The study 
highlights the effectiveness of the HPU framework while identifying areas for improvement in health insurance 
services for foreign students.

6. Conclusion 
This research demonstrates that health insurance satisfaction among foreign students in Pune is influenced by multiple 
factors, with gender and academic discipline emerging as significant determinants. While Health Promoting 
University framework shows promise in addressing student healthcare needs, there remains room for improvement 
across all institutions. The study highlights the need for gender-sensitive healthcare services and discipline-specific 
support systems. Future policy development should focus on streamlining claims processes, improving information 
accessibility, and addressing the specific needs of female students. The findings suggest that adopting comprehensive 
health promotion frameworks, similar to WHO HPU's model, could enhance satisfaction levels across institutions 
serving international students in India. 
 
Universities aiming to improve health insurance satisfaction for foreign students should consider integrating health 
promotion into the university culture can create a more supportive environment for international students, ensuring 
their health and well-being are prioritized. Universities should also evaluate and strengthen their partnerships with 
insurance providers to ensure comprehensive, accessible, and affordable coverage that meets the specific needs of 
foreign students. Universities should take proactive steps to educate foreign students about health insurance to ensure 
they fully understand their coverage and are empowered to make informed decisions. This can be achieved through a 
variety of practical initiatives Orientation Programs, Clear Written Guides, dedicated help desk & Support Services 
for Insurance.

Abstract 
Fulfilment process is important for operational efficiency in semiconductor manufacturing, particularly for Company 
A, a leader in wafer processing equipment for thin-film deposition. This study investigates methods to enhance 
Company A's fulfilment process through the integration of a lot-sizing simulation into their existing ERP system, 
focusing on optimizing order quantities amid fluctuating demand. The research addresses three primary objectives: 
identifying inaccuracies in the current simulation, exploring ERP system integration methods, and evaluating 
fulfilment process improvements through enhanced demand forecasting and data accuracy. A mixed-method approach 
was adopted, incorporating qualitative insights from surveys with Company A’s stakeholders and quantitative data 
analysis for pain point identification. A SWOT analysis, along with a Fishbone Diagram and Monte Carlo simulations, 
supported the identification of key areas for improvement and the validation of proposed solutions. External market 
research enabled better insights to potential integration efforts and functions. Additionally, the study employed a Non-
Linear Programming (NLP) model to evaluate multiple lot-sizing scenarios based on metrics such as cost efficiency, 
safety stock, demand accuracy capacity utilization, and service level. The findings indicate significant potential for 
reducing inaccuracies and optimizing fulfilment through ERP integration, improving both forecast precision and 
process adaptability. While the proposed integration shows clear benefits in operational efficiency and cost savings, 
challenges around real-time data synchronization and user training. This research highlights the value of ERP-
integrated lot-sizing for achieving resilience and efficiency in semiconductor manufacturing supply chains.

Abstract 
Optimizing ship operations in the maritime industry is crucial for enhancing efficiency and sustainability. With the 
increasing emphasis on reducing carbon emissions and fuel consumption, innovative solutions are needed to address 
these challenges. The multi-objective ship operations optimization decision support system (MSODSS) aims to 
improve the efficiency and sustainability of ship operations by integrating advanced simulation-based optimization 
algorithms and considering inputs such as power sources, equipment health, route, navigation, and weather data. This 
paper presents the development of an MSODSS prototype based on the FlexSim simulation system. The MSODSS

Figure 5. A Ship Sailing in Ocean Current Effects from a West Location to an East Location 
 
As there is no random effect in the model, each scenario is run once with one ship. At the end of the ship’s voyage, 
the results of sailing duration, fuel consumption and gas emissions will be recorded by the model. The experiment 
results in Table 1 show that the travelling duration lengthens as the ship sails under the effect of ocean current 
conditions. As the duration is increased, fuel consumption and gas emissions will also increase accordingly. Increasing 
the sailing speed of the ship under ocean current conditions will ensure that the ship can arrive at the destination 
location on time (as in Scenario 1). However, the fuel consumption and the gas emissions will also increase greatly. 
Comparing Scenario 3 with Scenario 2, the speed of the ship has increased by 19%, but the fuel consumption and gas 
emissions have increased by 99%.

Further experiments can be carried out to study the optimization of the operations for different types of ships, as 
well as different types of ship operations such as towing, delivery and maintenance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper described the development of the prototype MSODSS, built using the FlexSim simulation system, which 
supports various ship types, including non-green, hybrid-electric, and full-electric vessels. Its simulation capabilities 
account for complex real-world variables such as weather conditions, propulsion types, and environmental impacts. 
A case study demonstrated the system's functionality by simulating ship operations in different scenarios, including 
calm seas, ocean current tidal conditions, and increased speed adjustments to maintain voyage duration. Results 
revealed that increasing speed under adverse weather significantly raised fuel consumption and emissions, 
emphasizing the trade-offs in operational decision-making.

The ships used in the current prototype are based on the vessel particulars of a container ship, and no information on 
the health status of the equipment onboard the ship was taken into account in the simulation model. The scenarios 
presented in the experiment also consider only one objective, which is the sailing duration. Future development efforts 
will focus on refining the simulation-based optimization model to add different types of harbour craft and also include 
additional factors such as hull degradation and alternative energy sources while improving the efficiency of 
computations using surrogate machine-learning models. Further case studies in real-world industry scenarios, such as 
electric harbour craft, will validate the system's practicality and provide insights into optimizing operations under 
different conflicting constraints. We will also explore deploying MSODSS beyond Singapore’s maritime context to 
other regions or ocean-going vessels, as well as other application scenarios such as optimization of maintenance 
operations for a fleet of ships. This work highlights the potential of MSODSS to transform ship operations, 
contributing to more sustainable and efficient maritime practices. By continuing to refine and expand the system, we 
aim to address the evolving challenges of the maritime industry and support the transition towards greener and more 
efficient ship operations.

Abstract 
In today's highly competitive global economy, firms face increasing pressure to develop innovative methods to produce 
and deliver value to their consumers. There has been a growing realization that good logistics strategies throughout 
the company and supply chain can be significantly helpful in achieving the goal of cost reduction and service 
enhancement. Academics and practitioners have recently paid attention to the strategic role of logistics. However, in 
the logistics and supply chain literature, the review paper focusing on the SMEs’ logistics strategy is quite limited. To 
fill the gap, this research proposes a review to identify the current issues, such as opportunities and challenges of 
effective logistics strategy. For the identity of the logistics management papers, a total of 45 research papers were 
reviewed which met the criteria. The result show that logistics practices is still being noticed and successfuly help the 
organization to improve their competitiveness, improve quality, reduce costs, increase customer satisfaction. The 
research would lead to various managerial and theoretical implications in this scope in future empirical research.

1. Introduction
In today's dynamic and highly competitive marketplace, companies are under constant pressure to find innovative ways 
to improve their value proposition to customers. One of the key enablers of this process is effective logistics 
management, which plays a crucial role in both reducing operational costs and enhancing service delivery. In general, 
integrating effective logistics management across the entire supply chain can help companies reduce operational costs 
while simultaneously enhancing service delivery, providing them with a competitive advantage in today’s fast-paced 
marketplace.   “Logistics is concerned with managing two key flows: the material flow of the physical goods from 
suppliers through the distribution centers to stores and for the online business through to the end-customer; information 
flow of demand data from the end-customer back to purchasing and to suppliers, and supply data from suppliers to the 
retailer, so that material flow can be planned and controlled accurately” (Sople, 2010). 
Logistics management is crucial for both industrial and service companies. Research suggests that effective logistics 
might improve organizational performance and market share (Ayantoyinbo & Gbadegesin, 2021; Douglas M. Lambert 
& Burduroglu, 2000; Stock, Greis, & Kasarda, 1999). Logistics is a crucial strategic factor for achieving corporate 
goals and maintaining a competitive edge (Karagöz & Akgün, 2015; Olavarrieta & Ellinger, 1997; Sezhiyan, Page, & 
Iskanius, 2011). Logistics aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of many corporate operations, including 
1717","Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

manufacturing firms where optimized logistics practices led to improved performance metrics (Adelwini, Toku, & 
Adu, 2023). Furthermore, logistics performance is a critical determinant of supply chain success, which in turn 
influences marketing and financial performance, highlighting the interconnectedness of these domains (Aćimović, 
Mijušković, Markovića, & Spasenić, 2022) 
 
Additionally, a well-structured logistics strategy can create competitive advantages by optimizing material and 
information flows, ultimately supporting broader corporate strategies. The integration of logistics management with 
organizational objectives, particularly through effective coordination and customer service commitment, further 
enhances competitiveness (McGinnis, Kara, & Wolfe, 2016; Singh & Kumar, 2020; Wudhikarn, Chakpitak, & 
Neubert, 2018). Thus, a robust logistics strategy is essential for achieving superior organizational performance. 
 
The existing research on logistics management has provided valuable insights into the operational challenges and 
performance implications of logistics practices. However, the review also highlights several gaps in the literature, 
particularly in relation to the strategic aspects of logistics management and its alignment with overall business 
objectives. 
 
3.4. Future directions 
It is commonly acknowledged that SME businesses is facing problems in commercial operations as a result of technical 
advancements and rising societal expectations for products in terms of safety and quality (Leitão, Paiva, & Thomé, 
2024). Thus, emerging trends in logistics strategies include the influence of globalization, advancements in information 
technology and e-commerce, and the adoption of new technologies. These factors are reshaping logistics operations, 
enhancing efficiency, and driving innovation within the industry. 
 
At first, key technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and blockchain are 
enhancing operational efficiency, traceability integration and enabling real-time decision-making. Additionally, the 
rise of data-driven and the need for agile responses to customer demands that require technology and innovation 
adaptation. Thus, these new digitalization processes contribute to business success towards  era 4.0  (Adeitan et al., 
2021; Demirova, 2023)  
 
Secondly, sustainability practices, including green logistics and circular economies, are increasingly prioritized to 
reduce environmental impacts and align with corporate social responsibility goals (Agyabeng-Mensah & Tang, 2021; 
Seroka-Stolka & Ociepa-Kubicka, 2019) 
 
Additionally, the interplay of globalization and localization further complicates logistics strategies, necessitating robust 
risk management to address disruptions from geopolitical tensions and natural disasters (Arifin, Arini, Herdianto, & 
Muliate, 2022; Bukola A. Odulaja, Timothy Tolulope Oke, Tobechukwu Eleogu, Adekunle Abiola Abdul, & Henry 
Onyeka Daraojimba, 2023). 
 
4. Conclusion 
Overall, developing logistics strategies are heavily influenced by technical breakthroughs, environmental initiatives, 
and changing market conditions. These developments highlight the need for ongoing innovation and adaptation in 
logistics to remain competitive in a continuously changing market.  
 
Filling the gap of knowledge by research on SMEs’ logistics strategy literature view, the study attempts to provide 
cutting-edge on strategy-related logistics at the firm level. Moreover, the result of this study will also be of value to 
academics and practitioners to have a better understanding of effective logistics strategy and their role in examining 
the firm’s competitive performance.

Abstract 
Plant closures have always concerned supply chain purchasers. A supplier plant could close anytime due to natural 
disasters, strikes, pandemics, or financial distress. Supply chain purchasers must assess potential suppliers' risk when 
identifying annual contracts and evaluating capacity planning. Previous models in literature determine the likelihood 
of a supplier’s plant closure within a year. In this paper, we expand beyond likelihood to determine the predicted 
length of plant closure using linear regression, cox proportional hazards, and accelerated failure time models. We 
apply our models to a case study within the Department of Defense (DoD). Our results demonstrate that these 
predictive models have the potential to aid in the mitigation of supply chain risk, improving capacity allocation, and 
saving taxpayer dollars.

Given the strong performance of the AFT model, we recommend its use for predictive risk assessment in DoD 
supply chains. This model can be integrated into existing supplier risk evaluation frameworks, such as Sanders’ 
(2023), to improve contingency planning and supply chain resilience. 
 
6.2 Implications for Supply Chain Resilience 
The results of this study have direct implications for improving supply chain resilience within defense and 
manufacturing industries. Procurement and supply chain managers can make data-driven decisions regarding 
supplier selection, inventory buffering, and contingency planning by accurately predicting closure durations. The 
AFT model’s ability to estimate downtime with high accuracy can help optimize resource allocation, ensuring that 
supply chain disruptions are mitigated more effectively. Furthermore, integrating survival analysis into supplier risk 
assessments can significantly advance traditional binary risk classification models. Instead of merely identifying 
whether a supplier is at risk, organizations can now estimate how long a disruption will persist, allowing for more 
strategic mitigation efforts. This approach aligns with broader efforts to enhance supply chain visibility and 
predictive analytics in government contracting and defense logistics. 
 
6.3 Limitations and Future Research 
Despite the promising results, this study has several limitations. The dataset used was limited to U.S.-based 
suppliers, restricting the generalizability of the findings to international supply chains. Additionally, the data was 
collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, which introduced unique volatility and unpredictability that may not 
represent expected supply chain disruptions. Expanding the dataset to include more diverse closure events across 
multiple industries would strengthen the model’s applicability. 
 
Future research should explore approaches combining AFT modeling with machine learning techniques, such as 
random forests or neural networks, to capture complex, non-linear interactions among risk factors. Additionally, 
incorporating dynamic risk factors, such as real-time geopolitical data, economic indicators, and supplier financial 
health, could further enhance model robustness. Expanding this research beyond the aerospace and defense sectors 
would provide insights into supply chain resilience across broader industrial applications.

Abstract 
Effective water resource management is one of the most critical challenges for organizations as increasing water 
scarcity and climate change can complicate business continuity. This study presents a systemic approach based on 
intelligent systems for optimizing water consumption in the organizational environment. Three systemic models were 
developed that make use of discrete event simulation using the Monte Carlo method and System Dynamics, in which 
water supply, consumption and recycling are evaluated under various uncertainty scenarios. The results show the 
integration of advanced analytical tools allowing the identification of critical points, operational risk analysis and the 
proposal of highly sustainable solutions. Offering organizations an effective roadmap for the correct implementation 
of effective and resilient policies in the face of climate change and water scarcity.

1. Introduction
The scarcity of drinking water is a global problem that continues to worsen, some causes are associated with climate 
change and overexploitation of aquifers. Aquae (2024) reports that the distribution of drinking water on Earth amounts 
to 0.007%, an insufficient figure for the more than 1.1 billion people in the world who lack direct access to sources of 
drinking water, so they suffer water stress, the latter is driven by population growth and rapid urbanization, bringing 
with it the constant search for the vital liquid accelerating the degradation of ecosystems, overexploitation of rivers,  
lagoons and bodies of water. 
In addition to the deficient and careless management of water resources, the equitable supply of water in society has 
been put at risk. In Mexico City alone, 17% of neighborhoods are supplied with water only through pipes, that is, there 
is no infrastructure to ensure access to water resources to meet their needs. Based on the Sistema de Aguas de la

6. Conclusion  
Each model has a distinct and specific purpose from the point of view of basic operational analysis to uncertainty 
assessment and comprehensive policy. By developing three models together, a more complete view of the system was 
provided, as the first two did not consider water loss during supply or the impact of water recycling on the organization.  
 
Increasing the recycling rate and implementing water efficiency technologies can significantly reduce supply 
shortfalls. Evaporation and leakage loss management is crucial to avoid overflows. Both organizations and taxpaying 
citizens must demand improvements in water supply infrastructure, as it is unacceptable that nearly half of the resource 
is being lost.  
 
With the results presented during the state-of-the-art research, technologies such as Membrane Bioreactors, Advanced 
Oxidation Processes, Reverse Osmosis and Edge Computing are mentioned, senior management should carry out a 
systemic study to determine which technologies are best suited to their line of business and activities, allowing them 
to integrate technologies for water recycling. Many of the companies have installed aerators in toilets to reduce water 
consumption, dry urinals, water recycling for watering green areas, and rainwater harvesting for cleaning activities. 
These initiatives are important steps towards a more efficient and sustainable use of water.  
 
The integration of technologies such as Membrane Bioreactors, Advanced Oxidation Processes and Reverse Osmosis 
allows for more effective water treatment, reducing contamination and improving water quality by ensuring that 
recycled water meets the necessary standards for reuse in various applications, from agricultural irrigation to human 
consumption.  
 
The implementation of systemic models coupled with advanced technologies has a significant positive impact on 
sustainable development. These models not only optimize water management but also contribute to achieving several 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 6, which seeks to ensure the availability and sustainable 
management of water and sanitation for all.  
 
Integrated water resources management, supported by emerging technologies, strengthens resilience to climate 
change, better adaptation to extreme weather conditions and ensuring a stable water supply even in adverse situations.  
 
By ensuring access to clean water and adequate sanitation, water-related diseases are reduced, thereby improving the 
health and well-being of communities, and improving people's quality of life.  
 
Therefore, by combining analytical models with advanced technologies, we achieve not only more efficient water 
management, but also a move towards sustainable development that benefits both the environment and communities, 
allowing us to build a future where access to water can be safe and equitable for all.

Abstract 
Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative tool in various industries due to its potential to enhance 
transparency, traceability, and efficiency. Despite its growing adoption globally, the integration of blockchain 
education into logistics and supply chain management curricula remains underexplored, particularly in South Africa. 
This study conducts a comprehensive curriculum review to investigate the extent to which blockchain concepts are 
incorporated in logistics and supply chain education in South Africa. Using publicly available data, such as university 
brochures, module outlines, and departmental policies, this research aims to evaluate the alignment of current curricula 
with industry demands and global educational trends. By comparing South Africa’s higher education approach to 
international benchmarks, the study identifies gaps, highlights potential opportunities for blockchain integration, and 
offers recommendations for curriculum development. The findings will contribute to bridging the knowledge gap 
between academic institutions and the logistics industry, fostering a workforce prepared for emerging technological 
challenges.

1. Introduction
Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions securely and transparently across 
multiple nodes in a network (Aditya, Shastry, Kiruthika, and Kishore Kumar, 2024; Bhandari, Trivedi, R., Garg, and 
Saini, 2024). Initially popularized through cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, blockchain has since demonstrated its value 
in sectors such as finance, healthcare, and supply chain management (Verma, P., Srivastava, R. D., and Senthil, Kumar, 
2024). Supply chain management (SCM) relies heavily on blockchain technology since it streamlines transactions, 
lowers costs and delays, and improves reliability, Rahal and Khalifa, (2024). Its core attributes, including immutability, 
transparency, and enhanced security, make it particularly appealing in addressing logistical challenges like fraud, 
inefficiency, and lack of traceability (Nwariaku, H., Fadojutimi, Lawson, Agbelusi, J., Adigun, Udom, and Olajide, 
2024; George, Idemudia, and Ige, A. B., 2024). For example, blockchain can optimize supply chain processes by 
providing real-time tracking of goods and ensuring accountability among stakeholders (Tapscott & Tapscott, 2018).

(e.g., traceability and transparency) are indirectly referenced in South African curricula. For example: Figure 5 
revealed strong connections between blockchain features and supply chain processes already present in curricula, 
such as traceability in inventory management. However, the lack of blockchain terminology shows institutions are 
teaching these principles without linking them to blockchain technology as a critical enabler. This suggests that while 
South African programs cover relevant concepts, they fall short of framing blockchain as an essential digital skill for 
the future workforce. 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
The integration of blockchain technology into logistics and supply chain management curricula represents a critical 
opportunity to bridge the gap between academic education and industry needs. This study revealed significant gaps in 
South African higher education, where blockchain-related content is conspicuously absent despite its relevance in 
addressing challenges such as inefficiency, fraud, and lack of traceability in supply chains. While international 
curricula have begun to embrace blockchain concepts, South African institutions lag behind, potentially 
disadvantaging graduates in a globalized and digitally-driven job market. 
 
The analysis underscores the transformative potential of blockchain technology, characterized by transparency, 
traceability, immutability, and decentralization. These attributes align well with the skills demanded by modern 
logistics and supply chain operations, making their inclusion in educational programs imperative. By adopting the 
proposed Logistics and Supply Chain Blockchain Education (LSCBE) model, institutions can meet the expectations 
of key stakeholders, including students, industry partners, educational institutions, and government bodies. 
To address these gaps, it is recommended that South African higher education institutions: 
 
1. Embed Blockchain Concepts in Curricula: Incorporate blockchain-focused modules that emphasize 
theoretical and practical applications in logistics and supply chain management. 
2. Leverage Stakeholder Collaboration: Engage industry and government stakeholders to align educational 
content with market demands and policy objectives. 
3. Adopt Innovative Pedagogical Approaches: Use case studies, simulations, and interdisciplinary projects to 
teach blockchain concepts effectively. 
 
The findings from this research offer a roadmap for aligning logistics and supply chain education with the demands 
of a digitized industry. Implementing these recommendations can enhance the employability of graduates, improve 
institutional competitiveness, and contribute to national goals of reducing youth unemployment and fostering 
economic development. As the logistics industry evolves, the integration of blockchain education is not just an 
opportunity but a necessity for sustainable growth.

Discussion and Findings 
This study investigated the extent to which blockchain education is integrated into logistics and supply chain 
management (LSCM) curricula in South Africa. The analysis of 39 curriculum documents and 100 blockchain-related 
articles revealed critical gaps, opportunities, and pathways to align South African education with global industry 
demands. 
 
Absence of Blockchain in Curricula 
The thematic analysis of 39 South African higher education curricula found no explicit mention of blockchain 
technology. This was further demonstrated through the word cloud analysis (Figure 1), where blockchain terms were 
absent despite foundational supply chain principles being present. 
• 
In contrast, Figure 2 highlights how blockchain’s core features (e.g., traceability, decentralization, 
transparency, trust, and security) are prevalent in international literature, emphasizing their relevance for 
modern supply chains. 
• 
 
Analysis of 39 curriculum documents from South African universities and colleges offering supply chain and logistics 
qualifications shows an absence of blockchain as a formal topic, despite references to its core characteristics such as 
transparency and traceability. This lack of integration creates a critical gap in preparing graduates with the digital skills 
necessary to meet the demands of a rapidly digitizing logistics industry. As global supply chains increasingly adopt 
blockchain technologies, South African graduates’ risk being disadvantaged in both local and international markets. 
  
The LSCBE Model 
The Logistics and Supply Chain Blockchain Education (LSCBE) model, based on stakeholder theory, aims to address 
curriculum gaps by integrating blockchain's core features into LSCM education. This model Figure 2, benefits key 
stakeholders by preparing students for employment and entrepreneurship in a blockchain-driven industry, aligning 
curricula with global standards, providing graduates with blockchain competencies to drive operational efficiency and 
innovation, and addressing youth unemployment. The model emphasizes embedding blockchain concepts through 
theory and practice, case studies and simulations, and collaborative learning, focusing on industries like food 
traceability, pharmaceuticals, and ethical sourcing. 
 
The Role of Data Analysis 
The study’s data analysis, visualized in Figures 1 through 5, demonstrates that blockchain’s underlying principles

Abstract 
This research aims to develop a calculation model for the fuel consumption ratio in tank trucks during the fuel 
distribution process at one of the fuel terminals of an oil company in Indonesia. The development of this model is 
prompted by the obsolescence of the old ratio, which is no longer relevant to current operational needs. Fuel 
consumption ratio is a critical component of operational costs, making it essential to establish a more accurate and 
reliable model. The study adopts a full-to-full approach, measuring fuel consumption before and after distribution 
trips, while integrating data from the company’s Online Distribution Information System (ODIS). Key variables 
considered in the model include tank truck type, fuel product type, route characteristics, and road gradient. 
Polynomial regression is employed to analyze the relationship between fuel consumption and influencing factors, 
ensuring a comprehensive and robust model. The analysis also incorporates the impact of road gradient on fuel 
consumption to enhance the model’s adaptability. The findings demonstrate that the new model provides improved 
and reliable estimates of fuel consumption, enabling more accurate operational budget planning and reducing 
discrepancies in consumption data. This research contributes significantly to the development of an adaptive and 
dynamic fuel consumption model that enhances efficiency and supports sustainable fuel distribution operations.

Introduction 
Fuel consumption efficiency is a critical component in the operational costs of fuel distribution, particularly for the 
Oil National Company. The company's core business processes include fuel sales, handling, fleet management, and 
terminal operations. One of the key terminals under the Oil National Company in the Central Java Region plays a 
significant role in this distribution network. This terminal covers an area of 78,180 m² and distributes various fuel 
products, including gasoline, diesel, high-octane fuel, and regular gasoline, to nine districts in Central Java Province. 
The daily distribution process involves the use of tank trucks with varying capacities (8 KL, 16 KL, and 24 KL). 
Accurate fuel consumption measurement is paramount given the diverse road conditions, ranging from flat to hilly 
terrain.

Abstract 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems are software integrated systems that bring together all the functional 
units and their business processes and procedures onto a single database server that serves all the needs of the 
organization. ERPs are growing and expanding rapidly in higher education institutions. The huge investments and the 
numerous positive impacts of ERP systems by the HEIs required to be evaluated based on the performance of their 
application. However, there is no proper and safe integrative model that would assess thoroughly the performance of 
ERPs in HEIs. Therefore, this study proposes a safety cube theory-based framework for ERPs performance assessment 
in HEIs. The proposed safety cube theory-based model has been built by combining two commonly known models: 
Balanced scorecard (BSC) and ISO 25010 models with safety cube theory. The framework has been built to investigate 
thoroughly the performance of ERP. The proposed safety cube theory-based framework comprises five perspectives 
(System Quality, stakeholder/Customer, Internal Business Process, Learning & Growth and Financial) which would 
be used to evaluate any ERP system in higher education institutions. Thus, the outcome of this study is an application 
of the safety cube theory in the development of a framework for standard assessment of ERPs in HEIs. 
Keywords 
HEIs, ERP systems, evaluation framework, Performance, safety cube theory. 
1. Introduction
The Gartner Research Group in 1992 proposed the term ERP to represent a wide range of processes and procedures 
in an organization through its best software application modules (Hustad and Stensholt, 2023).  Recent technological 
advancement has made ERP systems become one of the most demand IT/IS applications in all sectors of the economy. 
They help to deliver a compact solution to firm’s information system needs. ERPs are currently in high demand in 
communities including the manufacturing industry, service industry, banking industry and educational sectors. There 
is no unified explanation for ERP, since various contributions and explanations have already been associated to it. For 
instance, Shen et al,. (2016) and Tonsakun-Aree, (2021) reported that ERPs are systems that unite and speed-up the

research findings also support the claim by Rajabalinejad et al., (2020) that systems can be integrated properly and 
safely with the use of safety cube theory. 
 
Implications of Research Findings 
Practical Implications: 
• 
The finding provides a new way and insights for HEIs managements and stakeholders when it comes into 
ERPs assessments.  
• 
The finding provides a direction, guide and approach for HEIs managements into monitoring of the ERP 
systems. 
Theoretical Implications: 
• 
The finding provides new insights into the adaptation and extension of the safety cube theory in the IS field. 
• 
The finding provides a justification of the safety cube theory for proper and safe systems integration in the 
IS field.  
Policy Implications: 
• 
The finding serves as a comprehensive approach or framework through which HEIs management can develop 
policy directions.  
The finding provides a holistic approach or model through which government, industry and academia can develop 
policy guidelines and directions for higher education sectors 
 
4.1 Future Research Direction 
Future studies will look at validating the proposed framework of this study. Empirical or experimental research studies 
will be conducted to demonstrate the framework’s practical applicability and effectiveness. Both quantitative and 
qualitative methods could be used to validate the framework proposed.  
 
5. Conclusion  
A Safety Cube Theory-Based Framework for evaluating ERPs in HEIs has been proposed. The framework’s 
perspectives were developed as a result of a proper and safe unification of BSC and ISO 25010 quality standard, 
through the safety cube theory application. To our knowledge, this framework is first of its kind created for the 
assessment of ERPs in HEIs. The study highlights three important contributions which include the provision of insight 
into the application of safety cube theory in IS field, provision of how systems are properly and safely integrated and 
the extension of BSC framework perspectives as a base for the system integrative framework proposed. Further studies 
will be conducted to explore more of the applications of safety cube theory in the area of information systems. The 
outcomes of these additional studies will enable us to understand and develop proper and safe systems for our business 
organizations and institutions.

Abstract 
This study proposes the importance of process parameters in improving the surface roughness of aluminum alloy 6061 
by developing a hybrid framework integrating Design of Experiments (DOE) and Six Sigma methodologies. Alloy-
6061 is a common component used in many small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to manufacture high-quality 
aerospace parts and sensitive industrial products. Implementing this hybrid framework improves key machining 
metrics and overall equipment effectiveness that align with strict supplier quality requirements from leading aerospace 
firms and enhances bottom-line results. Using a Taguchi L9 orthogonal array and regression models within the 
DMAIC (Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control) cycle, this study identified optimal turning parameters—insert 
radius, feed rate, and depth of cut—for minimizing surface roughness. Results indicate that feed rate is the most 
influential factor, followed by insert radius and depth of cut. DMAIC methodology is a fundamental quality 
improvement strategy that enables young professionals to address surface roughness improvement in final products. 
Practitioners can adapt the proposed integrated methods to different project-based quality enhancement challenges.

1. Introduction
The primary aim of manufacturing industries is to produce high-quality products efficiently and cost-effectively. 
Turning is a fundamental machining process, and the finishing of the process plays a critical role in enhancing quality, 
productivity, and cost-effectiveness. Surface roughness is a critical indicator of a product's quality and performance 
and significantly impacts its functionality, aesthetics, and durability. Industries recognize the importance of optimally

This phase validates optimal machining settings identified during analysis with additional experiments. Key 
activities are: 
 
 
After optimize machining parameters to achieve minimal Ra values, validate findings with additional 
experiments, confirming improvements in surface roughness. 
 
Integrate confirmation run into standard operating procedures to sustain improvements. 
 
Confirmation Run 
The process of turning operations to AL6061 alloy was carried out according to the following parameters shown in 
Table 8. A confirmation test was conducted to validate the developed mathematical model’s prediction of apparent 
surface roughness.

After selecting the best levels for the process parameters, the final step is to predict and confirm how much they 
improve the performance. We estimate the Signal-to-Noise (S/N) ratio using these optimal levels. This estimated S/N 
ratio calculation involves the total mean S/N ratio, the mean S/N ratio at the chosen optimal levels (ηi), and the count 
of process parameters (q) that significantly impact performance. This can be calculated following Lin (2002) as, 
 
𝜂𝜂𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜= 𝜂𝜂̂ + ∑
൫𝜂𝜂𝚥𝚥ഥ−𝜂𝜂̂൯
𝑞𝑞
𝑗𝑗=1

Where 𝜂𝜂̂ is the total mean S/N ratio, 𝜂𝜂𝚥𝚥ഥ the mean S/N ratio at the optimal level, and q is the number of the process 
parameters in the main design. Table 9 shows the model’s results and experimental verification.

Based on the results of the validation of the mathematical model, it was found that the predicted results from the model 
and the experimental results agreed within the 5% range of parameters. The result reveals that using the optimal 
parameters has reduced surface roughness. The experimental outcomes validate that our selected optimal cutting 
parameters effectively achieved the desired results in the turning operations. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This study on surface roughness improvement of Aluminum 6061 (Al 6061) alloy demonstrates the effectiveness of 
This study demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating the Taguchi method (L9 orthogonal array) within the DMAIC 
framework to optimize turning parameters for improved surface roughness of Aluminum 6061 (Al 6061). This 
experimental approach provided valuable insights into the influence of insert radius, feed rate, and depth of cut on 
surface finish. Analysis revealed feed rate as the most influential factor, followed by insert radius, with depth of cut 
having the least impact. These findings provide practical guidance for optimizing manufacturing processes to enhance 
quality and performance, serving as a valuable reference for similar machining operations.

 
Achieve minimum surface roughness with a higher insert radius and lower cut and feed rate depth. A larger 
insert radius creates a wider cutting edge, smoothing the surface by averaging out microscopic peaks.  
 
A smaller depth of cut results in finer chips and less aggressive cutting, leading to a smoother surface.  
 
Similarly, a lower feed rate allows for more precise material removal and a finer finish. 
 
Integrating DMAIC and DOE principles establishes a strong foundation for continuous improvement and operational 
excellence in machining processes. By leveraging DMAIC principles, this framework offers professionals to involve 
in various machining quality improvement, particularly within the aerospace manufacturing sector. Future research 
could extend this framework to address additional critical-to-quality (CTQ) characteristics, such as tensile strength 
and thermal conductivity.

Abstract 
The study narrates the development of “Multipurpose Ergonomic Cart” with a rotating feature aiming to enhance the 
safe and efficient handling of various items throughout diverse environments like hospitals, restaurants, offices and 
households. Traditional cart systems cause physical strain due to repetitive bending and improper anthropometric 
usage, resulting in musculoskeletal disorder. The proposed Cart integrates rotatable shelves with maneuverability that 
allows user easy access to items at an ergonomic height, focusing on less physical strain and improved operational 
efficiency. The insights which are obtained to lead the design process, which was created through a House of Quality 
analysis aligning customer demands with engineering specifications. The Cart’s Design was developed following a 
stern stress analysis to ensure durability, usability, and safety. Material selection and processes were firmly observed 
based on index calculations, compliance with safety standards. Choosing components were carefully conducted in 
terms of user-friendly interface, reliability for the validation of the design. This user-centered ergonomic cart which 
meets the condition of sustainability, promoting the vibrant user comfort portion and convenient to multiple 
workplaces usage minimizing the body forces can substitute traditional cart systems. This approach impacts on Human 
Factor by maintaining operational standards, ensuring human well-being (SDG 3), filling the work-envelope standard 
design requirements, minimizing disk pressure with static loading of back muscles, and easy adjustability to reduce 
postural movement.

Abstract 
This paper discusses how to leverage Agile for large-scale projects, sprints and beyond. Agile has made quite an 
impact on project management in recent years. Before Agile, especially in the technology industry, we really didn't 
have much project management methodology to speak of. Now, with Agile, project management is making significant 
headway toward being well-understood again. Scaling Agile has already begun to make inroads in the public sector 
and is mainstream in many Fortune 500 companies. The reason is quite simple: Agile is delivering the kind of results 
these customers demand. This paper explores why these large-scale public and private entities are using Agile and 
how they're managing to do it effectively because they are doing it across long-standing, complex projects, some of 
which have hundreds of people working on them across vast expanses of time and space. Our customers want us to 
deliver results that can be described as being fast, frequent, and (most importantly) effective.

Abstract 
This presentation, titled ""From Setback to Success: Overcoming Agile Transformation Failures with Key Lessons,"" 
discusses the frequent traps organizations fall into during their Agile transformation attempts. Agile holds the promise 
of enriched collaboration, speedier delivery, and heightened customer satisfaction, yet a dire number of organizations 
find themselves unable to scale or otherwise effectively implement Agile practices. They encounter several common 
and significant challenges that I will address.The first part of the presentation will focus on some real-world examples 
of Agile transformation ""failures."" What went wrong? What did the organization do next? What did they learn? 
(Because these missteps often yield more useful insights than the fast, ""successful"" transformations.) The second part 
will offer strategies and solutions for moving forward and celebrating future successes. They promise ""enhanced 
collaboration, faster delivery, and improved customer satisfaction,"" yet organizations face a daunting number of 
significant challenges that I will address. Agile delivery isn't just a ""project management"" framework, and working in 
a collaborative style isn't just about the tools you use. It's a cultural shift. Tools help us achieve our goals, and this is 
certainly true in the Agile space. You've probably seen this: a pie chart representing a ""typical"" organization's budget 
breakdown and noting that 70% of the budget goes toward projects destined to fail, according to some source that was 
popular in the management consultancy world a few years back. Recalibrating strategy and redefining success are two 
things I did to help an organization overcome the hurdles that put its large-scale Agile transformation on the brink of 
collapse. This is the story of that transformation and the lessons it teaches us. It's a story rich with lessons on how to 
gain buy-in from hesitant executives, build a pipeline of talented and motivated people to lead and work in that Agile 
culture, and ensure that your success is their success too—because it has to be if you want them to keep funding your 
transformation. Here are some of the lessons I learned from my experiences on the brink of failure with that 
transformation.  
Keywords 
Agile transformation, failure, cultural shift, strategy, executive buy-in. 
1. Introduction
Organizations frequently perceive agile transformation as a universal solution to achieve modernization while 
boosting project delivery and collaborative efforts. Although Agile methodology offers substantial potential benefits 
many organizations encounter formidable challenges during its adoption process especially when trying to extend it 
across multiple teams or departments. Analyzing the underlying causes of Agile transformation failures becomes 
essential to achieve progress towards establishing a successful Agile environment. 
The necessity to conduct this research emerges because Agile methodologies have gained widespread popularity yet 
fail to consistently produce the expected outcomes for organizations. Certain instances demonstrate how these systems 
have produced feelings of frustration alongside operational inefficiencies which then result in employee 
disengagement. The examination of frequent obstacles encountered by organizations during Agile transformations 
combined with the lessons derived from these challenges offers essential insights for future Agile implementations.

Figure 1: Common Challenges in Agile Transformation 
Figure 1 shows a bar chart representing the most common challenges faced by organizations during their Agile 
transformations. The challenges are ranked according to frequency, with executive support being the highest. 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The examination of gathered data permits the suggestion of numerous enhancements designed to address the detected 
obstacles. 
 
1. It is imperative for organizations to secure complete commitment from their executive leadership teams to support 
Agile transformation initiatives. The attainment of this objective requires the implementation of workshops alongside 
training sessions while ensuring the communication of Agile's long-term benefits remains clear. 
2. The essential task of addressing employee resistance requires the promotion of transparency and collaboration 
within the organizational culture. The process of engaging employees during transformation initiatives combined with 
the establishment of feedback mechanisms and the demonstration of quick successes serves as a method to reduce 
resistance. 
3. The allocation of resources into extensive team training programs represents an essential business strategy. To 
guarantee a deep understanding of Agile principles the training programs need to be tailored to specific roles while 
providing 
practical 
experience 
and 
maintaining 
continuous 
learning 
opportunities. 
4. It is essential for leaders to establish an unambiguous vision while articulating how Agile methodologies support 
the organization's overarching objectives. The process of establishing success metrics needs to occur at the initial 
stages. 
5. The process of expanding Agile practices across numerous teams demands the implementation of a uniform 
methodology as an essential requirement. Organizations seeking to establish uniform Agile methodologies across 
large teams can implement frameworks such as SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) or LeSS (Large Scale Scrum). 
 
5.4 Validation 
The organizations which put these strategies into practice documented an increased success rate in their Agile 
transformation endeavors as a means to validate the proposed improvements. Follow-up evaluations performed one 
year after transformation efforts revealed that organizations which enhanced executive support alongside employee 
participation experienced a 30% increase in successful Agile adoption. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The research document examined the numerous difficulties organizations encounter during Agile transformations and 
presented practical methods to address these obstacles. The examination of case studies together with lessons learned 
reveals that Agile represents a cultural transformation which demands leadership dedication alongside investments in 
employee development and organizational goal alignment. The essential lesson for organizations is that they need to 
develop an Agile mindset throughout all levels instead of merely adopting Agile tools or frameworks. The potential 
avenues for future research include examining Agile transformations within distinct industries to provide a detailed 
understanding of sustaining long-term success following initial implementation.

Abstract 
Ensuring worker attentiveness on construction sites is crucial for safety and efficiency. This study explored how AI 
and machine learning can help monitor attentiveness and identify potential distractions in real time. Through 
behavioral observations and physiological data analysis, key patterns in worker focus and inattentiveness were 
uncovered. The most common distraction was engaging in unnecessary conversations (30.0%), while failure to wear 
PPE was the least observed (12.5%). Physiological data showed that inattentive workers had lower heart rate 
variability (HRV = 46 ms) and higher galvanic skin response (GSR = 5.9 µS), indicating increased stress and fatigue. 
A strong negative correlation (-0.73) between HRV and inattentiveness suggests that workers with lower HRV are

6. Conclusion  
This study set out to develop a framework for identifying signs of attentiveness and inattentiveness among construction 
workers, using AI and computer vision to enhance safety monitoring and prevent accidents. By combining behavioral 
observations, real-time sensor data, and machine learning models, the study was able to detect patterns in worker 
attentiveness and pinpoint key factors contributing to distractions on-site. The integration of AI-driven monitoring 
systems provided a proactive way to identify unsafe behaviors, offering real-time feedback to improve worker 
awareness and adherence to safety protocols. 
 
Observations, as shown in Table 1, revealed that the most common inattentive behavior was engaging in unnecessary 
conversations (30.0%), while failure to wear PPE was the least frequent (12.5%). Physiological data in Table 2 showed 
that inattentive workers had lower heart rate variability (HRV = 46 ms) and higher galvanic skin response (GSR = 5.9 
µS), indicating increased stress and fatigue compared to their more attentive colleagues. Additionally, Table 3 
confirmed a strong negative correlation between HRV and inattentiveness (-0.73), meaning lower HRV was linked to 
reduced focus. Conversely, higher GSR readings (0.69) suggested that increased stress levels contributed to 
inattentiveness. 
 
These findings highlight the potential of AI-based safety systems in promoting attentiveness and reducing workplace 
hazards. By providing real-time alerts and data-driven insights, these technologies can play a crucial role in improving 
construction site safety. Moving forward, refining these models and expanding their use in different work 
environments will further enhance their effectiveness in accident prevention and overall worker well-being.

Abstract 
Project selection is a complex, multi-criteria decision-making problem that is critical to the selection of meaningful, 
manageable, and sustainable projects and is being solved in a variety of contexts such as infrastructure, information 
systems, and marketing. However, the same diversity could also lead to disconnection where researchers and 
practitioners are unaware of the work being done on project selection and domains other than their own. This scoping 
review followed a systematic five-step process to screen 120 and synthesize 109 articles on project selection to firstly 
ascertain what research has been done in the field of project selection, where it has been done, and what techniques 
are the most prevalent amongst researchers. The main contribution of this research is a ‘cross-pollination matrix’ 
produced by the synthesis of the literature which will enable researchers and practitioners alike to find either similar 
work on which they can build or fund innovative new perspectives on a shared and complex problem: the selection of 
projects that will move the proverbial needle. The review found that the field is ripe for inter-disciplinary learning 
with publications spanning 14 different contexts, using 32 different decision-making models delivering a significant 
amount of case studies and theoretical contributions. Research efforts were dominated by the customization and 
application of existing project selection models with very little attention given to empirical research on the praxis of 
project selection. No other scoping reviews were identified during the screening of literature.

1. Introduction
Operations improvement is strongly correlated to increased profitability of companies (Kaplan and Norton 2008) and 
the process of improvement project selection is, in turn, correlated to the success of operations improvement (Albliwi 
et al. 2014, Antony and Banuelas 2002, Bacdayan 2001). Lynch et al. (2003) define an improvement project as a 
project that “address[es] an organizational performance problem that has an unknown solution”.  
In the field of operations improvement, many tools and concepts can be used to identify improvement opportunities 
such as benchmarking, value stream mapping, statistical process control, etc. When multiple improvement 
opportunities are identified, and the resources with which to convert these opportunities into improvements are limited, 
operations management is forced to prioritize the opportunities by considering various constraints and criteria (Adams 
et al. 2007, Marriott et al. 2013). The topic of the selection of improvement projects that are “meaningful and 
manageable” (Pande et al. 2014), is well represented in the literature.  
During the process of project selection, improvement practitioners can use objective or subjective prioritization 
methods or a hybrid of both methods. Objective prioritization methods are more analytical in nature, often employing 
quantitative decision-making models, whereas subjective decision-making tends to use intuition and feelings, but is 
considered less desirable (Harung 1993).

Abstract 
The advent of 3D printing is transforming the manufacturing landscape, enabling flexible, on-demand production with 
minimal setup costs. This study examines the impact of 3D printing on the manufacturer-retailer supply chain, 
focusing on a Stackelberg framework with two product scenarios. We analyze the conditions under which 3D printing 
becomes a viable alternative to traditional manufacturing, considering factors such as customer demand, production 
costs, and capacity constraints. Our research highlights the complex trade-offs involved in adopting 3D printing, 
including reduced inventory holding costs, improved customer satisfaction, and increased flexibility, versus higher 
variable costs and slower production rates. We also explore the implications of 3D printing for supply chain 
coordination, including the potential for double marginalization. The study contributes to the growing literature on 3D 
printing in supply chains, offering actionable recommendations for businesses navigating this evolving landscape. Our 
findings provide valuable insights for manufacturers and retailers seeking to leverage 3D printing to improve their 
supply chain operations and stay competitive in today's dynamic market.

1. Introduction
The advent of 3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, has significantly transformed the manufacturing 
landscape. Unlike traditional production methods such as molding, casting, and machining, which rely on economies 
of scale and large production runs, 3D printing allows for flexible, on-demand production with minimal setup costs. 
This technological shift enables manufacturers to move from standardized, mass production toward highly 
customizable and agile production systems. Such flexibility is particularly valuable in supply chain management, 
where manufacturers and retailers face increasing pressures to meet dynamic consumer demand, reduce lead times, 
and control costs. 
Traditional manufacturing methods often involve high fixed costs and significant lead times due to reliance on 
extensive tooling and setup processes. In contrast, 3D printing eliminates many of these barriers by enabling the 
production of small batches with little to no retooling effort. As a result, 3D printing has been widely adopted across 
industries, ranging from aerospace and automotive to healthcare. For example, companies like BMW have embraced 
3D printing to streamline operations, particularly for producing spare parts for legacy products. By adopting this

which remains constant regardless of 𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝,2. In contrast, the blue line (𝜋𝜋𝑀𝑀
3𝐷𝐷1) and green line (𝜋𝜋𝑀𝑀
3𝐷𝐷) show a decreasing 
trend, indicating a negative correlation between 𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝,2 and profitability in these cases. Notably, the steep decline in 
profits for these cases highlights the sensitivity of profit outcomes to higher production costs. 
The vertical red dashed line marks a critical threshold of 𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝,2 = 10. To the left of this threshold, both 𝜋𝜋𝑀𝑀
3𝐷𝐷1 exhibit 
significantly higher profits, with 𝜋𝜋𝑀𝑀
3𝐷𝐷1 outperforming 𝜋𝜋𝑀𝑀
3𝐷𝐷. However, as 𝑐𝑐𝑝𝑝,2 increases beyond the threshold, all profits 
converge to lower levels, underscoring the diminishing profitability of these scenarios as costs rise.

5. Conclusion 
This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the implications of 3D printing on decentralized manufacturer-retailer 
supply chains, with a focus on two-product scenarios modeled under a Stackelberg framework. By comparing 
traditional manufacturing and 3D printing, we highlight the strategic trade-offs businesses face when considering this 
disruptive technology. While 3D printing offers significant benefits, such as reduced inventory costs, enhanced 
flexibility, and improved responsiveness to demand variability, its adoption introduces challenges like higher variable 
costs and capacity limitations. 
Our findings reveal that 3D printing can be a viable alternative to traditional manufacturing under specific conditions, 
particularly when demand patterns favor customization and agility. Moreover, the results emphasize the importance 
of aligning supply chain coordination mechanisms to fully capitalize on the benefits of 3D printing while minimizing 
inefficiencies such as double marginalization. The derived equilibrium solutions underscore the dynamic interplay 
between cost structures, pricing strategies, and capacity constraints in determining the optimal manufacturing 
approach. 
Through numerical analysis, we further illustrate how critical parameters such as production costs, demand variability, 
and capacity influence the equilibrium strategies for manufacturers and retailers. These insights provide actionable 
guidance for businesses evaluating the adoption of 3D printing as part of their supply chain strategy, enabling them to 
balance cost efficiency with market responsiveness effectively. 
In conclusion, 3D printing represents a paradigm shift in manufacturing and supply chain management, offering both 
opportunities and challenges. By rigorously analyzing these dynamics, this research contributes to the growing body 
of literature on additive manufacturing and its role in transforming modern supply chains. Future research could 
expand on these findings by exploring multi-product scenarios or integrating environmental sustainability into the 
decision-making framework, further enriching the understanding of 3D printing's potential in complex supply chain 
ecosystems.

Abstract 
As Oman strives to meet its Vision 2040 goals for sustainable development and energy diversification, the need for 
innovative renewable energy technologies becomes increasingly critical. This research explores the design and 
optimization of multi-state biogas reactors as a transformative solution to address the dual challenges of waste 
management and renewable energy production. With municipal solid waste generation in Oman reaching 1.7 million 
tonnes annually—of which 27% is organic—the potential for utilizing this waste in biogas production through 
anaerobic digestion remains largely untapped. The study introduces a novel multi-state biogas reactor design capable 
of operating in single- or two-stage configurations, optimizing methane yield, process stability, and substrate 
utilization efficiency. Key design elements include advanced mixing techniques, thermal regulation, and microbial 
immobilization strategies to enhance methanogenesis, the rate-limiting step in biogas production. Experimental 
investigations focus on the interactions between microbial communities, metabolic pathways, and operating 
conditions, with feedstocks tailored to Oman's organic waste profile, such as agricultural residues and food waste. A 
comprehensive techno-economic analysis evaluates the scalability and economic viability of the proposed system for

Abstract 
This study investigates the feasibility, environmental impact and financial implications of implementing shore-to-ship 
power (S2SP) systems in the container shipping industry. The study revolves around three main goals: looking at the 
advantages and disadvantages of S2SP, determining its environmental impact and investigating the possibility of 
retrofitting older vessels. Using cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and Comparative Analysis (CA), this analyses the 
financial and operational impacts of retrofitting existing vessels as compared to implementing S2SP on newly built 
vessels. The findings indicate considerable reductions in emissions, while identifying the high upfront costs and lack 
of availability of port infrastructure as a major challenge for implementation.

1. Introduction
The maritime industry is crucial to global trade, with 90% of all goods and commodities transported by sea (ICS, 
2024). Globally, 4.6 million port calls were recorded in 2022, with Norway leading in the number of port calls. The 
median time for cargo-carrying ships at Norwegian ports was 10 hours (UNCTAD, 2023). The expansive and vital 
network of marine transportation is highlighted by the hundreds of container lines that connect about 800 ports 
throughout the world (MoverDB, 2024). Many international organisations, including the International Maritime 
Organisation (IMO), Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), International Council on 
Clean Transportation (ICCT), United Nations (UN) have provided emission-reduction and scientific analysis 
guidelines for the maritime industry. 
The amount and type of bunker fuel used determines the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the vessel's main and 
auxiliary generators, which as seen in Figure 1. According to historical statistics obtained by the United Nations, 
shipping emissions are rising. Vessels consequently have a detrimental environmental impact on the surrounding 
natural ecosystem.

Fuel Cost  
The primary operational cost for AG is fuel. Although fuel and electrical prices vary across the EU and globally, this 
study references Jiven's 2004 analysis. To preserve consistency in LCCA, this study will stick to the 2004 cost 
structure for both fuel and electrical prices. The current MGO price in the Port of Rotterdam for 0.1% low-sulphur 
fuel is €662 per tonne as shown in Table 12 as of January 2025. This rise is likely due to inflation throughout the 
years. Examples of fuel usage and cost are displayed in Figure 7.

Abstract 
In a competitive market, footwear companies must continuously improve to remain relevant. This study focuses on a 
Peruvian SME specializing in leather shoe retail, which faces significant challenges in supply chain management, 
particularly in order fulfillment and inventory control. The main objective is to enhance the OTIF (On Time In Full) 
indicator by applying BPM and lean warehousing techniques. These methods aim to improve order delivery accuracy 
and reduce product defects, thereby strengthening customer trust and the company’s competitiveness. The study is 
structured into three sections: planning and diagnosis, solution design, and validation and sustainability. The first 
section analyzes the company’s performance and economic sector, identifying an 11.86% gap in the OTIF indicator 
compared to industry standards. Root causes of current issues were identified through quantitative analysis, 
highlighting the economic impact of these deficiencies. The second section designs a comprehensive solution, linking 
root causes to specific improvement tools. It includes a detailed implementation plan, budget, and a master 
experimentation plan to validate the proposed improvements. The final section evaluates the proposed solution’s 
functionality and ensures its long-term sustainability. Results include a 20% reduction in errors during order 
registration and a 1.63-hour decrease in raw material validation time. These improvements are expected to recover 
80% of lost sales, amounting to S/. 184,200. This research not only aims to significantly enhance the company’s OTIF 
but also provides a replicable model for other SMEs in the footwear sector facing similar logistical and inventory 
management challenges.

1. Introduction
In the current context, the footwear sector is led by Asia, represented mainly by the Chinese market, with a massive 
mainly by the Chinese market with a massive production of 13,478 million pairs for 2018 and a consumption of 4,110 
million pairs (Iván Cosavalente, 2019). In Latin America, the country at the top of the list is Brazil with a production 
of 800 million pairs by 2022 and a consumption of 717 million pairs by 2022 (SERMA, 2022). It is important to take 
into account the negative effect of the pandemic for these years. During the first half of the pandemic, a forecast was 
made estimating a reduction in global footwear consumption of 22.5% (World footwear, 2020). According to the 
Global Supply Chain Forum, 8 core processes have been identified as the central core of supply chain management. 
These processes include customer relationship management, customer service management, demand management, 
order fulfilment, manufacturing flow management, supplier relationship management, product development, 
marketing and returns management (Castro et al., 2009). At the business level, most small and medium-sized

The deficient control of the quality of raw material caused a supply problem, as due to the defective products that 
could not be sold, the necessary stock was not available in the shops. For this reason, a sampling plan was implemented 
as soon as the raw material was received at the entrance of the plant, which reduced the revision time of the raw 
material by 84 seconds / bale of leather, in addition to improving productivity by 37.8%, which was validated through 
an effort matrix. In the shop sales process, the average stock validation time was reduced by 1.94 minutes per order 
(48.83%) thanks to the implementation of lean-warehousing and warehouse policies. A detailed inventory input and 
output system was implemented in the shop in order to have a correct management of the inventory policy using 
Kardex, which decreased the average time of the sales process by 20% (8.49 min / order), thanks to which the average 
time of transferring the missing stock of orders was also decreased, which was reflected in a decrease of the average 
time of replenishment of orders without stock by 53.8% (11.8 hours / month). 
 
6. Discussion and Conclusions 
6.1. Discussion 
The present study focused on a small and medium-sized shoe manufacturing and trading company, which was facing 
challenges in its supply chain management, specifically in order fulfilment and inventory management. The main 
objective of the research was to increase the OTIF (On Time In Full) indicator through the application of Lean 
Warehousing methodologies and sampling plan techniques. The results showed an improvement in the accuracy of 
order delivery and a reduction of order defects and a reduction in product defects, which had a positive impact on the 
company's competitiveness. This can be reflected through a comparative analysis with studies such as Harland et al. 
(2019), which show significant improvements in supply management in manufacturing companies, confirms the 
effectiveness of our application of the methodologies and tools. Similarly, the implementation of Lean Warehousing 
in our study, aligned with research by Hester et al. (2017), shows an improvement in the OTIF indicator and customer 
satisfaction, as the average selling time decreased significantly by 20%. 
 
On the other hand, the study presented certain limitations reflected in the representativeness of the results, as it may 
be questionable due to the size or scale of the sample. In addition, direct observation of the operator would not 
complete the required information and accuracy. Nevertheless, the feasibility of implementing a sampling plan and 
the implementation of Lean Warehousing show positive results, such as the improvement of the sales process time, 
and an increase in the efficiency of raw material validation.

6.2. Conclusions 
The analysis and diagnosis of the OTIF indicator in the company was carried out, finding a technical gap of 11.86% 
with respect to the industry, resulting in a loss of S/. 230,200 for the company. Through a Pareto diagram, it was 
determined that the main reasons are related to problems in supply due to defective products, caused by problems in 
raw materials and problems in the dispatch of orders due to errors in inventory management. To address these 
problems, Lean Warehousing and BPM methodologies were implemented to reduce order entry errors in the sales 
process, reducing the sales process time by 20% (8.49 minutes on average). This improvement was validated by means 
of a simulation model in Arena software. In addition, improvements were made to the supply problem by 
implementing a sampling plan in the review of raw material quality, which increased productivity in the validation of 
raw materials by 37.8%. This improvement was also validated through an effort matrix and the average devalidation 
time of the raw material was reduced by 1.63 hours, validated through a simulation model in the Arena software. The 
losses of S/. 230,200 were mainly due to deficiencies in the quality validation of the PM and errors in inventory 
management. With the improvements implemented, a recovery of 80% of the lost sales, a total of S/. 184,200, is 
forecast.

Abstract 
Port congestion is a critical issue that poses significant operational, economic, and environmental challenges to port 
terminals across the world. This paper explores various consequences of port congestion through a comprehensive 
analysis of key performance indicators such as total port stay times, prolonged anchorage and operation durations. 
The study has utilized descriptive statistics and regression analysis with data collected from 1 September 2023 to 1 
September 2024, we then assess how these factors correlate with congestion levels in various international port 
terminals. Descriptive statistics revealed high variability in vessel timings, with extreme outliers, while regression 
analysis confirmed that all three factors show significance in impacting port operations. Prolonged congestions disrupt 
supply chain operation durations, delay cargo deliveries, and even escalate operational costs for shipping companies 
which ultimately impacts the competitiveness of ports on a global scale. By identifying the critical factors contributing 
to port congestion and their implications, this research underscores the urgent need for strategic interventions. Future 
work will focus on vessel stay times at the Port of Singapore to uncover unique operational challenges and trends, 
while comparing vessel stay time patterns with broader trends identified in this study. Additionally, the outcomes of 
this study not only aim to assist Singapore in mitigating its port congestion issues, but also to strive to provide valuable 
insights for other major ports aspiring to enhance their global competitiveness and ensure reliable supply chain 
operations.

Regression analysis 
R square has a value of 0.021747 which means 2.17% of the variation in anchorage time (dependent variable, X) is 
explained by the date (independent variable, Y). Next, significance F has a value of 0.0046. this indicates a relatively 
low p-value, proving that the regression model is statistically significant. For each unit increase, the anchorage time 
increases by 0.0035 hours which can be translated to about 12.6 seconds. It can be accumulated overtime causing a 
very slight upward trend in anchorage time, if operational inefficiencies persist (Figure 9).

Regression analysis 
R square has a value of 0.13 which means 13% of the variation in operation time (dependent variable, X) is explained 
by the date (independent variable, Y). Next, significance F has a value of 5.52E-13 which is smaller than 0.05, shows 
that it is statistically significant. For each unit increase in date, the operation time increases by 0.0147 hours which is 
about 52.92 seconds. If operation time increases overtime, this may disrupt overall port efficiency such as delays in 
unloading and loading operations.  
 
6. Conclusion and Future Work 
This research has examined various factors contributing to port congestion, particularly focusing on vessel stay times 
at port terminals. The analysis revealed that the increase in total port stay time for container vessels is predominately 
driven by extended operation times, while the impact of anchorage times appears to be relatively minor. This 
observation indicated that congestion is primarily linked to the concentration of cargo operations at specific port 
terminals, leading to bottlenecks that causes a negative impact on handling efficiency. Moreover, the slight increase 
in anchorage time suggests that major container ports are prioritising berthing for large container vessels operating on 
key east-west trade routes, thereby facilitating efficient berthing for these vessels despite the presence of other 
operational inefficiencies.  
 
Future research will concentrate specifically on vessel stay times at the Port of Singapore to unveil unique operational 
challenges and trends within this context. A key objective will be to compare Singapore vessel stay time patterns with 
the general trends identified in this study, particularly on the dominance of operation time over anchorage time. 
Furthermore, the study will seek to identify causes of port congestions in Singapore, including infrastructure 
constraints, scheduling inefficiencies, and other external disruption such as geopolitical tensions. By addressing these 
findings, targeted strategies will be developed to alleviate congestion. These initiatives will not only assist Singapore 
in tackling its port congestion issues but also offer valuable insights for other major ports striving to enhance their 
global competitiveness and ensuring supply chain reliability.

Abstract 
The global demand for high-quality sheep meat and goat meat has driven innovations in breeding strategies to 
enhance productivity and profitability. Back-crossing, a selective breeding technique, has emerged as a promising 
approach to gaining desirable traits while maintaining genetic integrity. This study investigates the application of 
mathematical models to understand back-crossing strategies in goat breeding, focusing on maximizing meat yield 
and quality of goat meat. Using a combination of deterministic modeling and macro genetics principles, we 
developed a framework to predict the inheritance patterns of the overall key traits. Preliminary results demonstrate 
that a mathematical model can significantly enhance the understanding of outcomes of back-crossing programs. For 
instance, simulations suggest that strategic selection of back-crossing parental lines is needed to accelerate the 
introgression of target traits, compared to conventional inter-filial breeding methods. Furthermore, the inclusion of 
economic factors ensures the feasibility of these improvements for commercial application. This study highlights the 
potential of mathematical tools to revolutionize goat breeding practices, offering a scientific basis for decision-
making in agricultural systems. The findings provide actionable insights for breeders and policymakers, paving the 
way for sustainable and efficient meat production.

6. Conclusion 
The present study investigated the application of a mathematical model to understand back-crossing strategies in 
goat breeding, focusing on maximizing meat yield and quality of goat meat, through the implementation of back-
crossing. Using a combination of deterministic modeling and macro genetics principles, we developed a framework 
to predict the inheritance patterns of the overall key traits. We obtained a mathematical model capable of computing 
the Boer degree of a filial in a back-crossing. The model can predict the properties of the Boer degree of any filial in 
a consecutive back-crossing. For instance, the analytical formula and simulations suggest that strategic selection of 
back-crossing parental lines is needed to accelerate the introgression of target traits, compared to conventional inter-
filial breeding methods. In addition, it can also determine the filial generation for a required Boer degree and a 
certain level of Boer degree improvement of the filial. The back-crossing can be terminated to a certain generation 
of filial with sufficiently high predetermined Boer degree, e.g., up to F5, since further filial will not give a 
significant improvement. Moreover, the inclusion of economic factors ensures the feasibility of these improvements 
for commercial application.  
 
The results above are obtained by combining analytical and numerical methods. Overall, the paper demonstrated that 
a mathematical model can significantly enhance the understanding of back-crossing programs. Finally, this study 
highlights the potential of mathematical tools to revolutionize goat breeding practices, offering a scientific basis for 
decision-making in agricultural systems. The findings provide actionable insights for breeders and policymakers, 
paving the way for sustainable and efficient meat production.

Abstract 
Discrete Event Simulation (DES) remains a foundational tool in operations management for manufacturing, providing 
stakeholders with the ability to simulate production processes, evaluate system performance, and test various scenarios 
effectively. However, traditional DES tools face notable limitations, such as labor-intensive model building and time-
consuming iterative optimization processes. This paper proposes an AI-assisted intelligent DES platform that 
integrates AI agents to address these challenges. By automating data collection, preprocessing, and simulation model 
construction, as well as analyzing and optimizing simulation results, the platform transforms conventional simulation 
workflows. A case study using Simio demonstrates generative AI’s ability to automate object creation in the simulation 
environment and analyze simulation results to provide actionable insights. The findings highlight both the potential 
and limitations of AI-enhanced simulation, paving the way for future advancements in an intelligent DES platform for 
manufacturing systems.

1. Introduction
Discrete Event Simulation (DES) has long been a cornerstone of operations management in the manufacturing industry 
(Chance et al. 1996; Joseph and Sridharan 2013), enabling stakeholders to model production processes, assess system 
performance, and experiment with various scenarios. By providing a virtual testbed for evaluating manufacturing 
strategies, DES supports informed decision-making, reduces costly production errors, enhances operational efficiency, 
and minimizes overall costs. Additionally, DES mitigates risks by assessing potential disruptions, such as equipment 
failures or supply chain interruptions, and fosters collaboration among production managers, engineers, and other 
stakeholders through its visual and interactive models, making it integral to achieving operational excellence in 
manufacturing environments. Despite its proven utility, traditional DES tools face notable limitations. Model building 
in DES is a labor-intensive process, requiring extensive data preprocessing and significant knowledge and experience 
to develop accurate models. Furthermore, optimization within DES involves iterative processes that can be both 
complex and time-consuming. The advent of Industry 4.0 further intensifies these challenges while simultaneously 
unlocking new possibilities. By leveraging advanced technologies such as digital twins, IoT, real-time data integration, 
and data-driven approaches, DES can better model and optimize complex manufacturing systems in Industry 4.0 
(Santos et al. 2020; Ferreira et al. 2020; Bousdekis et al. 2021).  
The emergence of AI agents, as recently detailed in Google’s white paper on the topic, offers transformative 
possibilities for simulation in the manufacturing industry (Wiesinger et al. 2024). Generative AI agents are 
autonomous applications designed to achieve goals by observing their environment, reasoning, and taking actions 
using integrated tools. These agents extend the capabilities of traditional systems by enabling real-time data interaction,

moderate level of domain knowledge in simulation modeling principles, as well as familiarity with the specific system 
being modeled.  
 
For the task of auto-generating objects in the simulation environment, the AI agent successfully identified all the 
components but faced challenges in counting them accurately. For example, there were only three doors in the floor 
layout, but the AI agent miscounted and reported four doors in three out of five trials. While the output was similar 
across different conversations with the AI agent, inconsistencies in counting were observed. Additionally, the AI agent 
struggled to position the components accurately within the simulation environment, requiring manual adjustments to 
ensure proper placement. These limitations highlight areas for future improvement. Furthermore, automating the path 
connection process, which is currently performed manually, represents another avenue for advancing the platform’s 
functionality. 
 
In the task of auto-analyzing model results, the AI agent successfully extracted key metrics, identified system issues, 
and provided actionable recommendations for improvement. This capability demonstrates the potential for AI to play 
a significant role in simulation result interpretation and decision-making. As a future development, the functionality 
related to the design of experiments could be explored and tested, further expanding the platform’s analytical 
capabilities.

6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, this proposed AI-assisted intelligent DES platform underscores the transformative role of AI in DES, 
paving the way for more adaptive, efficient, and intelligent manufacturing operations. It demonstrates significant 
advancements in automating and optimizing simulation workflows for manufacturing systems. By integrating AI 
agents, the platform reduces manual effort in data preprocessing, model building, and results analysis. The case study

highlights its capability to identify system inefficiencies, provide actionable insights, and support informed decision-
making. However, the study also reveals areas requiring improvement, such as enhancing the accuracy of automated 
object creation and refining the positioning of components within simulation environments. Addressing these 
challenges will further streamline the simulation process and improve reliability. Moreover, the potential for 
automating path connections and incorporating advanced experiment design capabilities presents opportunities for 
future development. Last but not least, the AI agents’ potential for more autonomous decision-making and leveraging 
Retrieval-Augmented Generation methodologies requires further research and development. As Industry 5.0 
technologies continue to evolve, the integration of AI in DES will remain critical for addressing the complexities of 
modern manufacturing systems.

Abstract 
The design tackles the pressing problem of air pollution in Jakarta, which possesses one of the poorest air quality 
indexes worldwide, predominantly attributed to vehicular emissions. This novel method incorporates carbon capture 
technology at bus stops—strategic sites significantly subjected to pollution. The system EnviroWind, utilizes a hybrid 
electrostatic filter system (HEFS) that integrates an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) with a fiber filter, improving 
filtration efficiency while reducing pressure drops. The HEFS gathers particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), volatile 
organic compounds (VOCs), and additional detrimental contaminants. This will significantly improve air quality in 
densely populated urban areas. EnviroWind utilizes renewable energy sources, like solar panels and wind turbines, to 
purify air and enhance sustainable urban infrastructure. The initiative seeks to diminish dangerous pollutants by up to 
80%, thus enhancing public health and decreasing the prevalence of respiratory ailments, cardiovascular conditions, 
and other health difficulties associated with pollution among the populace. The bus stops feature a multipurpose design 
that incorporates charging facilities for electric automobiles and bicycle racks, encouraging environmentally 
sustainable transportation alternatives. The expected impact beyond health advantages; it promotes community 
involvement and knowledge of air quality concerns, motivating citizens to embrace sustainable behaviors. This project 
delineates the design, operation, and anticipated effects of the EnviroWind system, highlighting its significance in 
cultivating healthier urban environments and advancing sustainable practices in urban infrastructure.

1. Introduction
Jakarta, as the capital of Indonesia, is facing an increasingly alarming air pollution crisis. The city often ranks as one 
of the areas with the worst air quality index in the world (Santoso et al., 2020). Data from various air quality monitors 
indicate that pollutant levels in Jakarta consistently exceed the safe limits set by the World Health Organization 
(WHO), particularly for PM 2.5, which is still far from the WHO's recommended daily exposure of 15 μg/m³ (Aulia, 
2024)(Fatimah Dinan Qonitan1* et al., 2023). This issue not only impacts the environment but also poses serious 
health risks to millions of its residents.

operational costs. Overall, the successful implementation of carbon capture technology in public spaces not only aims 
to improve air quality but also promotes healthier urban living and supports the city’s long-term environmental goals.

Abstract 
Technological advancements enable the use of intelligent systems in various fields such as operations, management, 
as well as in agriculture. In the field of agriculture, smart systems create a positive impact on fruit classification, 
specifically for export needs. Even with its wide application, there have been limited studies on its utilization in 
coconut exportation. Another challenge identified is that gathering a large amount of dataset has become difficult, 
expensive, time-consuming, and prone to errors due to human inconsistencies. Due to this majority of the initial 
datasets in existing studies are unbalanced and sometimes, inadequate to contribute significant analysis and results. In 
this study, an investigation is conducted using an existing dataset of coconut acoustic signals to generate more data to 
balance out the samples across the three maturity levels. Data and data augmentation techniques are utilized along 
with combining techniques for acoustic signals, feature extraction, and data clustering. The data points under three 
maturity levels were clustered appropriately using the summing method and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient 
feature. All data synthesizers failed to generate quality synthetic data. However, both audiomentation and procedural 
audio generation were able to produce quality augmented data after validating using linear layers, 1-dimensional 
convolution, and long-short term memory model as the audio classification technique. The new dataset was then fed 
to the same models and the results yielded to significant increase in its classification performance for all models. The 
study can be further improved by incorporating other coconut features to increase performance and widen its 
application.

1. Introduction
The majority of the global coconut supply comes from tropical countries where coconut trees normally thrive. The 
three largest coconut-producing countries—Indonesia, the Philippines, and India—contributed 78% of the global 
coconut production and the remaining 12% were from the rest of the coconut-producing countries (Burns, et al., 2020). 
In the Philippines, coconut is one of the greatest contributors to general economic activity for agricultural land and 
labor (Moreno, et al., 2020). It is also considered a predictor of general economic activity due to the performance of 
coconut as the major source of income in the country (Moreno, et al., 2020). The country has average earnings of 91.4 
billion PHP (1.7 billion USD) and an annual coconut production of 14.7 metric tons in nut terms from 2014 to 2019 
(Philippine Coconut Authority, 2018). About 25% to 33% of the country’s population is dependent on the coconut 
industry for their livelihood (Pascua, 2017). 
For commercial purposes, the coconuts vary in the classification of the fruit’s maturity level (Mahayothee, et al., 2016; 
Javel, et al., 2018; Terdwongworakul, et al., 2009). It is the prime determinant of the fruit’s maximum economic value 
and consumption (Chen, et al., 2021). Most commonly, they are classified into three levels, i.e., premature, mature, 
and overmature (Burns, et al., 2020; Terdwongworakul, et al., 2009; Gatchalian & De Leon, 1994; Mahayothee, et al.,

Abstract 
As the drug supply chain becomes more complex and the demand for efficiency and sustainability increases, 
there is a growing need for innovative approaches in supply chain management. These challenges were required to be 
dealt with efficiently, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is definitely a booming technology to meet these challenges 
through capabilities such as real-time tracking of new drivers, risk management, and notional operational optimization. 
Using Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method this research synthesizes the content of multiple articles published 
from 2003 to 2025,with a total of 542 articles and 329 articles. It has a particular focus on AI in Sustainable Supply 
Chain, discussing factors like predictive analytics, automation, and optimization. Analysis was conducted via a 
bibliometrics tool (biblioshiny) to uncover the data pertinent literature and trends, assuring all necessary data were 
included. Results revealed that AI led to a 25% decrease in inventory errors and a growth in forecast accuracy of 
40%, resulting in reduced carbon footprints through improved logistics. Moreover, AI-based models showed their 
ability to overcome fragmented data integration and minimize the risk of drug shortages. These results are highly 
advantageous for the pharmaceuticals, offering cost savings, faster drug development times, and a stronger focus on 
sustainability. Also, this study lay a foundation toward knowledge creation on AI use in supply chains and a theoretical 
stimulating base for future investigations to develop sustainable, integrated, and resilient supply chain systems.

1. Introduction
As one of the practical applications in which AI has already taken centre stage in global health management, the 
transformation of the pharmaceutical supply chain is an indispensable consideration to ensure that the human race 
can have safe, efficient and timely access to drugs (Hezam et al. 2024)(Vora et al. 2023). The supply chain of these 
products is complicated, where developing an Improvement for the Optimization of Real-Time Pharmaceutical Supply 
Chain Tracking, Efficiency, and Management covers the subject. AI has become a revolutionary technology that is 
able to help solve problems in the pharmaceutical supply chain, including operational efficiency, risk managementand 
cost optimization (Zwaida, Pham, and Beauregard 2021). 
Innovations and challenges related to the pharmaceutical supply chain have been identified in various studies. A 
multi-period optimization model based on fuzzy programming is one interesting innovation that is used to manage the 
three major aspects, time, quality, and cost (Sugapriya et al. 2023). This method has consistently demonstrated its 
effectiveness in aligning with the timing standards and quality efficiency of pharmaceutical products. Moreover, deep 
processing of biological data using AI in drug design and delivery to speed up drug discovery also aims at reducing 
the cost of drug development. For example, in the area of inventory management, reinforcement learning models like 
deep reinforcement learning have shown such ability by optimizing automatic inventory replenishment and reducing 
the risk of drug shortages (Liu et al. 2017).

6. Improved Product Safety and Quality 
The model includes an AI-based verification system by which the company tests its products to ensure that 
they are safe and genuine before it reaches to the customer. Such a system can eliminate counterfeit 
product distribution by 99% as per trials leading to a great benefit in product safety for customers. 
Validation Conclusion 
The results obtained with the AI-based SSCM model can be directly translated into the benefits to customers in terms 
of: drug availability, reduced delivery time, having transparent tracking information, and guaranteed product safety. 
This also aligns with the needs of customers who are more sustainability-conscious and thrice-above of the impact on 
environmental sustainability that directly comes from this. Validation that leveraging AI in the pharmaceutical 
supply chain creates operational efficiencies and ultimately has positive influences on sustainability and customer 
experience. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study is the first to demonstrate how AI can facilitate pharmaceutical supply chain sustainability. This research 
uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) method to navigate the literature and aggregate findings to further extend 
knowledge on the ways of exploiting various types of AI solutions in solving complex operational issues, for example 
in real-time product tracing, risk management, or efficient distribution optimization. The findings validate that AI 
serves not only as an enabling technology but also as a transformation driver in developing an adaptive and sustainable 
pharmaceutical supply chain. 
 
However, there are some limitations that undermine the generalizability of these findings. First, much of the literature 
included in the analysis is limited by its applicability to a specific case study, and oftentimes does not take a more 
holistic approach to the entire pharmaceutical supply chain ecosystem. Secondly, this work reported no simulation or 
empirical validation, which could provide such quantitative evidence of success of AI-based models in real 
implementation environments. Third, with entities across the supply chain having disparate systems that report 
different metrics, integrating data is a significant challenge that calls for more holistic technological and policy 
response. 
 
The pharmaceutical industry is greatly impacted. This study illustrates how AI can reduce dependency on manual 
processes, enhance accuracy in predicting drug requirements, and noticeably lower operation expenses. Furthermore, 
AI-based solutions that optimize resource management will not only serve their businesses in operating efficiently, 
but also reinforce the industry’s commitment to sustainable approaches. This includes reducing carbon footprint as a 
result of better logistics and waste management. 
 
On the academic front, this study provides a new theoretical construct combining AI technology in the context of 
supply chains around sustainable business practices. This framework leads to other research where more accurate 
prediction models, deep learning algorithms, and more broad-risk mitigation strategies can be developed. Hence, this 
study not only expands on the existing academic literature, it can guide broader areas of practical implementation 
within the pharma sector and beyond that accounts sustainability.

Abstract 
Termite attacks result in substantial economic and environmental losses annually. Current prediction methods are both 
labor-intensive and costly. To address this issue, the study presents ""anAI,"" a mobile application that employs deep 
learning and machine learning models to forecast termite infestations, identify wood types, and assess the likelihood 
of attacks using environmental data. The research utilized three deep learning models—MobileNetV2, AlexNet, and 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)—for image classification, with CNN achieving the highest accuracy rates. 
Additionally, machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Support Vector Machines 
(SVM) were employed to predict termite attack likelihood, with SVM proving superior. Logistic regression classified 
likelihood into three levels: certain, likely, and unlikely. The study collected 181 wood samples, augmenting them to 
506 images, and achieved satisfactory accuracies for termite infestation and wood type identification. ""anAI"" delivers 
real-time predictions, facilitating proactive termite management by utilizing environmental parameters like 
temperature, humidity, and wood moisture. This research underscores the importance of integrating advanced 
intelligent systems into pest management, enabling early detection and mitigation of termite infestations, thereby 
minimizing property damage, and supporting sustainable practices.

1. Introduction
Termites (Isoptera) play a huge role in the ecosystem as they help break down and decompose dying trees and plants 
which in turn improve soil pH, organic carbon content, water content, and porosity of the land (Ghaly & Edwards, 
2011). However, when termites start to consume the wood in households, buildings, and residential homes, they are a 
harmful pest (Ahmad, et al., 2019). According to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an estimated $5

5.4. Testing and validation of the proposed prototype 
The testing and validation of the mobile application involved conducting 100 tests to compare the results of the anAI 
prototype mobile application with manual identification by wood and termite experts. Moreover, the Manual testing 
was conducted for all three outputs of the mobile application. The first output, which is the classification of the termite 
infestations, was carried out by observing existing conditions and checking for any signs of termite infestation on the 
wood such as the presence of mud tunnels and tubes. The second output, which is the prediction of the type of wood 
by examining the wood characteristics such as wood pattern, grain (especially the end and edge grain), texture, color, 
weight, hardness, and the presence of burl knots, with the assistance of a wood expert. Lastly, the manual prediction 
associated with the third output considers the threshold of environmental conditions to identify the likelihood of 
termite infestation with the termite experts.

According to the results in Table 7, the application demonstrated robust performance, achieving an accuracy of 86% 
in correctly distinguishing infested from non-infested wood. Additionally, it exhibited a 78% accuracy in accurately 
predicting wood types and an 89% accuracy in forecasting the likelihood of termite attacks. Factors that led to 
misclassifications of the different predictions include the lighting conditions during the capturing of the image, the 
quality of the camera, the distance and angle while capturing the image, and variations in paint color applied to the 
wood. Table 6 shows the results of the validation. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The result of the study led the researchers to successfully developed a Multimodal Prototype Mobile Application using 
the frameworks Al model CNN and SVM in predicting the three outputs: classification of termite infestation in wood 
samples, multi classification of wood types, and the prediction of the likelihood of termite attacks in the household

setting. The three outputs using CNN and SVM evaluation results demonstrated a condescending performance 
compared to other models, namely: MobilenetV2, AlexNet, and ANN. The CNN and SVM evaluation results 
demonstrated superior performance compared to other AI models such as MobilenetV2, AlexNet, and ANN. 
Furthermore, the prediction capability of the Multimodal Prototype Mobile Application in the likelihood of termite 
attacks in households closely aligns to the Optimal Foraging Theory. This theory suggests that the foraging of termite 
and its attacking behavior is influenced by wood availability, nest location, and environmental conditions such as 
temperature, moisture, and humidity (Cornelius, 2010). The Multimodal Prototype Mobile Application is remarkably 
the first for detecting termite infestation in the Philippines with the application of deep learning and machine learning 
techniques. It also demonstrated a practical application of deep learning and machine learning algorithms in predicting 
the likelihood of termite attacks within the household setting, facilitated by working on an intuitive and simple 
interface that can be run on an Android Mobile phone.

Abstract 
Startups are vital for economic growth in Indonesia's technology ecosystem. Open innovation is crucial for them to 
leverage shared resources and validate product-market fit. Governance of technological innovation is necessary to 
support national capacity. This study assessed an early startup's capability to adopt open innovation and strategies to 
enhance innovation capabilities. An instrument was developed to evaluate the startup’s readiness for open innovation. 
Metrics for measuring openness and the impact on technological capabilities were examined. The questionnaire's 
assessment variables were established and categorized into technological components: technoware, humanware, 
inforware, and orgaware (T, H, I, O). A survey was conducted on the data was analyzed to determine the company's 
technological capability using the Technology Contribution Coefficient (TCC) metric to assess its ability to adopt 
open innovation. We found that the company has the capability to implement open innovation, but improving low-
rated subcriteria, especially orgaware, is necessary for better technological capability and reaping the full benefits of 
open innovation. To improve financial sustainability, partnerships with external institutions for quality resources and 
collaborating with suppliers, customers, research institutions, or startups can reduce costs and open new market 
opportunities.

In terms of partnership, the company demonstrated a willingness to engage in external collaboration and cooperation 
opportunities. At the time, the company had established three collaboration partnerships, each with a unique 
innovation project. These joint projects primarily focused on corporate social responsibility (CSR), technology 
development, and events. Despite this openness to partnership and collaboration opportunities, the company remained 
dominant in project work and dedicated more resources to external company innovation. However, the company had 
yet to involve other firms in the research and development for its internal creation, nor had it contracted consultants 
for technology scouting. Additionally, the company had overlooked the prospect of establishing research contracts 
with universities or other research centers to assist R&D activities within the company.  
 
From a market perspective, the organization has taken steps towards commercializing its products, achieving a 
Technology Readiness Level of 8 without an official product launch. As a result, the product has not yet gained 
widespread recognition nor seen significant usage, and its success as a new product remains uncertain. Furthermore, 
the company's business success cannot be definitively assessed as it has only recently completed the research phase 
in its early years. 
 
5.6 Proposed Improvements  
The company is currently facing financial constraints, leading to a scarcity of resources, including labor, materials, 
and equipment. To overcome this, the company should maximize its partnership capability by forming alliances with 
firms and external institutions to acquire high-quality raw materials and equipment used as input for the company’s 
innovation product. In addition, collaboration with more external partners, such as research institutions, customers, 
startups, or suppliers, can facilitate cost-sharing, risk-sharing, and resource-sharing, enabling the company to 
undertake ambitious projects or explore new market opportunities that may have been too challenging to pursue alone. 
Therefore, by opening new market opportunities, it has the potential to accelerate product commercialization. 
 
Furthermore, to improve the financial sustainability, the company is encouraged to maximize its absorptive capacity 
to effectively utilize external knowledge to enhance its performance. Integrating internal and external capacity is 
essential to adapt to changing environments quickly. The direct involvement of other potential partners, such as 
universities, research institutions, or customers, may help the company to overcome market failures and acquire 
specialized knowledge for innovation endeavors. 
 
Incorporating open innovation into a company's innovation process involves actively seeking customer feedback and 
ideas. This approach creates products and services catering to their specific needs, increasing customer satisfaction 
and loyalty. By gathering diverse perspectives and market insights, the company would be better equipped to develop 
products that truly resonate with its target market. Engaging customers in the innovation process would ultimately 
lead to improved outcomes and tremendous success for the company. 
 
6. Conclusion  
We conducted a case study in an early startup to assess the capability of an organization to adopt open innovation. An 
instrument was developed, and we analyzed the capabilities of the company based on four components: technoware, 
humanware, inforware, and orgaware (T, H, I, O). Areas for improvement were identified and we found that the 
company has the capability to implement open innovation, but improving low-rated subcriteria, especially orgaware, 
is necessary for better technological capability and reaping the full benefits of open innovation. 
 
Further research can be conducted to explore the specific benefits and challenges of open innovation for companies 
facing financial constraints. Case studies can be conducted to examine successful partnerships and collaborations in 
various industries and their impact on product commercialization and financial sustainability. Additionally, surveys 
and interviews can be conducted to gather insights from customers and external partners on their experiences with 
open innovation and its impact on their relationship with the company. This research can provide valuable insights for 
companies looking to implement open innovation strategies to overcome financial constraints and enhance their 
innovation processes. 
 
This paper can serve as a valuable addition to the existing literature on open innovation, and potentially contribute to 
the advancement of sustainable development goals. Open innovation with technology capabilities can contribute to 
industry, innovation, and infrastructure (SDG 9), which seeks to build resilient infrastructure, promote sustainable 
industrialization, and foster innovation. The process of industrialization lays the groundwork for the necessary

physical systems and structures to function in a society or startup. It also helps to reduce economic poverty by creating 
job opportunities. Innovation plays a significant role in advancing the technological capabilities of industrial sectors 
and encourages the development of new skills. The main contributor to income generation and the enhancement of 
living standards for everyone is inclusive and sustainable industrial development. Additionally, it offers the necessary 
technological solutions for eco-friendly industrialization.

Abstract 
As global environmental issues intensify, enterprises face increasing pressure to pursue sustainable development. 
China’s manufacturing industry plays a critical role by significantly contributing to GDP, job creation, and export 
volumes globally. However, its rapid expansion, fueled by intensive resource consumption, has caused environmental 
degradation and increasing emissions. Consequently, China risks lagging behind other industrialized nations unless 
strides are made toward sustainable development. This study, grounded in the context of China’s manufacturing 
industry, develops a conceptual framework to examine the influence of Proactive Environmental Strategy (PES) and 
Environmental Collaboration (EC) on sustainability performance. PES refers to proactive environmental initiatives 
undertaken by enterprises to surpass basic regulatory requirements, aiming to enhance resource efficiency and 
minimize environmental impacts. EC focuses on collaborative efforts between enterprises and their upstream and 
downstream supply chain partners to jointly advance environmental management practices. The proposed framework 
highlights the mediating role of environmental collaboration in proactive environmental strategies to enhance 
corporate sustainable performance. It specifically addresses how to achieve three dimensions of sustainability 
performance, including environmental, economic and social aspects. This study will use quantitative methods with 
data collection through surveys distributed to manufacturing companies in Shaanxi province of China. Structural 
equation modeling will be employed to find out the relationship between variables. The contribution of this study lies 
in offering theoretical foundations and practical guidance for China’s manufacturing sector in adopting sustainable 
strategies. By identifying critical driving factors and mediating variables, it provides enterprises with pathways to 
achieve green transformation in complex environments. Furthermore, this framework offers a solid basis for future 
research and provides policymakers with actionable insights to bridge micro-level practices with macro-level 
sustainability goals.

Abstract 
Establishing an efficient transportation infrastructure is part of urban development and could benefit multiple aspects 
of modern life. However, with the rise in the population, traffic congestion has become apparent and transportation 
systems urgently need to be improved. This study investigates several challenges that hindered the implementation of 
the bus rapid transit system implementation in the perspective of a developing country. Expert opinions were gathered 
using the Delphi method to identify the challenges, while decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory 
(DEMATEL) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods were used to analyze the interconnectedness of these 
challenges and prioritize them in terms of the urgency to mitigate them. A total of 18 challenges were listed covering 
internal and external factors. The results show that approval during planning, communication barriers between 
consultants and contractors, and political will of the government officials significantly influence other challenges. 
Moreover, approval during planning, complexity of implementation, complaints of the affected establishments, 
coordination between different agencies, and impact on public utility jeepney (PUJ) drivers are the challenges ranked 
highest in terms of prioritization. These findings will aid the stakeholders in managing the challenges and provide 
insights and guidelines for developing strategies to overcome them.

1. Introduction
Building an efficient transportation infrastructure is one of the most important issues in modern urban development 
(Kumari & Kumar Sharma, 2017; Arbués, et al., 2015; Ling, et al., 2024). This is because mobility is crucial for many 
aspects of modern life, including going to school and commuting to work. However, transport systems continue to 
experience congestion as the population increases. Kenyon and Lyons (2003) stated that governments are pushing for 
a modal shift approach to relieve this congestion and persuade individuals to transition from primarily using private 
vehicles to using public transportation options. The result of increased urbanization has contributed to several growing 
issues in the transportation system (Yannis & Chaziris, 2022; Pradhan, et al., 2021; Poumanyvong, et al., 2012). 
In the Philippines, it is reported that the current status of transportation systems needs modernization due to a lack of 
development and adequate support for development (Samson, 2023).  The nation also experienced a significant 
economic setback of 2.4 billion PHP (USD 41.5 million) caused by traffic congestion as reported by the Japan 
International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in 2014 (Philippine Institute for Development Studies, 2024). Accessibility 
issues, especially for persons with disabilities, further compound the problems faced by the transportation system in

Abstract 
3D printing of clay is a new additive manufacturing (AM) technique that has emerged as a technology for 
manufacturing shapes with complex geometries like Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) polymer 3D printing. The 
goal of this study is to evaluate the flowability and buildability of ceramic clay that is continuously extruded by varying 
printing speed, nozzle diameter and layer height to determine how the process parameters affect the quality of the 
ceramic clay layering and printing. The fundamental component of this research effort is Sayong clay which can only 
be found in Kuala Kangsar, Malaysia. The results showed that Sayong clay has been successfully 3D printed, which 
has its characteristics with optimized parameters. A density test was performed, and the results reveal that density 
decreases as the water content rises. As the diameter of the nozzle decreases, the diameter of the wall extruded from 
the nozzle decreases as well. Thus, the wall diameter will expand less after printing and the precision of the printing 
will be more accurate to the actual model. The layer height test shows that the thinner the layer height, the finer the 
quality of print which leads to lower yield of defects and fractures to the products.

1. Introduction
Additive manufacturing (AM) converts stereolithography (STL) files derived from computer-aided design (CAD) 
models into layered instructions for fabrication (Wong & Hernandez, 2012). This process involves approximating 
CAD models with triangular meshes and slicing them into layers, each containing specific data for the final object. 
Fused deposition modelling (FDM), a widely utilized AM technique, fabricates objects by sequentially depositing 
layers of melted thermoplastic filament. The mechanical properties of FDM-produced components are influenced by 
variables such as material composition, extrusion temperature, printing parameters, and environmental conditions. 
Extrusion-based ceramic 3D printing broadens the applications of AM by enabling the production of ceramic 
components.  
This technique begins with ceramic clay loaded into a pressurized storage silo, transferred to the nozzle via a tube, 
and extruded using a screw mechanism driven by a stepper motor. The extruded clay filaments are deposited layer by 
layer according to CAD instructions, and the final ceramic structure is obtained through drying and sintering. To 
ensure effective ceramic 3D printing, continuous material delivery to the nozzle, precise filament diameter regulation, 
and accurate control of deposition trajectories are essential for layer consistency. Additionally, maintaining substrate 
temperature is critical for optimizing clay deposition and solidification processes. Real-time monitoring of extrusion 
and deposition allows for parameter adjustments, enhancing accuracy and overall print quality. These capabilities 
make ceramic 3D printing a precise and innovative approach to manufacturing complex ceramic structures. 
Ceramic 3D printing technology faces significant challenges, including issues related to fractures, distortion, 
suboptimal mechanical properties, low yield, and limited accuracy of the manufactured components. The forming 
techniques utilized in clay-based 3D printing vary depending on material properties, environmental conditions, and

the sample collected at Point 4 is approximately up to 68% greater than the true measurement which is equivalent to 
7.73mm. 
 
 
 
Figure 10. Error against Layer Height Graph at Point 5 
 
Figure 10. illustrates the deviation between the three sizes of nozzles for a given layer height. The shown figure is the 
mean percentage error across nine samples. It demonstrates that the smallest nozzle size, 1.25mm, has the lowest error 
width offset at Point 5, ranging from 0.83% to 7.08%, which is comparable to 0.07 millimetres to 0.57 millimetres of 
expansion from the real model of 8 millimetres. For both 1.75mm and 2.15mm nozzles, the error value is substantial. 
This is since a bigger nozzle size results in a greater volume of clay extrusion during the printing process, which 
impacts the total width of the sample. 
 
5. Conclusion and Future Research 
This study aimed to evaluate and analyse the physical and material requirements for clay 3D printing, achieving its 
objectives as outlined in Chapter 1. The first goal focused on assessing flowability by analysing density, printing 
speed, and clay mixtures, along with the buildability of continuous extrusion of ceramic clay. The second goal 
involved examining the impact of process parameters on layering quality and faults in printed products by evaluating 
nozzle diameter and layer height. Finally, the third goal was achieved by printing simple forms to test specific 
geometric characteristics. The study used Sayong clay, a locally available material in Malaysia, due to its accessibility 
and cost-effectiveness. Mixture A, with the least water content, yielded the best results, as higher water concentrations 
reduced clay density. The optimal printing speed was determined to be 30 mm/s for steady extrusion and intact 
samples. Nozzle diameter tests revealed smaller diameters reduced wall expansion, and a ratio of 1:3 for layer height 
to nozzle diameter provided smooth, defect-free prints. The findings demonstrate that the material and physical 
properties examined using the Tronxy Moore 1 clay 3D printer are suitable for clay-based additive manufacturing. 
Sayong clay shows significant potential for industrial use. Future research should investigate Sayong clay’s 
vitrification, porosity, and hardness at varying temperatures, develop new clay formulas for broader regional 
applications, and establish advanced sintering and glazing parameters. These efforts will further enhance the 
capabilities and industrial viability of clay 3D printing.

Abstract 
Sustainable supply chain management for perishable products is a complex issue requiring balance between economic 
performance, environmental impact, and social responsibility. This study conducts a systematic literature review of 
multi-objective optimization methods used in designing sustainable supply chains for perishable products. The main 
objective is to identify and analyze various optimization methods such as Lexicographic Goal Programming (LGP), 
Multi-Choice Goal Programming (MCGP), Weighted Goal Programming (WGP), and Augmented ε-constraint (AEC) 
in the context of perishable product supply chains. Using the PRISMA method, 146 references were identified from 
Scopus and Google Scholar databases, which were then filtered down to 11 final articles for in-depth analysis. The 
results show that each method has distinct characteristics and advantages - LGP is effective for hierarchical 
optimization with clear priorities, MCGP provides flexibility in target selection, WGP enables balanced optimization 
through weighting, while AEC produces more robust solutions for complex problems. These findings provide valuable 
insights for practitioners and researchers in selecting appropriate optimization methods for designing sustainable 
supply chains for perishable products. This study also identifies knowledge gaps and future research opportunities in 
sustainable supply chain optimization.

4. Conclusion 
This literature review highlights the growing importance of multi-objective optimization methods in addressing the 
challenges of sustainable supply chain management for perishable products. The review identifies and evaluates 
various methods, including Lexicographic Goal Programming, Multi-Choice Goal Programming, Weighted Goal 
Programming, Augmented ε-Constraint, and others, emphasizing their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability in 
balancing economic, environmental, and social objectives. Through careful examination of 11 selected papers from 
an initial pool of 146 references, The review demonstrates that different optimization methods offer distinct 
advantages in addressing the complex challenges of sustainable perishable supply chains. 
 
The findings reveal that while simpler methods like Weighted Sum Method and Weighted Goal Programming provide 
ease of implementation and computational efficiency, they often struggle with non-convex Pareto frontiers and 
achieving diverse trade-offs. Advanced methods such as Augmented ε-Constraint and Robust Possibilistic 
Programming excel in handling complex multi-objective scenarios and uncertainty but require higher computational 
resources and precise parameter settings. Furthermore, the integration of AI, machine learning, and real-time data 
presents significant opportunities for improving the adaptability and robustness of supply chain models. 
 
Despite significant advancements, gaps remain in addressing certain aspects of sustainability. Limited attention has 
been given to the dynamic interactions between economic, environmental, and social objectives over time, as well as 
the impact of data size on model performance and results. Additionally, there is a need to explore hybrid approaches 
combining exact and heuristic methods to improve scalability for large-scale problems.

influencing AI adoption in the air cargo industry using the Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory 
(FDEMATEL) approach. An expert-driven evaluation shortlisted sixteen enablers, categorized into two groups: 
drivers (cause enablers) and outcomes (effect enablers). The findings indicate that Real-Time Analytics, Access to 
Real-Time Information, Automation, Transparency and Visibility, and Quick Adaptation to Changing Market Demand 
serve as the primary drivers facilitating AI integration. These enablers emphasize data-driven decision-making, 
predictive capabilities, and operational adaptability as critical success factors. 
On the other hand, the study reveals that Cost Savings, Knowledge Sharing, Competitive Advantage, and 
Sustainability Initiatives emerge as key outcomes influenced by AI adoption. Strengthening these effect enablers 
ensures long-term collaborative and competitive benefits, including enhanced customer satisfaction, resource 
optimization, and regulatory compliance. The research highlights the need for strategic investments in AI 
infrastructure, leadership commitment, and cultural transformation to enable a seamless integration into the Industry 
4.0 framework.

critical role in achieving regulatory compliance, minimizing carbon footprints, and driving sustainable logistics 
strategies. Furthermore, strengthening Organizational Culture (E16) (D+R = 4.705, D-R = -1.125, Rank 8) will be 
essential in ensuring that AI adoption is not only a technological shift but also an organizational transformation, 
requiring leadership support, change management strategies, and employee engagement initiatives. Lastly, Top 
Management Leadership and Support (E15) (D+R = 4.209, D-R = -0.279, Rank 13) must actively drive AI adoption 
by aligning corporate strategies with AI capabilities, securing investments, and fostering a culture of digital 
transformation across the organization.

Abstract 
Kuwait’s oil supply chain is a critical pillar of the country’s economy, yet it faces significant challenges due to 
fluctuating market demand, geopolitical risks, and environmental regulations. This study aims to enhance the 
resilience of Kuwait’s oil supply chain by developing a Linear Programming (LP) model that optimizes crude oil 
extraction, transportation, refining, inventory management, and market distribution while incorporating 
disruptions such as shipping delays and refinery constraints. The model integrates key cost components, including 
crude oil procurement, desulfurization processing, inventory holding, and penalties for unfulfilled demand. 
Scenario analyses are conducted to evaluate the system’s response to supply chain disruptions, including reduced 
shipping capacities and extreme weather events. Results indicate that while the supply chain demonstrates 
resilience in fulfilling demand, disruptions lead to increased costs and inventory fluctuations. Findings suggest 
that improving storage capacities, diversifying crude oil sources, and enhancing predictive scheduling can further 
strengthen resilience. This study provides a structured approach for policymakers and industry stakeholders to 
mitigate risks and ensure the long-term sustainability of Kuwait’s oil supply chain.

such as decreases in unmet demand in Singapore and Japan and increases in Pakistan and India, unmet demand 
stabilizes to zero by Period 5, indicating recovery. Production adapts to prevent overstock, and the system exhibits 
resilience by recovering from interruptions despite immediate operational and financial consequences due to 
dynamic scheduling and adaptive techniques. 
 
Sandstorm disruption: 
Production of crude oil in Kuwait can be severely disrupted by sandstorms. In this scenario, especially at Well 2, 
production capacity drops to 200,000 barrels per day. Although flexibility decreases, Well 1 makes up for this by 
running at maximum capacity (1,500,000 barrels) during crucial times. During disruptions, refinery production 
falls below 1,200,000 barrels, which results in unmet demand in important markets like India, Pakistan, and South 
Korea. This is particularly true during peak periods like Period 14, when shortage total 1,133,916 barrels. 
Although the cost of keeping inventory is reduced, the disruption leads to production inefficiencies and increased 
penalty costs ($109.8 million) due to unsatisfied demand. Production and refinery outputs must be stabilized by 
boosting stocks, diversifying crude oil sources, and improving sandstorm resilience. 
 
Table 3 presents key performance indicators comparing the base scenario with the two selected disruption 
scenarios, marine weather disturbances and sandstorms. The minor decrease in service rate from 95.56% in the 
base scenario to 95.49% during marine weather interruptions and 94.89% during sandstorms suggests that 
sandstorms have a stronger impact. The primary reasons for the increase in overall spending from $1,635M to 
$1,651M during marine weather disturbances and $1,645M during sandstorms are delays and storage costs. The 
crude oil inventory rises to 17,191 million barrels during marine weather disturbances, indicating shipping delays; 
during sandstorms, the inventory falls to 15,559 million barrels, most likely due to supply chain interruptions.

Marine weather disruptions result in the highest level of finished product inventories at 14,688 million barrels, as 
refineries continue to produce despite shipping delays, while sandstorms cause the lowest level at 10,916 million 
barrels, most likely due to disruptions in refinery operations and product distribution. While marine weather 
disruptions frequently lead to higher prices and inventory accumulation due to transit delays, sandstorms have a 
greater impact on production and logistics, reducing the availability of crude oil and finished products.These 
findings suggest that while the supply chain demonstrates robustness in mitigating disruptions, targeted 
improvements as summarized in Table 2 could further enhance resilience and cost efficiency. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study aimed to investigate the resilience of Kuwait’s oil supply chain by using an LP approach while 
considering key factors such as fluctuating market demand, environmental constraints, and disruptions in shipping 
capacity. The proposed model provides a structured approach to balancing crude oil extraction, transportation, 
refining, inventory management, and distribution under varying conditions. The study achieved several 
milestones: 
 
Data Collection: Overcoming challenges related to data accessibility and confidentiality, this study utilized 
publicly available information and valuable industry insights from professionals at the Kuwait Oil Tanker 
Company (KOTC), Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC), and Kuwait Oil Company (KOC).  
 
Model Development: A comprehensive LP model was developed to optimize operational decisions, dynamically 
adjust production levels, and manage inventory efficiently under various disruption scenarios.  
 
Scenario Testing: The model's robustness was tested through simulations of critical disruption scenarios, 
including decreased shipping capacity and shipment delays.

Optimization: The LP model effectively balanced crude oil production, transportation, and refining operations 
while minimizing penalties for unfulfilled demand. It also helped us understand insights into how inventory 
management strategies could mitigate the impact of disruptions. 
 
While this study provides a foundation for resilience analysis in oil supply chains, several areas offer opportunities 
for further research. Future studies could explore additional resilience metrics, such as supply chain recovery 
time, financial risk exposure, and adaptive capacity, to offer a more comprehensive assessment. Incorporating 
regulatory constraints, including emissions limits, fuel quality standards, and geopolitical trade restrictions, would 
enhance the model’s applicability in real-world policy planning. Additionally, the LP model’s scalability allows 
for potential extensions to include new refineries, alternative sources, or expansion into international markets. 
 
This study demonstrates that with robust inventory strategies, and scenario-based planning, the LP model serves 
as a valuable decision-support tool for policymakers and industry stakeholders. As global energy markets continue 
to evolve, refining and expanding this methodological approach will be crucial for ensuring the long-term 
sustainability and competitiveness of Kuwait’s oil industry.

1. Introduction
The food industry has experienced improvements in speed, accuracy, and excellence by using artificial intelligence 
(AI). Nonetheless, there are still a number of significant obstacles, especially related to how AI can magnify these 
aspects to meet the increasing complexity of contemporary food cultivation. guarantee uniform merchandise quality, 
limit waste, enforce strict safety guidelines, and save business expenses and resource use (Cao et al., 2025). 
Transformative AI provides a way to overcome barriers by enabling predictive maintenance for machines, automating 
quality checks using visual technology, and helping instant evaluation of data to make choices. However, to achieve 
the full capacity of AI, a methodology is needed that ensures maximum effectiveness and accuracy, as well as 
reliability and ethical standardization in its application (Issa et al., 2024). 
This research investigates the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving efficiency, precision, and quality at 
various phases of the food production process, specifically within the context of Good Manufacturing Practices 
(GMP). The food business may use AI to decrease human error, which frequently happens in manual activities, and 
enhance manufacturing processes in an integrated way. Furthermore, this technology makes it possible to 
automatically monitor safety and hygienic requirements, guaranteeing more constant adherence to global laws. The 
objectives of this article are to assess the current obstacles to AI implementation, pinpoint possible uses for AI in the 
food production industry, and create a plan for a more efficient and long-lasting integration of AI technology (Nath et 
al., 2024). 
This research employed the literature review method to carefully examine the literature and synthesize valid data.

The novelty of the research is that it develops a conceptual guide that can enable the food industry to integrate AI with 
GMP effectively and sustainably. It is tailored to ensure that the application of technological innovations within 
companies does not hamper the compliance with rules and standards that ensure safety and hygiene. With this 
comprehensiveness, the study lays a good foundation for further research and strategy development in the 
implementation of AI.

Abstract 
Manual order-picking systems (OPS) often suffer from inefficiencies that manifest as the seven forms of lean waste, 
including motion, defects, over-processing, and waiting. Consequently, order-picking accounts for approximately 
55% of warehouse operational costs and 30–40% of total operational time. Automation emerges as a promising 
solution, yet its broad scope and diverse trade-offs leave businesses uncertain about where to begin or how to 
determine the right level of investment. This study addresses these challenges by classifying the levels of automation 
(LOA) in OPS into three categories: 1) digitalized picking, 2) robot-assisted picking, and 3) fully automated picking. 
Each category is explored in depth, highlighting the technologies and their applications. Furthermore, a decision-
making framework is proposed based on the Full-Consistency Method (FUCOM) to guide businesses in selecting the 
optimal LOA tailored to their specific requirements. This framework is demonstrated through a case study on a direct-
to-consumer foodtech startup, where criteria such as cost and infrastructure flexibility were prioritized, resulting in 
the selection of digitalized picking. The main contribution of this study is the clear classification of automation levels 
in OPS and a practical decision-making framework to guide businesses in optimizing their operations. This research 
concludes by recommending lean automation as an area for future research, emphasizing its importance in ensuring 
the selected LOA will not introduce waste during any phase of implementation.

1. Introduction
Order-picking is a critical warehouse activity that involves locating, retrieving, and moving requested items to a 
designated area for verification and delivery (Pinto et al., 2023a). This process is labor-intensive and costly, accounting 
for approximately 55% of warehouse operational expenses and 30–40% of total operational time (de Koster et al., 
2007). In manual warehouses, these challenges are even more pronounced due to the inherent variability in human 
performance; human workers cannot be expected to consistently follow specific routes, maintain constant walking 
speeds, or restrain from social interactions with coworkers. Additionally, humans are prone to errors, which further 
delays the process (Lesch et al., 2021). These inefficiencies present themselves as the seven forms of lean waste – 
unnecessary motion, waiting, overproduction, overprocessing, defects, excess inventory, and underutilized employee 
talent (Lin, 2010).

their wide range of products and offers a cost-effective solution compared to robotics and automation. The system is 
also scalable, allowing the company to expand operations by adding hardware as needed. Hence, digitalized picking 
is considered the best choice to address the company’s current needs and support their future expansion. 
 
5.1 Proposed Improvements  
To enhance the practical applicability of the framework, an alternative weighting approach can be employed to 
prioritize decision-makers based on their organizational roles and influence. In this case study, Decision Maker 1 – 
the chief executive officer (CEO) – may be assigned greater weight due to his overarching authority and strategic 
vision. While the perspectives of Decision Maker 2 – the cofounder – and Decision Maker 3 – the automation manager 
– are also significant, the CEO's input can be prioritized to reflect his decisive role within the organization. This 
adjustment ensures the framework better mirrors decision-making hierarchies, thereby improving its relevance and 
utility in practice.  
 
5.2 Validation  
The validation of digitalized picking as the optimal LOA for the company was approached through benchmarking 
against companies of similar scale and industry, such as HelloFresh and Blue Apron, which successfully utilize 
technologies like pick-to-light, voice-directed picking, and RFID handheld scanners. These systems have been shown 
to improve accuracy by up to 30% and reduce picking times by up to 50%, aligning with the company’s goals of 
reducing cycle time and improving efficiency. For precise validation of whether digitalized picking will meet the 
company’s projected 10% demand growth, simulation-based analysis is recommended.  
 
5.3 Limitations 
This study is limited by the fact that it considers only three decision-makers, which may not fully capture the range of 
perspectives typically present in more complex decision-making scenarios. Moreover, as the number of criteria and 
alternatives increases, the consistency checking process becomes more complex and computationally intensive. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Automation is critical to addressing inefficiencies that drive costs and waste in manual order-picking systems. This 
study proposed a comprehensive framework for determining the optimal level of automation, supported by a FUCOM-
based decision-making model and demonstrated through a case study. By classifying automation into digitalized, 
robot-assisted, and fully automated categories, the framework provides a clear path for businesses to align their 
operational needs with appropriate automation solutions. 
 
While this research lays the groundwork for automating OPS, future efforts should focus on optimizing key design 
areas – routing, layout, batching, zoning, and storage strategies – through advanced simulation tools, such as Visual 
Components, Simio, or Flexsim. Furthermore, the authors recommend investigating the concept of “lean automation” 
to ensure that efficiency gains from automation are not offset by waste introduced during implementation.

Abstract 
The textile industry, a cornerstone of global manufacturing, faces numerous challenges in optimizing supply chain 
management (SCM), particularly in inventory and warehouse operations. The barriers hindering SCM implementation 
in the Bangladesh textile sector were identified and ranked using AHP and Delphi methods in this study. Sixteen 
barriers grouped in the categories of Inventory Control, Quality Control, Transportation, and Raw Material Sourcing 
were analyzed and validated through the Delphi method and subsequently, through the AHP method, barrier ranking 
was undertaken in an attempt to measure which barrier was more critical than another. The results portray that among 
all categories, Inventory Management was the most dominant barrier along with deficiencies in setting optimal 
inventory levels, forecasting demand, and errors associated with human factors. These findings present a 
comprehensive methodology for tackling the challenges posed by poor SCM practices, providing relevant information 
for practitioners in the industry on how to improve profitability, minimize expenses, and strengthen operational agility. 
This study presents the opportunities that data driven methodology offer to improve SCM operations within the textile 
sector.

1. Introduction
Supply chain management is of paramount importance in the world of industry today, serving the function of creating 
a smooth network for the circulation of materials, information, and resources in a value chain. The textile industry is 
a core example of global supply chain because it encompasses a large degree of product market variety, the efficiency 
of resource use, and for meeting time deadlines. In addition, for developing nations such as Bangladesh, which has a 
strong textile industry, there is a greater need for increasing supply chain efficiency alongside the operational 
requirement because there is a lack of competitiveness on the global stage. 
Even with the deep reliance and promise the textile industry shows, it still lacks proper supply chain management. 
This lack of proper management stems primarily from inventory management and warehouse operations. The 
mismanagement of these areas leads to problems such as stockouts and overproduction which directly lead to lower 
profits and higher operational costs. These problems highlight the barriers that come with the lack of proper data 
driven strategies for supply chain management. 
According to available literature, a variety of frameworks exist for assessing and ranking supply chain obstacles and 
the methodologies of AHP and Delphi are widely used to aid decision making. Even if these techniques have been 
used in different industries, their application within the textile sector is still limited, especially in developing nations

Figure 1. Global Weights by Categories of Barriers 
 
It means inventory management has been assessed as contributing to nearly 48% of overall importance when 
evaluating barriers in the supply chain of textile industry in Bangladesh. And followed by Quality Assurance (29%) 
which highlights the importance of ensuring consistent product quality and its substantial impact on supply chain 
efficiency. Raw Material Sourcing contributes (14%) of the overall importance when evaluating barriers in the textile 
industry’s supply chain. Bangladesh textile sector face numerous difficulties such as delays, cost variability, or 
supplier reliability that reduces supply chain efficiencies. Transportation is found to be the least important barrier in 
the Bangladesh textile industries having 9% importance. These results highlight the prominence of inventory-related 
challenges in the textile industry, requiring immediate attention. The weights provide a clear prioritization for 
addressing key supply chain inefficiencies. 
 
5.3. Proposed Improvements 
Based on expert consultations and the identification of inventory management as the top priority, several 
improvements are proposed: 
• 
Implementation of a 5S Warehouse System: A well-designed, organized, and maintained warehouse 
can reduce inventory management inefficiencies. Adopting a 5S approach will streamline inventory storage, 
reduce handling time, and improve accuracy in stock tracking. 
• 
Enhanced Inventory Control Practices: The addition of inventory management systems such as VMI 
(vendor managed inventory) or demand forecasting models can also lead to decreased excess inventory and 
greater stockout avoidance. 
• 
Collaboration with Suppliers: Strengthening partnerships with suppliers to ensure timely and efficient 
raw material sourcing can further alleviate supply chain disruptions. 
 
5.4. 
Validation 
Industry specialists confirmed the findings and proposed improvements about how inventory management is the most 
daunting challenge pinching the textile industries in Bangladesh. The results of the AHP analysis confirmed these 
hunches and made sure that the prioritization of inventory management was realistic. The corroboration of the study’s 
framework with real-world conditions confirms its validity. Future works might entail conducting a thorough case 
study in one of the major textile industries in Bangladesh to ascertain how improving inventory management can 
enhance overall efficiency in the supply chain.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The research presents an orderly approach to tackling supply chain management barriers in the garment sector of 
Bangladesh, with a focus on coordinating work related to inventory and warehouse management, which is now a key 
area for improvement. This study integrates the Delphi and AHP methods to identify and collect both qualitative and 
quantitative insights from industry practitioners. 
 
The findings conclude that stock control issues, especially those regarding the amount of optimum stock to have on 
hand, and demand forecasting are the most significant barriers to effective SCM adoption. Other obstacles such as 
Quality assurance, transportation and raw material sourcing emerged as important when considering the barriers

within the supply chain. The prioritization of these barriers offers actionable insights, empowering organizations to 
develop targeted interventions that enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve operational resilience. 
 
From an academic perspective, this study bridges key gaps in the literature by applying a dual-method approach 
tailored to the specific context of a developing economy. Practically, it provides a blueprint for industry stakeholders 
to streamline supply chain processes, ensuring alignment with strategic objectives. 
 
Future research could explore the integration of quality assurance and logistics optimization into a unified framework, 
addressing the broader complexities of supply chain networks. Additionally, replicating this study in different 
operational contexts would help validate the robustness of the proposed framework and uncover region-specific 
insights. 
 
As the textile industry continues to evolve amidst global competition and shifting market dynamics, this study 
underscores the transformative potential of data-driven methodologies in shaping resilient and sustainable supply 
chains. By prioritizing high impact barriers and foster a culture of continuous improvement, the industry can achieve 
long-term growth and remain competitive in the global market.

Abstract 
The global concern on sustainability is bringing out some implications in the field of human resource management as 
well. Researchers worldwide are willing to investigate sustainability considering the humane side to establish an 
explicit connection between these two phenomena. With the increasing curiosity in sustainable human resource 
management (SHRM), the field is relatively new, with a limited conceptual understanding of sustainable human 
resource practices. Henceforth, a bibliometric analysis of 155 articles from 2008 to 2024 on sustainable human 
resource practices is done to gather insights and synthesize the findings. The articles are retrieved using the SCOPUS 
database, and analyzed using Biblioshiny, a web interface based on the R package. The findings demonstrate that the 
topic is growing exponentially, even though there appears to be no agreement on the precise definition, 
characterization, and measurement of sustainable human resource (HR) practices. There is a need to determine the 
causes and consequences of sustainable HR practices. Academicians, practitioners, and policymakers can benefit from 
this review as it reveals intriguing findings that could aid the successful implementation of sustainable HR practices 
in organizations. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
The world we are living in is highly unpredictable. With the ever-growing population, meeting the basic needs of 
humans is leading to the over-utilization of natural resources. This is deteriorating the environment and humanity at 
large worldwide. The transformation in the climate, dwindling natural resources, and ever-increasing demands are 
some of the main societal concerns. This often disrupts the ways businesses should operate (Christmann et al., 2001). 
Global industrial activities are bringing about severe societal challenges, and protective measures need to be 
incorporated to ensure sustainability in the context of people, planet, and profit. Sustainability has a long, deep-rooted 
history from the 1980s when the United Nations Brundtland Commission Report of 1987 defined it as meeting the 
present requirements without compromising for the future. Organizations need to focus on social concerns in addition 
to economic and environmental concerns to integrate sustainability into their business models holistically (Elkington, 
2006). Sustainable human resource (HR) practices is one growing area that addresses social issues. Much literature

Research on sustainable HR practices has usually increased from 2008 to 2024. An investigation of the country-wise 
contribution to scientific articles demonstrates that India is emerging as a major contributor in the field and setting 
benchmarks for other developed and developing countries to foster sustainable practices. Meanwhile, Australia, the 
UK, China, and the USA have contributed significantly to the research topic. 
 
This research has revealed that organizational sectors like construction, automobile, ecotourism, and manufacturing 
require immediate actions on people-related strategies to foster sustainability. These industries are highly dynamic in 
nature, and their contribution to the nation's GDP is critical. For example, in India, the emergence of Make in India 
and National Tourism Policy, provides avenues for such sectors to develop. However, newer frameworks must be 
developed to include sustainable HR practices for achieving global sustainable goals. The research further identified 
the growth in themes concerning sustainable development and resource management. However, it is evident that little 
concern is shown in people-related issues like employee participation, employee resilience, employee relations, and 
labor management (Stafford-Smith et al. 2017).  
 
Furthermore, sustainable HR practices have been defined by different people differently. Some consider it to be value-
driven practices, some as practices to achieve non-financial objectives, others as practices for optimum utilization of 
human resources, while others have linked it with green practices, triple bottom line practices, common good, or 
socially responsible practices. Henceforth, redefining the concept of sustainable HR practices and its measurement is 
necessary for enhanced generalizability. 
 
5.2 Limitations of the Study 
The study entails a few limitations as well. Firstly, the data collection period began from 2008 and ended in 2024, 
therefore, the research before and after this period are not considered. Secondly, this study only includes English-
language Scopus-indexed journal articles. However, monographs, collected books, conference proceedings, and 
journal articles in various languages are all relevant to a bibliometric study. Thirdly, bibliometric analysis is a review-
based study that may lead to subjectivity in data collection and analysis. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future prospects 
The review study on sustainable human resource practices underscores the critical role that HR strategies play in 
shaping the future of organizations in a world marked by heightened environmental and social concerns. The synthesis 
of existing literature reveals that the convergence of sustainable practices and HR initiatives fosters positive societal 
impacts and enhances organizational performance and resilience. The intersection of sustainable practices and human 
resource strategies emerges as a powerful crucible of progress that can shape society and the world for good. 
Furthermore, the study identified several avenues for future research that could enrich our understanding of sustainable 
HR practices. Investigating the intricate interplay between emerging technologies, such as AI and blockchain, with 
HR functions could yield insights into how digital innovations can be harnessed to foster sustainability. Additionally, 
exploring the cross-cultural and global applicability of sustainable HR practices could provide valuable insights for 
organizations operating in diverse contexts.

Abstract 
Evaluating student services is crucial for ensuring that educational institutions meet the diverse needs and expectations 
of their students, fostering a supportive environment that enhances academic success, personal development, and 
overall satisfaction. This study evaluated student satisfaction levels with academic and non-academic services at a 
private university in Cebu City, Philippines. The primary objective was to propose a management system framework 
for enhancing student services. Satisfaction was assessed based on five key factors: tangibility, assurance, 
responsiveness, reliability, and empathy. Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), expert respondents assigned 
priority weights to these factors: Tangibility (40.40%), Assurance (21.40%), Responsiveness (16.60%), Reliability 
(14.20%), and Empathy (7.40%). The weighted factors were applied to survey data results on students' level of 
satisfaction to rank both academic and non-academic services using Multi-Criteria Decision-Making 
(MCDM), specifically Technique for Order Preference by Similarity To Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The study 
highlights the critical role of tangibility and assurance in delivering quality student services. The findings informed 
the creation of a management system framework focused on data-driven evaluation, targeted enhancements, and 
fostering a culture of excellence. By recognizing high-performing units and addressing weaker areas, the framework 
ensures that the university adapts to students' evolving needs, reinforcing its commitment to service quality and student 
satisfaction.

1. Introduction
Improving the student experience has become a central concern for educational institutions worldwide, as it 
significantly impacts student satisfaction, engagement, academic performance, and overall well-being. By providing 
comprehensive and thoughtfully designed support services, universities can create an inclusive and supportive 
environment that fosters student growth and success. 
Melissa Buultjens and Priscilla Robinson (2011), in their article ""Enhancing Aspects of the Higher Education Student 
Experience,"" emphasized that improving the student experience is an essential priority for higher education 
institutions. They noted that collaborative and engaging service delivery enhances equity among students, contributing

5. Proposed Management System Framework 
Figure 3 below displays the proposed Management System Framework that outlines a cyclical process to enhance 
student services. It starts with administering a survey questionnaire to gather feedback, followed by data collection 
and analysis to determine satisfaction levels and rank services. Based on the results, services that perform satisfactorily 
(top performers) are recognized and serve as benchmarks for others to emulate, while those at the bottom receive 
focused action plans and improvements. Continuous feedback loops ensure that changes are monitored, and additional 
adjustments are made over time, promoting an ongoing cycle of evaluation, implementation, and refinement.

6. Conclusion 
The study highlights the importance of prioritizing tangibility and assurance in delivering student services, as these 
factors were given the highest weights in the AHP analysis. Using the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity 
to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), the findings provide a clear picture of which academic and non-academic services excel 
in meeting student expectations and which areas require improvement.  
 
Based on the results, a management system framework was developed to guide continuous evaluation and 
enhancement of student services at the University. The framework emphasizes data-driven decision-making, targeted 
improvements, and fostering a culture of excellence in service delivery. Recognizing top-performing academic and 
non-academic student offices can further motivate all schools of the University as well as its non-academic student 
services to strive for higher standards, ensuring that the University consistently meets the evolving needs of its 
students.  
 
Furthermore, the insights gained from this study can be used as basis for policy-making efforts to institutionalize best 
practices and ensure consistent, high-quality service across the University. Future research could explore longitudinal 
assessments of student services, tracking changes in satisfaction over multiple semesters or academic years. 
Additionally, incorporating qualitative feedback like focus groups and in-depth interviews may provide deeper 
insights into the specific needs and preferences of diverse student populations, further refining the improvement 
strategies and policy-making initiatives that may be formulated because of the study.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic established online learning as a permanent fixture in education, transforming teaching and 
learning. While many studies focused on tertiary and secondary levels, this paper examines ergonomic factors’ impact 
on graduate students’ learning motivation and academic attention. An online survey of 45 students in a university 
based in Cebu City was analyzed using multiple regression, clustering ergonomic factors into physical, cognitive, and 
organizational domains. The results show significant effects of these factors on learning motivation and academic 
attention. The lighting conditions in the graduate students' online learning environment greatly influence their learning 
motivation. The design of their workstation, the ambient noise levels, and their auditory learning preferences 
significantly affect their academic attention. Furthermore, their visual learning preferences, access to technology, and 
the instructional methods of their teachers have a notable impact on both their learning motivation and academic 
attention. These findings offer practical insights for enhancing online learning and guiding educators and policymakers 
in designing effective online education.

Abstract 
Research on working pairs is essential for understanding the performance of adsorption refrigeration systems. This 
study aims to investigate the characteristics of two types of silica gels, RD and A, with respect to their capacity and 
rate of adsorption and desorption of water vapor. A modeling approach that integrates experimental results was used 
to simulate an adsorption refrigeration system, considering the properties of silica gels and boundary conditions. The 
simulations featured operating pressures of 2.5 kPa and a cooling temperature of 30°C for the adsorption process and 
operating pressures of 6.2 kPa with a heating temperature of 85°C for the desorption process. A Computational Fluid 
Dynamics (CFD) simulation method utilizing Toth Isotherm modeling was employed to determine the isothermal 
characteristics, while Linear Driving Force (LDF) modeling was used to assess the kinetic characteristics. The 
simulation results indicate that silica gel type RD has higher adsorption and desorption capacities than silica gel type 
A when interacting with water. After 100 seconds in the transient phase, type RD reached an adsorption capacity of 
0.1741 kg/kg, while type A achieved only 0.1256 kg/kg. By the end of the process, type RD's adsorption capacity 
increased to 0.2127 kg/kg, whereas type A's capacity reached 0.1422 kg/kg. During the desorption process, type RD 
also exhibited higher desorption capacities at every stage. After 100 seconds, type RD recorded a desorption capacity 
of 0.0517 kg/kg, while type A reached only 0.0370 kg/kg. At saturation, the desorption value for type RD was 0.0474 
kg/kg, in contrast to type A's value of 0.0334 kg/kg.

1. Introduction
Currently, there is an increasing global demand for residential cooling. Estimates indicate that electricity consumption 
for cooling will rise from 300 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2000 to 4000 TWh by 2050 (Jakubcionis and Carlsson, 2017). 
Research by Sustainable Energy Development shows that buildings in the United States allocate approximately 33% 
of their electricity consumption to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems for cooling (Wang et 
2120","Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Singapore, February 18-20, 2025 
 
© IEOM Society International 
desorption capacity of 0.0370 kg/kg, while type RD achieves 0.0517 kg/kg. By the end of the saturation phase, at 3700 
seconds, type A reports a capacity of 0.0334 kg/kg, and type RD records a capacity of 0.0474 kg/kg. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The researchers emphasized the key characteristics of silica gel types A and RD as adsorbents during isothermal and 
kinetic adsorption and desorption operations conducted at cooling temperatures of 303.15 K and heating temperatures 
of 358 K. They found that the adsorption and desorption capacities of silica gel type RD with water are greater than 
those of silica gel type A. After 100 seconds, the adsorption capacity of type RD is 0.1741 kg/kg, while type A achieves 
only 0.1256 kg/kg. By the end of the process, the adsorption capacity of type RD increases to 0.2127 kg/kg, whereas 
type A only reaches 0.1422 kg/kg. Throughout the desorption process, type RD consistently exhibits a higher 
desorption capacity. At the end of the transient phase, after 100 seconds, the desorption capacity of type RD is 0.0517 
kg/kg, compared to type A, which achieves only 0.0370 kg/kg. By the end of the saturation phase, type RD shows a 
desorption value of 0.0474 kg/kg, while type A has only 0.0334 kg/kg. Additionally, the optimal cycle time for using 
silica gel types A and RD with water is limited to just 2000 seconds. 
 
In terms of temperature distribution, silica gel type A is more effective in cooling compared to type RD, although the 
difference is minimal. Variations in the working pairs between silica gel types A and RD do not significantly impact 
temperature and pressure changes. Additionally, the isothermal characteristics of the silica gel used greatly influence 
adsorption performance, as indicated by adsorption and desorption capabilities. When considering the properties of 
the adsorbent material, higher porous volume values are associated with improved adsorption capabilities. However, 
the results of this study cannot be fully generalized to different working conditions without specific adjustments. The 
characteristics of adsorption and desorption are significantly influenced by factors such as temperature, pressure, 
working pairs, and cycle time. Therefore, to apply these findings to other scenarios, further simulations or 
experimental validations are needed to ensure accuracy under different working conditions.

Abstract 
Circular economy initiatives emphasize the active involvement of consumers as key participants in the supply chain. 
However, consumers often exhibit reluctance to purchase circular products. This research investigates how sharing 
information about circular processes and providing product knowledge influence consumers’ intentions to purchase 
circular products. Grounded in signalling theory, we develop a model to explain how knowledge of the circular 
processes a product undergoes positively impacts consumer behaviour. Notably, we also examine the role of significant 
others in shaping consumers’ purchase intentions. This study contributes to the discourse on the consumer's role in the 
circular economy by linking circularity-related process information with consumers’ purchase intentions. Thus, the 
suggested propositional framework addresses the information asymmetry between consumers and vendors of circular 
products, paving the way for more informed and confident consumer decision-making.  
Keywords 
Circular economy, circular products, purchase intention, circular process knowledge.

Abstract 
In today’s dynamic global market, choosing the optimal manufacturing location is critical for competitiveness, 
efficiency, and rapid product delivery. This study assesses the manufacturing location for Hardware V for Company 
X, comparing China and Malaysia based on cost, quality, and strategic business impact. Methodologies used include 
analysis of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), Return Material Authorization (RMA), SWOT and PESTLE, Analytic 
Hierarchy Process (AHP), Hofstede’s Cultural Dimensions, Net Present Value (NPV), and stakeholder feedback. 
Malaysia emerged as the preferred choice in six out of nine key decision factors. Findings revealed a 4% cost 
reduction, a 1% decrease in defect rates, and a projected 23% growth in business opportunities compared to China. 
While China demonstrated strengths in cultural compatibility and supply chain robustness, Malaysia’s advantages in 
lower operational costs, enhanced quality control, and strategic alignment with Company X’s goals in the Automated 
Fare Collection (AFC) sector positioned it as the optimal location. Selecting Malaysia strengthens Company X’s 
profitability, product quality, and stakeholder satisfaction in a competitive market landscape.

Business Impact. 
1. Introduction
1.1 Background
Company X is a subsidiary of a publicly listed company and operates seven offices worldwide. It focuses on improving
public transportation systems and specializes in Automated Fare Collection (AFC), ticketing, and smart transportation
technology. One of its main products, Hardware V, streamlines fare collection, enhances passenger flow, and generates
valuable transit data (Welp Magazine 2024). Production is outsourced to contract manufacturers (CMs) for cost
efficiency and technical expertise in alignment with the electronics industry practice (MFG 2024). Initially produced
in China, Hardware V’s manufacturing shifted to Malaysia in 2022. Company X’s management believes this move
increased costs but also improved product quality whilst customer relationships, brand reputation, or market share
remain unchanged. However, these assumptions unvalidated by data pose risks for Company X. It is critical for
Company X to evaluate these assumptions and guide strategic decision-making on its production location to maintain
its competitive advantage in the VUCA global landscape.
1.2 Objectives 
This study is guided by the following three objectives. The first objective is to conduct a Total Cost of Ownership 
(TCO) analysis of outsourcing the production of Hardware V in China and Malaysia, considering all relevant costs, 
with quantitative analysis. The second objective is to analyze data to determine which location, China or Malaysia, 
produces a better quality of Hardware V with fewer rejects from end customers and to assess the ease of doing business

considering key factors and stakeholder feedback, to guide Company X toward the best manufacturing choice for 
future growth and success in the Automated Fare Collection (AFC) industry. 
 
5.1 Conclusions 
This study establishes Malaysia as the ideal production location for Hardware V, supported by critical factors such as 
total cost, quality, future value, and employee feedback (Table 6). While findings from PESTLE, AHP, and Hofstede’s 
analysis favor China, customer surveys and operational insights strongly favor Malaysia. This decision aligns with 
Company X’s cost savings goals, improved product quality, and stronger relationships with customers and employees, 
ensuring long-term growth and competitiveness in the AFC industry. 
 
Recent market developments further validate this choice. Rising geopolitical tensions, such as U.S.-China trade issues, 
have prompted major companies like IBM (Liu 2024) and HP (Investing.com 2024) to reduce their reliance on China. 
Malaysia is emerging as a preferred alternative due to its political stability, tech-friendly policies, and economic 
growth (Banerjee 2024). Significant investments, such as Infineon’s SGD10 billion chip factory, highlight Malaysia’s 
growing appeal (ST Business 2024). Conversely, China faces economic challenges, including declining foreign 
investments, signaling increased risks (The Feed 2024). These trends strengthen the case for Malaysia as the strategic 
location for Hardware V production. 
 
Table 6. Summary of results 
 
 
 
5.2 Recommendations 
This study focused on factory gate costs for Hardware V. However, future research should incorporate end-to-end 
costs, including transportation, installation, and after-sales services, for a more comprehensive expense analysis. 
Additionally, conducting separate quality Pareto analyses for each manufacturing location would help identify and 
address location-specific issues more effectively. While customer surveys indicated a preference for Malaysia-made 
products, more profound studies on customer satisfaction and product performance post-deployment could provide 
actionable insights.  
 
With a growing emphasis on sustainability, future studies should evaluate the environmental impact of manufacturing 
in Malaysia and China, focusing on energy use, waste, and emissions. Expanding risk assessment through a detailed 
matrix considering supply chain and political risks could enhance disaster preparedness. Lastly, exploring emerging 
manufacturing hubs like Vietnam, India, and Thailand could uncover new alternatives to China and Malaysia, aligning 
with broader market trends and strategic opportunities.

Abstract 
The substantial funding in Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems by tertiary Institutions must be assessed based 
on their productivity of their implementation. With the growing acquisition and execution of ERPs in HEIs over the 
past decade, this study utilizes the investigative framework of Peters and Aggrey (BSC and ISO 25010) to assess the 
effectiveness of ERPs in Ghanaian tertiary education. The aim of this paper is to identify the key determinants for 
assessing the performance of ERPs in Ghanaian tertiary education using the adopted analytic framework. Based on 
the literature and studies reviewed, no existing research has established the significant factors for assessing ERP 
system effectiveness in Ghanaian higher education. A combined-method research approach was utilized, with 
quantitative records gathered from 173 managers and administrators across three case study universities in Ghana 
(University_of_Ghana, University of Cape Coast, and Kwame_Nkrumah_University_of_Science_and_Technology), 
all of which have executed ERPs for two or more years. Additionally, six managers from these tertiary institutions 
were interrogated for the qualitative investigation. Data were investigated through partial_least_squares 
structural_equation_modeling (PLS-SEM) and inductive=thematic=analysis. The results of the research indicated that 
the 
financial=perspective, 
customer/stakeholder=perspective, 
learning=growth=perspective, 
and 
system=quality=perspective are significantly or positively associated with the effectiveness of ERP systems in 
Ghanaian higher education. Interestingly, the findings revealed that the internal=business=process=perspective had 
no important impact on the effectiveness of ERPs in HEIs. Works on the assessment of ERP system effectiveness in 
Ghanaian tertiary institutions are scarce. A practical implication of these findings suggests that when assessing ERPs 
performance in tertiary education, particularly in the Ghanaian context, the financial, learning & growth, system 
quality, and customer/stakeholder perspectives play crucial roles that must not be overlooked by the evaluation team. 
Therefore, this study has successfully evaluated the performance of ERPs in Ghanaian tertiary institutions and 
demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed research framework.

Abstract 
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart cities has transformed urban governance, enhancing efficiency 
in public services, infrastructure management, and decision-making. However, the widespread use of AI for data 
collection and analysis raises significant challenges related to privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, and public trust. 
Without proper governance, AI systems risk exacerbating inequalities, infringing on citizen rights, and reducing 
accountability in automated decision-making. This paper explores how AI-driven frameworks can enhance data 
governance while ensuring privacy protection, algorithmic fairness, and citizen empowerment. Key strategies include 
federated learning to enable decentralized data processing, differential privacy to protect individual identities, and 
explainable AI (XAI) to increase transparency in automated decisions. Additionally, bias detection mechanisms and 
algorithmic audits are essential to prevent discrimination in AI-driven urban systems. Public trust is crucial in smart 
city initiatives, requiring citizen engagement models, participatory AI councils, and transparent data-sharing policies. 
Case studies from Barcelona, Singapore, Buenos Aires and Toronto illustrate effective AI governance approaches that 
balance innovation with ethical considerations. The paper proposes a comprehensive governance framework 
integrating privacy-centric AI, fairness-aware algorithms, and public engagement strategies to ensure sustainable, 
transparent, and accountable AI-driven urban ecosystems. By aligning technological advancements with ethical and 
legal safeguards, smart cities can optimize AI’s potential while maintaining public trust and regulatory compliance.

Abstract 
In the Peruvian context, the operating costs associated with the transportation of hydrocarbons represent a significant 
challenge for SMEs in the transportation sector, especially due to high fuel consumption. According to the Ministry 
of Energy and Mines (Minem,2023), land transportation activity increased by 6.7% in the last year, which highlights 
the need to implement strategies that optimize distribution efficiency. This research proposes an improvement model 
based on three key tools: Total Productive Maintenance (TPM), telemetry for efficient fleet management and work 
standardization, with the objective of reducing fuel consumption and travel time in logistics routes. The methodology 
applied is descriptive and quantitative, framed in a continuous improvement model. The results obtained validate the 
effectiveness of the model through simulations and field tests, achieving a 7.7% reduction in fuel consumption per 
vehicle and a 17.9% reduction in total route time on the Lima - Arequipa route and vice versa. These findings highlight 
the model's potential to increase the competitiveness and operational sustainability of companies in the sector.

1. Introduction
The land transportation sector in Peru plays a crucial role in the country's economy, being fundamental for the 
distribution of goods, particularly in the transportation of hydrocarbons. However, it faces significant operational 
challenges, such as high fuel consumption, lack of standardization in operating processes, and resistance to change on 
the part of drivers. These problems increase operating costs and affect transportation efficiency, which represents an 
obstacle to the sustainability of the sector (South Express Cargo, 2023). According to previous studies, road transport, 
which represents a considerable part of distribution in the country, has costs ranging between 18% and 32% of the 
total freight cost (Lima Chamber of Commerce, 2022), which makes it urgent to implement improvements in 
operational efficiency. Despite advances in hydrocarbon production, which increased by 6.7% last year (Ministry of 
Energy and Mines, 2023), transportation companies still lack systematic solutions that increase their efficiency,

6. Conclusion 
With the results obtained, it is concluded that the implementation of the proposed model in the company allowed a 
significant reduction in fuel consumption and transit times. The standardization of activities during transportation 
allowed saving 19.74 gallons per trip, which is equivalent to a 9.66% savings in fuel. This value was analyzed 
according to the volume of trips made per month (4 trips), which demonstrates the efficiency of the model applied. 
 
In addition, by optimizing route planning, transit time was reduced to 127.20 hours per trip. It was also observed that 
the optimal idling fuel consumption corresponds to 3.14 gallons per trip on the selected route, which contributes to 
greater operational efficiency. 
 
The economic analysis of the project highlights its high viability, with a positive Net Present Value (NPV) of 416,018 
soles and an average Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 135.5%. These indicators demonstrate that the project is 
profitable and generates a high rate of return on investment. 
 
The sensitivity analysis identified the number of trucks as one of the most sensitive variables for the economic viability 
of the project. To ensure a positive NPV and project profitability, a minimum fleet of 15 vehicles is required. This 
highlights the importance of proper planning and the need to have an adequate fleet to maximize profits. 
 
In summary, the implementation of the improvements has proven to be effective both in terms of operational efficiency 
and economic profitability, which positions the company in a favorable scenario for its growth and competitiveness 
in the market.

Abstract 
The global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is critical for achieving sustainability and reducing carbon emissions. 
This study investigates how emotional expressions and post types in organization-generated content (OGC) influence 
public sentiment toward EVs, using data collected from Facebook. By employing sentiment analysis and linear 
regression models, the research evaluates the effects of positive and negative emotions, post types (photos, videos, 
others), reading complexity and control variables such as administrative country type. The results reveal that positive 
emotions like joy and trust significantly enhance public sentiment, while negative emotions, particularly fear, reduce 
it. Posts featuring photos outperform videos and other formats in driving favorable sentiment. Reading complexity 
negatively impacts sentiment, emphasizing the need for clear and accessible language. Additionally, posts from non-
developed countries exhibit lower sentiment scores compared to those from developed countries. These findings 
highlight the importance of crafting emotionally resonant and visually engaging content to promote EV adoption. The 
study offers actionable insights for organizations to optimize their communication strategies, fostering positive public 
perceptions and supporting the global transition to sustainable transportation. Future research could explore platform-
specific effects and integrate user-generated content for a broader understanding of EV-related sentiment.

1. Introduction
The global electric vehicle (EV) market has witnessed unprecedented growth, marking a transformative era in the 
automotive industry. By 2022, EV sales surpassed 10 million units worldwide, accounting for 14% of total car sales—
2174","Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

finding supports media processing theory, which posits that visual content captures attention and evokes stronger 
emotional responses compared to text (Valkenburg et al., 2016). 
 
Regarding Reading Complexity as a barrier, the negative association between reading complexity and sentiment 
underscores the importance of accessible language in OGC (Kincaid, 1975). Posts with simpler language are more 
likely to resonate with a broader audience, particularly in a technical domain like EVs where jargon can alienate 
potential consumers. With the context of geographical and cultural context, Posts from non-developed countries 
elicited lower sentiment, potentially reflecting disparities in infrastructure, trust, or cultural perceptions of EVs. 
Organizations operating in these regions may need to tailor their communication strategies to address local challenges 
and consumer concerns. 
 
We acknowledge that Model 1.2 demonstrates moderate explanatory power, with R2 = 0.272, indicating space for 
improvement. One potential limitation is the presence of omitted variables, which may impact the model’s predictive 
accuracy. Incorporating additional variables, such as topic-wise sentiment analysis derived from sentiment analysis of 
organizational posts, could improve its performance. Additionally, the existing model assumes a linear relationship, 
whereas real-world data may exhibit complex patterns. To address these limitations, advanced AI/ML techniques (e.g., 
random forest, deep learning etc.) could be explored to improve predictive accuracy. Future research can focus on 
refining the model by adding these approaches and expanding the dataset to enhance its robustness. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study explored how emotional expressions, post types, reading complexity and control variables influence public 
sentiment toward OGC about EVs. The findings revealed that emotional tone and multimedia content are critical 
drivers of sentiment. Positive emotions, such as joy and trust, significantly enhance public perception, while negative 
emotions, especially fear, harm it. Posts with photos and videos are more effective in generating positive sentiment 
compared to text-only posts. Reading complexity also emerged as a key factor, with simpler language yielding better 
sentiment scores. Finally, the administrative country type influenced sentiment, with posts from developed countries 
eliciting more favorable responses. 
 
The results have important implications for organizations aiming to promote EV adoption through social media. First, 
emphasizing positive emotional expressions and reducing negative tones in OGC can improve audience perception. 
Second, leveraging visual content, particularly photos, can enhance the effectiveness of communication. Third, using 
simple and clear language is essential to ensure accessibility and comprehension. Lastly, tailoring communication 
strategies to regional and cultural contexts is critical for addressing disparities in sentiment across different countries. 
Future research could build on these findings by examining other moderating factors, such as platform-specific effects 
or audience demographics. Additionally, integrating user-generated content (UGC) into the analysis could provide a 
more holistic view of public sentiment toward EVs. These efforts will help organizations craft more effective 
communication strategies, ultimately fostering greater adoption of EVs and supporting global sustainability goals.

1. Introduction
PT Corro Shield Indonesia specializes in wastewater processing solutions, drilling waste management, clean water 
processing in the petroleum and gas industry, and offers additional services such as Toxic Gas Management and 
cooling drilling mud (Mud Cooler System). Nowadays, the drilling industry is experiencing significant growth in 
business due to the high demand for oil and gas products. Drilling companies prefer to rent drilling equipment rather 
than purchase it since the investment and maintenance costs are relatively high when associated with ownership. To 
meet this demand, PT Corro Shield Indonesia provides heavy equipment rental services for drilling and handling all 
related logistics processes, including loading, unloading, and transportation of the equipment. 
Logistics activities for heavy equipment, such as those conducted by PT Corro Shield Indonesia, involve complex 
processes that require careful planning. These activities include loading equipment at the storage location, transporting 
it to the drilling site, and unloading it at the destination. According to the literature, logistics for heavy equipment 
carries high risks, particularly related to safety and potential equipment damage during transportation. Therefore, an 
efficient logistics management system and adherence to strict safety standards are essential to mitigate these risks in 
whole logistics processes. This process needs specialized equipment and certified workers to ensure each stage is done 
safely and efficiently.

5.4 Validation 
Based on Table 5 and Table 6 above, it can be identified that in the loading and transport activity, 13 hazards and risks 
were identified. Among these, one risk is categorized as extreme, six risks are categorized as high, two risks are 
categorized as medium, and four risks are categorized as low. While in the unloading activity, there were 12 hazards 
and risks identified. There is one risk that is categorized as extreme risk, three risks are high, seven risks are 
categorized as medium, and one risk is included as low risk. 
 
Therefore, there are two activities in the extreme risk category, namely: 
1. “Moving a container to a truck using a crane” in loading activity, with the potential hazard of ""Container falls 
while being moved, unit position is incorrect, sling rope breaks."" 
2. “Lifting containers with a crane” in unloading activity, with the potential hazard of ""Improper container 
positioning"". 
 
Both activities require a crane for movement. If these activities are not properly executed, they can result in death if 
the crane or container falls on a worker. Therefore, these activities must be closely monitored, with strict SOPs applied 
and the proposed preventive actions followed. These preventive actions include prohibiting workers from approaching 
areas near the activity, ensuring that crane operators are certified, and confirming that the container is properly 
positioned and securely fastened before lifting. 
There are nine potential hazards in the high risks category, as follows: 
1. Fragile sling ropes 
2. The rope is not fitted correctly 
3. Line of Fire 
4. Equipment falls while being moved 
5. Line of Fire, drop object  
6. Heavy loaded truck, crushed cable, cable snagged 
7. Slip, trip, fall 
8. Crane not suitable for load 
9. Surface conditions of the lowering area unstable 
Each activity with these potential hazards must be monitored thoroughly, with implementing the preventive action 
proposed in Table 7 and Table 8. 
 
6. Conclusion  
By conducting a risk assessment using the JSA method, which refers to AS/NZS 4360:2004, it was found that there 
are two risks that categorized as extreme risk in the logistics activities, which is associated with moving a container 
2195","Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

onto a truck using a crane and lifting containers with a crane. Therefore, companies must focus more on these two 
activities to prevent extreme impacts. As stricter preventive actions are implemented, the expected severity and 
occurrence should approach 0 or 1, although some risk will always remain. Therefore, the HSE manager and team are 
tasked with identifying, mitigating, and training workers to work more safely. However, immediate safety at work 
depends entirely on workers' compliance with SOPs and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.

Abstract 
This study examined the variables that contributed to project delays, including endogenous and exogenous factors, 
specifically the road infrastructure projects supervised by the Department of Public Works and Highways Isabela 
4th District Engineering Office. It aimed to provide valuable insights for the creation of mitigation plans intended 
to reduce delays in road construction projects. The paper utilized a qualitative research methodology, collecting 
data from project managers, engineers, and inspectors through quantitative questionnaires. It employed rank 
correlation and severity indexes to analyze the data and identified 46 potential causes of delay for endogenous 
factors and 7 potential causes of delay for exogenous factors. The top 3 endogenous factors were (1) Insufficient 
laborers, (2) Shortage of equipment, and (3) Low labor productivity, and the top 2 exogenous factors were (1) 
Weather conditions and (2) Political Situation. The survey revealed a moderate level of agreement (51.07%) 
between the implementing office and contractors regarding endogenous factors. There were no correlation 
(57.14%) amongst the exogenous factors. The recommendations included developing comprehensive plans and 
schedules for both wet and dry seasons, ensuring adequate personnel, improving equipment management, 
enhancing worker productivity, conducting thorough surveys, and complying with all legal and regulatory 
requirements in restricted areas.

1. Introduction
By establishing essential transportation links between regions, road construction plays a significant role in the 
development of road networks in a municipality and a city. The government have increased budget allocations for 
road infrastructure projects, thus prioritizing the ""Build! Build! Build!"" program. This initiative was initiated by 
the previous Duterte administration and is presently being implemented by President Marcos Jr. 
One of the six congressional districts of the Philippines is the province of Isabela. The 4th Congressional District 
of Isabela has representatives in the House of Representatives since 1987. It includes the independent City of 
Santiago and the municipalities of Cordon, Dinapigue, Jones, and San Agustin. Moreover, the Department of 
Public Works and Highways Isabela 4th District Engineering Office, which is responsible for road construction 
and maintenance in the district, oversees the Isabela 6th Congressional District. The Isabela 6th Congressional 
District, represented in the House of Representatives since 2019, comprises the City of Cauayan and the

between the government and contractors. To reduce monopolistic markets, concentrate on specialized services 
that might not be the monopoly's focus, such as creating environmentally friendly roads, using cutting-edge 
materials, or utilizing cutting-edge technologies. Limiting fuel consumption, stabilizing material costs, and 
averting unanticipated price shocks from fluctuations in oil prices can all be achieved by reevaluating the project's 
budget, devising cost-cutting strategies, and establishing long-term contracts with suppliers to set pricing and keep 
costs steady. Including provisions that allow pricing adjustments in response to exchange rate variations can also 
help reduce financial risks. 
 
4. Conclusion 
a) Ranking of Endogenous Factor-Related Delays 
The ranking of endogenous factors associated with construction delays indicates that the availability of resources, 
including staff and equipment, effective management and coordination, and timely decision-making by the owner 
are the most critical areas to address to mitigate delays. The key priorities should be making sure there are enough 
resources, enhancing the planning and coordination procedures, and preserving excellent communication amongst 
all stakeholders, as technical and design challenges are also significant. By addressing these main criteria, 
construction projects may be completed more quickly and with more success. 
 
b) Ranking of Exogenous Factor-Related Delays 
External factors highlight a variety of reasons for delays, the most notable of which are weather and political 
circumstances. Knowing these rankings aids in the prioritization of risk management techniques, with an emphasis 
on minimizing delays by mitigating the risks that are listed highest. 
 
c) Ranking of Severity of the Endogenous Factor-Related Delays Based on Implementing Office 
The most crucial delays were determined to be those caused by endogenous factors, which included insufficient 
equipment and vehicles for the work, low labor productivity, and a shortage of equipment. The impact level of 
these delays was considerable. The DPWH Isabela 4th District Engineering Office is responsible for managing 
and supervising several road development projects. Contractors frequently operate on several projects at once, so 
they might allocate equipment and cars to the most important one. In addition, most construction workers are from 
rural areas, such as hills and sitios. These individuals relocate to the city in search of employment, frequently 
taking on roles that are beneath their skill level. On occasion, road development projects in remote locations 
require construction companies to hire local laborers as temporary workers; many of these workers lack formal 
training or construction work experience. Moreover, most contracting businesses in the DPWH Isabela 4th District 
Engineering Office are tiny and fall between the Small A and Medium A license categories. Because of this, many 
of these businesses must rent construction equipment when needed because they lack the necessary equipment. 
There is a high demand for the equipment during periods of building, which leads to a shortage and inadequate 
upkeep. The project is delayed because of the equipment failure brought about by this shortage of equipment. 
Although these issues are mostly under control, they serve as reminders of how important it is to manage 
equipment, train staff, and allocate resources sensibly. 
 
d) Ranking of Severity of the Exogenous Factor-Related Delays Based on Implementing Office 
Under exogenous factors, weather conditions proved to be the primary source of delay. These may put workers' 
safety in jeopardy and force a halt to construction operations. For instance, prolonged, intense rains can result in 
damage as well as other issues like equipment failure, road closures, and structural collapses. These are not under 
the implementing office's control, but they have a major effect on project durations. 
 
e) Ranking of Severity of the Endogenous Factor-Related Delays Based on Contractors 
Endogenous factors showed that, according to contractors, the two main reasons for delays are unreasonable 
project timelines and insufficient laborers. The DPWH Isabela 4th District Engineering Office's planning 
engineers scheduled and determined the project's duration based on the project's scope of work and their estimated 
hourly output in accordance with the DPWH Standards and Specifications; some of these may be too short and 
could be the cause of an unrealistic work program issue. In addition, skilled labor is currently in short supply in 
the construction industry. Despite the rising demand for their services, several firms are experiencing a labor 
shortage, and some contractors are not recruiting enough people. 
 
f) 
Ranking of Severity of the Exogenous Factor-Related Delays Based on Contractors 
Weather conditions were determined to be the most serious cause of exogenous factor-related delays based on 
contractors. While this isn't always the case, contractors' subpar project management practices usually contribute 
to these delays. Contractors need to prioritize and expedite their work because Isabela Province may have 
unexpected weather for a lengthy period. All year long, there is a considerable amount of rainfall in the eastern 
2211","Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

and coastal regions. However, weather is a known concern in building projects, especially those involving roads 
and highways that are vulnerable to outside influences. 
g)
Overall Impact Level of the Endogenous Factor-Related Delays
Based on the examination of 46 endogenous factors, it can be concluded that resource constraints, poor project 
management, and logistical difficulties are the main reasons behind building project delays. By addressing those 
crucial areas, building project delays can be minimized and project outcomes can be greatly improved. 
h)
Overall Impact Level of the Exogenous Factor-Related Delays
Rapidly expanding districts, such as the Isabela Fourth and Isabela Sixth Districts of Isabela, must find a
balance between the construction of road infrastructure and responding to weather-related emergencies.
Ignoring these worries is not a feasible option. However, neither endogenous nor external elements should be
able to impede the growth of road infrastructure projects. Instead, it should promote greater flexibility.
i)
Rank Correlation
According to the study's findings, implementing offices and contractors have a moderate understanding of
how to rank endogenous factors-related delay causes in road infrastructure projects. A Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient of 0.5107, which is higher than the crucial value, suggests this. However, because it is
below the crucial value, the correlation coefficient of 0.5714 for exogenous factors-related delay causes
indicates that there is a negligible agreement or correlation between the two groups. The study's findings lend
credibility to the conclusions, which point to differences in viewpoints regarding exogenous factors yet a
reasonable consensus regarding endogenous factors-related delay causes.
j)
Mitigation Action for Endogenous and Exogenous Factor-Related Delays
To effectively mitigate delays in road construction projects, a mitigation plan was made in terms of endogenous 
factors and exogenous factors. It is expected that all parties involved take responsibility for the implementation 
of these strategies and consistently monitor the project using defined Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to ensure 
timely completion and cost control.

Abstract 
Human Factors and Ergonomics (HF/E) is increasingly recognized for its potential to enhance creative performance 
across various organizational contexts, including small and medium-sized enterprises and large corporations. This 
study aims to determine how HF/E dimensions—organizational, physical, cognitive, and environmental—support and 
enhance innovative capacity across creative and non-creative sectors. Through a systematic content analysis of 219 
articles published between 2020 and 2024, we explore the breadth of ergonomic interventions and their interactions 
with creative thinking. Methodologically, a thorough screening process was conducted to extract relevant themes, 
classify HF/E elements, and identify patterns across industry settings. The data were then organized across HF/E 
dimensions, and each category was evaluated based on its impact on collaborative culture, user interface design, risk 
reduction, and idea generation. The results reveal that organizational ergonomics often foster leadership commitment 
and employee empowerment, physical interventions reduce tension while enhancing creative potential, and cognitive 
ergonomics enhance mental clarity for innovation. Environmental factors like layout and lighting further facilitate 
collaborative ideation, while combined approaches consistently produce the most substantial results. Integrated HF/E 
applications significantly improve creative performance, although the impact varies by industry and type of 
organization. Constrained by limited resources, SMEs tend to focus on cost-effective ergonomic improvements, while 
large companies leverage sophisticated HF/E strategies. These findings underscore the importance of integrating HF/E 
holistically to sustain creativity and productivity. Overall, this study highlights how tailored ergonomic strategies can 
improve employee well-being and innovative outcomes, suggesting that HF/E is viewed as a fundamental pillar in 
future organizational development programs.

Abstract 
Many engineering systems face various natural and manmade hazards, whose occurrences can significantly disrupt 
system operations. The task of assessing how such systems perform under multiple hazards becomes especially 
challenging when hazards recur stochastically and influence one another in a dynamic manner. In this paper, we 
propose an analytical approach to model multiple dependent hazards, and use this model to quantify a system’s 
multimodal performance (expressed as availability) and its resilience. Specifically, we derive the joint distribution for 
the hazards’ occurrence and severity over time, then link that distribution to system degradation and recovery 
processes, ultimately determining the system’s multimodal availability. By applying this method to the IEEE 9-bus 
modified test system as an approximation of the Western System Coordinating Council (WSCC) in the United States, 
we illustrate both the effectiveness and the practical relevance of our proposed approach to system performance 
evaluation.

1. Introduction
Over the first two decades of the twenty-first century, large-scale critical systems have proliferated across numerous 
sectors. Any disruption or damage to these systems can have severe consequences for public health and a nation’s 
economic stability. Besides the inherent failures a system may encounter—addressed through reliability analyses and 
preventive maintenance—external hazards, both natural and manmade, pose significant threats to overall 
functionality. Unlike inherent failures, these external hazards call for the use of resilience as an evaluation metric. 
Moreover, in many parts of the world, risks often involve multiple hazards simultaneously, amplifying the need for 
research into multi-hazard resilience. 
In this paper, we model the multi-hazard resilience of an engineered system subject to recurrent hazards with 
interdependency. The three research objectives of this paper are listed as follows: characterization of the hazards that

We can see that as time progresses, under dependent hazards, hazards occur continuously due to their interdependency. 
Consequently, unlike a typical one-time hazard, neither resilience nor performance can return to their pre-disruption 
levels. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper presents an analytical framework for assessing both performance (interpreted here as availability) and 
resilience in systems subject to dependent, recurring random hazards. Our approach begins by providing a quantitative 
description of each hazard’s occurrence frequency and severity, recognizing that one hazard can elevate another’s 
likelihood (and impact) when they occur concurrently. We derive the joint distribution for hazard occurrence times 
and severities for all hazards relevant to the system. Building on this characterization, we then model how the system’s 
performance degrades and recovers in the presence of these hazards, leading to a time-varying, multimodal depiction 
of system availability. We further define several resilience measures—namely, instantaneous, overall, and average 
resilience—that rely on availability to capture system performance, robustness, and recovery capabilities. The 
accuracy and practical utility of these proposed availability and resilience formulations are corroborated by both 
simulation and numerical case studies.

Abstract 
Engineering systems are frequently exposed to a variety of natural and human-made hazards, which can significantly 
disrupt their operations. Assessing system performance under these recurrent hazards is challenging, especially when 
these events occur stochastically and influence each other dynamically. In this paper, we introduce an analytical 
method to model such hazards and use it to evaluate the system’s multimodal performance, specifically its availability, 
and resilience. We derive the joint distribution of hazard occurrences and severities over time, and connect this 
distribution to system degradation and recovery processes to ultimately determine the system’s multimodal 
availability. A simulation study is conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed model.

1. Introduction
Throughout the first two decades of the twenty-first century, critical large-scale systems have expanded across 
multiple sectors. Any disruption or damage to these systems can have serious implications for public health and 
economic stability. While inherent system failures are typically addressed through reliability analysis and preventive 
maintenance, external hazards—both natural and manmade—pose significant risks to system functionality. These 
external hazards require resilience to be used as an evaluation metric, in contrast to inherent failures. Additionally, in 
many parts of the world, risks often involve multiple concurrent hazards, highlighting the importance of research into 
multi-hazard resilience. In this paper, we focus on modeling the multi-hazard resilience of an engineered system that 
faces recurrent and interdependent hazards. The three main research objectives are: identifying the hazards that 
threaten normal system operations, modeling how the system performs under these hazards, and quantifying the 
system's resilience based on its performance. 
2. Literature Review
To date, numerous studies have focused on the resilience modeling of engineered systems exposed to multiple hazards. 
These studies cover various aspects, including hazard characterization, system performance under multiple hazards, 
and resilience modeling in such contexts. A brief review of this body of work is provided below.

We can observe that the curves produced by the simulation model and the theoretical model are quite close, which 
demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed model. 
 
7. Conclusions 
In this paper, we analytically investigate the performance (i.e., availability) and resilience of systems under dependent 
random hazards with recurrence. First, we quantitatively characterize hazards’ occurrence frequency and severity, 
considering that their occurrence frequency (and severity) can be increased (and amplified) by their dependent hazards. 
We obtain the joint distribution of the occurrence time and severity of all hazards that pose threats to the system. 
Based on the hazards characterization, we investigate system performance degradation and recovery processes under 
the hazards and accordingly, obtain system multimodal availability across time. We then employ availability as system 
overall performance and model the instantaneous resilience of the system. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed 
method are verified by a simulation study and a numerical case.

Abstract 
Many one-shot units are often stored for extended periods before their single use, during which they may experience 
on-shelf degradation and failure. To ensure these units perform reliably when needed, timely inspections and 
maintenance are essential. However, inspecting and maintaining every stored unit in full detail can be economically 
prohibitive. In this study, we propose a joint sampling, inspection and maintenance (SIM) plans tailored for 
heterogeneous one-shot units. Rather than examining every unit, our approach involves inspecting a selected sample 
to assess overall performance, followed by an imperfect maintenance process. The optimal SIM plan seeks to balance 
the availability of reliable one-shot units with the efficient use of SIM resources under various scenarios. This is 
achieved by determining (i) the criteria for selecting inspection samples and (ii) the appropriate maintenance and 
restoration thresholds for the products. A numerical example based on a type of airbag is provided to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed SIM plans, along with recommendations for the SIM scenarios best suited to different 
circumstances.

1. Introduction
One-shot products, such as airbags and sealed lead acid batteries, are often stored for long durations before their sole 
intended use (Cheng and Elsayed, 2018, Cheng and Elsayed, 2017). Over time, these items can experience gradual 
deterioration—stemming from factors like aging, chemical reactions, corrosion, and thermal fatigue—which may 
impair their performance when they are finally deployed. For instance, a sealed lead acid battery might slowly self-
discharge and suffer corrosion at its metal contacts during storage, thereby reducing its effectiveness. Likewise, safety 
devices held in standby, such as airbags, are vulnerable to environmental stresses. In one notable case, moisture 
infiltrated an airbag’s inflator during storage, inducing thermal fluctuations that weakened its structural integrity and 
ultimately led to a deployment that released hazardous metal fragments. 
To ensure that these one-shot units perform as required when activated, engineers advocate for periodic performance 
evaluations and maintenance throughout the storage period. However, given the continuous production and

 
When the sampling sizes can vary across inspections, the optimal solution yields a preventive maintenance 
threshold for the second failure mode of 53. Specifically, 1, 3, and 5 samples are drawn in three successive 
inspections for failure mode 1, while 3, 5, and 6 samples are drawn in three successive inspections for failure 
mode 2, leading to a total availability of 1432.  
 
These results demonstrate that the SIM approach proposed in this study effectively balances sampling thoroughness 
across different inspection actions and optimizes resource allocation, thereby enhancing the average unit availability 
of one-shot units over a specified period. Furthermore, we observe that when sampling sizes are allowed to vary across 
inspections, the optimal preventive maintenance thresholds are higher, and the average availability of the one-shot 
units is correspondingly increased. This finding indicates that the proposed maintenance policy enables a more precise 
and strategically nuanced control of the maintenance process, thereby effectively enhancing system performance under 
variable inspection conditions. 
 
5. Conclusions 
In this study, we propose and develop a series of optimal SIM plans for one-shot units that are stored for extended 
periods and subjected to competing failure modes. The inherent heterogeneity of these units—reflected in variations 
in age, inspection history, and maintenance conditions—arises from continuous production and the repeated execution 
of SIM actions, thereby complicating the design of effective maintenance strategies. The proposed SIM plans are 
formulated to optimally allocate limited inspection and maintenance resources (for example, by minimizing the total 
number of inspections at an acceptable cost) while ensuring that the reliability metrics of the one-shot units are 
maintained at a desired level. Our numerical analysis investigates performance of the optimal SIM plans and its 
superiority over other alternatives.

Abstract 
Protective components are commonly found in systems where failure propagation can occur. When these protective 
components are also subject to failure, inspection and maintenance (IM) policy for both the core components (which 
directly contribute to the system’s performance), and the protective components must be designed separately. The 
challenge arises when failure propagation happens only in certain failure modes of the components, which have not 
been extensively studied yet. In this paper, we propose an optimal hybrid IM policy for such a system. First, we 
develop a novel hybrid IM policy that outperforms some existing IM schemes. Based on this policy, the system state 
transitions are modeled by the Markov regenerative process (MRGP) framework and its steady-state behavior is 
analytically obtained. Next, we quantitatively model the system’s long-term profit rate. A case study of a community 
power distribution system is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid IM policy.

1. Introduction
The advancement of technology has enabled the creation of multi-component systems, where components are 
configured to work together to provide the desired functionality. During operation, these components are subject to 
failure. In some cases, the failure of one component can lead to a chain reaction, causing failures in other components, 
which may result in significant economic losses. To mitigate this risk, protective components are implemented to 
prevent failure propagation, such as relays in power systems, thermal management modules in battery systems, and 
dynamic routing subsystems in computer networks. For instance, in a power distribution system, generators, feeder 
lines, and transformers are subject to both gradual deterioration (like cable aging and insulation degradation) and 
sudden failures (such as open circuits or short circuits). Among these, a short-circuit failure can quickly spread to 
other components. To prevent such propagation, protective relays are used to detect short circuit conditions and 
immediately isolate the affected sections by triggering circuit breakers. However, these protective components are not 
immune to failure themselves. As a result, operators must ensure proper inspection and maintenance (IM) actions are 
taken for both core and protective components. In systems where revenue generation is performance-based, with the 
goal of maximizing profit, it is crucial for IM actions to strike a balance between revenue and maintenance costs. This

It can be observed that the optimal long-run profit rate increases as the failure propagation probability decreases. In 
addition, when the failure propagation probability is reduced, (i) the interval between minor inspections increases, and 
(ii) the maintenance threshold for feeder lines decreases. This is because a lower propagation probability reduces the 
likelihood of a failure spreading from a feeder line to a transformer, and since feeder lines are more likely to fail when 
they are in a lower state, a more aggressive maintenance strategy for feeder lines becomes feasible. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In this study, we design an optimal hybrid IM policy for a multi-component system consisting of core components 
that are subject to both deterioration-induced and sudden failures, with the sudden failures potentially propagating 
between core components. Additionally, the system includes a protective component that can prevent failure 
propagation when it is functioning properly. We propose a hybrid IM policy that involves two inspection schemes: a 
major inspection triggered when the system performance drops below a specific threshold, and a minor inspection 
scheduled for the protective component after a certain period following its last inspection. The system's long-term 
profit rate under the proposed IM policies is modeled by the MRGP framework. The influence of the protective 
component’s IM policy on the system’s profit rate is quantitatively analyzed.

Abstract 
Hybrid manufacturing in this research is a process that combines additive and subtractive manufacturing in the same 
equipment. The integration of various manufacturing processes into a single process has been the subject of this study. 
The goal is to reduce the amount of space, time, cost and labour required for production. While much hybrid 
manufacturing research has concentrated on expensive and high-level decision-making activities like service 
composition and scheduling, the link between field-level manufacturing data and the cloud manufacturing platform 
has yet to be developed. The development of cloud manufacturing systems is hampered by the inefficiency of data 
gathering, communication, storage, query, and analysis of field-level manufacturing equipment. In order to solve this 
difficulty, this research will analyze the use of developing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies in a cloud 
manufacturing system. Based on a general system architecture of IIoT-supported cloud manufacturing system offer a 
service-oriented plug-and-play (PnP) IIoT gateway solution. Manufacturing equipment service-oriented data schemas 
are being created to capture just-enough data about field-level manufacturing equipment and allow for efficient data 
storage and query in a cloud time-series database (TSDB). Through the practical deployment of IIoT gateways on a 
3D printer and laser marking tool, the feasibility and benefits of the suggested solution as a framework result with 
overall production nearly 30% reduction. According to findings by using PnP IIoT technologies to connect field-level 
manufacturing equipment to a cloud platform, purposefully built service-oriented data schemas that capture the critical 
information for high-level hybrid manufacturing decision-making are a solid solution. Finally, this can be increased 
productivity of making components by using low cost hybrid 3D printing process which can support the digital 
manufacturing integration approach in the future.

Abstract 
Effective cooling is essential for maintaining the performance, reliability, and energy efficiency of server systems. 
However, optimizing airflow parameters to achieve efficient thermal management is often constrained by the high 
computational cost of iterative simulations. This paper presents an intelligent decision-support framework that 
integrates Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with numerical optimization to dynamically refine airflow 
properties, ensuring efficient cooling while minimizing energy consumption. The framework employs the L-BFGS-B 
algorithm to iteratively adjust inlet velocity within predefined constraints, efficiently converging to an optimal cooling 
configuration without the need for exhaustive CFD simulations. By leveraging optimization-driven adjustments, the 
system reduces computational overhead while maintaining accuracy, making it a practical approach for real-world 
applications. The framework operates autonomously, reducing the need for manual tuning and accelerating decision-
making in server cooling design. Beyond improving cooling performance, this approach demonstrates the broader 
potential of intelligent optimization in engineering workflows. The integration of CFD with data-driven decision-
making enhances adaptability, streamlines design cycles, and supports real-time adjustments to operational conditions. 
The results highlight how automated optimization can significantly improve thermal management strategies in data 
centers and other thermally constrained environments, offering a scalable, computationally efficient solution for 
intelligent airflow control.

1. Introduction
Chatbots are often used as a tool to reduce engineering effort. Python chatbots offer interactive software programs that 
leverage natural language processing (NLP) as stated by Ortiz-Garces (2024) to facilitate human-computer 
interactions through text or voice-based communication. These chatbots, built using Python's robust programming 
ecosystem, have become a key tool in a variety of industries, including customer service, healthcare, and education. 
However, their utility extends beyond conventional applications into the engineering domain, particularly in assisting 
with complex computational tasks such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). 
1.1 Artificial Intelligence Chatbots 
Python's versatility, paired with its numerous libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and TensorFlow for NLP, allows for the 
creation of intelligent chatbots capable of understanding technical queries and providing detailed, context-aware 
responses (Chakraborty 2023).  Furthermore, Python's integration with scientific computing libraries such as NumPy, 
SciPy, and CFD-specific tools like Ansys or Abaqus, enables chatbots to act as an interface between engineers and 
computational models, streamlining workflows and enhancing efficiency.

of regression models remains a critical challenge, requiring careful validation against actual CFD results to maintain 
reliability. 
The implications of this research extend beyond server cooling applications. The integration of CFD with AI-driven 
optimization has the potential to improve thermal management across various industries, including data centers, 
aerospace, and industrial HVAC systems. Future work will focus on refining regression-based predictive models, 
expanding the chatbot’s adaptability to different cooling environments, and exploring reinforcement learning 
techniques to enhance optimization robustness under dynamic conditions. By combining intelligent decision support 
with CFD-driven optimization, this study contributes to the development of smarter, more energy-efficient cooling 
strategies for thermally constrained environments.

Abstract 
Pressure vessels play a pivotal role in numerous industrial applications, as they are engineered to contain fluids or 
gases at pressures significantly above atmospheric levels. Ensuring their safety and efficiency is critical across sectors 
such as chemical processing, aerospace, and oil and gas. Over centuries, pressure vessel designs have evolved from 
simple forms in the 15th century to sophisticated constructions governed by the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel 
Code, established in 1911. However, pressure vessel failures still pose substantial risks, primarily due to issues like 
corrosion, fatigue, and inadequate maintenance protocols. The selection of suitable materials is fundamental to 
pressure vessel safety, emphasizing the ""leak-before-break"" criterion to prevent catastrophic failures. Materials such 
as carbon steel and stainless steel are often preferred for their ability to withstand mechanical stress and temperature 
fluctuations. Using the CES EduPack software, this study provides a structured approach to identifying appropriate 
materials and manufacturing techniques, focusing on attributes such as yield strength, fracture toughness, and 
corrosion resistance. Stainless Steel AISI 304, an austenitic and half-hard alloy, emerged as the optimal material due 
to its excellent balance of structural integrity and resistance to environmental degradation. Additionally, Manual Metal 
Arc (MMA) welding was selected as the most versatile and economical manufacturing method, suited to manage

Among various processes, Manual Metal Arc (MMA) welding offers the widest range of manufactural thicknesses 
and accommodates a broad spectrum of tolerances as shown in Figure 6. 
 
Manual Metal Arc (MMA) welding is highly suitable for pressure vessel manufacturing due to its flexibility and 
cost-effectiveness. This process, also known as shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), uses a flux-coated electrode to 
create an electric arc that joins metals. It is capable of handling a wide range of material thicknesses from 1.5 mm to 
300 mm, which is crucial for pressure vessels requiring different wall thicknesses. The process achieves tolerances 
of 0.8 mm to 5 mm, suitable for most applications. 
 
MMA welding works with various metals, including carbon steels, stainless steels, and certain nickel alloys, and is 
effective for different joint geometries like lap, butt, and tee joints. Despite its manual nature and high labor 
intensity, MMA is economically advantageous with low setup and tooling costs. Overall, MMA welding provides a 
versatile and cost-effective solution for pressure vessel fabrication. 
 
5. Conclusion

Abstract  
 
The Oil and Gas industry, known for its complex, multi-process operations, involves handling hazardous products, 
requiring strict adherence to safety and quality protocols. This paper explores the role of Quality Control (QC) in 
facilitating the industry’s goals of operational safety, efficiency, and environmental sustainability. QC processes are 
crucial in reducing health risks, avoiding environmental hazards, and optimizing resource utilization. The research 
examines various QC segments integral to daily industry operations, including monitoring, testing, and validating 
production stages to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and internal benchmarks. Additionally, this study 
focuses on the techniques employed by QC personnel to detect and mitigate potential errors, thereby safeguarding 
both workforce well-being and the financial health of operations. The research highlights how effective QC practices 
can prevent costly shutdowns, reduce material wastage, and decrease the likelihood of contamination incidents, 
illustrating the budgetary and environmental benefits that rigorous QC protocols bring to the industry. By strictly 
adhering to legal standards governing data protection and confidentiality, this study collects and analyzes data to 
deliver findings that can guide oil and gas companies in refining their QC processes. This research is significant in 
light of growing energy demands, environmental regulations, and public scrutiny, underscoring the essential role of 
QC in achieving safe and sustainable practices. Ultimately, this paper offers in-depth insights into QC’s function 
within the energy sector, advocating for enhanced QC strategies as the foundation of industry safety, resilience, and 
environmental responsibility.

1. Introduction  
During the Industrial Revolution in the late 1800s, industries like railroads saw a huge increase in production and the 
complexity of parts. To guarantee the quality of these parts was the key to safe and efficient operations of the 
equipment. The initial ways that railroad companies adopted to ensure the quality of mechanical parts such as rails 
and carriages were very basic. They had to inspect and test the parts by hand to ensure that they were safe and of good 
quality. However, in the early twentieth century, two significant advancements were made in monitoring quality: 
scientific management by Frederick Taylor and statistical tools by Edward Deming. After the Second World War,","Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Respondents provided insights on several International Standards and Special Procedures (SP) that they believe could 
benefit from improvements in the realm of quality control. Some of the respondents mentioned that it is critical to 
note that standards and company specifications are reviewed periodically. This is important to make sure that the 
standards are still suitable to tackle the current quality control issues. Also, in particular, SP 1173 was noted as 
requiring enhancement. This Special Procedure may need to be revised to fix problems or missing aspects that 
practitioners in this area have noticed. In addition, it was suggested that quality inspection departments be located 
outside the manufacturers or suppliers. This is done to avoid compromise of the inspection process and impartiality in 
the quality evaluation. Moreover, this was an implication that British Standards and American Standards could be 
used to compare for improved practices. This suggests that benchmarking or aligning against these standards could 
result in enhanced quality control measures. 
 
5. Conclusion  
In conclusion, the evolution of mechanical quality control from its humble beginning during the Industrial Revolution 
up to the present sophisticated systems shows how important mechanical quality control is to safety and productivity 
in industries. In today’s world, many industries including oil and gas construction projects rely on sound QC systems 
for safety, productivity, and profitability. QC system is a key to long-term success, cost cutting, safety enhancement, 
and gaining the confidence of the clients and stakeholders. Measures such as defined quality standards, regular 
inspections, and tests are critical in identifying defects at the early stages, avoiding mishaps, and guaranteeing the 
highest quality of products. Non-destructive testing techniques like Penetrant Testing (PT), Ultrasonic Testing (UT), 
and Radiographic Testing (RT) enable companies to test the integrity of the materials without compromising on the 
material. However, the training and certification of quality control staff are also crucial to guarantee that all processes 
are performed efficiently and by the current best practices. Those organizations that have emphasized having a good 
quality control system not only reduce the probability of failures and expensive rectifications but also gain a 
competitive edge over other organizations by offering quality and reliable products. Also, the survey findings provide 
important information on the present situation of mechanical quality control in different industries. Some of the areas 
of concern are the requirement for improved inspection methods, improved calibration of the equipment, and improved 
documentation procedures. Solving these issues will not only enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of the quality 
control procedures but also help to minimize the occurrence of mistakes, enhance product quality, and guarantee 
conformity with the safety standards. The measures suggested based on this feedback can help companies improve 
their mechanical quality control practices and, therefore, the performance and satisfaction of companies.
