Abstract 
Landfill organic waste fraction was investigated for the potential to generate bio ethanol, a liquid bio fuel 
that can be used in place of the conventional liquid fuels. This was achieved through acid treatment 
enzymatic hydrolysis. The organic fraction waste was first pre-treated with dilute sulphuric acid at 121 °C 
for 15 minutes. Afterwards it underwent enzymatic hydrolysis at 50 °C for a period of 5 days to allow the 
release of C6 sugars. The hydrolysate was then fermented at 30 °C for 5 days with yeast inoculated as the 
bio catalyst to produce bio ethanol. Enzymatic hydrolysis and the prior pre-treatment resulted in a high 
yield of 60% of the C6 sugars. The bio ethanol produced from the fermentable sugars was 40%. There is 
potential for utilization of the organic municipal waste fraction for bio fuels production.  
Keywords: Bio ethanol, fermentation, landfill waste, organic waste fraction 
1. Introduction
In Southern Africa, huge amounts of organic waste are being generated on a daily basis and these usually find 
themselves to the landfills facility, possibly shortening the life span of landfills if not properly managed (Manyuchi et 
al., 2017). In addition, the organic fraction of the municipal waste poses a challenge for green house gases emissions 
if left to rot, effectively resulting in climate change effects (Matsakas et al., 2014). The organic fraction of the 
municipal waste is a potential raw material for production of solids and liquid bio fuels such as biomass briquettes, 
biogas, bio hydrogen, bio diesel and bio ethanol (Saka et al., 2012; Shruti at el., 2016). Figure 1 shows the bio 
conversion potential of the organic fraction of landfill waste to bio fuels.

4. Conclusion  
The organic fraction of the municipal waste from the landfills is a potential raw material for bio ethanol production 
which can be used as a substitute to the conventional fuels. The organic fraction was hydrolyzed to simple C6 sugars 
to achieve a yield of 60%. These sugars were allowed to ferment in the presence of yeast and a 50% yield of bio 
ethanol was achieved. The concentration of the bio ethanol was increased to 95% through the process of distillation.

Abstract 
In this present study, Jatropha Carcus cake, a by product from the bio diesel production process was 
destabilization through vermicomposting to produce bio fertilizers. Jatropha Curcas cake was 
vermicomposted over a period 30 days using Eisenia Fetida earthworms. The nitrogen, phosphorous 
and potassium (NPK) content in the cake was continuously monitored using AOAC methods and the 
same was done for the leachate (vermiwash) produced during the vermicomposting process. The NPK 
content in the Jatropha Curcas cake increased with increase in the vermicomposting period with a 
35% increase in N, 58% increase in P and a 98% increase in K. Furthermore, the vermiwash produced 
had an NPK with a composition of 2.1%, 0.75% and 0.51% respectively. The bio stabilization of the 
Jatropha Curcas cake through vermicomposting to bio fertilizers.

1. Introduction
The vermicomposting technology is increasingly becoming popular as a bio waste management initiative 
(Mistry et al., 2015). During vermicomposting, earthworms feed on the bio waste acting as the bio reactor 
whereby the bio waste is converted to vermicasts which are the faecal matter of the earthworms and are rich in 
nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium as well as other trace elements required for plant growth (Atiyeh et al., 
2000). As the vermicomposting process takes place, a leachate which is termed vermiwash is produced from the 
earthworms’ urine and other excreta (Benitez et al., 1999). This vermiwash is also rich in NPK and is applicable 
as a liquid bio fertilizer as well as foliar spray (Benitez et al., 1999).  
On the other side, in most developing countries like Zimbabwe, the Jatropha plant has been identified and is 
being explored as a raw material for bio diesel production (Patidar et al., 2013). From the bio diesel production 
process, Jatropha Curcas cake is produced as a waste by product and is considered contaminated (Patidar et al., 
2013). Jatropha Curcas cake is reported to be rich in nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium composition which 
makes it an attractive alternative raw material for vermicomposting (Patidar et al., 2013; Eroa, 2015; Elbl et al., 
2016).  From previous studies it was reported that the nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (NPK) content in 
the Jatropha Curcas was 4.44%, 2.09% and 1.68% respectively. In this study the potential for value adding the

From the observed trends, it can be noted that as the vermicomposting period increases, the composition of the 
NPK also increased. A summary of the Jatropha Curcas cake before and after vermicomposting is shown in

The vermiwash that was collected during the bio stabilization of the Jatropha Curcas cake was rich in NPK with 
a composition of 2.1%, 0.75% and 0.51% respectively and could be used as a liquid bio fertilizer. Previous 
studies by Benitez et al. (1999) also reported the same results and trend in NPK for vermiwash that was 
collected during vermicomposting. A summary of the Jatropha Curcas cake vermiwash is given in Table 3.

Vermicomposting of Jatropha Curcas cake provides an opportunity for waste management of Jatropha cake at 
the same time producing bio fertilizers. Vermicompost with an NPK composition of 6.30%, 4.27% and 3.30% 
respectively. Increasing the vermicomposting period also increased the quality of the nutrient composition of the 
vermicompost. In addition, the vermiwash produced as leachate from the vermicomposting of the Jatropha 
Curcas cake was rich in NPK with a composition of 2.1%, 0.75% and 0.51% respectively.

Abstract 
The brewery industry is one of the major industries in Zimbabwe and the following study was 
conducted to assess the techno-economic feasibility of reuse of wastewater after treatment using the 
biofilm that forms on the bio carriers. The malting plant of a certain brewing plant uses up to 350000 
cubic meters water a year discharging about 75% of the biologically contaminated water as effluent 
which is discharged into the ecosystem. A biological water treatment approach was done using a 
moving bed biofilm reactor, with use of Mutag biochips. The treatment resulted in 93% BOD
reduction, 87.9% COD reduction, 48% TSS reduction, 44% TDS reduction and a 97.8% increase in 
DO at a treatment period of 24 hours. An economic analysis was done with a payback period of 2.09 
years and return on investment of 49% indicating the techno-economic viability of brewery 
wastewater.

1. Introduction
Zimbabwean industries are characterized by outdated water treatment methods, some that are becoming less 
effective due to introduction of modern era chemicals and techniques to the industrial processes. There is 
therefore a call to adopt modern methods of effluent treatment, which are cost effective and efficient in treating 
water such as the moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) which has the potential to treat wastewater with high 
organic pollutants (Dong et al., 2011; Borka et al., 2013; Burghate and Ingole., 2013). For example the beverage 
industries incur huge costs in acquiring fresh water from the city council of which the costs can be cut down by 
means of setting up a water treatment plant that treats the water to the standard of fresh water that it can be used 
in the plant itself. Water recycling is not only economical but also human and ecologically ethical. The brewery 
malting plant of a certain brewing plant uses up to 350000 cubic meters of fresh water a year (converting to

5.4 Financial Indicators 
The payback period which is calculated as the ratio between total capital investment and the profit 
was (292837.09/ 140000.01) 2. 09 years. The return on investment which is calculated as the ratio 
between profit and the total capital investment was 49%.  
Using on the cost-volume-profit (CVP) formula: px = vx + FC + Profit, p is the savings per unit which 
is equal to US$0.77 whilst x is the number of units which is 180000 m3. Whereas v is the variable cost 
per unit with the value of US$82000/180000 which equals to US$0.45 and FC is the total fixed cost 
which equals to US$292837. But at breakeven we assume the profit will be zero, so the equation can 
be written as px = vx + FC. Breakeven point is reached after producing 250288.1 m3 of clean brewery 
effluent (Figure 3). ESIGNIG OF AY

6. Conclusion 
The biofilm carriers effectively treat brewery wastewater to meet the set standards for effluent disposal. A 
reduction of at least 44% was achieved for the BOD, TSS, TDS, EC and COD. An economic assessment for 
application of the technology in the in the brewery industry wastewater at small scale indicated its viability with 
a payback period of 2 years and internal rate of return of 49%.

Abstract 
The measure of ambulance cycle time is of particular interest in the performance of Emergency Medical Systems (EMS). Its 
value determines the ambulance capacity of the operations system of an EMS institution. For a given number of ambulances 
in operation, as the value of the average ambulance cycle time increases, total ambulance capacity for the system is reduced. 
Additional impacts resulting from this situation are; an increase on the average ambulance response time and patient´s health 
risk due to the unavailability of ambulances; and a greater need of ambulance replacement investment requirements and 
operating cost. This work suggests an improvement approach based on Theory of Constraints (TOC) and elimination of waste 
for reducing ambulance cycle time. The approach is applied to a Mexican EMS institution based on metropolitan Monterrey. 
Results of the application are provided.

Introduction
The fundamental responsibilities of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems are to provide urgent medical care, such as 
pre-hospital care, and to transport the patient to the hospital if needed. The efﬁciency of EMS systems is a major public 
concern.  
According to Fitch, et al., (2015), EMS systems are to provide urgent medical care, such as pre-hospital care, and to 
transport the patient to the hospital if needed. The activities involved are: 
-
Receive emergency call and an ambulance is assigned.
-
Ambulance preparation.
-
Transporting the ambulance to the emergency scene.
-
Serving the injured or sick person until he is stabilized.
-
Transfer the customer to a health institution.
-
Delivering the customer to the health institution.
-
Transportation back to ambulance base.
The activities previously described are part of the ambulance cycle. According to Blackwell, et al., (2009), the provision of 
optimal emergency medical services care in the pre-hospital environment requires a high level of coordination and integration 
of multiple operational and clinical resources utilized by many people located at different places. Activities such as call 
taking and dispatching, scene response, on-scene patient care, triage and hospital destination decisions, continuing care 
during transport, and transfer to definitive care are all subject to online and off-line medical direction and guidance. The level 
of performance of this process is determined by the adequate management of all these elements.  
Two of the most important performance indicators for EMS institutions; the agility required to execute the process; and its 
efficiency (operations cost).  The level of agility is measured by various time indicators; Paramedic response time; ambulance

Abstract 
Traditional inventory models do not take into account various circumstances that are unique to a 
retail setting. The purpose of this study is to high light one such issue, namely, inventory 
management of slow moving items. The impact of all these decisions led the company to hold 
inventory levels of about 30 days on average with replenishment cycles of seven days. This work 
describes the efforts of the company to decrease inventory levels through the application of concepts 
associated to the forecasting and the impact of pack sizes for slow moving items. Results of the pilot 
studies of implementing the suggested initiatives are provided.

According to Kotler et al., (2003), the concept of retailing includes all activities involving the sale of goods or 
services for individual consumption (and which it is not for commercial purposes). In other words, retailing can be 
seen when retailers purchase products from a dealer and sell it again to other users (Nilsson, et al., 1987). The 
traditional approach to retailing states that whenever a customer need arises, retailers used to serve final customers 
from the stored inventory that they purchased based on forecasted data. Different categories of retailing are 
described in Kotzab (2005). These are Non store retailing (general mail-order, specialist mail-order, electronic 
commerce, etc), Store based retailing (retail stores, general merchandise retail stores, supermarkets, departments 
stores, discount stores, etc). Other types of store based retailing that have been discussed in literature are vending 
machines, kiosks, catalogue show rooms and gas stations. 
According to the Food Marketing Institute (FMI) and the Grocery Manufacturers of America (GMA), (2000), the 
convenience store (C-store) sector represented by Seven & I Holdings occupies the position 20 among the top 250 
retailing institutions in the world, as shown in Table 1. In the age of retail giants like Walmart and e-retailer 
Amazon, how do the small, corner convenience stores and bodegas compete? Food, fuel, and fast service are paving 
the way, and it all comes down to that key word: “convenience.” The National Association of Convenience Stores 
(NACS) defines a convenience store as: “a retail business with primary emphasis on providing the public a 
convenient location to quickly purchase from a wide array of consumable products (predominantly food or food and 
motor fuels) and services. The average convenience store is a mere 2,744 square feet, yet it serves as a one-stop 
destination for food, refreshments, tobacco products, motor fuels, and a wide variety of other items (NACS). 7-
Eleven is the leading convenience store throughout the United States and Canada, followed by Circle K and 
Speedway stores (http://www.mechtron.com/blog/how-do-convenience-stores-compete/#sthash.wkHIUSEu.dpuf). 
The Mexican C-S sector was located in position 11 among the first 15 biggest world markets in year 2014 with total 
sales of 8500 million dollars. These sales were generated by 17,450 stores established throughout Mexico. The 
leading company in this sector contributed with 12,853 stores and a market share of 88% in that year. This firm will 
be called “The One” hereafter. One of the greatest challenges of C-stores to be competitive refers to inventory

incorporating an economic point of view. Thus, the total improvement on the level of inventory of the stores is 
estimated in 6.2 days. 
 
4. Conclusions and recommendations 
The level of competitiveness of the C – store retailing sector is dependent on the level of product availability at the 
store. Under these circumstances, the effectiveness with which inventory management is performed becomes very 
important. Too much is expensive, and too little implies the appearance of more frequent stockouts. 
 
The case of study treated in this paper deals with the management of inventories of C – F items for the leading 
network of C – stores in Mexico. The company was dealing with the problem of having excessive level of 
inventories in its stores in terms of days of inventory. An exhaustive analysis of the contribution to this excess was 
developed and found that the C – F categories of items were very important. Thus,  three initial initiatives were 
designed and implemented in corresponding pilot programs; modifying the forecast procedure for the items; 
changing the rounding up to case pack sizes rule and; eliminating the F items from the national catalogue of the 
company. 
 
The impact expected with the full implementation of the previous initiatives totals 6.2 days of inventory in the 
stores. This additional work is programmed to be carried out during the first semester of 2018. Further research 
work to be done will focus on the application of the ADIDA scheme for the forecasting of items A and B.

Abstract 
The development of several ambulance location models have been discussed in the academic literature. 
Most of these models have been further extended to consider more realistic situations into account and the 
use of different assessment criteria. However, there is not an exhaustive literature that takes the existing 
standard models to compare them according to the criteria used in practice. In this work, we undertake the 
task of comparing the performance of several ambulance location models on coverage and response time 
criteria. The results of this work are important to help emergency medical organizations to define their 
most adequate model for defining their ambulance base structure. The comparison of the models is carried 
out in two Mexican emergency operations of the Red Cross located in the cities of Monterrey and 
Tijuana.

Introduction 
The emergency medical services (EMS) providers are responsible of the pre-hospital care and transportation of the 
patients to a medical center. They are in charge of the first medical contact with the patient since an emergency call 
enters to a call center. The quality of these services, offered either by public or private companies, has a potential 
direct impact on the patient survival, especially when the cause of the call is a life-threatening disease (Rodriguez et 
al, 2016), and it has been of interest for OR researchers in the last four decades. 
There is a vast literature in OR approaches to solve the problems arisen in both strategic and tactical levels of the 
EMS planning process. There are several recent reviews that address them as well as identify new challenges 
(Hadiyul et al, 2018, Rodriguez et al, 2017, Reuter-Oppermann, 2017, Aringhieri et al, 2017 Ahmadi-Javid et al, 
2016, Li et al., 2011). The location of bases for ambulances is one of the strategic decisions of this EMS planning 
process. Only Reuter-Oppermann et al. (2017) refer more than 33 papers dealing with ambulance location problems 
especially in European countries such as UK, Germany and the Netherlands. However, very few studies have been 
found in LA countries (Dibene, 2017 in Mexico; Andrade et al, 2015 in Brazil; Cespedes et al, 2008 in Colombia, 
and Rodriguez et al, 2016, a review). 
One of the most common process’ performance indicator of the ambulance location problem is the response time 
(RT), which is measured since a call enters until the ambulance arrives at the patient’s location. It includes a pre-trip 
delay for triage and dispatch, and the ambulance travel time. RT is one of the five key indicators defined to monitor 
and evaluate the pre-hospital emergency care by the European Emergency Data Project (Reuter-Oppermann, 2017). 
In Tijuana, Mexico, for example, the average response time was reported to be 14 min with a standard deviation of 7 
min (Dibene et al., 2017); nevertheless the National Fire Protection Association’s recommendation is to attend a call

Conclusions 
Similar performance behavior of the three models compared in this study, the DSM, the ARTM, and the MEXCLP, 
were observed for the two Mexican cases studied: Monterrey and Tijuana. These cities are different in size, demand 
behavior and density.  It was observed that when the DSM reaches its performance limits (i.e. 100% or almost), the 
increase of ambulances does not contribute to an improvement in RT. However, this is not true the other way 
around, since the RT is always susceptible to improvement. For the ARTM, an increase in the number of 
ambulances contributes steadily to improvements in both the objective function and the coverage. 
 
It should be addressed a multi-objective approach with objective functions that promote at the same time to 
maximize coverage and minimize response times; since each model pulls the solution towards its objective function 
but does not necessarily promote an improvement in the other criteria. The MEXCLP is the model that shows a 
constant improvement with the increase of ambulances in both types of criteria (coverage and RT), but the RTs 
obtained are well above the optimal ones, which is not good. It is suggested to complement the ARTM, in a way that 
involves the backup coverage. On the other hand, the MEXCLP has a great potential for improvement if it is 
considered dynamically, so that the probability parameter that an ambulance is occupied 𝑝𝑟 is observed and taken as 
a changing value according to the time interval and the actual number of ambulances in operation.

Abstract 
The definition of the Ambulance Emergency Medical System Structure (EMSS) is an important 
issue in the healthcare sector. The EMSS consists of the number and location of ambulance bases 
required to satisfy an established service level or optimize a certain criterion. An important effort 
of academic research has been realized to determine the optimal EMSS based on the 
optimization of single objectives. However, as evidenced by the different criteria utilized in the 
vast literature developed, this issue could be discussed under several criteria simultaneously such 
as demand coverage and ambulance response time concepts. In this paper, we will undertake a 
multicriteria approach for supporting decision makers to determine their most preferred EMSS. 
This approach is applied to the Monterrey metropolitan operations of the Mexican Red Cross. 
Results of the application are provided.

Abstract 
Despite Today’s bold presence of machinery and the progress of technology in societies, human’s 
safety, and occupational health are still under the shadow of numerous hazards. In order to ensure 
sustainability, in different sectors of industries, occupational health and safety must be observed 
diligently and businesses have every reason to be concerned. It is estimated that annually 120 
million injuries, caused by work-related accidents, have led to 220 thousand death reports all over 
the world. Therefore, Precautious measures should be taken in order to protect labor force against 
unfortunate repercussions, stemmed from the hazards of the workplace. In an overall sense, 
injuries and occupational accidents, are the result of a set of unsafety (actions and conditions). 
Therefore, accidents can be decreased in rate by identification, prevention and elimination of this 
unsafety. The main purpose of this research is to propose a system dynamics model to analyze 
dynamisms of safety management systems, occupational health and accident management. Using 
such approach, and with the aid of causal feedback loops analysis and stock and flow structure, we 
can define and conceptualize complex interactions within these systems. In this approach we 
model the structure of their relationships; and lastly, simulate their dynamic behaviors. Results 
show that implementing policies related to human factor engineering and promote safety culture 
and standardization in the workplace, were the major appropriate and effective solutions which can 
have a positive effect on accidents management, they can help to develop the health and safety 
management system. Also, among these policies, both safety culture and human factor engineering 
have significant impacts on decreasing the number of accidents, but from a long-term viewpoint, 
safety culture is the most effective.

Abstract  
 
Since the building's problems in construction projects have increased, there is serious need to focus on the 
quality of building constructions industry. Even though Six Sigma has been employed in the manufacturing 
and other industries, it is quite a fairly new impression in the construction project. Therefore, a case study 
of how Six Sigma has been established in the building industry to identify problems of building projects in 
Amman. The main objectives of this case study to investigate the implementation of Six Sigma tools to 
investigate the main building's problems and the root causes of these problems. Also, the study intends to 
implement these tools to improve the performance and the efficiency of construction projects. To achieve 
this objective, the data is collected from government institutions to identify the main building problems and 
then the survey-based approach is used in order to identify the root causes of these problems. The main 
results of six sigma tools showed the main problems in building projects in Amman are excavation collapse, 
defective water proofing system at roof and bad drainage system of rainwater and lack of ventilation which 
represent 52.2% of total problems in building projects. Although the concept of using Pareto analysis and 
cause and effect diagrams have been around for a considerable period of time, the paper has successfully 
shown how can make use of these simple Six Sigma tools to find out the root causes of the problem and 
allocate resources to eliminate such problems. This study may trigger an important debate over the research and 
implementation of Six Sigma in the construction industry of developing countries that may greatly benefit by 
improving the quality of their projects. 
 
Key words: Six Sigma tools, excavation collapse, building construction. 
 
1. Introduction 
There are numerous problems associated with quality in projects constructed by international firms.  The construction 
problems refer to inaccurate design, faulty execution, and bad concrete mixtures. A lot of construction problems

4. Conclusion 
Six Sigma as a quality management practice is gaining importance in Building Construction. This study has attempted 
to contribute to the understanding of performance and implementation aspects of Six Sigma in building construction. 
This study has identified the relative importance of the causes defect influencing in Amman’s construction industry 
by applying Six Sigma. These causes of problems must be identified as early as possible so that quality can be 
improved. Six sigma tools and techniques that have been applied in this research includes Pareto, cause and effect 
diagram, check list sheet, histogram, scatter diagram. From previous analysis it can be concluded that the cause of 
excavation collapse are: improper shoring or sloping for excavation sides, materials and machinery resting 
dangerously close to excavation, poor dewatering and drainage of ground and rain water during excavation and 
Increased soil density due to the presence of wastewater sum pits .Also, it illustrates the causes lead to problems in 
water proofing system at roof and bad drainage of rainwater are neglecting cleaning of building roof, using bad quality 
of insulation materials, placing waterproofing above thermal insulation, using poor quality of concrete, and 
unqualified labor .Regarding to ventilation problems, the causes of it are Lack of adequate ventilation systems to drive 
out water vapor from wet areas such as kitchens, bathrooms and swimming pools, violation of spaces dedicated for 
ventilation purposes, inadequate location and insufficient sizing of doors and windows during the design stage, and 
bad internal design which prevents entrance of fresh air .The implementation of Six Sigma in construction project has 
resulted on fill a gap in knowledge of common problems in the construction industry, which can serve as a guide for 
contractors and construction managers for helping to achieve a competitive level of quality and a cost-effective project. 
Barriers and critical success factors for six sigma implementations in the construction industry in the Amman could 
be potential future research direction.

Abstract 
 
Purpose– This paper develops a model of a Knowledge-Based (KB) System using Lean Six 
Sigma (L6σ) principles to increase the effectiveness of healthcare organisational resources 
management. 
 
Design/methodology/approach– Using L6σ principles to enhance healthcare resources’ 
effectiveness needs a pre-assessment of the healthcare organisation’s capabilities. The model will 
be developed using a rule based approach of KB system. The KB system embeds Gauging 
Absence of Pre-requisite (GAP) for benchmarking and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) for 
prioritization. A comprehensive literature review will be covered for the main contents of the 
model with a typical output of GAP analysis and AHP   
 
Findings–The proposed KB system has benchmarked the current status of healthcare resources 
with the ideal benchmark one (resulting from extensive evaluation) by the KB/GAP/AHP system 
of international organisational resources management in healthcare environments. 
 
Research limitations/implications– Future work includes validating the implementation model 
in healthcare environments around the world. 
 
Originality/value– This research presents a novel application of a hybrid KB/GAP/AHP 
methodology to implement L6σ principles to enhance Healthcare resources management. This 
approach will assist healthcare governor’s decision making to reach performance improvement 
against a best practice benchmark.

Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is among the most potent tools for ranking decision making 
units (DMUs). We present a new perspective for ranking DMUs under a DEA peer-evaluation 
setting.  The proposed approach exploits the property of multiple weighting schemes generated 
over the cross-evaluation process in developing a methodology that yields not only robust 
ranking patterns but also more realistic sets of weights for the DMUs.  The robustness of the 
proposed methodology is evaluated using OWA combinations involving different minimax 
disparity models and different levels of optimism of the decision maker.  We show that 
discrimination is boosted at each stage of the decision process.  As an illustration, our approach is 
applied to ranking a sample of manufacturing systems.

Abstract 
With regards to the rapid development of renewable energy resources, which is seen as 
sustainable electricity generating technologies. The costs analysis related to various power 
supply technologies are critical for business decision making. To this end, the South African 
government by means of its energy department has signed an agreement to add 2 300MW of 
renewable energy generating sources, which will be developed by the Independent Power 
Producer. Thus, this research paper used two different approaches (the Levelized Cost of 
Electricity (LCOE) and the Levelized Avoided Cost of Electricity (LACE). This latter was 
developed with the aim of addressing the issues left out by LCOE, which are crucial to business 
decision making. In this paper, at least 10 different power producing plants (coal, gas, nuclear, 
biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric, wind offshore, wind onshore, solar photovoltaic, 
concentrated solar power) were used as case study.  The results indicate that of all technologies, 
geothermal ranks at the first place as the most economic competitive alternative, followed by 
coal technology. Furthermore, the results illustrate that the worse technologies in terms of 
economic viability are solar photovoltaic, concentrated solar power, and wind. As far as the 
authors are aware this study is the first example in the context of the South African energy 
sector.

I. Introduction 
In South Africa, the history of power supply and demand started since 1881. During that century, the first electric 
lights were made online in western Cape by the British colony, this was just after Thomas Edison invented them in 
the United States. This was based on the benefits that electrical energy would have brought into human activities, 
therefore, the use of electricity spread quickly into the inner circle of the then Boer-ruled South African Republic. The 
main beneficiary was the gold mining industry. As early as 1895, first small hydro- and steam powered electricity 
power plants were in operation in the main cities of Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria [2]. Likewise, the gold 
mining industry was the driving force behind the development of further power stations. In the years around 1900, the 
mining industry recognized that existing power plants where too small in capacity and that more energy was needed 
for their mining processes. This proved to be the beginning of the idea of “larger and centralized power plants” in 
South Africa, which provide cheap and reliable electricity supply to the industry. Soon, several mining companies 
bundled their forces and gave concessions to newly founded electricity companies that would provide them with the 
necessary electricity. Coal was then introduced for electricity generation in thermal power plants [3]. Subsequently, 
both private companies and municipalities started to produce electricity from a variety of technologies and under a 
variety of municipal laws and regulations in order to cover the increasing electricity demand. To bundle new individual 
power stations into a network and to deliver power to railroads and nearby cities, the Electricity Supply Commission 
(ESCOM) was created in the government’s Electricity Act of 1922, with a mandate to supply electricity at the least

Abstract 
 
South Africa one of the most developed country in the continent of Africa had been dealing with 
serious challenges such as substantial growth in residents and increasing per capita electrical 
energy use that requires maximum utilization of existing electricity generating sources. Presently, 
more than 88% of electricity is being generated by means of fossil fuels with coal leading the 
raking by feeding the national power grid with approximately 72% of electrical energy produced. 
However, this power supply system puts a colossal strain on the economy and triggers significant 
damage to the ecosystem in general. To mitigate, this high reliance over non-renewable electricity 
producing resources, the South African government along with its department of energy as well as 
the electricity utility decided to implement measures with the aim of promoting the production of 
electricity through the renewable energy resources. However, these decisions have been primarily 
made with the goal of reducing the power  crisis, without giving a significant consideration to the 
environmental, economic, social, and technical aspects concerning all the proposed renewable 
energy resource alternatives. To bridge this gap, this paper used the Analytical Hierarchy Process 
(AHP) in order to define the absolute priorities of the renewable energy sources in the South 
African energy sector. The parameters such as environmental, economic, social, and technical 
were taken into account in this study with the aim of identifying and ranking the electricity 
technologies such as biomass, wind, hydro, and solar energy. Various analyses including 
sensitivity ones were conducted in order to determine the most promising energy source between 
these technologies. The outcomes of these analyses indicate that biomass is the most promising 
option with 52.6%, followed by wind with 27.2%, hydro 12.9%, and solar energy 6,9%.

I.  Introduction  
 
Electricity is the key element in evaluating the welfare of humans and community as a whole. considering this, in 
order to develop an unbiassed and adequate community, it is important to make sure that the everybody within the 
current and future generations has an easy and fair access to electricity to achieve their needs. Nevertheless, with a 
momentous size of the present electricity demand that is being met by means of a restricted means, generally fossil 
fuels, the current generation are facing several challenges to ensure an easy access to electricity to underprivileged 
communities as impartially as it might attain in well-off communities [5]. Current’s power infrastructure comprising 
of integrated power infrastructure necessitates a huge amount of capital cost to put into service and, thus, makes it out 
of the reach of deprived societies. The ability of fossil fuel reserve as well resources that future generations cannot be 
ensured the extent of welfare that being enjoyed from nowadays’ electricity interplay [5, 6, 7, 9]. Furthermore, in

The figure 3 above displays that though all the attributes were given the same importance of criteria, the raking did 
not change since biomass technology still leading the raking, followed by wind, hydro, and solar energy. Thus, we 
can now conclude that biomass is the most preferred and promising renewable energy source in the context of the 
South African electricity sector. 
 
VII. Discussion and Conclusion  
 
The overall aim of this study was to assist decision makers in the South African electricity sector concerning the 
selection of the most and promising renewable energy sources. To this end, AHP approach as one of the MCDA was 
applied to different attributes and alternatives, the attributes include the economic, environmental, social, and technical 
aspects. While, the alternatives considered were biomass, wind, hydro, and solar energy. From the figure 2 above, it 
can clearly be seen that biomass is the most promising option with 52.6%, followed by wind with 27.2%, hydro 12.9%, 
and solar energy 6,9%. When computing the priority vector, economic attribute led the raking with 42.6%, followed 
by social aspect with 23.4%, environmental attribute with 17.5% and in closing technical aspect has had 16.4%. it is 
therefore believed that the results of this work will help all the parties involved in implementing policy associated 
with the electricity production.

Abstract 
 
Over the last decade, there has been a growing cognizance concerning the environmental 
degradation caused by the greenhouse gases emissions release during the production of electricity. 
This awareness along with the issue surrounding the depletion of natural resources, has led many 
countries across the world, comprising South Africa to explore the alternatives for mitigating this 
situation and developing strategies to move away from conventional electricity generating sources 
towards ‘’low-emissions’’ electricity technologies. However, with the current economic growth 
and increased of population, ‘’high-carbon emissions’’ electricity technologies are expected to be 
used for many decades to come, especially in South Africa where roughly 88% of energy are being 
generated from fossil fuels. Keeping this in mind, this paper aimed at measuring and comparing 
the environmental impact between coal and biomass-based power plants in the context of the South 
African energy sector. The assessments were conducted by means of fourteen environmental 
indicators. The results of the assessments indicate that the coal- fired power plant has significant 
ecological impacts regarding the global warming, freshwater eutrophication, and fossil depletion 
categories than the biomass electricity generating source.

I.  Introduction  
 
The deployment of non-renewable energy means is expected to last for several decades in order to support the ever-
increasing global people. However, it is important to make use of these means within an effective and efficient manner, 
which lessens their negative influences over human being health and the ecosystem. Access to adequate provisions of 
affordable electricity is one of the main requirement for economic growth, and growth is essential for accomplishing 
the acceptable lifestyle to which several individuals across the world seek. Nevertheless, it is important for policy 
makers to ensure that both economic growth and improvement of humans’ lives are sustainable. 
 
A largely acknowledged explanation of Sustainable Development (SD) is the one provided in 1987, by the World 
Commission on Environment and Development (WCED) “the ability of present generation to meet their needs without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” [1] [2] [4]. To this end, in order to develop 
sustainable energy decision policy makers should adopt and apply the principles of SD to the power sector. An 
important principle of sustainable energy is the effective deployment of electricity, society, monetary and natural 
means. Many nations all over the world are endorsing the concept of SD [9]. The challenge is to conduct appraisals 
and judgments on various forms of electricity generating sources in the context of SD. Practically, sustainable energy 
development implies that people health and ecological effects, resource depletion and intergenerational fairness 
connotations ought to be resolved together with conventional financial and technical matters during the development 
and employment of electricity generating alternatives. Economic growth and ecological safety ideas must not be

Abstract 
Energy sector is a key player in the economic and social growth of a nation and to the quality of 
humans’ lifestyle. However, considering the way it is being mined, generated and employed, two 
serious flows have arisen. Foremost, the whole power supply system has become very ineffective. 
Secondly, important ecological burdens are generated from the activities linked to the power 
supply system. Thus, over the last decade, the sustainability assessment of electricity technologies 
has drawn significant attention from scholars and industrial practitioners. Decision regarding 
sustainable energy development is based on a wide range of indicators. However, in the context of 
the South African energy sector, there is a paucity of such wide analysis. Therefore, to bridge this 
gap, we have made use of the weighted sum method, which is one of the multi criteria decision 
analysis approach to assess and compare 9 different electricity generating technologies on a basis 
of 7 sustainability indicators (load factor, the operations and maintenance costs, the costs of 
producing electricity, greenhouse gases emissions, Sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen; and lead. 
The results of the assessments demonstrate that off all technologies wind and solar thermal are the 
most sustainable alternatives in the context of South Africa. Additionally, we have noticed that 
hydropower and geothermal technologies have the potential to provide considerable sustainability 
developments over conventional power technologies (coal, gas, and nuclear). Lastly, off 
conventional technologies coal and gas demonstrate a good sustainability performance than coal 
in most cases.

I. Introduction
Since the mid-1700s, electrical energy has been performing a critical role in the betterment of the human being live.
This electricity generating resource – clean, affordable, and secured – is estimated at 37% of the global ‘s overall
energy consumption, with universal electricity demand expected to upsurge sharply in the near future [4]. The United
Nations argues that easy access to electrical energy is a driving-factor towards the mitigation of poverty and worldwide
inequality [2] [11]. Currently, approximately 82% of total global electricity is being generated from fossil fuel and
nuclear energy sources [10]. This is in part associated with the current approaches ‘superior properties regarding power
density, controllability, and historically, outlay. However, the fuels employed for these kinds of electricity production
are mostly non-renewable sources and, therefore, create stern ecological burdens. Fossil fuel production is the main
producer of greenhouse gases emissions, uncommon metals, and erstwhile atmosphere pollutants [4] [5] [8]. Nuclear
power production plant generates radioactive residue, conveys a hazard of nuclear tragedies [11]. Seizing and stowing
carbon underground, together with cautious management of nuclear residue, might assist in mitigating some of these
ecological issues within the short term [7]. Nevertheless, the activities related to oil, coal, natural gas, and uranium is
expected to increase at several times throughout the subsequent 20 decades, off-putting these alternatives ‘expediency
within a sustainable future [8] [9] [10].

In this paper, we have made use of MCDA to assess 
and compare different electricity generating sources, 
including thermal and renewable energy sources on a 
basis of 7 sustainability indicators comprising 
technical, economic, and environmental making use of 
quantitative minimum, nominal, and maximum values. 
As far as far as the author is aware this study is the first 
example in the context of the South African energy 
sector. To this end, energy policy decision makers may 
make use of these findings in order to assist in choosing 
the technology meeting an acceptable set of sustainable 
development requirements. As it can be seen from the 
figure 1 and 2, the results demonstrate that off all 
technologies wind and solar thermal are the most 
sustainable alternatives in the context of South Africa 
as a whole. Additionally, we have noticed that 
hydropower and geothermal technologies have the 
potential to provide considerable sustainability 
developments over conventional power technologies 
(coal, gas, and nuclear). Off conventional technologies 
coal and gas demonstrate a good sustainability 
performance than coal in most cases. These outcomes 
insinuate that policy makers should encourage the 
adoption and implementation of renewable energy 
sources. Though, these latter still not competitive to 
conventional electricity technologies in terms of the 
load factor and cost of producing electricity. It should 
be pointed out that the results of our sustainability 
assessments do not take geographical boundaries into 
account. Since the results presented in this work are the 
South African-based and might therefore not be 
relevant to a worldwide extent. Nevertheless, an akin 
approach used with whereabouts-particular data might 
be suitable to decision-making process from a global 
scale perspective.

Abstract 
Over the past decades, the primary goal of business corporations has customarily concentrated on 
the economic growth, and meanwhile keeping consumers happy by meeting their needs. 
Nevertheless, due to ever-increasing pressure regarding ecological and social concerns from 
governments, non-governmental organizations, and consumers have forced various organizations, 
mainly electricity utilities and manufacturing companies, to reconsider their goals by taking the 
environmental and social aspects into account. However, a global challenge has emerged 
concerning the development of such concept. Because, there is a lack of a rational and trustworthy 
approach designed for measuring environmental burdens, which remain a complex task for various 
business corporations. Especially for the energy sector that is considered as the driving-factor of 
ecological deterioration all over the world. Considering this, this paper reviews a set of previous 
environmental frameworks applied to energy sector. The results indicate that there is a lack of a 
holistic framework in the current literature, since many studies focused on evaluating the 
environmental impacts generated during the extraction of raw material and production of energy 
stages, thus, ignoring other life cycle stages such as processing of raw material, transportation of 
raw material, and transmission and distribution of end-product to end-users. Therefore, this paper 
seeks to bridge this gap by assisting decision policy makers to have a comprehensive 
understanding regarding the connections between all the life cycle stages and thus identifying ways 
to analyse them.

I. Introduction 
The ecological burdens related to contemporary electrical energy production have not happened within a vacuum. 
They are considered as part of a larger relapse of the planet ‘s environment triggered through mankind activities. This 
relapse is exclusively huge since the environment offers the society various vital products and life-support services 
[30]. These comprise sanitisation of atmosphere and water, management of climate, and the generation and 
maintenance of biodiversity. Environment resources are viewed undeniably indispensable to industrial sector and 
overall welfare. Previously, demand concerning those resources was trivial that stern environmental impacts triggered 
by means of activities associated with human being were curbed in scope and duration. Nevertheless, as worldwide 
inhabitants and demand concerning those resources has been growing at 
 
 
a fast pace, strain on the environment has amplified considerably. Human being change of the globe has generated 
immense soil alteration, biodiversity damage, and a substantial upsurge regarding atmospheric carbon dioxide levels 
[25, 26, 29]. These ecological burdens are generating growing strain over mankind society. As they are worsening on

Abstract  
 
Surface hardness plays an important role in lifetime of a mechanical part subjected to friction 
and wear. Indeed, the hardness can be improved by processes of superficial plastic deformation 
(DPS), such as the mechanical surface treatment ""TMS"", in particular the ball burnishing. 
However, the result of treatment is conditioned by mastery of operation thus ensuring treated 
parts good mechanical and geometric properties. Experimental work was carried out by applying 
Ball burnishing process on S355JR steel specimens, in order to observe influence of treatment 
regime parameters on surface hardness 'Hv'. Two parameters of regime were considered namely:  
pressure force ""Py"" and number of passes ""i"". The relationship between these parameters and  
microhardness measured at  ""Hv"" surface has been highlighting using factorial design plans 22. 
Moreover a mathematical model has been obtained allowing prediction of response (Hv) as well 
as optimization of parameters of treatment regime. The experimental results showed that for 
surface hardness Hv it is possible to reach a 45% improvement rate for a pressure force p = 20 
Kgf and a number of passages i = 3 for this material.

Abstract 
The use of pre fabrication components in the construction industry around the world has long been 
introduced. Malaysia is also not left behind in introducing the use of this type of construction method. The 
use of pre fabrication components was started in the 1960s. However, after more than 50 years, the use of 
pre fabrication components in each of the construction projects is still low and received less attention.  This 
study looks at the main factors that slow the use of pre-fabrication components in the construction industry. 
This study was conducted by involving a company as respondent. Interview method was used to obtain 
information and was rewritten in text form. The results of the interview also found that in pre-fabrication, 
the main problem of stakeholders refused to use this type of construction method due to faster construction 
time but the payment received was slow and based on progress payment. Most of the projects using pre 
fabrication will be completed faster but the payments received from the client are a little late.

1. Introduction
In Malaysia, the pre fabrication components are also known as Industrialised Building System (IBS). Industrialised 
Building System (IBS) has been recognized as synonymous with industrialisation of the construction industry. In 
Malaysia, the domination of traditional method in IBS project has gained much attention not only from researchers 
but also construction industry practitioners as the implementation of IBS through traditional approach always led to 
the rise of construction problems such as increasing project time and cost, redesigning, ineffective supply chain, and 
others. As a developing country, Malaysian is currently driving for implementing a new or modern construction 
method, the Industrialised Building System (IBS), as an alternative towards enhancing construction performance. 
Currently, most of the IBS project developments in Malaysia are still conducted by using the traditional construction 
process approach. This traditional construction process has been widely criticised for its fragmented approach to 
project delivery and its failure to form effective teams thus created a number of issues such as reworks, time delay, 
rising costs, lack of communication and coordination, and wastages.  
The limited take up on pre fabrications components have triggered many research initiatives attempting to scrutinized 
the barriers and seek the way forward. For contractors, the call to use pre fabrications components is less attractive 
due to cost and risk issues, lack of professional trained in installing the pre fabrications components, limited 
Information Technology (IT) adoption and lack of guidance (Pan et al. 2008; Pan et a!, 2007 and Blismas, 2007).

Apart from the above strategies, the other steps taken by him in developing this company is to entrust the staff. 
According to him, trust plays a very important role in developing the company. He will also share the knowledge and 
expertise available to the staff. 
 
""In ensuring this company continues to grow, in managing this company, my goal is to educate. We will 
teach the workers with good knowledge and us to trust them. We know we've got enough of them, then we 
believe in them. When there is a problem, they will refer to us and we will try to solve it. In this way, my 
workload can be reduced and the staff will be delighted with the trust they have. "" 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
In the most volatile environment of construction industry, the management of the construction industry needs to be 
aware of all the signal of any turbulence and uncertainty. This company have been in the industry for a quite number 
of years have really understand what does in needs to sustain the business. Its not only about the capital that is always 
be the central issue in any business, but the art in sustaining and setting the future direction of the business is matters. 
It can be conclude that this company has several key points in making them as one of the successful construction 
company in Malaysia. The founder of this company highlighted among others, for a construction company to succeed, 
they should possess advance information, good company finance, cooperation with other contractors, work with 
design and build contractors, maintain a good relationship, have a good financial structure and finally, trust. For him, 
these are the key factors for ensuring the success and sustaining their business in construction industry. He mentioned 
that advance information that is needed in order for them to construct a project includes amount of project funds, the 
issue with supply chain, existing connection that is required and finally communication with the subcontractors. When 
all the required information is gathered, then there is chance to get the ball rolling.  
 
Good company finance is meant by making sure the there is no redundancy of work done by the employees. According 
to the company’s MD, redundancy in employees’ job can cause a serious damage to the company finance. In order to 
overcome this issue, he as the Managing Director of the company, will determine who are among the employee that 
makes multiple redundancy in their job. The moment they take leave, they will be asked not to continue working at 
the company. The employee then will use the opportunity while having holiday, they will also try to search for a new 
job. Those remains in the company can be utilize to do their job effectively and efficiently. This strategy alone could 
save the company finance close to RM 1 million. Cooperation with other contractor is the next strategy used by the 
company. Cooperation means working together in achieving the same desired goal. Cooperate with other contractor 
meaning, once they got project, we will also get the project. By doing this, every year, the company will get a project. 
Maintaining good relationship with manufacturers and suppliers is another strategy for any construction industry to 
succeed. The advantage when they manage to have a good relationship is through getting material prices at a cheaper 
price. This can only be achieved if and only if we have good relationships with the suppliers and manufacturers. 
 
Good financial structure can also be obtained through discipline in the company. To achieve this strategy, this 
company did a good strategy by not making any loans from the bank. Although the company was being approached 
by the banks to acquire a loan in order to increase their budget capital, this company did not want to make such 
commitments because they have enough capital to operate their business. It turns up that this strategy work well for 
them. Finally, the MD also mentioned that trust is a key point in sustaining his construction company. He is a firm 
believer that trust is not build in one day. For him, sharing his knowledge and experience to his staff is something that 
be benefitted to his company. Providing trust to his staff in making their job would also ease his burden. But, trust is 
always one of the key issue for the company to succeed in the long run. With all the above mentioned strategy did by 
this company, these are their ingredients in making sure that their company can do well in the near future. These 
ingredients are however can become a benchmark for any business to succeed. May be not all can be implemented, 
but some are key factors for businesses to succeed.

Abstract 
The development of business strategies demands coherence among the most diverse activities of 
the different areas of a company, aiming to provide coordinated actions and aligned with the goals 
of the organization. It becomes vital in this process to consider the influence that the strategic positions 
of each sector play on the others. Recent technological advances aligned with the development of the 
production methods have had a great impact on the competitiveness of the companies and, consequently, 
attracted the attention of those related to the business and academic fields. 
Thus, an effective dialogue between the marketing and production areas proves to be of great 
importance given that marketing seeks to understand, serve and satisfy consumer desires (KOTLER, 
2000), while production seeks to responding the demand for products, optimizing processes and 
concentrating their efforts on obtaining efficiency out of productive resources. 
Therefore, the objective of this study is to address the relationship between production and marketing 
and the impact of this integration on organizations.

Abstract 
Since a major part of Iran's petrochemical base products has been taken into account for export, it is 
essential and inevitable to consider international markets to examine the economic conditions of 
petrochemical development projects. The aim of this research in Iran’s petrochemical industry is access to 
appropriate solutions to solve the facing challenges as well as development of innovation management 
model in petrochemical companies producing polyethylene products with the approach of the new 
polyethylene goods. Data collection was conducted using the library and field studies. After taking these 
steps, 58 main indicators were considered by experts’ screening among 130 extracted indices. Based on 
these indicators, final questionnaire was designed by Likert scale and it was also distributed. Finally, after 
asking comments of 105 managers and experts in 5 Petrochemical Companies producing polyethylene 
products on these indicators, Data were collected and the research model was fitted using structural 
equation and Smart PLS software. After fitting, 29 indices, 2 factors and 6 dimensions were accepted for 
designing model. General dimension was composed of economic, organizational, regulatory and 
supervision factors while specific dimension was formed of technological, technical, marketing and 
systemic factors. According to research conducted for successful innovation management, considering all 
the above mentioned points is necessary in Petrochemical companies which are producers of polyethylene 
products.

1. Introduction
Today, companies and organizations are made to innovate in the process with the approach of producing the new 
products in order to maintain a competitive advantage (Salajegheh, 2008). Falling in world oil prices and the 
subsequent drop in prices of petrochemical products in global markets has had the large aftershocks so far in which

6. Discussion and conclusion 
 
as the major part of basic petrochemical products in Iran are  intended currently for export, considering international 
markets for investigating  economy conditions and Petrochemical development projects is essential and inevitable. 
This research was conducted in order to achieve appropriate solutions in order to solve the challenges and 
development of innovation management model in petrochemical companies which are producers of polyethylene 
products. In this study, two factors, 6 dimensions and 58 indices  were obtained in this study in which the results of 
research indicated that economic,  organizational, regulatory and supervisory, technological and technical marketing 
and systemic dimensions which were constituent dimensions of the general and specific the factors, have a 
significant effect on innovation management in petrochemical companies producing polyethylene products. As a 
result, between the two factors involved in this aspect, general factor has the maximum influence on innovation 
management. On the basis of the outcomes obtained of SMART PLS software output, indicators with the maximum 
amount of R2, have a greater share in explaining variance, and also in strengthening and predicting behavior of the 
related factors, thus, more attention is required for them. 
According to the results presented in Table 2, 3 and Fig. 1, following results and the recommendations are obtained: 
Economic development (AE9) in economic factor of the indicator has the highest R2 among other indicators of this 
dimension. This means that economic factor has the greatest share in Explaining variance of economic factor. In this 
regard, it is suggested that government increases investment in petrochemical companies producing polyethylene 
products and also pays special attention to such companies. 
  The organizational structure of innovation reinforcement (BO11) in the organizational factor of indicator has the 
highest R2 In this context, it is recommended that structure of the petrochemical companies producing polyethylene 
products is revised and flexible structure with minimal bureaucracy is replaced. 
Specified national industrial policies (CR4) in regulatory and supervisory factor have the greatest share in explaining 
this factor. It is recommended that government takes action on codification of the industrial policies which 
reinforces innovative products for petrochemical companies in the field of Polyethylene to strengthen this factor. 
Compatibility of technology (DT3) in technological and technical factor has the highest r2 in which improvement to 
greater efficiency is suggested so that innovative technologies are used locally and considering the specific 
circumstances of the companies. Moreover, necessary Adaptability in this area is done in the field of technology 
transfer. 
 Index of sales support (EM3) in marketing factor has the highest R2. Therefore, it is recommended that process of 
selling support is revised and custodian unit is also strengthened by education and training in order to strengthen this 
indicator. 
The highest amount of R2 in system factor is related to specialize screening system of ideas (FS1) .it is 
recommended that a system to collect and select ideas and eventually to implement selected ideas, that can lead to 
can lead to value takeover, is created in order to maintain and strengthen the proposed indicator.

Abstract 
The main purpose of manufacturing industry is to produce goods economically in order to gain profit and 
be able to deliver products on time. Ineffective and efficient production processes lead to non-current 
production. Lean production systems help companies to be competitive, especially in terms of reducing 
waste (waste) that occurs in their operations. This study aims to reduce production waste in one automotive 
company by using Waste Relationship Matrix (WRM), Waste Assessment Questionnaire (WAQ) and Value 
Stream Mapping (VSM). Activities in the automotive Industry is to design, develop, manufacture, market 
and sell motor vehicles in the world. The three methods are intended to identify and analyze the waste 
(waste) that occurred and make improvements to eliminate waste. From the research results obtained type 
of waste ""form"" is waiting and motion. While the type of waste ""to"" the inventory. The three types of waste 
is the greatest procession to occur in the process of assembly trimming on the production line of Daihatsu 
SIGRA 1.5 L 3NR-Ve, DOHC Dual VVT-i at PT. Astra Daihatsu Motor. Then performed the improvement 
implementation by using WRM and VSM method obtained the results of waste efficiency that occurs in the 
type of waste from the motion from 17.65% to 15.75%, waiting from 15.88 to 13.12%, and lead time down 
from 14.202 minutes to 12.322 minutes in one assembly process trimming. Some suggestions for 
improvements made are the implementation of the FIFO system (First in First Out), Improving changes in 
movement and movement of workers, and line balancing on the assembly line trimming process lines of 
automobile production processes.

process in AT-07 is also done by one worker. Especially for waiting in the area of AT-02 and AT-06 where waiting 
to be processed on AT-03 and AT-07 authors do their own analysis to provide input to the production. The analysis is 
to measure the cycle time between the three work stations (AT-02, AT-03, AT-04) and (AT-06, AT-07, AT-08) to 
determine the actual cycle time of the three operations. From the measurement found that the average CT for AT-02: 
is equal to 0.571 minutes, AT-03: 2,506 minutes and AT-04: 1.125 minutes. The work area of AT-03 and AT-04 is 
done by the same operator so that it works sequence (sequential) from AT-03 process after that just doing assembly 
on AT-04.  
 
When measuring the time of this cycle the material resulted from the work by the AT-02 process operator must 
wait for AT-03 to complete assembly. Because in fact the standard time for this process is only 2.05 minutes (standard 
time specified by PT Astra Daihatsu Motor). While the CT on AT-06 is 1013 minutes, AT-07: 2.134 minutes, and 
AT-08: 0.673 minutes. AT-07 and AT-08 are performed by one operator so that it is sequenced sequentially. This 
results in waste from one point causing another waste at another point. The AT-07 is still more than the standard time 
set by the company. The conclusion is the work of the operators in all three WIPs at point (AT-06, AT-03, AT-04) 
and (AT-06, AT-07, AT- 08) is not balanced. For that to balance the work of the operator so there is no waiting time 
the authors suggest to combine these three machines with the concept of first in first out or FIFO and Line Balancing 
for the division of workload on each operator so that the system works will be balanced in one production line assembly 
electronic components This car. From the implementation results applied to PT. Astra Daihatsu Motor Training 
Center, the result of the repair of the original waste waiting 15.88% decreased to 13.12%. From the results of these 
improvements on waste reduction and waiting waste impact on the total lead time of this car trimming assembly 
process. Lead Time fell from 14,202 minutes to 12,322 minutes in a single line of assembly trimming process in the 
car production process. In other words from the application of improvements can be concluded that is able to eliminate 
the time of 1 sub process on the assembly line trimming of the time for 12 assembly process that is AT 1-12 becomes 
the time for 11 assembly process that is AT 1-11 that is decreased 1.88 minutes or 1 Minute 52.8 seconds. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
 
 
Based on the results of research with the method of Waste Relationship Matrix (WRM) and Value Stream 
Mapping (VSM) can be drawn the following conclusions: 
1. Waste identification result using WRM (Waste Relationship Matrix) and VSM (Value Stream Mapping) method 
on assembly trimming process resulted 3 biggest waste that happened that is Inventory, Motion, and Waiting. 
2. Waste type ""from"" that is Motion and Waiting has the largest percentage of 17.65% and 15.88% which means that 
waste Motion and Waiting if it happens then have a large enough effect to cause other waste that will increase the 
production lead time. 
3. Waste type ""to"" the Inventory has the largest percentage of 18.24% this indicates that waste inventory is the waste 
that most affected other waste. 
4. From the improvements made to eliminate waste motion & waiting is by improving the FIFO system (First in First 
Out), Improving changes in the movement of workers, and Line Balancing in the assembly trimming process 
produces some efficiency such as: 
• Reduced Motion waste from 17.65% to 15.75%, and 
• Waste Waiting from 15.88 to 13.12%, and 
• Lead Time fell from 14,202 minutes to 12,322 minutes in a single line of assembly trimming process in the car 
production process. 
 
In other words from the application of improvements can be concluded that is able to eliminate the time of 1 sub 
process on the assembly line trimming of the time for 12 assembly process that is AT 1-12 into the time for 11 assembly 
process is AT 1-11 that is decreased 1.88 minutes or 1 Minute 52.8 seconds. 
 
5. Recommendations 
 
For future research related to the current research, the authors provide some suggestions as follows: 
1. Preferably the object of research is not only limited to the area of assembly trimming course because this area is 
only one of the whole 5 line car production process. 
2. Conducted an overall analysis with regard to factors in other production lines because there is a possibility in the 
process of production of the car there is another waste that occurs therein. 
3. Created simulations with software with several production process scenarios to determine the impact or benefit of 
any repair recommendations and for the purpose of saving the cost of checking the improvements made.

4. Cost analysis is required in terms of whether the improvements made have a significant cost impact so that it can 
be seen that the improvements made provide measurable benefits from the previous. So it can be seen whether 
worth it enough to be repaired or not.

Abstract. The Special Capital Region of Jakarta is covered in densely growing infrastructure. 
However, little attention is paid towards its environmental conditions. This leads to social 
problems such the absence of a clean water supply. The conditions of contaminated shallow 
groundwater and river water makes layer analysis of deep groundwater carriers (aquifers) 
necessary. This research aims to provide insight about deep groundwater potential, and 
determine the depths and locations of aquifers in the Jakarta area, particularly for the benefit of 
the Kapuk-Cengkareng people. This research was conducted via well logging analysis. Well 
logging is a geophysical method designed to find out the subsurface lithology of an area using 
its physical characteristics. The result from this research can be used to interpret that there are 
four deep groundwater layer zones with different qualities. Good groundwater layers can be 
found in layers with good porosity and permeability. By analyzing the curves obtained using 
the well logging method, it can be known that most of the layers found in the wellbore are 
claystone with low resistivity and high gamma radiation. The resistivity value of the claystone 
layers is about 2-5 Ω•m with 65-80 cps. There are several layers with high resistivity and low 
gamma radiation (sandstone) that has the potential to be an aquifer. This is reinforced by the 
sand layer with a right-leaning SP log curve proving that this layer is permeable. These layers 
have a 4-9 Ω•m with 40-65 cps. These are mostly found as freshwater aquifers with (83-279) 
µ•S/cm EC, (7.61- 8.17) ph, and (56-188) mg/L TDS.

1. Introduction
The Kapuk research area is located between 5°19’12”S to 6°23’54”S and 106°22’42”E to 
106°58’18”E. This research area is part of Jakarta’s Groundwater Basin. Kapuk is part of the 
Northwest Java Beach, in the Jakarta Bay Area. Since the beginning of the 20th century, 
groundwater from the Greater Jakarta Basin has been used for drinking water and other water 
resources purposes [1]. The city’s high population and growing infrastructure rapidly creates 
social problems. The change in allocation from paddy field areas to settlement decreases area of 
water absorption in the region for groundwater sources. This triggers a lack of clean water supply. 
It has been estimated that only 38% of Jakarta’s population have access to clean water. Much of

Paris, France, July 26-27, 2018","7. Conclusion 
 
Based on the well logging and groundwater chemical analysis performed in Kapuk-Cengkareng, 
West Jakarta, it can be stated that: 
 
1. Well logging investigations using three methods (spontaneous potential log, resistivity log, and 
gamma ray log) have been able to describe potential layers as aquifers, based on the physical 
properties of the rocks. 
 
2.  Layers that are identified as fresh aquifers lie at depths of 122-126m, 94-100m, and 76-80m 
based on the samples tested. Aquifers at 108-113m are estimated as not freshwater aquifers. 
 
Knowing an aquifer’s potential can be used as a guide in groundwater exploitation. It should be 
noted that land subsidence will happen along with water exploitation. Aquifers at depths of 76-80 
m and 108-113 m need to be identified first before exploiting them.

Abstract 
This STEM project is to simulate the Poker Probability.  The game rule is to select three from four 
shared cards plus two own cards to form the BEST Five to determine who can be the winner.  In 
order to simplify the probability scenario, partial deck (9, 10, J, Q, K, and A) are drawn to increase 
matching probability on higher ranked patterns such as Four of a Kind and Full House.  Author 
used JAVA random simulation method and conducted Combination and Conditional Probability 
to calculate each player’s winning probability. Author used a simple case study to derive the 
winning probability between two players.  JAVA random simulation is programmed to generate 
the random cards for both players.  JAVA programming can randomly duplicate the real Poker 
scenario in a random way to distribute the cards to players randomly.  Authors compared the JAVA 
simulated results against the expected probability derived based on combination and conditional 
probability.  Contingency table, Chi-Square proportions tests were conducted and confirmed that 
the JAVA simulated probability could match the expected Poker probability very well.  This is a 
very successful STEM project which has integrated JAVA Computer Science and 
Statistics/Probability on the Poker application.

1. Introduction and Literature Research
Most Poker players lost Money in Poker Gambling since they played blind gambling without applying the poker 
probability and assess their risk on each play. The objective of this paper is to use JAVA to simulate Poker Probability 
and study Sample Size effect on Statistics and decision making.  The project scope is for learning purpose, not for 
gambling purpose.  Authors used partial deck (9, 10, J, Q, K, A) of 24 cards to simplify JAVA poker simulation.  
Figure 1 has listed the rankings of different matched patterns for the full deck (52 cards) scenario.  The full deck poker 
for 6 to 7 random cards is very popular in most Poker tournament [1, 2]. Several research papers have demonstrated and 
simulated the poker probability by using Monte Carlo Simulation [3], Evolutionary Computing [4] and Artificial 
Intelligence [5].  There is also an US Patent [6] studied the partial deck on Royal Flush probability.  In this paper, the 
authors will study the Poker Probability on the 24-cards Partial Deck and use JAVA Monte Carlo Simulation on a 
special case study to verify the winning probability between two players.  The ranking of Partial Deck may be different 
from the Full Deck.    
2. Study Partial Deck Probability
Authors used partial deck (9, 10, J, Q, K, A) of 24 cards to simplify JAVA poker simulation…  Partial Deck can 
increase the matching probability especially on higher ranked patterns such as Four of a Kind, and Full House.  Partial 
Deck Poker may also simplify JAVA simulation process concentrated on higher ranked patterns which may be critical 
for Poker Players in real time decision making on each betting move.

scenario. Run 1-Proportion Z test to verify JAVA simulation algorithm.  Except (Player A- K Full House, Player B- J 
Full House), all the other scenarios showed good matching (P-Values > 0.05) as shown in Figure 9.  In general, the 
JAVA simulation results matched the expected probability very well. The matching performance can be further 
improved by increasing the sample size of JAVA simulation run (for example from current 25 runs to 50 runs). 
 
Figure 9. Compare JAVA Simulation Result against the Expected Probability. 
 
3.3 Verify the JAVA Simulation Accuracy on Player Winning Probability 
 
Next, the winner probability by JAVA simulation (Figure 8) was compared to the expected winning probability (in 
section 2.4).  In Figure 10, JAVA Random Simulation method can match the expected probability reliably. Player A 
has a slightly higher chance to win over Player B (Because Player A K Full House > Player B J Full House).

4. Results and Conclusions 
Authors have successfully applied both Probability and JAVA programming on simulating Poker Winning Probability.  
The JAVA simulation can predict the expected matching probability and players’ winning probability very well based 
on 1-Proportion tests.  Partial Deck Poker was used to simplify the winning patterns and probability simulation.  The 
ranking of the matching patterns has been changed from the Full Deck to Partial Deck as unexpectedly. Authors have 
created a Case Study and focus on Full House pattern scenario to demonstrate the JAVA Monte Carlo simulation.   
 
179","5. Future Work 
 
This paper can be further polished by the following opportunities: (1) extend the partial deck from 24 cards to in 
general, (2) expand it from current 6-cards to 7-cards (five shared, 2 owned), and (3) consider the winning probability 
of all possible matching (not just on Full House).

Abstract 
Information Technology (IT), by facilitating and accelerating information exchange, enables organization 
and suppliers to become aware of each other’s needs and meet them in a timely manner which enhances 
on-time production philosophy. In this respect, a study was conducted with the aim of investigating the 
role of information sharing in drug supply chain using the views of experts in the field of pharmacy in 
Tehran and Hormozgan University of Medical Sciences as well as relevant organizations such as 
drugstores, hospitals, and drug deputies in 1392-1393. The findings revealed that 71% of the experts 
completely agree with the impact of information sharing on the integration of drug supply chain, and 45% 
agreed with the effect of information sharing on the efficiency of drug supply chain. Also, 45% of the 
experts confirmed the effect of information sharing on the performance of drug supply chain. Based on 
the results of inferential statistics, information sharing has a significant effect on the efficiency, 
integration, and performance of drug supply chain.

1.Introduction
Nowadays, organizations in order to deal with global competition require to manage their supply chain in a best way 
, so, that organizations are obliged to better manage the supply chain [Marinagi, et al. 2014, Paulraj,et al. 2017]. 
Supply chain includes all activities related to the preparation of goods from raw materials to deliver the final 
products that the follow of information and financial resources are both in this process [Feng, 2012]. The drug sector 
plays an important role in the health and medical system. In most countries, the drug market is hardly regulated due 
to the unique nature of drug supply and demand. Depending on the competition in drug market, the governments 
need to regulate both economic and clinical side [Yu,2010]. The drug supply chain guarantees availability of drugs 
appropriate for individuals in the right time. This availability is a big challenge, unless it becomes simple and 
effective on the basis of customers’ needs and demands [Chandrasekaran,Kumar,2009]. Cooperation among supply 
chain partners is the main way to achieve competitive advantage and information sharing among the members of this

Paris, France, July 26-27, 2018","7.Conclusions 
Nowadays, information sharing is one of the vital aspects for the survival of different supply chain in the 
competitive world which has many advantages like increasing efficiency, decreasing inventory level at each time 
period, reducing totals costs of the chain, increasing certainty and decreasing uncertain conditions, as well as 
optimal use of resources and increasing productivity in all sectors involved throughout the chain. Considering its 
different sections, the drug supply chain is not exempt from this rule, and information sharing has a significant effect 
on its performance. Health and treatment supply chain, like supply chain management in a production system can 
lead to integration and coordination of processes, integration of information flow and coordination of planning 
processes. Information sharing is acquisition and dissemination of information relevant to planning and controlling 
supply chain operations. Information sharing is important for the efficiency and effectiveness as well as competitive 
advantage of the supply chain.  
The results obtained in this study show that most experts completely agree with the effect of information sharing on 
the integration, efficiency, and performance of drug supply chain and confirm its positive effect. According to the 
analyses of this study, managers and policy-makers of health and treatment sector should pay more attention to the 
role of information sharing in drug supply chain to improve its efficiency and performance and increase the quality 
of drug distribution

Abstract 
Like most other developing countries, mining remains the soul of Zimbabwe’s economy. The drilling and 
mining equipment operation is based on hydraulics. The steering system, the hoisting, dumping, hauling 
and hydraulics systems constitutes approximately 80% of the mechanical build-up of these equipment. In 
a mining setup, lubrication of the hydraulic system for these equipment is extremely critical.  Breakdown 
of these machines may lead to the need of refilling of the hydraulic tanks hence a convenient mobile 
pumping system has become the crying need for mining industries. Literature was carried out on already 
existing designs. Information obtained includes, materials used, methods used, selected operating 
mechanisms, history of designs from various sources. Information pertaining to the parts regarding price, 
rating, availability, functions, performance and alternatives was obtained.  In the design process, the 
reciprocating aspect of the slider crank was designed basing on the discharge flow required. An 
experiment was carried out to determine the flowrate. A diaphragm was added to the piston to ensure the 
separation of the oil being pumped and the actuator(pneumatics). Pneumatics offers a more flexible safer 
alternative to electric motors. Air is clean and will not harm to the environment in case of any leaks. 
There is also reduced risk of ignition as there will be no magnetic fields or sparks associated with the 
system. The von Mises stresses and deflections were done using Solidworks and they were in range and

The design is safe for the working conditions designed for. 
5. Recommendations 
Reciprocating pumps, still however have challenge of wearing out. Condition monitoring could 
be applied to predict failure so as to prevent catastrophic failure. As it has still a couple of 
moving parts, failure of one component can affect e whole system and functionality which will 
be very expensive to repair. 
6. Conclusion 
As humans, we owe it to the environment to maintain a healthy and safe working place. As a 
company seeking to make profit we should see to it that we minimise cost as much as possible. 
Under these circumstances of downtimes threatening productivity a mobile pumping system can 
play a significant role. Mobile reciprocating pumping offers a convenient and safe way of 
199","delivering hydraulic oil into the drilling and trucking equipment hydraulic tanks. This mobile 
reciprocating pumping system was designed with an adjustable height mechanism which caters 
for the difference in height of operators. Tall people can operate it with ease without having to 
strain their backs and the same with short persons without difficulty. The research was a success 
as all objectives were addressed. This research will go a long way in offering a convenient 
platform for pumping and hence an increase in production giving our economy a dive over the 
current status.

Abstract 
 
The Zimbabwean Fast Track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP) (2000) resulted in the creation of smaller 
land pieces which, although beneficiary in that land was indigenised, were however not suitable for 
farming most cereal crops, particularly wheat. This is because the available machines used for the 
harvesting processes are mostly designed and economical for large pieces of land. In order to serve those 
small scale A2 wheat farmers who have resorted to time consuming and laborious manual harvesting 
methods, and to encourage those who have abandoned wheat farming completely, this paper was done to 
design a mini combine harvester machine that is both affordable and economical for these farmers. 
Design specifications and drawings were developed for the machine. Information for the manufacture and 
assembly of the mini combine harvester was also provided, and material selection was done focusing on 
the locally available and affordable materials in the country. Manufacture of this mini combine harvester 
will result in profitable wheat farming by small scale farmers and will also boost the gradually declining 
wheat grain production. For most practical industrial applications, a transmission shaft with span length L 
(distance between two adjacent bearings), the maximum deflection δ lies in the range of 
0.001L<δ<0.003L. In the design process, reaping and threshing systems were designed through the use of 
the crop requirements. These include the mechanical and physical properties of the wheat kernel and 
straw properties. The mechanical and physical properties used have been obtained from various studies 
carried out on determining them, focusing mainly on the varieties being grown in Zimbabwe. The

Conclusion 
The mini combine harvester will result in a fast harvesting method for small scale farmers; 
reduce labour and the respective costs associated with hiring labour; and give the small scale 
farmers enough time to focus on other operations at the farm. The mini harvester will be more 
convenient for the operator, and most importantly, reduce postharvest losses due to traditional

methods’ use. This will increase the productivity and quality of the crops produced, allowing 
small scale farmers to contribute more to the nation’s development to a greater extent. It can also 
provide an alternative way for cereal crop harvesting to all farmers, preventing the loss of cereal 
crops due to early rains or animals, birds in the case of cereal crops, destroying the crops. 
Therefore, an increase in harvest mechanization was seen to be very important in order to harvest 
crops in a fast way with minimum losses. For most small scale farmers (A1 and A2), there is 
therefore a need for the design of harvest machinery that is economical for them, as most of them 
do not afford the machinery already present, or acquire the machinery way past the harvesting 
period.

Abstract 
The research paper is based on the design of an automated mirror cutting machine for a developing country in a low 
level production system. Current machines are very expensive. Research on types of mirrors and car manufacturing 
industries was conducted on the internet, and also industrial visits to local car manufacturing industries. Firstly the 
experiment was conducted in the lab and the force F=2.7kN required to break the mirror was found, this force was 
used to calculate the deflection y=39.44mm and bending stress= 305.5𝑁𝑁/𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚2. In the design process a cylinder of 
internal diameter d=75mm and a solenoid valve with flow factor 𝐶𝐶𝑣𝑣= 1.5 were selected. The maximum von Mises 
in each of the tested components were below the yield stresses of the respective components hence this machine will 
not fail under normal operations. The maximum von Mises stress= 2.948𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 for the cutting wheel is less than the 
design stress= 18.387𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀, therefore the design is safe. In this project an Arduino board will be able to read the 
input (pressure) by the use of the pressure sensors and turn it into the output, when the pressure from the compressor 
is great than 10.5bar the red LED light will be turned ON, then the operator of the machine will witch it OFF. Above 
all the operator of this automated machine should be well skilled and wear goggles during the operation of the machine. 
An automated mirror cutting machine was designed within a budget of USD$4 221.34 and the machine can cut mirrors 
ranging from 20mm*20mm up to 500mm*500mm as stated from the objectives.

5. Conclusion 
The paper was successfully done. An automated mirror cutting machine was designed within a budget of USD 4 
221.34 and the machine can cut mirrors ranging from 20*20mm up to 500*500mm as stated from the objectives. The 
machine can also cut any shape of mirror. In the designing of the machine local materials were used so as to promote 
local companies by keeping the cost as minimum as possible and maintaining the quality. Improving a robot will help 
in increasing the accuracy and precision. A robot has an advantage over humans because it does not require sick leave 
and it does not affected by fatigue.

Abstract 
Wood is a renewable source of energy that is used by everyone and cutting wood is a vast problem in 
developing countries such as Zimbabwe where manual methods are still been mostly used. Zimbabwe has 
been facing electricity shortages to the extent of importing 1200 megawatts of electricity from Zambia 
which is almost half of its peak demand. The aim of the paper is to design an automated wood cutter for 
cutting wood for domestic use. The objectives were to design a wood cutter which can cut wood of 
diameter 100mm, to design a wood cutter with an output capacity of (850-1000) kg per hour and to come 
up with a 3D prototype of the wood cutter. This machine will cut wood with minimum human influence. 
The objectives were achieved by performing an experiment to come up with the force required to cut the 
100mm diameter round-wood and the torque generated was used to design and size the components of the 
machine. SolidWorks 2016 was used to calculate and estimate the bearing type and life, do the deflections 
and stress analysis to determine the weakest point on the machine. Automation was done using the SMT 
Version 3.3 PLC in connection with a shoe brake to protect the machine operator making the machine 
safer and user friendly. The fuzzy logic controller was used to monitor moisture content of inserted wood 
to prevent jamming of the machine. DFMA principle was also used to optimize the machine cost without 
reducing the product quality.

6. Results and Discussion 
The researchers looked into the literature that was required to partake the project which included 
the wood anatomy, sawmilling in developing countries as well as in first world countries, the 
current machines being used, the problems faced with these machines and how the industry has 
tried to reduce them. This helped the researcher to come up with solutions to achieve the 
objectives stated in chapter 1 as well as to come up other methods which could be used to protect 
the machine users from being injured by the blades. The researcher came up with possible 
solutions and used the Binary Dominance Matrix Method to come.   
The researcher worked on designing for cost effective manufacturing of the wood cutter by 
analyzing the cost involved and how best these costs can be reduced without reducing but rather 
improving the overall machine performance. Design for ease of assembly was also performed in 
this write-up by reducing the overall machine assemblies of the machine. Cost analysis was 
performed, DFMA reduced the overall cost of the machine as well as making it easier to sustain 
by an amount of by US$107.80 which is reasonable.  
7. Recommendations and Conclusion 
The researcher acclaims that in the process of feeding wood, care should be taken before 
switching the machine on to check if it is in a good condition to function and the users are 
recommended to wear eye protection googles to protect themselves in the case of flying cuts. In 
sustaining the machine, the bearings should be greased after approximately every 5000Hrs of 
service and after use, the machine should be shut down, cleaned and covered to prevent dust 
from accumulating which may end up hindering the sight of the user which is un-safe. The 
researcher also recommends the exchange of the cutter knives after sharpening to a maximum of 
228","4mm from the cutting edge. The gears should consistently be lubricated with a thicker lubricant 
to reduce gear failure probabilities. The researcher also recommends the mounting of a 
horizontal based hopper for easy feeding of the stock into the machine for cutting and the use of 
rollers to pull the wood into the machine which is safer to the user as well as user friendly. 
In conclusion of the whole write-up, the main aims of the project which are to design an 
automated wood cutter for cutting wood in the wood industry as well as for domestic use were 
achieved. The safety of the machine was also improved through the introduction of a PLC. The 
objectives of the write-up were also met through designing the machine for maximum force 
required to cut wood of diameter 100mm.

Abstract 
We argue that the process of learning from the data (that is: Analytics and Machine Learning Algorithms) is more 
complex in Differentiators and Innovators compared to Cost Leaders (see Miles and Snow et. al. 1978). Given that 
the errors in prediction is as high as 80% on an average (see Google Pages), it is recommended that decision makers 
using Analytics need to be of Perceptive type (spend more time in analysis) and must avoid being Judgmental (see 
MBTI [4]) when the core company is following  Differentiation and/or  Innovation strategy. Also we show that 
decision makers in cost leaders need to far less perceptive. We further argue that Analytics applications are 
primarily done in PRODUCTION and FINANCE for cost leaders, and primarily done in MARKETING AND R&D 
for Differentiators and Innovators. Use font size 11 for the abstract text. It should not be exceeding 200 words.

Abstract 
Sequencing and scheduling the surgeries in operating rooms (ORs) can be a very important problem since 
(i) the duration of each surgery can be uncertain, (ii) surgeries are a great source of revenue and a huge 
source of cost for the hospitals because doctors, OR staff, and surgery equipment are very expensive 
resources, and (iii) the satisfaction of patients and minimizing their waiting time is also a very important 
criterion. Solving this problem can reduce the costs and increase the satisfaction of patients significantly, 
but at the same time it is very hard to drive the solution mathematically. Even the sequencing sub-
problem can be challenging if the number of surgeries are large. There is no known tractable optimal 
solution to this problem and in practice, mostly a heuristic policy which orders surgeries based on 
increasing duration variances, i.e. the surgery with the smaller variance is scheduled earlier, is applied. 
We propose a simple heuristic policy for the sequencing of the surgeries based on the Newsvendor cost, 
and analyze it using a hospital data set as a case study. We show that this heuristic policy outperforms the 
ordering based on variance since it takes the asymmetry of waiting and idle costs into account. For the 
cases where the difference between the idle and waiting cost is large, which is the case in surgery 
sequencing, this approach achieves a better improvement in the total expected cost.

1. Introduction 
Scheduling and sequencing jobs with uncertain time duration of services has been a challenging problem in 
operation research (e.g. Wang 1997, Panwar 1999, Pinedo 2005). There are different applications for the sequencing 
and scheduling and one of the common applications is the surgery scheduling (e.g. Denton 2007, Weiss 1990, 
Denton 2003, Wachtel 2009). Operation rooms (ORs) are the main sources of revenue for the hospitals and on the 
other hand the main sources of costs since the surgery equipment and staffs are very expensive resources. There are 
two different types of surgeries, outpatient and inpatient. In the inpatient surgery case, the patient has been already 
hospitalized and has an assigned room to stay the night before the surgery or after the surgery for longer recovery 
duration. On the other hand, in the outpatient surgery case, the patient doesn’t need to be hospitalized and arrives to 
the hospital a short time before the surgery and leaves the hospital the same day after a short recovery. Furthermore, 
some procedures may need a deterministic or predictable time but some may take a significantly uncertain time to be 
served. The scheduling of the appointments must provide both the order of the patients and the exact appointment 
time for each patient considering different types of cost.  
Assume that we have N patients and we should assign the ordering of the patients and the appointment times for 
their arrival to the hospital to minimize the total expected cost. There are three different sources of the cost: (i) idle

8. Conclusion 
We have proposed a heuristic surgery sequencing policy based on the Newsvendor cost and compared it with the 
most common heuristics in practice, which order the surgeries based on the variance of surgery durations (VAR) and 
the one that asks all patients to be present in the morning to avoid any idle cost (NI). We have used both simulation 
and a hospital data to show that this proposed heuristic approach can outperform the available heuristics and have a 
considerable impact on the revenue of the hospitals as well as patients’ satisfaction.  
As a future work, it will be interesting to consider more complex scenarios in which multiple ORs are involved and 
the patients and doctors have time restrictions which will affect the ordering and scheduling and see how the NV 
heuristic can affect the cost reduction. In addition, any mathematical direction to show the optimality of NV 
ordering under specific conditions or deriving a performance guarantee for this scheme could be an exciting 
direction.

Abstract 
This paper studies the Newsvendor problem for a setting in which (i) the demand is temporally correlated, 
(ii) the demand is censored, (iii) the distribution of the demand is unknown. The correlation is modeled as 
a Markovian process. The censoring means that if the demand is larger than the action (selected 
inventory), only a lower bound on the demand can be revealed. The uncertainty set on the demand 
distribution is given by only the upper and lower bound on the amount of the change from a time to the 
next time. We propose a robust approach to minimize the worst-case total cost and model it as a min-max 
zero-sum repeated game. We prove that the worst-case distribution of the adversary at each time is a two-
point distribution with non-zero probabilities at the extrema of the uncertainty set of the demand. And the 
optimal action of the decision-maker can have any of the following structures: (i) a randomized solution 
with a two-point distribution at the extrema, (ii) a deterministic solution at a convex combination of the 
extrema. Both above solutions balance the over-utilization and under-utilization costs. Finally, we extend 
our results to uni-model cost functions.

Newsvendor problem or perishable inventory control problem has been a research topic for many years (Arrow 
1951).  The newsvendor model relates by analogy to the situation faced by a newspaper vendor who must decide on 
how many newspapers to stock since he doesn’t know how many demand (customer) he might have, and he knows 
that the leftover newspapers cannot be sold the next day (it is perishable in some sense). Since then, different

5. Conclusion 
We have studied the Newsvendor problem with the following challenges: (i) the demand is temporally correlated as 
a Markovian process, (ii) the demand can only be censored (i.e. partially observable), (iii) the distribution of the 
demand and the transition probabilities of the Markovian process are unknown and only upper and lower bounds on 
the transitions are given. We modeled this problem as a min-max zero-sum repeated game. We have proved that the 
worst-case distribution of the adversary at each time is a two-point distribution with non-zero probabilities at the 
lower and upper bound of the uncertainty set. The optimal action to minimize the worst-case cost-to-go can have be 
any of the following two formats: (i) a randomized solution with a two-point distribution at the lower and upper 
bound of the uncertainty set. If the over-utilization cost is larger than the under-utilization cost, higher probability is 
assigned to the lower bound to behave conservatively. Otherwise, higher probability is assigned to the upper bound 
to behave more aggressively and increase the chance of full observation. (ii) a deterministic solution at a convex 
combination of the lower and upper bounds of the uncertainty set, which also balance the over-utilization and under-
utilization costs. Finally, we showed that similar results hold for a more general class of cost functions that are uni-
model on the difference between the demand and the action.

Abstract 
We study a set of inventory control problems with correlated demands over different time periods. On the 
other hands, we relax the assumption of fully observation of the demand at the end of each time period. In 
other words, we consider the case of partially observed (censored) demand in the context of a multi-
period inventory problem. If the demand in a period is larger than the inventory level, we don’t observe 
the unmet demand. Otherwise, the demand is fully observed and the leftover inventory is carried over to 
the next period. Formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process provides a 
dynamic program (DP) to minimize the total expected cost. Unfortunately, the corresponding DP is 
defined on an uncountable state space, with little hope for a computationally feasible solution. We present 
an interesting heuristic policy with a percentile threshold structure which outperforms the myopic policy 
and performs close to the optimal policy. We derive its performance guarantee and evaluate it using 
numerical simulations.

1. Introduction 
Inventory control is one of the important topics in operations research and management and it has been studied by 
many researchers (Qin, 2011). In this kind of problems, the demand for some good is assumed to follow a stochastic 
process and at the beginning of each decision epoch the decision-maker decides on the inventory level (i.e. how 
many items to store) in order to satisfy the demand. As one of the challenging problems in inventory control, many 
studies have been focused on different distributions of the demand. Most inventory models in these studies assume 
that demands are independent and identically distributed over different time periods (e.g. Besbes 2010). However, in 
recent years, it has been observed that this assumption might not hold in practice (Tai 2016), thus, there have been 
research papers on the inventory problems with correlated demands over time (Hu 2016, Alwan 2016). For instance, 
in some studies the demand is assumed to be Markov-modulated (Hu, 2016), or Autoregressive (Alwan 2016).  
Another challenging problem in this field is about the observability of the demand. In other words, if the demand is 
higher than the sale, the unmet demand might not be fully observable. In some inventory systems such as retail 
stores, unmet demand of inventory is lost and cannot be observed or recorded. In literature, this problem is referred 
as censoring or partial observability (e.g. Lu 2008, Bisi 2011).  
In this paper, we address the two aforementioned challenging problems. We study the inventory control problem 
when the demand is partial observable, and correlated over time periods as a Markovian process. Therefore, we face 
with a Partial Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) problem. As such the solution of this problem can be

Abstract 
 
In this paper we relate culture required to support innovation of a given type. It has implications for top 
management in terms of institutional building (while a research organization is being built from scratch); 
keep conflict (between research workers engaged in different types of innovation in the same 
organization) at manageable levels.  
  
Keywords  
Innovation strategy, conflict management, Innovation types 
 
1. INTRODUCTION  
Burgelman et. al. (2004) has categorized Innovation into four types i.e.  Radical, Architectural, Modular and 
Incremental. Further Radical Innovation has been categorized to Exploration and Exploitative innovation. In 
exploratory innovation, focus on discovery of a technology that will come into market place little longer; and in 
exploratory innovation efforts are made to use current technology to come up with a product that the consumers will 
find it useful. In modular innovation, the overall product structure remains the same, but innovation is done in a 
small module (such as in the personal computer (PC) a new type of disk drive is discovered, and it does not affect 
the other parts of PC).  In architectural innovation, we change the way modules are connected in the overall plan 
(example is converting a ceiling fan to table fan). Incremental innovation is done to boost the efficiency of a given 
task.  
 
We collate cultural dimensions given by Hofstede and Cartworth et. al. (1996) typology to get the following: Power 
distance, uncertainty avoidance, individuality/collectivism, long/short term, masculinity/feminine, bureaucratic, 
professional, personal support, market and adhocracy. These are self explanatory and hence detailed description is 
avoided here.  
In the following section we attempt to relate innovation type to culture that will result in synergy.  
 
2. DEVELOPING HYPOTHESIS 
Exploratory innovation will be possible when research workers love to exist in high level of uncertainty; and have 
long term orientation.  
H1: Exploratory innovation will be supported by culture of adhocracy, low power distance, low uncertainty 
avoidance and long term orientation. 
  
In exploitation innovation feedback from market/consumers will be crucial; and there is pressure to be on time, 
hence we have the following.  
H2: Exploitative innovation to be supported by Market Culture, A little higher (compared to as given in H1) Power 
distance and Uncertainty Avoidance. It will need the organization to have short term orientation.  
 
In support of the hypothesis below reader may please refer to (Sharma and Saha, 2014).  
H3. Architectural Innovation needs to have much higher collectivism.  
 
If uncertainty is very high, then we need efforts of many to counter it (in both exploratory and exploitative research). 
Hence we have the following,

H4. If the research is happening in high velocity environment, then it would need more collectivism and much 
higher level of flexibility.  
The above are self explanatory and detailed discussion is avoided deliberately.  
 
3. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
There are several implications of above for research organizations (industry and academic institutions). (a) When 
research organization is built from scratch, the above framework will be useful to top management to inculcate 
appropriate culture/values.  (b) It will have serious implications for comparing individuals (research organizations: 
academic/industry) engaged in different types of research (for the purposes of distribution of rewards). (c) Also there 
will be serious problems in comparing different research organizations (typically Academic Institutes of Higher 
Learning) that are engaged in different types of innovation as above.  
It is known that many organizations are practicing explorative and exploitative innovations under same roof (USR) 
as opposed to in different roofs (UDR) (Singh, et. al., 2017). We expect that when exploratory and exploitative are 
done under same roof (USR) it will have a much larger culture clash, and top management (of these research 
organizations) has to devise approaches for resolving the conflict.

Abstract 
 
Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an advanced technology which is currently being used in the 
construction industries especially in other countries. However, there are still some barriers to implement 
BIM in Malaysia. This paper aims to determine the benefits of investing in BIM, explore the barriers to 
implement BIM and to persuade the implementation of BIM. The data was collected through interview 
targeting the construction player, and the data was analyzed. The result shows that the construction player 
agreed to the benefits and the implementation of BIM. However, there are still existing barriers to 
implement BIM in the Malaysian construction industry. 
 
Keywords 
Building Information Modelling (BIM), benefits, barriers, implementation, construction industry 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Technologies are advancing day by day. With the constant developing, changing, and improvement of technologies, 
human’s life is getting easier, and works are completed faster. In order for the Malaysian government to achieve the 
status of developed country by 2020, they have been promoting and pushing the industries to adopt and utilise 
information technology (Zahrizan, Ali, Haron, Marshall-Ponting, & Hamid, 2013). Even in the construction industry, 
many new technologies are starting to be implemented to help change and improve the construction industry. 
According to Brandon et al. (2008) cited in Hosseini, Chileshe, Zou, & Baroudi (2013), construction industry was 
left behind by other industries in term of adopting new technologies. However, according to Thatcher Associates - 
an online blog, drones, Augmented Reality (AR), and Building Information Modelling (BIM) have already started to 
be use in the construction industry (Chaffe, 2016). 
 
Most construction industry acknowledges the adoption of technology, but they still resist investing time and money 
to see a better result (Gallagher, 2017). On the other hand, some construction industries around the world have 
started implementing BIM in their company. Therefore, this research is carried out to study the benefits and barriers 
of implementing BIM in Malaysian construction industry, especially in Kedah.  
 
1.1 Problem Statement and Objective 
 
BIM do provide many advantages to the construction players such as save cost and time of reworking, earlier 
detection of error, and detect clashing. However, there are barriers in implementing BIM in Malaysian construction 
industry. However, there are always problems that will arise in carrying out a project. For example, a project will 
run smoothly with good communication and understanding, but without proper visualization, a person will make 
mistakes. A client has a hard time understanding the building while some conceptual rendering was shown 
(AECMagazine, 2017). Besides that, communication difficulties between different parties will arise in the design 
and planning process. Thus, there is a need for Malaysian construction industry to know well the function and 
benefits of using BIM. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore the benefits and barriers of investing in 
BIM in Malaysian construction industry.

5. Discussion and Conclusion 
 
This research found that currently the industry is good enough with using AutoCAD and have not implement BIM 
as BIM will only be beneficial if it involves big and complicated projects. However, the industry will start to 
implement BIM as they saw the benefits that BIM will offer in construction projects. Furthermore, this research 
found out that the barriers of implementation of BIM at the moment is cost, training, and resistant to change. 
 
Based on this research, BIM need to be expose more to Malaysian construction industry. More future research 
should be done and focus on Malaysian construction to help benefit the industry. Furthermore, maybe the industry 
can evaluate the differences of using BIM and traditional method in construction project. The researchers can help to 
develop a framework for the implementation of BIM that will be suitable for the local construction industry by 
referring to the successful implementation in other countries.

Abstract 
 
Product Configuration Systems (PCS) are considered types of IT systems that enable companies to 
develop product alternatives to facilitate the sales and production processes automation. Based on 
literature, there are various challenges reported on managing different phases of PCS projects. Different 
tools and solutions have been suggested and applied for solving these challenges especially at the level of 
the project management process. Moreover, various software project management methods are used, in 
order to get high quality PCS, such as Rational Unified Process (RUP). The changes from Plan-driven 
methodologies towards a pure agile way of working is a challenge that comes with both benefits and 
risks. In this paper, first we will investigate about the PCS projects using the RUP method and then we 
will discuss PCS projects cases managed and launch using Agile principles. We use a comparative 
qualitative explanatory case study method on multiple data sources: documentation, workshops and 
participant observation. We find that changing from RUP to Scrum brings both positive effects and 
challenges to the organization.

Abstract  
 
We consider a real case study of a vehicle routing problem with a heterogeneous fleet and time windows 
(HFVRPTW) for a franchise company bottling Coca-Cola products in Colombia. This study aims to 
determine the routes to be performed to fulfill the demand of the customers by using a heterogeneous fleet 
and considering soft time windows. The objective is to minimize the distance traveled by the performed 
routes. We propose a two-phase heuristic algorithm. In the proposed approach, after an initial phase (first 
phase), a granular tabu search is applied during the improvement phase (second phase). Two additional 
procedures are considered to help that the algorithm could escape from local optimum, given that during a 
given number of iterations there has been no improvement. Computational experiments on real instances 
show that the proposed algorithm is able to obtain high-quality solutions within a short computing time 
compared to the results found by the software that the company currently uses to plan the daily routes.

Abstract  
 
This work considers the Dynamic Problem of Locating and Dispatching Emergency Medical Vehicles 
(PDLDVE). The problem considers three decisions sequentially: location of the fleet of emergency 
vehicles, the assigning and dispatching of the available vehicles, and finally the relocation of available 
vehicles, by considering a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. The objective of the PDLDVE is to maximize 
coverage in terms of time of response depending on the type of service requested. In this work, a 
matheuristic algorithm is proposed addressing the three problems: location, dispatch and relocation. The 
problem of location is mathematically formulated with a vertex approach which is oriented towards the 
maximum coverage; the dispatch problem is solved through a heuristic based on the preparedness index 
for multiple servers; and, finally, the relocation problem is approached in two stages: in the first stage, a 
mathematical model related to maximum coverage is solved, and the second stage minimizes the 
maximum time need for the displacement of the vehicles in order to relocate the available fleet. 
Computational experiments generated in a simulation of discrete events based on real information for the 
city of Bogotá, Colombia, show that the proposed algorithm is able to obtain good solutions within short 
computing times.

Abstract 
In this paper, we investigate the optimal supplier’s and buyer’s reactions to supply disruption. 
Upon disruption, the supplier loses the supply during the recovery period. Given a delivery time 
contract between the supplier and buyer, the supplier can make an investment to decrease the 
recovery time to benefit both parties. If the supplier’s capacity is recovered after the delivery 
time, the supplier should pay a penalty cost to the buyer for each unit of lost sale demand and for 
the amount of time that the supply is delayed. Also, similar to the supplier situation, the buyer 
incurs a penalty cost for each unit of lost sale demand and for the amount of the waiting time.  
Because the supplier can decrease the recovery completion time, the buyer may offer a financial 
subsidy incentive to the supplier (sole sourcing with a financial subsidy incentive strategy) or 
source from two suppliers (dual sourcing strategy). In this study, we present two Stackelberg 
game models to highlight optimal buyer’s and supplier’s decisions under the mentioned 
strategies We also find the financial incentives levels that would coordinate the two-party supply 
chain. Finally, we compare the two strategies and characterize the buyer’s preference as a 
function of the model parameters.  
Our work complements literature papers where they analyzed similar problems in the context of 
improving the suppliers’ reliability so as to reduce their chances of being disrupted. In contrast, 
we focus on the analysis of disruption recovery strategies. In particular, we investigate the role of 
building long term supplier relationships, through joint investment programs, in mitigating the 
impact of supply disruptions.

Abstract  
 
Emergence of cloud computing has brought evolution in many sectors like education, healthcare, 
governance, etc. Cloud computing is growing interest to manufacturer, but rate of adopting the cloud 
computing is low in manufacturing sector. Cloud manufacturing is in the early stage of development and 
successful as a prototype particularly in additive manufacturing. However, it still requires a great amount 
of research in order for successful implementation on a large scale. In this paper, first we discuss adoption 
of CC for manufacturing in industry for various categories like small and medium-sized enterprises, 
startup companies etc. Then we use the SWOT analysis to study the opportunities and challenges of CC 
for manufacturing. A SWOT analysis is here demonstrated to be a helpful guide in decision-making for 
industry when considering the migration to cloud based systems.  Finally, the paper concludes with some 
further research areas in the field of CC for manufacturing.

1. Introduction 
 
Cloud Computing (CC) has been cited as ‗the fifth utility‘ (along with water, electricity, gas, and telephone) 
whereby computing services are readily available on demand, like other utility services available in today‘s society 
(Buyya et al., 2009). Many authors, organizations defined CC as commentators on the subject, all definitions 
eventually indicate the utility of CC in several aspects like: pay as you go structure, on demand services, scalability 
of applications, strong importance of SLAs, guaranteed Quality of Service (QoS), reliability of services. Among the 
various definitions, the one by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) has gained recent 
recognition and popularity, which states as ―A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on demand network 
access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. - networks, servers, storage, applications and 
services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider 
interaction‖ (Mell and Grace, 2009). CC enables organizations to consume computing resources as a utility just like 
electricity. Essential characteristics of CC are broad network access, measured services, on-demand self-service, 
rapid elasticity and resource pooling.

security requirements and mandatory notifications of data breaches are must have exponential growth of CC for 
manufacturing (Gupta et al., 2013; Hsu and Lin, 2016).  According to Sehgal et al., 2016 security is listed as a top 
concern both in the study and in the EDA industry. 
Concern over continuous availability of the service is prominent in SMEs as loss of service will result in substantial 
loss of sale opportunities and customer dissatisfaction (Alshamaila et al., 2013; Doherty et al., 2015; Sultan, 2011). 
According to Gupta et al. (2013) reliability of cloud services for SMEs needs to be improved through data protection 
regulations, security requirements and mandatory notifications of data breaches.  
Data confidentiality (Bharathi and Mandal, 2015) and trust (Camara et al., 2015) plays an important role in the 
information-sharing process between customer and cloud service provider.  
Analyzing risk and return status of CC services and help organisations that adopt CC to evaluate and review their 
CC projects and services (Chang et al., 2016).  According to Ratten, 2015 study on technology firms of Australia 
risk analysis is crucial factor for intention of CC adoption. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Cloud technology holds a key for future in all sectors, research and development has been remained topic of 
attraction around the globe. Cloud technology application in manufacturing paradigm is becoming popular in 
additive manufacturing sector and seldom in other sectors like subtractive manufacturing. This affects SMEs, OEMs 
throughout the globe. Based on literature review done, it is clear that CC for manufacturing has come a long way 
since its inception. Good amount of research and development has been going on in countries like China or USA. 
But there are several issues involved in industry. So this paper explains CC adoption, feature of it and manufacturing 
need to using the CC, and investigated on advantages and disadvantages of CC. SWOT analysis of CC in the 
manufacturing sector was evaluated. The results of SWOT analysis shows that manufacturing sector particularly 
SMEs will get benefited from CC. This needs top management support as well as overcoming issues of security and 
reliability.

Abstract 
 
Outsourcing, possible originating in the make-or-buy decision, has been investigated from a number of 
theoretical perspectives, such as transaction cost economics and the resource-based view; however, the 
use of these canonical theories has insufficiently accounted for its long-term effects, the risks associated 
with the decision and the phenomenon of backsourcing.  To include these long-term effects, this paper 
presents a complementary view informed by a (theoretical) evolutionary biological perspective that 
counteracts some controversies raised in literature.  This perspective leads to an outline of an evolutionary 
framework that could inform further research into the effectiveness of decision making on outsourcing. 
Keywords 
Decision making, evolutionary models, mutations, outsourcing

Introduction 
Whereas the conceptualisation of outsourcing decisions has often been related weakly to theories in studies (Dekkers 
et al., 2017), one possible avenue has been insufficiently explored: evolutionary models.  Particularly, Mahnke 
(2001, p. 373) has advocated the role these evolutionary models could play for managerial decision making, 
although he did not expand the conceptualisation; note that he places the evolutionary processes in the context of 
searching, learning and capability development.  In addition to his propositional paper, some other papers have 
referred to sources that propagate evolutionary models; a case in point is Doh (2005) referring to the work of Nelson 
and Winter (1982), but then connecting it to the resource-based view (Doh, 2005, p. 699).  Another strand views the 
evolutionary process as staged development (e.g. Mirani, 2006).  Nonetheless their referral to evolutionary models 
and processes, these studies are hardly linked to evolutionary models derived from (theoretical) evolutionary 
biology.  Using these (theoretical) evolutionary models could lead to reference models for outsourcing and has the 
potential for developing more effective methods for decision making on outsourcing; this is what this paper seeks to 
explore. 
1.1 
Objectives of Paper 
Before going into more detail about reference models derived from (theoretical) evolutionary biology, it should be 
noted that Mahnke (2001) relates the evolutionary perspective to a number of works that have taken this approach in 
a somewhat different manner.  By way of illustration, he (ibid., p. 358) mentions the work of Teece et al. (1997).  
The work of Teece et al. relies on the resource-based view for forming the perspective of dynamic capabilities.  
However, Priem and Butler (2001) have mentioned the inadequacy of the resource-based view based on their 
argument that its conceptualisation is relevant to competitive heterogeneity and not suitable for other topics.  Its 
inadequacy for outsourcing is proven by Dekkers (2011, p. 959), albeit based on case studies, because it does not 
account for long-term effects.  Although the dynamic capability perspective building on the resource-based vie 
among other theoretical constructs for firms is relatively newer, works (e.g. Ellonen et al., 2009; Vogel and Güttel, 
2013) are propositional and refer to outsourcing in the context of this perspective (e.g. Ellonen et al., 2009, pp. 757, 
760; Vogel and Güttel, 2013, pp. 434, 437) rather then developing models or methods for decision making.  This 
implies that the potential of a perspective from (theoretical) evolutionary biology has been untouched, even in the 
context of dynamic capabilities. 
Although the dynamic capabilities perspective integrates the temporal dimension, the long-term perspective is 
missing in other canonical theories used for outsourcing.  For example, Dekkers (2011, p. 959) finds that transaction 
cost economics, the resource-based view and the conceptualisation of core competencies are providing inadequate 
descriptions for long-term effects of outsourcing.  The inclusion of the long-term perspective is necessary, because

Abstract  
Managing supply chain is a critical issue in any business domains. To manage the overall supply chain it 
is important that the management understands the drivers that is associated with the complex interactions 
within a chain. In this paper, generic supply chain complexity drivers are identified through literature 
survey and expert opinion. These drivers are then analyzed using interpretive structure modelling tool to 
understand the contextual relationships that exists between the identified drivers. Finally, ISM diagraph 
is developed based on the analyzed contextual relationship. 
 
Keywords—Supply chain, Complexity drivers, Interpretive structural modelling 
 
Introduction 
Supply chain management (SCM) has generated greater enthusiasm among researchers as well as 
industrial practitioners with the beginning of twentieth century. SCM is a system of individuals, 
organizations and the flow of resources, services, activities and information between them (Lu, 2011). 
The network of SC is an essential part to many successful industries around the globe. Due to the 
globalization of business domain, the importance of SC is getting profound more than ever. It is 
therefore critical for organization to manage their SC network as smoothly as possible. However, often, 
it is not an easy task to manage SC network according to the needs (Manuj and Sahin, 2011). Today’s 
SC exhibit a large and complex interaction with their suppliers, customers and other firms thereby 
making the chain complex to manage. Although dealing with complexity in supply chain is not easy, 
various studies have shown that managing complexity leads to better supply chain performances 
(Vachon & Klassen, 2002.; Koudal & Engel, 2007).  
SC complexity has been considered as an important research effort attempting to harness the generic 
factors or drivers, which are arising in diverse business domains.  SC complexity is defined as the 
complexity demonstrated by the products, processes and relationships that make up a chain. Complexity 
makes it difficult to manage SC efficiently as planned. This is a growing concern in global business 
domain due to its importance in day-to-day business environment. Various factors inherent within and 
outside of the chain contribute to SC complexity. These factors are known as complexity drivers. The 
identification of the drivers or factors are critical to manage or mitigate SC complexity (Walker et al. 
2008). Due to several reasons, such as distributed business environment, modes of transportation, 
competitive business environment, etc., the complexity in supply chain is increasing, which needs to be 
addressed critically in order to minimize its detrimental impacts on business environment (Blome et al., 
2014). It has been argued that SC complexity decreases the overall performance of operations, trigger 
disruptions and contribute decision making process complicated (Chopra and Sodhi, 2014).  
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 identifies the drivers of supply chain complexity. 
In section 3, ISM tool is used to understand the contextual relationships between the identified drivers.

Conclusion 
In this research, at first, based on the literature review drivers of supply chain complexity are 
collected. Experts are consulted to understand the contextual relationship that exists between 
these drivers. Thereafter, Interpretative structural method is used as a tool to segregate the 
identified drivers into various levels. The result of ISM is presented in the form of directed 
graph. The graph shows that the drivers such as competitors action, product variety, product 
development, manufacturing process and number of suppliers are the main drivers that trigger 
complexity in supply chain.  
The result of this research can be extended to develop a conceptual framework and a 
quantitative model to measure complexity in supply chain. The framework may help the 
company and its supply chain partners to understand the drivers on which they need more 
attention to minimize complexity.

Abreast
In the recent times the base of almost everything is the electrical energy. Fossil and nuclear 
power plants are used mostly to meet the present energy demand. As the demand of electrical 
energy has increased globally, there is a major threat of fast depletion of the fossil 
fuel reserves to meet that demand. So, it is important to generate energy from other sources 
before facing a severe fuel shortage. Renewable energy such as wind and solar are 
the best alternatives to meet the high demand of energy along with conventional energy. 
In order to reduce energy consumption and the environmental impact of fossil fuel, a 
hybrid system which combines solar panel and wind turbine can assist to provide a 
reliable and fully customized power to operate street light. This project has been designed 
fabricated and tested to provide a durable, reliable, and fully customized power from 
hybrid horizontal wind generator and solar system to operate street light. The system uses 
photovoltaic solar cells that directly convert solar energy into electrical energy, combined 
with a horizontal wind turbine generator which converts wind power into electrical energy. 
This electrical energy is stored in a battery . During day time electricity is generated using 
the solar panel, while the wind turbine is used to generate electricity in cloudy and rainy 
days, as well as at night. Solar and wind energy combine to provide enough energy to power 
the light system for 10-hours, without connected to the grid. 
Key words: solar energy, wend energy, hybrid system, street light, reduce electricity

Abstract 
The residential housing sector consumes a significant amount of fossil fuel energy and thereby the 
sector generates a large percentage of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming 
and climate change. At present, approximately 39% of the total household energy used is required 
for space heating/cooling and a substantial amount of that energy is lost through the house walls. 
Additionally, the floor space area and volumetric dimension of modern residential houses are 
increasing at a constant rate in most developed countries including Australia. This additional space 
also requires energy for heating and cooling. Therefore, the energy consumption for heating and 
cooling and greenhouse gas emissions will be increasing rapidly. A continuous upward energy 
consumption trend in residential housing sector worldwide will continue for years to come unless 
energy efficient and carbon neutral house wall systems are developed. One of the biggest 
challenges is to develop a smart house wall system made of thermal mass and insulation materials 
that can provide reduced energy needs for on-going heating and cooling with lower carbon 
footprint as most house wall construction materials are very energy intensive and have large carbon 
footprints. In order to develop a new energy smart house wall system, a study has been undertaken 
on thermal performance of two house wall systems (one is currently used conventional brick 
veneer house wall and other is an alternative house wall). The thermal performance (heat gain or 
loss through the wall) has been determined using computational modelling and experimental 
measurements.  The economic analysis of both house wall systems has also been carried out. The 
effects of various climate conditions on these two house wall systems have also been determined. 
The findings indicate that the new house wall system provides better thermal efficiency than that of 
currently used conventional house wall.

Abstract 
 
Product-Service Systems (PSSs) have emerged in the last years as a means of integrating products and 
services in a coordinated manner, to deliver functional results that increase customer value while 
achieving environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, the design and development of these systems is 
hindered by the absence of consistent and robust approaches that facilitate their implementation. The 
initial phases of the design of any solution, product or service oriented, are the vital stages where its key 
elements are determined. The research proposes a functional approach based on morphological reasoning 
to address the PSS design concerns. The approach enables the integration of products and services while 
capturing the values and costs of their respective providers and receivers. Life cycle modeling is then 
applied to evaluate the environmental impact of such a concept while a cost analysis portrays the 
economic benefits that can be achieved. A case study at an agricultural manufacturer demonstrates the use 
of the described approach and exhibits the advantages that can be achieved through a PSS application.

1. Introduction 
Product-Service Systems (PSSs) have significantly expanded in recent years allowing manufacturers to achieve 
economic benefits through increased customer satisfaction while improving the environmental performance of their 
offerings (Lindahl et al., 2014; Meier et al., 2010; Fargnoli et al. 2018). To achieve these goals, PSSs consist of 
shifting from stand-alone product sales towards the provision of functional results (Tukker, 2004). As noted by 
Mont (2002) and Beuren et al. (2013) manufacturers integrate services in their offerings as a means of achieving 
these functional results which leads to innovative solutions and an improved market position. Alongside the 
“business” advantages that PSSs offer, several advantages also relate to the environment as the consumed resources 
are minimized, the product and its use are optimized, the life cycle of the solution is improved, and several End-of-
Life (EoL) strategies can be put in place such as recycling, reconditioning and product recovery schemes (Tran and 
Park, 2015; Haber and Fargnoli 2017a). Nevertheless, caution is advised as PSSs can have detrimental “rebound” 
effects from an ecological standpoint if uncarefully implemented (Tukker and Tischner, 2006). A consequence 
would be the achievement of economic outcomes at the expense of unwanted environmental outcomes thus 
jeopardizing the feasibility and success of the PSS (Tukker, 2004; Bocken et al., 2014). 
To achieve these benefits, suitable stakeholder networks and innovative thinking that allow an effective integration 
of products and services are required (Baines et al., 2007; Meier et al. 2010; Sakao and Fargnoli 2010; Durugbo, 
2013; Vasantha et al. 2012; Vezzoli et al. 2015). Several studies were proposed as possible ways to successfully 
implement a PSS in practice (i.e. Baines et al., 2007; Sakao and Lindahl, 2009; Sakao et al., 2009; Haber, 2017).

Abstract 
The research addresses the management of customers’ requirements when implementing services in a 
Product-Service System (PSS) context. Services have expanded throughout recent years, yet their proper 
management and implementation remains a problematic matter for manufacturers. Uncertainties and 
ambiguities characterize services due to their intangible nature on one hand and the customers’ 
subjectivities on the other. Hence, when it comes to capturing the customer’s requirements for the PSS’ 
services, traditional product design tools such as the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) are limited for 
their accurate assessment and prioritization in order to develop an adequate service-oriented solution. To 
address this issue, the QFD is augmented using the fuzzy logic and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) 
with the goal of reducing the above inaccuracies. The proposed approach is verified at a manufacturer in 
the medical field, where few practical PSS investigations have been carried out despite their largely 
remarked potential.

1. Introduction 
In recent years, the provision of product-based solutions has shifted towards offering service and integrated product-
service offerings known as Product-Service Systems (PSSs) (Lindahl et al. 2014). This shift took place as 
manufacturers and customers alike realized that services have the potential to offer more effective and value 
augmenting solutions than a stand-alone product (Sakao and Shimomura, 2007; Haber, 2017a; Wang et al. 2017). The 
potential of integrated services and PSSs has been largely discussed in the literature (Tukker, 2004; Aurich et al. 2010; 
Tran and Park, 2015; Haber and Fargnoli, 2017a) underlining the advantages and benefits they can offer to the provider 
in terms of productivity (Matschewsky et al. 2015), to the customer in terms of satisfaction (Meier et al. 2010; Fargnoli 
et al. 2018) and to the environment in terms of ecological impact (Fargnoli et al., 2012; Haber and Fargnoli, 2017b). 
In addition, and from a more global perspective, PSSs are recognized as a possible and viable solution of “closing the 
loop” of product life cycles as a means of meeting “circular economy” goals (EU, 2015; Tukker, 2015; Sakao et al. 
2017). 
Thus, product development has progressively moved from the design of stand-alone products to the design of PSSs 
(Mager and Sung, 2011). This transition relies on the adaptation and augmentation of product-centered methodologies 
towards integrated product-service endeavors focused on delivering a satisfying solution (Oliva and Kallenberg, 2003; 
Song and Sakao, 2016; Haber and Fargnoli, 2017b). In other words, manufacturing products and providing the 
customers with their related services consist of activities that should be comprehensively combined in a single system 
to ensure the feasibility and success of the offered solution (Fargnoli et al., 2014). Both Liu (2009) and Najafi et al.

 Abstract
Todays’ world has resulted in extremely more complex traditional supply chains, where 
technological changes in the economy happen at a very fast pace. It is even made more complex due 
to emergence of digital technology, which is disrupting traditional operations which calls for all 
businesses to be digitally oriented. Traditional business cannot unlock full potential of digital without 
reinventing their supply chain strategy. Most companies understood the nature of these changes 
and are worked on introducing digital technology in their operations, however, an introduction of 
digital technology is not the answer for competitiveness advantage. We proposes an approach that 
overlooks at the fundamental differences between traditional supply chains that have been 
enhanced digitally and truly integrated, reinvented supply with fundamentally digital DNA. It is 
proved in the study that for businesses to realize benefits of digital technology, businesses need to 
reinvent their supply chain strategy, reimagine supply chain as a digital supply network that units 
talent, information and finance and not only physical flows which has been the case with traditional 
companies. This solution further encourages companies to remain more connected, scalable and 
rapid than traditional supply chain management. This network enables people and data, as well as 
material, products and supplies to travel together across the extended enterprise.

Abstract  
 
Lean Manufacturing is a century old concept, initially developed by the Toyota Company. The 
word lean is ubiquitous but it can be diversely explained. The most common definition of lean is to be 
highly responsive to customer demand by reducing waste. The word Lean Manufacturing is synonymous 
with Agile Manufacturing, Just-In-Time or the Toyota Production System. The primary aim of Lean is to 
reduce waste from the Value Stream of an organization and according to the pioneer of Lean, Taiichi Ohno, 
waste can be categorized into seven categories. Through the elimination of waste, lean manufacturing helps 
in increasing productivity, improving quality, as well as reduction of cycle time, all of which contribute to 
improved profitability of the institution. The aims of this study are to use Lean methodologies to improve 
productivity through multi-skilling of operations, reduce waste from the value stream and decrease the 
dynamic cycle time, improve quality and reduce defects. Through the survey questionnaire, the value 
streams of the Mauritian Textile Industries were analyzed for non-value-added activities, and these wastes 
were subsequently reduced from the process. The main gains of this study were to help the Mauritian Textile 
companies gain competitive advantage and survive in this tough market.

1.1 The Need for Survival in the Textile Industry 
 
In this twenty-first century, there is fierce competition for survival in the manufacturing sector. While it is 
one of the fastest growing industries in the world, it is also one in which many organizations are struggling in the 
customer driven and globally competitive markets. Many institutions have struggled because of their lack of 
understanding of the changed mind-sets of the customers and the new cost practices. The challenges faced by 
numerous manufacturing organizations are how to remain competitive and sustain their market share whilst 
simultaneously overcoming the rising production cost and variations in the product mix. 
Almost all textile industrialists are facing a dilemma; either to adapt to change or to resist the change and 
face the threat of becoming extinct. Back in the early nineties, the apparel industry adapted to change by transferring 
their production operations to under developed countries, with the main rationale behind this move being the cheap 
labor. But, with development, the cost of labor has been steadily increasing and the industry has had to look towards 
new solutions. While there are several trade agreements which benefit the industries such as the Africa Growth and 
Opportunity Act (AGOA), these trade agreements only partly cover the increased expense of industrialists.

5. Conclusion & Recommendations 
 
5.1 Conclusion 
 
Lean Manufacturing was designed for the automobile sector and was developed by the Toyota Company 
more than a century ago. Lean concept has since evolved and now numerous sectors such as the textile sector is 
adopting its principles as they aim to maintain competitiveness and survive the market. The survey questionnaire was 
used to gather valuable information from the respondents and also helped in formulation of few hypotheses. From the 
data obtained, the author found out that in the textile factory, lean is very beneficial; it helps in improving productivity, 
elimination of waste from the value stream, reduction of the cycle time, and improvement in Quality. 
 
5.2 Recommendations 
 
Trainings should not be done within a training room, but rather it should be done on the Gemba, that is the 
workplace itself. The lean tools should be tailor made to suit a specific manufacturing operation and the personnel 
should be taught to actually use the lean tools as a means of improving their operations, rather than just using those 
tools for the sake of using them. 
Multi-skilling is another key pillar to ensure that productivity is improved through lean. Continuous 
improvement is another pillar for the industry to adapt to the lean philosophy. The top management should aim to 
motivate its personnel such that the focus remains on Lean Manufacturing. 
 
5.3 Future scope for Research 
 
While Lean exists for over a century, it is still new in the Apparel Manufacturing Sector. Designed and 
perfected for the automobile sector, naturally it will require some modifications to prove its worth to the Textile 
Industry. Many Mauritian textile companies are in dire need for survival. Having previously resorted to foreign labor

as a means of maintaining low operational cost, now with new government legislations, the expatriate workers will be 
reduced and those textile companies should aim for localization. One scope for research is how can Lean help in 
recruitment of local workers. A second scope for research is how to extend the lean concept in the numerous Small 
and Medium Apparel Industries in the island for them to remain competitive and maintain profitability. 
 
The Mauritian Textile Industry is seeking to use the lean philosophy as a means of gaining competitive 
advantage whilst simultaneously aiming to survive the market. Without a doubt, this is a challenge. But since lean has 
shown the proof with the automobile sector, there is reason to believe that a catered approach towards lean, will indeed 
help this textile company.

Abstract 
The benefits of Lean manufacturing and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) for manufacturing 
systems have been confirmed in the literature. However, there are continuing debates on the effects of 
these two systems on the manufacturing performance. Given this trend, this paper aims at quantitatively 
examining these impacts and offers insights for the managerial implications. A system dynamics 
approach is used to illustrate how the performance changes under different scenarios using the real data 
of a case study at the textile and garment industry. The results highlight the role of Lean manufacturing 
itself and lend support to the view of the inefficiency of ERP system to manufacturing system. A 
suggestion to build ERP-based Lean system which ERP supports Lean production is made for 
industry managers to gain the benefits from the ERP system.

1. Introduction
“Lean manufacturing” or “Lean production” is acknowledged as a “standard manufacturing mode of the 21st 
century” (Shah & Ward, 2007) and a philosophy of managerial approaches that helps organizations to cope with the 
new competitive environment (Shtub & Karni, 2010). Besides, along with the development of Lean production, 
information systems, Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) in particular, to provide the information and decision 
support to the management are also developed (Shtub & Karni, 2010). ERP systems has been also seen as an 
effective tool for companies seeking efficiency through organizational integration to improve their performance

5. Conclusion 
 
This paper has examined how the Lean and ERP system affect the manufacturing performance through a system 
dynamics approach. The textile and apparel industry was chosen as a case study and actual data was collected. The 
results highlight the role of Lean manufacturing itself and lend support to the view that ERP becomes a hindrance to 
Lean manufacturing when Lean practices are not properly integrated into the ERP system. Therefore, it is necessary 
for the companies to design an ERP-based Lean system and to build effective Lean practices before they can gain 
the benefits from the ERP system. 
 
The ERP-enabled lean system is still new and requires further research for this application. In future, it is suggested 
to examine the effects of ERP-based Lean system on the manufacturing performance when ERP is built to support 
Lean system. In addition, building on the previous research of the maturity model of ERP support for pull 
production, the SD methodology can be used to further illustrate how the performance changes under different 
scenarios of the ERP-based Lean system. Also, future research could focus on extending the analysis to other sectors 
to see how ERP-based Lean system is adopted in a particular industry.

Abstract 
We develop and analyze a mathematical model for a specific stochastic vehicle routing problem in which 
a vehicle starts its route from a depot and visits N customers according to a particular sequence in order to 
collect from them two similar but not identical products. The actual quantity and the actual type of product 
that each customer possesses are revealed only when the vehicle arrives at the customer’s site. It is assumed 
that the vehicle has two compartments. We name these compartments, compartment 1 and compartment 2. 
It is assumed that compartment 1 is suitable for loading product 1 and compartment 2 is suitable for loading 
product 2. However it is permitted to load items of product 1 into compartment 2 and items of product 2 
into compartment 1. These actions cause extra costs that are due to extra labor. The vehicle is allowed 
during its route to return to the depot to unload the items of both products. The travel costs between 
consecutive customers and the travel costs between the customers and the depot are known. The objective 
is to find the routing strategy that minimizes the total expected cost among all possible strategies for 
servicing all customers. It is possible to find the optimal routing strategy by implementing a suitable 
stochastic dynamic programming algorithm.

Abstract - An economy becomes competitive if it manages to optimize its logistics operations and to achieve a higher level 
of competitively is important to improve the foreign trade activities of a country. One of the most representative foreign 
trade activities of a country is the import activity, which ends up hindering the net gains if the adequate logistic 
optimization is not achieved. One way to address such optimization is through collaboration through game theory or 
fictional games. This article proposes a model to optimize and maximize profits of different players, taking into account 
the costs associated with the import of goods and scenarios with multiple suppliers eligible for the dispatch of the desired 
product. For this analysis, a hybrid algorithm composed of two parts is proposed, the first is responsible for determining 
the vendor and the international transactional conditions and the second is the solution of the fictional games. The results 
demonstrate that can be achieved economic benefits with the application of the model, on average the profits can be 
increased  22.2%, this was found after developing 100 problems with different parameters.

I. INTRODUCTION
Current organizations have a changing and dynamic character that is functional to their purposes and 
objectives. Most companies have an inventory, either raw materials or finished product. Some inventories are 
unavoidable, however, it is possible to minimize this inventory by improving production scheduling. 
In most businesses, inventories represent a relatively high investment, which has important effects on 
all the main functions of the company. The inventories allow a flexibility in the operation, which without them 
would not exist. For example, in production companies, inventories of products in a process are an absolute 
necessity. 
When companies manage an adequate level of inventory, it not only reduces costs, it also eliminates 
irregularities in the offer, it could know how much of a given item to order and when to replenish the inventory 
of that item. 
Many companies that handle large amounts of inventory are in trouble when they must review or when 
they must perform operations that depend on the information it provides. So having it implies a minimum effort, 
but not having it implies a disaster and a great waste of time. 
However, when we study global supply chains, the problem has even greater consequences, since by not 
having perfect information about the demand in the links of the chain, the forecasts are increasingly moving 
away from the real data in the first links, this is known as whip effect. This effect has a huge impact on the 
operational and financial costs of companies, especially those that produce goods.

Figure 5 and 6 show that in both cases, n= 50 and n = 10, the fictitious game is in average better than 
the regular method, decreasing significantly the total cost. Figure 5 shows that only in one case the regular 
method is better than the fictitious game method. For the sample with n = 10, the situation is a little bit different 
than for the sample of n = 50.  Figure 6 shows that for a sample with n = 10 there are more cases where the 
regular method is better than the fictitious one and the distance between the costs with the regular method and 
the costs with the fictitious game is shorter than the previous sample. This indicates that the higher n is, the use 
of fictitious games can improve the game and reduce more significantly the total costs. 
 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
The model of fictitious games has a notorious application in problems of real inventories, it becomes an 
opportunity for the decision makers to improve the efficiency of their logistics processes. The study consisted 
precisely in the analysis of global supply chains and whose objective is to formulate and validate an optimization 
model that minimizes the total costs in a chain of (n) retailers and (n) international suppliers.  The research was 
developed in two stages, one for the operations between retailers and each of them with its market and another 
one to control the retail-supplier relations whose lead time is greater and merits planning organized according to 
previously established replenishment policies. 
The article was divided into four sections, the first section, section II was composed by a short literature 
review about the topic and the approached in the current literature. Section III contains the problem description, 
followed by section IV with the problem and model formulation. Finally, section V is the computational 
experiment and analysis of the model results.  
The model was based on fictitious games, which have proven effectiveness to improve the operative 
profit when diminishing the logistic costs. The model is effective regardless of the number of players available, 
in fact, by increasing the number of nodes, the system increases its performance; the average reached was 22.2%, 
with better savings for large sets. 
Cooperation between players presents important barriers despite showing economic benefits [14]. 
Apparently, the distrust between the parties, turns out to be the biggest barrier, so the biggest difficulty seems to 
be the formation of large coalitions. 
The solution of the model is composed of two fundamental parts; the first consists in determining the 
suppliers to be employed, considering those parameters of international transactions, and the second the design 
of the network of fictitious games. It is recognized then, the possibility of locality of the solutions, and not the 
global, in spite of that the model shows favorable results. It is noteworthy that the model is tactical, so its 
implementation may involve changes in rates.

Abstract 
 
In Mexico, fuel consumption costs are almost a half of the total operational costs in passenger road 
transportation companies so that even small improvements in this matter can positively affect their 
profit. This work presents the results of applying a continuous improvement project in the fuel 
efficiency department for one of the main bus fleets of an important transportation company in the 
region. We describe the application of the PDCA methodology. During the “Plan” step, we also rely 
on relevant literature to justify the strategies proposed. Among these strategies are: a new 
measurement & control system of fuel efficiency, the improvement of the value stream in the 
maintenance department, a system to increase the fuel energy efficiency using additives, and a new 
incentive program for drivers. Results on the implemented strategies and estimations for the ones 
still on progress show that the company will be able to increase up to 3.8% the fuel efficiency of the 
fleet under study.

Introduction and Background 
 
The total world delivered energy consumption due to the passenger transportation activity was nearly 15% in 2012 
(i.e. 60% of the whole transportation sector) (EIA, 2016). In the Transport Forum for Latin American, the 
improvement of buses and the passenger transportation service was among the most common actions declared for a 
Sustainable Low Carbon Transport (FTS, 2011). In Mexico, where transit transportation moves 98% of domestic 
passengers, fuel consumption represented about 50% of the companies’ variable costs (Huertas et al, 2017).    
 
Among the many worldwide approaches to decrease fuel consumption, and hence, pollutant emissions on current 
vehicles fleets are: eco-driving techniques (e.g. Díaz et al, 2017, as one of the few reported Latin American 
experiences out of 218 references in Journals indexed in Scopus), powertrain reconfigurations (e.g. Huertas et al, 
2018), green routing problems (e.g. Demir et al. 2014), change or conversion to cleaner vehicles (e.g. the CiViTAS 
Initiative for cleaner and better transport cities in Dyn@mo cities of the European Union (CiViTAS, 2017);

developed a system of rewards for drivers and implemented process of additives in fuel and assurance of calibration 
and balancing of tires. Based on pilot tests results, simulations and estimations based on experiences found in the 
literature, it expected an increase of 3.1% in the fuel efficiency of the federal fleet of the company under study.   
Besides a practical description of a continuous improvement project, along this paper we described how research 
findings in fuel consumption reductions, empirical findings in fuel consumption estimations, together with the 
application of financial, statistical, simulation, quality and logistics tools, lead to the achievement of the objectives, 
and discover a set of more possibilities for improvement.

Abstract  
 
Information systems (IS) forms the nucleus of any organization. Proper coordination, timely 
support and availability of information is essential for any organization to function properly in 
order to achieve its objectives, fulfill its strategic needs and sustain in the competitive 
environment of uncertainty. Strategic information system (SIS) is the new term adhering to the 
above concept which talks about alignment of information needs to strategic orientation of any 
organization. In this paper, we particularly talk about the various manufacturing strategies 
adopted by organizations and try to relate their characteristics to the type of IS flexibility 
requirement to effectively support them. A literature review has been presented to identify the 
diverse organizational strategies and IS flexibility dimensions. Based on the review, arguments 
are made to build the theoretical framework and subsequent hypothesis.

1. Introduction 
Organization’s operating strategy must be supported simultaneously by all related functions and systems functioning 
within the enterprise. IS forms an integral part of any organization to manage the information requirements. The 
current business environment is characterised by fast changing and competitive conditions which requires flexibility 
in IS to match and support the strategic needs. This paper identifies some major strategic groups and tries to map 
them to the type of IS flexibility suited for them.    
 
2. Literature Review 
2.1 Literature review on organizational strategy 
Many researchers made attempts to understand the operating behavior of different types of organization and classify 
them accordingly into various strategic groups. The first such classification of organizational strategy was given by 
Miles et al. (1978). Their typology was based on the changing rate of products and market. They divided 
organizations into three types namely defender, prospector and analyzer. Defenders are the stable form of 
organization with limited product range, covering a narrow segment of the total market. They compete on cost, 
offering the best product at the lowest price in the market. Prospectors continuously look for market opportunities by 
introducing additional features into the existing products as per customer demand. These organizations maintain 
industry leadership in product innovation by emphasizing more on marketing and R&D functions. The third 
strategic group i.e. Analyzer lies in between defender and prospector strategy. These organizations concentrate on 
limited product ranges maintaining quality standards. At the same time, they also excel in delivery of new products 
by avoiding excessive risks. Porter (1980) classified the organizations into three prominent strategic groups namely 
cost leadership, differentiation and focus based on competitive advantage. Organizations following cost leadership 
strategy offer lowest price in the industry by utilizing technological efficiency and economies of scale.

5. Conclusions 
Organizational information systems forms the backbone of organizations. In this paper, we particularly 
emphasize on manufacturing organizations. The operating and production strategy varies for different groups 
depending upon the market segment they target, prevailing environmental conditions and company’s philosophy. 
The IS/IT system plays a significant role in supporting the organization’s strategic decisions and implement related 
operations. This work tries to draw a relationship between organizational and manufacturing strategy and kind of IS 
flexibity required to sustain in the competitive environment. The developed theoretical framework can be further 
empirically investigated for insights.

Abstract 
Since the work of Lotfi Zadeh in 1965, the fuzzy logic continues to interest researchers and industrialists 
who gather around the ""theories of uncertainty"". The ramifications of fuzzy logic extend to fields as varied 
as control, the diagnosis of complex systems, bioinformatics, decision support. Research work is done in 
bio-informatic field where a system for decision support of anesthetic depth fuzzy basic. This study was 
carried out under general anesthesia with propofol. We use in our work some parameters influencing the 
patient's condition during the course of surgery to control their effects on the depth of general anesthesia 
by fuzzy logic. In this paper, we propose using the environment MatLab R2017a to realize this application. 
A comparison between the predictions of the anesthesiologist and anesthetic predictions according to fuzzy 
logic of our work is done. This study will serve as a guide in developing new anesthesia control systems 
for patients.

1. Introduction
The knowledge whose humans have about the world is almost never perfect. This is why it is important to be able to 
express a set of uncertain and insecure information in a system driven from a set of rules and knowledge using 
developed methods and techniques. These techniques are based on computer tools that combine artificial intelligence 
methodologies such as fuzzy logic, expert systems [1]. The fuzzy logic aims to formalize and implement the reasoning 
of a human. For this, it is classified in the artificial intelligence field [2], [3], [4]. The anesthetic management of a 
surgical patient is a process that relies on the experience of an anesthesiologist, since currently there is no direct means 
of assessing a patient's level of consciousness during surgery. The decision for the initial anesthetic level is generally 
made by using the recommended drug dosages based on various patient characteristics, such as age and weight. The 
anesthesiologist determines any subsequent alteration in the anesthetic level by observing signs from the patient. These 
signs, the indirect indicators of the depth of anesthesia (DOA), may include changes in blood pressures or heart rate. 
[1] Depth of anesthesia (DOA) for a patient can change according to anesthetic agent and characteristic properties of
a patient such as age, weight, etc. During the surgery, depth of anesthesia of a patient is determined by the experience
of anesthetist controlling of many parameters. For this reason, an inappropriate depth of anesthesia could be applied

7. Conclusion  
 
According to the study of the case we have chosen, we confirmed the importance of the studied parameters to the 
study which is AGE and WEIGHT and how the doses of the anesthesia are very related to these parameters. Thus, we 
observed a sharp decrease in anesthetic doses by the fuzzy system compared to the choice of anesthetists in references, 
and that the fuzzy system is powerful to imitate the decisions anesthetists. Fuzzy reasoning gives good results in 
relation to Boolean reasoning, or other systems, especially in continuous phenomena that had no choice to be treated 
only by rigid systems that accept only two cases: confirmation of the phenomenon or its negation. Our perspective is 
to install this type of fuzzy decision system at the surgical blocks of hospitals and its exploitation for a better decision 
and the availability of the service offered even if the anesthetist doctor is absent in case of emergencies.

Abstract  
 
Based on the frequently unanticipated occurrences of natural landslide disaster across Malaysia, it can be 
seen that Malaysia is still not fully prepared for occurrences of natural landslide disaster. The lack of 
predictive and warning systems for the disaster in the country is creating panic and apprehension among 
citizens alongside with both economic and property losses. The general objectives of this research are: to 
identify the meteorological factors that cause landslide natural disaster occurrences in Malaysia and to 
develop a predictive model for landslide disaster occurrence in Malaysia. This research therefore explored 
modelling disasters occurrences in order to predict, warn, and prevent huge impact of landslide disasters 
in Penang, Malaysia. This research shall make use of data from Malaysian Meteorological department 
considering climatic parameters such as daily mean temperature and daily rainfall only.  Data mining and 
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) shall be developed to predict landslide disaster occurrences in 
Malaysia.  Thus, the need for a predictive model for occurrence of landslide natural disaster is imperative 
to the safety of lives and protection of both environmental and economy of the region.

for Standardization) 14001 certified manufacturing firms in Malaysia. Self-administered surveys were 
used to gather data and information for the study from 722 organizations operating in Malaysia. Statistical 
Package for Social Science (SPSS) was used to analyze the data. The results identify significant 
associations between technology integration and sustainable performance from the perspective of 
economic, environmental and social performances. Technology integration has always been significant 
predictors of sustainable performance as it is a necessity and key driver in most industries toward 
environmental achievements in manufacturing firms. The findings from this study provide some 
specificity to relationship that had been illustrated and explained previously in a conceptual framework. 
Technology integration has been found to have a positive relationship with three dimensions of 
sustainable performance (economic, environmental, and social). A basis for future research and practical 
application are provided by a framework of identified associations to improve the sustainability 
performance.

Abstract  
 
Public administration nowadays seeks to increase the effectiveness of the internal administrative 
processes in order to offer a higher degree of service towards the citizens. The way governments achieve 
this is by actually focusing on “e-government,” the use of the Internet to provide public services to 
citizens. E-government makes public agencies and organizations more approachable for citizens giving 
access to a variety of services and processes from their home. Fortunately, besides this being no easy task, 
governments can take a tip from the private sector and utilize Business Process Management (BPM) in 
order to maximize their results. Business Process Management consists of identifying and enhancing 
business processes in order to establish more effective, efficient and more capable of adapting to an ever-
changing environment organizations. In the public sector, authorities have huge service overlaps because 
the ability to share knowledge about business processes is very limited resulting in a plethora of waste, 
costs, errors and delays when performing activities. BPM becomes the cornerstone of the rationalization 
of the public sector showing us that technology can be utilized in order to facilitate our interaction with 
government services and at the same time simplify the ways in which public processes are executed.

Abstract 
In this paper, we present an experimental procedure that involves a collection of 
mathematical and statistical techniques to optimize the performance of a structured light 
shape reconstruction system. Four factors were studied: the distance between the centers 
of camera´s lens and projector´s lens, the normal distant between reference plane and the 
camera, fringe patterns period on the reference plane and the angle of the projector with 
respect to the surface where it is placed. The response variable analyzed was the 
difference between the reconstructed dimensions and the reference objet dimension, we 
used the cross-section and calculate the root mean square error. The aim was to determine 
the factors levels arrangement that improve the performance of the phase measuring 
profilometry system.

Abstract 
 
Many complex problems are commonly tackled decision-makers to propose a decision as a solution. 
Many of these problems are needed expertise of Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to be solved. 
But any of MCDM methods have some limitations and lacks. In this study as a qualitative research 
methodology tries to mention some example about these problems, based on literature review. As an 
example, Analytic Hierarchy process (AHP) is one of them which is a multi-applicable and the most 
popular method of MCDM. But, AHP method was lacking in evaluation of cluster criteria.  Therefore, 
Analytic Network process (ANP) was proposed to improve and minimize problems of AHP. Because 
ANP can present relationships between elements and told which factor is so important. But, if the 
researcher uses many numbers of factors, it will increase number of pairwise interdependency 
comparisons among them. Therefore, the results not so clear and decision maker will be complicated and 
couldn’t understand relationships very well. A group of scholars used other alternative MCDM models to 
solve this problem, such as, decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) instead of ANP 
or hybrid this method with ANP. Because DEMATEL can be evaluated extended interrelationships 
(direct or indirect) of elements and explained. To conclude, current MCDM methods are needed 
improvement based on today’s complex decision making and use hybrid methods can be one solution to 
overcome on limitations and lacks methods.

Abstract 
This paper studies the decisions of two competing firms with the risk-averse behaviors when enhancing 
environmental social responsibility (ESR). As a benchmark of two firms without investing ESR, we focus 
on the other case, that is, one of them invests in ESR. A Nash game together with the conditional value at 
risk (CVaR) to evaluate the risk-averse behavior is built to model the decisions and the optimal equilibrium 
solutions are compared under the two cases. We find that once the firm invests ESR, his price will be 
increased no matter how much his risk-averse degree is. Further, we obtain the conditions under which the 
firm will select to invest in ESR when he has risk-averse behavior and some important parameters, such as 
the cost and the demand elasticity, will strongly influence the selection of the firm’s green investment.

Abstract 
Have you ever wondered why tanks use the continuous track design instead of just 
regular wheels?  What are the advantages and disadvantages behind this design? This STEM 
project is to study continuous track design by playing the hill climb racing video game, and 
applying Minitab statistics to determine the positive and negative aspects of it. The benefit of 
this project is to research and explore an interesting topic and have fun playing video games 
at the same time. While doing the project, we will use the Mountain stage in the game, the 
stage with the most extreme terrain and assess five various cars; Hotrod, Moon lander, 
Super off-road, tank and hovercraft.  Each vehicle has a different wheel design or 
continuous track design. We will compare their performances based on the distance they 
can climb on the mountains. Our hypotheses is we want to determine whether there is 
any measurement repeatability, so that players could duplicate the similar result to prove the 
playing patterns are less-human dependent. The other objective is to determine whether 
continuous track design actually is the better wheel design with several merits to overcome the 
several challenges of the Mountain stage.  This paper will combine STEM (Science, 
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) in demonstrating the advantages of using the 
Continuous Track Design.

1. Introduction
Continuous track, also called tank tread or caterpillar track, is a system of vehicle 
propulsion in which a continuous band of treads or track plates is driven by two or 
more wheels, the large surface area of the tracks distributes the weight of the vehicle, 
enabling a continuous tracked vehicle to traverse soft ground with less likelihood of 
becoming stuck due to sinking.

3.2 Why the super off-road is the best choice 
It's very fast, which means it is easier for the super off-road to reach a longer distance. As it has 
continuous track, it is much easier for the super off-road to climb steep hills and jump over bumps 
without flipping over or crashing. With its lighter weight and spoiler to balance, it stays on the 
ground easier and balances well. 
  
4. Conclusions  
 
4.1 Conclusions 
We conducted Measurement System Analysis: passed both repeatability and reproducibility and 
designed a successful experiment to study the Car Upgrade Potential among five different cars. 
We also demonstrated the Advantages of Continuous Track Design over the Wheel Design on the 
Mountain Stage.

Relating Flexibility, Scalability and Security Issues in 
Internet of Things (IoT) To Strategy of the Firm

Abstract 
Several dimensions are available in literature for describing IT information technology. We extend the same 
to develop dimensions of IoTs. And by thorough arguments we propose that these are substantially different 
for different types of firm and/or supply chains strategy. Few interesting hypotheses are proposed. These 
have substantial implications for management. 
H1: Two or three standard IoT providers can join hands and provide flexible services (these IoTs are based on OOA 
(Object Oriented Architecture) to cost leaders (CLs) with moderate product variety. But this approach may not be 
suitable for differentiators and integrators who face higher level of uncertainty and is based on higher layered IoT (and 
these are based on Service Oriented Architecture (SoA)).   
H2. For cost leaders, load scalability will be most important. And for differentiators and innovators, generational and 
administrative (as it has higher level of complexity of work flow) scalability will more important.  
H3: Differentiators and innovators will have same schema replicated at different locations (as it has several small 
facilities that are closer to customers) but will have IoTs that will have ‘Latency’ problem (as they require frequent 
co-operation between themselves). Latency will not be a major problem for cost leaders that have functional based 
schemas, and it will be located at different places.  
H4: IoTs for cost leaders will need high level of standardization. And differentiators and innovators that are designed 
for applications across different areas (like automobiles and healthcare) standardization will NOT be possible; whereas 
IoTs for differentiators and innovators in the same industry will be a lot easier to be standardized.  
H5: The more the number of layers in IoTs, more will be the difficulty (and more costs) while implementing security. 
H6: IoTs having higher levels of flexibility (through increased redundancy) will have low ‘Latency’ problems; and 
IoTs having lower levels of flexibilities will higher levels of ‘Latency’ problems.  
IoT of differentiators and innovators are more complex than the IoT of cost leaders as former have more number of 
layers than that of cost leaders. Hence for the sake of ease in interoperability IoT hardware/software of differentiators 
and innovators will be nurtured in house. And for cost leaders, IoT hardware/software will be outsourced.  
H7: IoT hardware/software of differentiators and innovators will be developed in house; and the same for cost leaders 
will be outsourced. 
In this paper we relate IoT related dimensions to strategy types of firm and as well as supply chains. We argue that 
IoTs of cost leaders and differentiators differ widely on the dimensions of flexibility, scalability, standardization and 
security. This is a useful contribution we make. A questionnaire-based survey is underway, and we will report it in 
the future study.

Mason Chen, Stanford OHS, Palo Alto, CA 
 Abstract:  
This paper is to build an empirical model to predict the NBA team winning percentage based on their team offensive, defensive, 
and differential statistics by collecting historical data during 2003-2016.  The raw data have been standardized through Z 
transformation to remove mean and large variance bias effect. A multiple linear and step regression model was derived to predict 
the team winning record.  After trimmed the insignificant regression terms, the derived model can predict team winning percent 
with R-Square > 0.95.  The multi-linearity concerns were addressed by looking at the Variance Inflation Factor > 10.  The 
redundant terms were removed to avoid over-fit risk.  The regression model has identified 3-point Percentage, Turn Over, and 
Point per Game most critical to the team offensive efficiency.  This observation is consistent with modern basketball.  In defense, 
how to defend the rebound and opponent’s field goal percentage are most critical.  Warriors’ 2015-2016 team record has been
identified as an extreme outlier since their winning formula and team statistics are significantly different from the remaining 29 
teams. The 2nd-order and Interaction Terms were added to enhance the prediction accuracy. The nonlinearity terms have indicated 
the complexity of the basketball team behaviors.  Defense Field Goal% * Defense Point per Game was identified as the most 
significant interaction term.  Which may reflect the Best Defense is the start of a good Offense.  The model built based on 2003-
2016 data was further validated by the new season 2016-2017.  This model can provide NBA coaches and general managers how 
to draft, recruit, trade, or sign particular players to build a desired Championship team based on the winning % formula. This 
methodology can be applied to NBA play-off and other major professional sports like baseball, football, hockey, soccer.

1. Introduction
Sports are big part of our daily life.  Every major city has their professional teams and local fans are very supportive 
to their local professional players as their heroes or role models.  National Basketball Associate (NBA) is the largest 
basketball organization.  Each year, each NBA team is fighting for the playoff spot to win the championship.  This 
paper would try to formulate what could be the most deciding factors to formulate how to build a championship 
team by analyzing historical team statistics.  In major professional sports, the coach and team management are looking for 
ways to win more games to build their championship dynasty (such as Celtics, Lakers, Bulls) in order to attract more fans to 
support their business.  Sports statistical modeling analytics1, 2 is becoming a critical approach to uncover the 
winning patterns hidden in sports data collected during each game played.  The objective of this paper is to build a 
statistical model based on the past team offensive, defensive, and differential statistics in order to predict the NBA 
2016-2017 Regular Season Team Record. There are several research talks presented in MIT Sloan Sports Analytics 
Conference3-5.  These papers have used intensive Analytics to uncover players’ playing patterns and help coach
develop each player in order to create and maximize each player’s values to their specific team. Our paper will
provide the predictive methodology to be applied in the end of the regular season (April 2017).  In Figure 1, the 
authors have demonstrated the project scope of this paper: (1) use the 2003-2016 team offensive, defensive, 
differential statistics (input independent variables Xs) to build a transfer function to predict the 2003-2016 team 
record (Y); (2) use the same transfer function and 2016-2017 team offensive, defensive, and differential statistics to 
predict the new 2016-2017 regular season team record.

The following is the Predictive Regression Model Equation.  Authors can use this equation and the top 9 factors in 
the team Offensive, Defensive and Differential Statistics to predict the Team Record Performance for any particular 
year. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Authors have successfully built a predictive model which can predict the NBA Team Winning Record based on the 
top 9 team statistics records.  Authors have addressed the model adequacy such as multi-collinearity (VIF), residual 
outliers, interaction terms, R-Sq vs. R-Sq (Adjusted), and residual analysis (normality, equal variance, 
independency).  This paper has shown the power of applying the statistical regression model to predict the winning 
pattern.  This paper can be further expanded to consider several situations such as player injury, match-up between 
two particular teams.

Abstract 
Many people like eating chocolate, but may have some concerns on health risk, especially to people with 
Cardiovascular or Neurovascular diseases. The objectives of this paper are to use Multivariate Statistics to define a 
health biometric on choosing a healthy chocolate to patients with heart disease. Chocolate, made from cocoa beans, 
contains flavonoids which contain antioxidants. Flavonoids are the most abundant polyphenols in human diet. 
Polyphenols have antioxidant properties which can prevent aging and is also beneficial to heart disease and diabetes 
patients. People with heart diseases should eat less of saturated fat, trans fat, sodium, and cholesterol. They should 
eat more dietary fiber. Cocoa flavanols promote healthy blood flow circulation from head to toe. The heart, brain, 
and muscle depend on a healthy circulatory system. Data has been collected on 20+ chocolate ingredient contents 
from 60+ different types of chocolate. Multivariate correlation study has found that (1) strong negative correlation 
between Cocoa and Sugar, and (2) strong positive correlation between Diet Fiber and Iron. Most dark chocolate 
contains more cocoa, and less sugar. Dietary fiber and iron are high in correlation because of the high cocoa percent. 
The above two correlations can be further explained by conducting the Hierarchical Clustering Analysis on 
separating the Dark Chocolate, Milk Chocolate and White Chocolate. The Cocoa and Calcium are the deciding 
factors to separate these three Chocolates. Based on Chocolate Science. These healthiest chocolate can actually help 
prevent heart disease. The same approach can be applied to help people with other diseases (cancer, 
diabetes...).  In Big Data World, the Multivariate Statistics can help connect different data and explain the Science in 
a predictive or/and empirical modeling.

1. Introduction and Research
Many people like chocolate, but most have some concerns that chocolate is unhealthy. Are they sure whether eating
chocolate is unhealthy? The objectives of this paper are to find out if eating chocolate is unhealthy, especially what
diseases can be prevented by eating chocolate, and why can chocolate prevent those diseases, what nutritions let
chocolate prevent those diseases, and how we can select the best chocolate for preventing those diseases.
1.1 Adopt STEM Approach 
Author has decided to deploy STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) methodology. All 4 STEM 
elements are critical to making this project successful. The following is the breakdown of four STEM elements. The 
science studied was cocoa bean nutrition, flavonoids, flavanols, and antioxidants. Understanding this chemistry 
science and foods science is useful when defining the project objectives and scope.  Technology is the chocolate 
manufacturing process to produce the chocolate from coca beans. Systematic engineering problem solving 
techniques such as 5 whys were deployed to understand the root cause analysis. JMP Statistics, Graphical Analytics, 
Data Mining tools are conducted to analyze the chocolate science and product complexity in order to establish a 
Chocolate Health Index. 
1.2 Literature Research 
Is chocolate really unhealthy?  In Fig.1, the chocolate consumption and the median life expectancy was 
plotted side by side [1]. The countries on the left are the world’s biggest chocolate consumers in 2015. The number
on the right is the median life expectancy for those countries. If chocolate is unhealthy, then the median life 
expectancy will go down from top to bottom. However, there is no significant correlation, and therefore according to 
this chart, chocolate has not been proven unhealthy.

This section will analyze the chocolate health index distribution and understand on how to choose better chocolate 
products, especially for patient with heart disease. The top four healthiest chocolates for heart disease were found in 
this paper. JMP software tools such as cluster analysis, correlation analysis, and distribution analysis were all 
applied to this project. Cocoa science, such as cocoa production, flavonoids, antioxidants, flavanol benefits, and the 
different types of chocolate, was learned throughout this paper. STEM approach is applied effectively to define the 
project scope by taking systematic scientific literature and engineering problem solving techniques. Further research 
may consider different health indexes for other diseases (cancer, diabetes, etc). The STEM approach could be 
applied more in daily life. The other opportunity is that antioxidants and flavonoid science will be further researched 
and proven through STEM framework.

Abstract 
 
Lean techniques have yet to extend to the majority of manufacturers in developing countries where 
traditional work practices are dominant and cultural resistance to change is high.  This research consists 
of a case study about a Lean implementation at a clothing manufacturer in a developing country.  
Production wastes are identified and appropriate lean techniques, namely Total Productive Maintenance, 
Kanban and Supermarket Pull, are used to eliminate or reduce them.  The potential impacts on the 
manufacturing system are first assessed using a system dynamics model.  The modeling results showed 
that system performance, in the form of reduced work-in-process, is improved by 34% on average starting 
immediately after the lean intervention, which was replicated by a similar trend in practice.  A similar 
improvement trend was achieved with the actual implementation of the selected lean techniques.  And 
since lean improvements are typically difficult to sustain over the long term, the system dynamics model 
is simulated over a 6 months period to ensure the achieved benefits are sustained.

1. Introduction 
 
The worldwide fashion industry is one of the most competitive sectors of the global economy where a vast number 
of manufacturers compete without geographic boundaries, producing countless product varieties at an extremely fast 
pace, and for smaller and smaller profit margins.  In such an environment, efficiency has long been a must, making 
the use of process improvement methods essential at all levels, from production operations to supply chain 
management.  Lean manufacturing is one of the most popular methods for continuous improvement across all stages 
of a production operation, focusing on minimizing wastes in production time and effort, and maximizing 
productivity such as production throughput and product quality.  However, one of the biggest challenges facing lean 
success is sustaining the performance improvements over the long run (Rymaszewska, 2014) due to a variety of 
problems.  Some of these problems are well known, such as cultural resistance to change (Oudhuis and Olsson, 
2015) and the lack of management commitment to lean (Salge, 2008), but other problems are unpredictable and are 
due to the complexity of large-scale manufacturing systems.  Such problems are best understood with the use of 
systems thinking and system dynamics (SD) modeling, especially when the purpose is to identify the problem and 
its root cause rather than to patch up the visible negative impacts (Meadows, 2008).  The use of system dynamics to 
model lean manufacturing operations has had little attention in the literature.  In this work, an actual lean 
implementation is conducted for reducing work-in-process (WIP) at a children’s apparel manufacturer in a 
developing country.  The manufacturer experiences internal inefficiencies due to management and production 
problems, and external challenges in the form of fluctuating demand.  In this study, an SD model of the production 
process is developed in order to simulate the impacts of complementary lean techniques on system performance over 
the long-term.  The performance of the implemented lean improvements was monitored over a period of 3 months in 
order to ensure the improvements are sustained.

Figure 5: Total WIP in the current state and lean future state 
 
As the figure shows, the WIP levels prior to lean implementation are continuously increasing over time, making it 
necessary for the manufacturer to continually acquire additional storage space, foregoing substantial investment 
money locked in inventory and being forced to regularly clear excess inventories at very low costs.   
 
In the future state simulation, total WIP is reduced by 34% on average over the first 3 months starting immediately 
after the lean intervention.  Furthermore, while the sudden disruptions at days 13 and 30 significantly impact system 
performance in the current state, these impacts are drastically dampened in the future state, as can be seen from the 
narrow range of fluctuations in the future state curve. 
 
Actual improvement levels of the lean implementation in the factory were monitored over the first 3 months and a 
similar trend to the modeling results was observed in practice, with an average 8567 ± 902 pieces compared with the 
simulated average of 8,373 ± 862 pieces. This amounts to an actual net reduction in WIP of 31% on average over the 
first 3 months.  And since the modeling results were sustained beyond 3 months as shown in Figure 5, no further 
monitoring was necessary on the factory floor, showing that system dynamics modeling can effectively serve to 
verify the long-term sustainment of the lean initiative in practice. 
 
7. Conclusion and future work 
 
This paper illustrated the use of system dynamics modeling to simulate the impacts of a lean manufacturing 
initiative at an apparel manufacturer facing several efficiency challenges.  The initiative targeted the reduction of 
WIP in the factory and the main lean techniques used were Total Productive Maintenance, Kanban and Supermarket 
Pull.  An SD model was built to represent the production operation and assess the impacts of the lean intervention 
before implementing it in practice.  Modeling results showed a net reduction in WIP of 34% on average over the 
first 3 months, and the actual lean implementation showed a similar decreasing trend and a net average reduction of 
31% in WIP over the same period. 
 
The simulated improvement results were sustained for a simulation period of 6 months, and since the actual 
improvements in the factory showed a similar trend, only 3 months of monitoring were necessary on the factory 
floor to ensure the sustainment of the lean intervention.  This shows the usefulness of system dynamics modeling for 
validating the long-term sustainment of lean implementations in practice. 
 
In conclusion, the study showed that SD modeling can be useful in testing the potential benefits of a lean 
intervention prior to actual implementation, especially for ensuring that the achieved benefits are sustained over the

as in different contexts in order to generalize the results of this study.

Abstract  
 
This paper considers a single echelon inventory system with two retailers. We assume that when a 
stockout occurs at one retailer, its demand can be fulfilled from the other retailer. This policy is known as 
emergency lateral transshipment. Using emergency lateral transshipments can be beneficial in order to 
improve service levels and to reduce system costs.  This problem has been studied in the past using 
stochastic optimization, which needs full knowledge of the demand distribution. We assume that the 
distributional information on demand is not available, and it is only known that the demand in each period 
of a finite planning horizon takes a value in a known interval. The robust optimization is a powerful 
approach in dealing with this situation. In this paper, we first propose an inventory control model for 
emergency lateral transshipments. Then, to deal with the uncertainty of the demand, we apply a robust 
optimization approach through formulating a robust linear programming model. Moreover, resorting to 
duality theory, an equivalent robust optimization model is obtained which allow the solution to be 
delivered more efficiently.

Abstract  
 
The speedy progression of e-commerce has complicated its logistics operations especially when it comes 
to cross-border e-commerce logistics. Once the cargo has been delivered to the recipients in their 
individual countries, intricate operational issues occur such as problems with taxes, the exchange rate, 
local and transnational logistics, etc. This study aims to develop an optimization model to tackle the 
issues of cross-border e-commerce logistics. Specifically, this proposed model minimizes operational 
costs as well as identifies optimal shipping routes and product types within the regulation framework of 
cross-border logistics. Moreover, a numerical study has been established based on a cross-border e-
commerce business model of a Taiwanese online shopping website that imports Korean products. This 
numerical illustration reveals the following findings. First, since the import duty tax and the exchange rate 
both have an effect, every cross-border logistics with the combination of product types and volumes 
should be carefully arranged. Second, due to high international transportation costs, incentive strategies 
with low-cost deliveries can benefit both customers and e-commerce firms. Finally, since inventory costs 
play an essential role in cross-border e-commerce logistics, the purchase of goods from overseas countries 
can be postponed until it has been specifically ordered.

Abstract 
 
Developers of product configuration systems (PCS) act as designers, albeit often not recognizing they are 
performing in a design process. These developers face challenges in developing and implementing PCS as 
the main enabler of mass customization. Main difficulties occur in knowledge management (KM) stage 
for domain experts and the configuration team as the internal stakeholders or users. Design Thinking (DT) 
is a human-centered approach that includes a wide perspective of stakeholders and aims at enhancing 
human experience and solving complicated problems. Therefore, it can be used to solve this challenge of 
KM in configuration projects which is mainly related to communication within the organization by 
following a systematic, iterative design approach. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to review the 
literature of DT to gain deeper understanding of its characteristics, processes and components. Secondly, 
to apply the findings from literature regarding DT to the KM stage in PCS. The authors’ ultimate goal is 
to outline what the contribution of DT to PCS can be and discuss its importance in promoting the 
collaboration and communication of knowledge within the organization.

Abstract 
 
Service modularity has been attracting growing interest in the last decade, especially in how modularity 
can benefit service research and service providers. The application of modularity concepts in service 
context has been discussed as a way to achieve benefits such as increased variety, economy of scale, and 
decreased lead times. Nevertheless, although the literature suggests that service modularity can positively 
influence service performance, the research on the evaluation of service modularization results is still 
scarce. The assessment of service modularity results is necessary for the application of modularity 
concepts in service organizations by demonstrating the potential of modularization in achieving benefits 
and improvements. Therefore, this work proposes an approach to assess service modularity results based 
on the performance measures from modularity literature. These modularity performance measures should 
be selected and prioritized according to service characteristics, to assess the modularization outcomes.  
The results are valuable for proving the benefits related to service modularization and providing a holistic 
view of modularization outcomes. Further work involves expert assessment concerning the proposal and 
fieldwork by simulating a healthcare service within a modular scenario.

1. Introduction 
 
The growing importance of service sector in the global economy and international trade in services led to increased 
competition among service providers (Gleich et al., 2017). In this scenario, organizations face pressures to offer 
effective, efficient and personalized services (Avlonitis and Hsuan, 2017; Brax et al., 2017). Service modularity has 
emerged as a solution to this challenge, offering performance efficiency and lower costs due to the improved 
operational and functional flexibility (Voss and Hsuan, 2009; Brax et al., 2017). 
Modularity refers to the decomposition of a complex system into simpler parts that may function independently 
(Chorpita et al., 2005; Voss and Hsuan, 2009), which can be mixed and matched to address the customer needs 
(Hsiao et al., 2015). Service modularization has the potential to achieve benefits such as cost savings, enabling 
customization, fostering service innovation, increasing module performance and quality, and expanding options for 
the development of new services (Dörbecker and Böhmann, 2015; Iman, 2016). 
Given these benefits, the research on service modularity has attracted attention in the last decade (Eissens-van der 
Laan et al., 2016), and its application has been explored in different service contexts. Nevertheless, although the 
literature suggests that modularity can positively influence service performance and service delivery processes 
(Pekkarinen and Ulkuniemi, 2008; Lubarski and Poeppelbuss, 2016), the research on the evaluation of these benefits 
is scarce (Iman, 2016; Brax et al., 2017). 
In this sense, this paper proposes an approach for assessing the outcomes related to service modularization. This 
proposal is based on the definition of performance measures, based on product and service modularity literature (e.g. 
Otto and Hölttä-Otto, 2007; Böttcher and Klingner, 2011; Peters and Leimeister, 2013). The development of 
measures of service modularization, representing measurable goals, has the potential to direct studies to better 
methods and models for the design of modular services (Dörbecker et al., 2015). Therefore, the purpose of this 
proposal is also to demonstrate an overview of the modularization outcomes and to identify actions that may be 
applied to improve the service performance.

Ei: Effect [1 or -1] 
 
This evaluation also depends on the organization's historical data, or even on an ideal value for comparing the 
current situation (modular) with the previous one (or similar integral situation). By analyzing the modular scenario 
compared to the previous one may indicate opportunities for improvement for the organization. After presenting the 
proposal, attention is turned to the conclusions of this study. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
The proposed approach aims to address the gap concerning the testing phase of service modularization (the 
modularization phases were presented in section 2) since the literature on the assessment of modularization results is 
still scarce. The approach may be suitable for providing an overview of the service modularization effects, based on 
the analysis of performance measures. The results of this proposal may be valuable to identify improvements in the 
service provision and process. Conclusively, the results are useful for proving the benefits of service modularization 
and providing a holistic view of modularization outcomes, which may be valuable since the existing studies consider 
few evaluation criteria. Regarding practical contributions, the evaluation of modularization effects aims to support 
the development and implementation of modularity in service offerings, allowing project teams to assess whether 
the objectives pursued with modularization are achieved. Moreover, the results may help the practitioners in the 
decision-making process, demonstrating aspects that should be changed in the service offer/provision. The 
understanding of how to evaluate the modularization results as well as the demonstration of benefits achieved can 
also contribute to increasing the number of practical applications, which is also a research gap. 
Similarly to any other study, this one suffers from limitations. Firstly, the proposal scope is limited to the testing 
phase of modularization. Thus, further studies could consider other modularization phases (analysis of a service 
system, module and interface creation, and testing). The purpose application is also limited since it depends on the 
availability of organization's historical data, or even on an ideal value for comparing the current situation (modular) 
with the previous one (traditional scenario). Furthermore, the proposal would also be refined by the prioritization of 
performance measures using multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDM) techniques or a combination of MCDM to 
assign weights and rank them accordingly. Moreover, this approach aimed to be generic, but by considering the 
service heterogeneity, some adaptations to service characteristics of specific service types (e.g., health services and 
logistics services) must be necessary, which may improve the service assessment. Finally, this study has limitations 
regarding the assessment of this proposal, because it was constructed based on theory. The next step of this work is 
the proposal assessment by experts in addition to its application with real data of health service modularization.

Abstract  
 
The industrial sector has traditionally utilised energy models and control and monitoring software for 
energy system evaluation and optimisation. A limitation of this approach is that the focus is primarily on 
manufacturing processes, not necessarily providing a comprehensive enterprise evaluation. The non-
manufacturing activities require evaluation as the contributions of associated services such as technical 
building services, ICT and other on energy demand continues to increase.  This limitation is especially 
concerning for Multinational Manufacturing Corporations (MMC’s) with business sites across various 
geographic locations, which can vary from manufacturing to warehousing to corporate. This research 
introduces the Process Centric Energy Model, which utilises business processes for energy evaluation and 
optimisation at MMC’s. MMC’s conduct business by enablement of business processes, which supports 
the energy evaluation of any business activity on any site. The concept and methodology of application of 
the Process Centric Energy Model is demonstrated with the procurement and electroplating business 
processes. The results demonstrate that business processes can be applied for energy quantification and 
optimisation of both manufacturing and non-manufacturing business activities, thus providing a 
comprehensive MMC energy evaluation.

1. Introduction  
Historically as economic growth increased energy related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions increased, however the 
delinking between economic growth and GHG emission is being observed (IEA, 2015). However, even with this 
observed change, the IEA has stated that energy is central to combatting climate change, as energy production and 
use is accountable for approximately 67% of global GHG emissions(IEA, 2015). The IEA reported that industry was 
accountable for 38% of global final energy consumption and 24% of the total CO2 emissions in 2014 (IEA, 2017).  
 
McKinsey and Company have reported that manufacturers have the potential to reduce production energy 
consumption by approximately 20 - 30% (Mohr et al., 2012). Thus this study focuses on the manufacturing sector 
with specific reference to Multinational Manufacturing Corporations (MMC’s). MMC’s encounter challenges with 
energy quantification, thereby hindering optimisation opportunities, which include(Munsamy and Telukdarie, 2016): 
 
Business sites across various geographic regions spanning international borders. 
 
Sites with varying business activities ranging from manufacturing to warehousing to distribution to 
corporate.

6. Conclusion 
 
To achieve the “below two degree” rise in global temperature, industry has to be a leader in the reduction of energy 
use and CO2 emissions. MMC’s encounter challenges to energy quantification and optimisation due to inherent 
complexity and the lack of a MMC specific tool.  The desktop review of non-industrial and industrial energy models 
revealed its limited applicability to MMC’s, further affirming the need for a MMC specific energy model. The PCE 
model adopts a novel approach of business processes for energy evaluation and optimisation, as all MMC’s conduct 
business by employing business processes at various levels of functional enablement. The defining features of the 
PCE model are; reproducibility, genericity, ease of use, limited user data inputs and modelling time and 
comprehensiveness. The paper demonstrated the concept and methodology of application of the PCE model by 
application to the procurement and electroplating business processes. The results demonstrate that business 
processes can quantify and optimise the energy demand of both manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities of a 
MMC. However, this is the initial stage of development, with the fully enabled PCE model providing a holistic and 
integrated methodology for MMC evaluation and optimisation. Detailed application of the PCE model is expected in 
in the sequel paper, following the enablement and validation of the PCE model.

Abstract 
 
All industries benefit from product standardization and modularization in order to automate the sales and 
production processes. The Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry is lagging behind 
due to the challenges it is faces with compared to other industries. The literature discusses how to apply 
modularization in construction industries, however, what seems to still be missing are guidelines and case 
examples for both researchers and practitioners. In this study, we discuss two main modularization 
strategies and investigate how and where they were applied in different construction companies. This 
research benefits from comparative case studies research in order to make deductions from different 
empirical data to draw a logically plausible conclusion. The gathered empirical data and the results from 
industrial expert interviews can then be used as guidelines for the companies to analyze how and where to 
use different modularization techniques and what are the gained benefits and challenges.

Abstract 
 
In recent years, cities have been designed for vehicles and large infrastructures have been 
constructed for their circulation. As a result, vehicular congestion has significantly increased air 
pollution. Consequently, intermediate cities are looking for more sustainable mobility options 
before they face road collapse. The objective of this study was to evaluate an electric bicycle as an 
alternative mobility option in the city of Cuenca, Ecuador. The analysis was done considering 
these four aspects:  energy, environment, cost, and time. Previous work published by local city 
government was considered to determine the most representative routes taking into account how 
people moves in Cuenca. Data collection was carried out with GPS devices in order to propose a 
dynamic vehicle equation to determine energy consumption. The results were compared to light-
duty vehicles operating on gasoline. Hence, it was concluded that the electric bicycle is a viable 
option since it consumes less energy than a vehicle, emits fewer emissions, and costs less to cover 
the same distance. In near future, this information could be useful for local government to 
encouraged new mobility politics.

1. Introduction 
 
Since the 1950s, cities have been planned around vehicles with the construction of large highways, thus encouraging 
their usage in urban areas. In 2016, the United Nations held the ""Habitat III"" Conference on Housing and Sustainable 
Urban Development in the city of Quito, Ecuador, where the foundations were laid for more sustainable populations 
for the next 20 years. Complications will arise when the time comes to implement the different initiatives proposed 
by the participating countries. In the last two decades, cities have grown up to five times more than their inhabitants. 
This has created problems when providing services, since costs increase. Therefore, more compact cities, if well 
planned, require less displacement, which generates less pollution. 
 
Cities occupy a mere 2% of the earth's surface but generate 70% of greenhouse gases. Therefore, it is necessary to 
have less polluted cities and one of the options is to promote the use of public transport with bicycles as a mobility 
alternative (Monzón, Rondinella, & Equipo Investigador PROBICI, 2010). 
 
Environmental pollution in cities is a widespread problem worldwide. This is why researchers from different countries 
conduct studies and seek new technologies to mitigate the effects of less sustainable transport means. Therefore, the 
electric bicycle can be seen as an alternative transportation option due to the good results obtained by its use around

3.3 Cost 
 
The costs of using each of the means of transport was linked to the retail price of gasoline and the kilowatt hour of 
electric power (see Table 2).

With the OBD reader / recorder connected to the light test vehicles, the average consumption of 9,54 ± 1,028 liters / 
100 km was determined. Thus, covering the average route of 6.5 km cost $0,24 with regular gasoline and $0,38 with 
premium gasoline. That is, the kilometer traveled would have cost $0,04 and $0,06 with regular and premium, 
respectively. These costs did not include vehicle maintenance. 
 
Therefore, traveling 6,5 km by electric bicycle cost $0.01 (not including maintenance costs). With respect to the 
expenses, it was determined that maintaining a bicycle was much cheaper than a vehicle. 
 
3.4 Time 
 
Transfer time was a decisive factor when moving from one point to another. In the analysis routes with an average of 
6.5 km, the duration of the trip was 36,81 minutes on a conventional bicycle (without assistance), 18,75 minutes on 
an electric bicycle, and 15,18 minutes on a light vehicle (see Figure 6).  
 
Figure 6. Average travel time on a 6,5 km route 
 
4. Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
After conducting tests with an average route of approximately 6.5 km, it can be concluded that the bicycle is a feasible 
alternative for mobility in the city of Cuenca, Ecuador. In energy terms, it consumes 40 times less energy than the 
light vehicle, which in most cases is underutilized. Moreover, the electric bicycle uses 0.99 ± 0.004, while a vehicle 
equipped with an ignition combustion engine consumes 3.950 ± 0.227 kWh / route. This represents a 97% difference. 
Therefore, in this aspect, the use of the electric bicycle is certainly viable. 
 
In terms of carbon dioxide emissions, there was a significant difference between the two means of transport, even 
though an electric bicycle that charges its batteries from a thermoelectric plant emits 55 times less than a vehicle. 
Were the load to be made from a renewable source such as hydroelectric, as is the case in our country, the difference 
would be much wider. A vehicle emits 1502.92 ± 26.85 gCO2 / route and an electric bicycle 27.21 ± 1102 gCO2 / route.

Another important factor to consider is the cost of using each type of transport. The route by vehicle costs $ 0.24 
USD/route with regular gasoline and $ 0.38 USD/route with premium gasoline. Therefore, the kilometer traveled 
would cost $ 0.04 USD / km and $0.06 USD / km with regular and premium, respectively. On the other hand, traveling 
by electric bicycle costs $0.01 USD / route and 0.0015 USD / km. It should be noted that maintenance was not 
considered in either case. The difference in cost is 95%, which favors the bicycle. 
 
In contrast, in the case of travel time, vehicles have a slight advantage. The duration of the trip in a vehicle was 15.18 
minutes, while cycling was 18.75 minutes; this represents a difference of 19%, which equates to 4 minutes 
approximately. In sum, the results obtained show a high possibility that the vehicle can be replaced by the electric 
bicycle to circulate around the city. 
 
It is recommended that research projects such as these be shared with authorities dedicated to the planning and 
development of intermediate cities, with the aim of building more sustainable cities.

Abstract 
 
Despite the developments on human health and hospital management sciences, many health risks 
in hospitals should be well-thought-out; especially Nosocomial Infection (NI) (which is acquired 
by patients during hospitalization period). NIs add huge financial burden for patients, healthcare 
facilities, and society, raise patient mortality rates, prolong hospital stays, increase resistance to 
antimicrobials, and etc. It is studied and verified by previous researchers that a hospital 
management could play a noticeable role to control NI. However, the hospital management, 
hospital architecture, and ways of microbiological infection control are still demanding more 
studies and developments to be able to omit the NI risks. There is a need for more studies with 
the focus on minimizing NIs risks. This research has benefited from a qualitative research 
method, reviewing the existing literature, to list some of the critical factors in field of hospital 
management to prevent NI risks. Therefore, it is found that there are different criteria which need 
to be considered by hospitals and healthcare managers in cooperation by hospital architects. 
Some of the factors which the literature suggests are suitable equipment and their possible 
locations, light, air ventilation, functional distance between patients, ward types and designs. 
However, from the result of this study, the authors would like to highlight their finding on the 
importance of hospital architectural layout and their wards’ places or configuration of them to 
minimize NIs. To rephrase, architectural layout design of hospitals and their wards places or 
configuration of them could moderate the NIs rate, increase speed of patient recovery and 
financial profit etc. Therefore, the finding of this research, as a hypothesis, could be explored 
more by future studies.

Abstract 
 
Energy consumption has been increasing rapidly in the world. That is why production of energy from 
renewable resources is getting more and more important today. Hydroelectric power is the largest source 
of renewable electricity generation in the world. Countries that have large resources of hydropower use 
hydroelectricity as a base load energy source because of its secure and reliable energy production. 
Maintenance scheduling in energy production plants is very crucial since any unexpected malfunction 
leads to very serious economic losses. It is essential to decide how and when to perform maintenance 
activities for power plants, especially if they are among base load electricity producers. The control gates 
are one of the vital components in hydroelectric power plants which control the movement of water. In 
this study, we formulate the maintenance problem of control gates using Markov Decision Processes. Our 
aim is to find an optimum maintenance policy for the gates by considering maintenance related losses 
such as equipment cost, lost sales and time spent during maintenance. We create and analyze different 
scenarios based on the physical conditions of the plant and cost structures.

digitalization, which is now becoming a major component of the business environment. The study is also 
intended to create awareness and prepare the organization as well as its stakeholders for this new 
digitalization era. A mixed method research approach was adopted.  The researcher has selected a simple 
random sample of 50 employees to complete the research questionnaire.  It was established that there 
were several barriers such as an improper digital strategic plan, stakeholder engagement and lack of 
communication, which tend to inhibit the digitalization process.  Additional concerns at the SA private 
organization that inhibited the digitalization process was the flow of information among all stakeholders 
concerned, regarding digital strategy such as employees, suppliers, customers and the management.  
Digitalization delivers a plethora of benefits and improves the way in which organizations engage with its 
customers.

1. Introduction  
Digitalization has become a requirement for every organization that wishes to remain competitive in the industry, 
failure to adopt new digital systems can be a harmful choice for any business entity. The arrival of the digital era has 
taken many organizations by surprise and whether these organization are prepared or not, they are absorbed in a 
“digital vortex” (Bradley et al. 2015) which disrupts the organization’s systems and structures.  This turbulence in 
the business ecosystem caused by the dawn of the digital era can be so severe to organizations if they do not set 
structures in place in order to embrace this new style of conducting business. The aim of this research study was to 
establish whether the SA Private organization was consciously aware of the need to prepare for this digital change. 
The need to adopt digitalization is not an option for organization doing business in the 21st century due to the string 
of benefits that will be derived from it. Grishikashvili et al (2014) postulates that there are several benefits that 
businesses can derive from the adoption of digitalization and these include enhanced collection of quality customer 
data, the ability to tract buying trends for customers, facilitating instant customer engagement when necessary and 
implementing effective Customer Relationship Management (CRM).

Conclusions 
The importance of digitalizing the SA Private Organization is not a subject of debate as employees and management 
were in agreement of the need for such a development at the organization. Despite the importance of digitalizing the 
organization, several barriers such as a proper digital strategic plan, stakeholder engagement and lack of 
communication tend to inhibit the digitalization process.  While some measures are said to be in place at the SA 
Private Organization, there is a worrying concern that these measures are not being brought to life as the digital 
strategy is only existing on paper. This unfortunate outcome could be attributed to the lack of leadership in 
executing the digital strategy at the SA Private Organization.  Additional concerns at the SA Private Organization 
that inhibited the digitalization process is the flow of information among all stakeholders concerned regarding digital 
strategy such as employees, suppliers, customers and the management. 
6  
Recommendations based on the study 
In view of the research findings above, the following recommendations are provided: 
 
There is need for an urgent establishment of a digitalization committee at the SA Private Organization. This 
committee will spearhead the process of creating the right environment, the right tools and skills that are ideal for 
the digitalization process. This recommendation should be implemented by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at the 
SA Private Organization as soon as possible.  The CEO at the SA Private Organization should set up a budget 
dedicated to the digital process. The budget should be established as a matter of urgency to avail resources that are 
required for this initiative.  The CEO and the digital committee at the SA Private Organization should nominate a 
digital champion as soon as possible. The digital champion will assume the role of providing leadership to the 
organization on all digital matters.  The establishment of a digitalization committee and the digital champion should 
be used as a gateway to stakeholder consultation. This initiative should be implemented by the CEO once a digital 
committee and a digital champion is nominated. Digitalization should be implemented in the interest of customers, 
employees, suppliers and shareholders for the SA Private Organization to achieve its business objective.

7. 
Proposed framework for future research. 
 
7.1 
Assessing the level of digital skills in organizations 
Future research can be conducted on assessing the level of digital skills among private companies that seek to adopt 
digital technology or that have already adopted the technology. The goal will be to spot possible skills gaps that can 
be closed by recommending appropriate training programs. 
7.2 
Establishing the effectiveness of adopted digital tools  
The process of digitalization cannot be adopted for the sake of copying what other organizations are doing, given 
that different organizations have different needs, systems and goals. Likewise, conducting a research on whether the 
adopted technologies is effective will be important. This can be measured by carrying out a before and after 
situational analysis. 
7.3 
Cost benefit analysis of digitalization 
Future researchers can also seek to conduct a research on cost benefit analysis of digital adoption. The research can 
weigh the benefits accruing to the organization against the costs associated with digitalization.

Abstract 
The real-time biggest challenges in energy balance and delivery by Virtual Power Plant System stems 
from the complex nature of the system, barriers associated with the integration of Distributed Energy 
Resources (DER) multiple sites, demand-side responses, regulatory tools, Market economics, logical and 
physical standards, networking, technical, models’ proliferation and the dynamics of current technologies; 
requiring the service of a higher digitization level. 
Industry 4.0 as the key driver of both the horizontal and vertical integration maintains real-time optimal 
energy operations, distributions, scheduling, forecasts, pricing and demand responses for enterprises, 
which performance is also constrained by cybersecurity, information networks, and protocols, 
maintenance, technical and economic.  
To satisfy these requirements for real-time energy balance, reliability, flexibility, resiliency and 
sustainability, the operational and functional systems in order to perform require automated intelligent 
distributed technologies and control interfaces, data information techniques, protocols and cloud 
platforms.  
This paper, therefore considers the technical and operational requirements of VPP supported by industry 
4.0 for interoperability and integration of DERs, optimization of Supply and Demand-side energy 
management, standards and protocols, best emerging management practices; and control strategies to 
mitigate system cyber security as integration tools to support and maximize DER benefits for the 
Stakeholders.

Integration of the system performs at its best, governed by the System uptime, response speed, and accuracy, latency 
of communication and its ability to receive and respond consistently to dispatch signals. However, IEC 61724 
describes few parameters for evaluating the performance of the systems through Weather forecast, Energy trading, 
Billing, and TSO/DSOs having data collection for a prescribed period in accordance with the standards, Via 
SCADA. This enables the execution of VPP major functions for managing energy and asset as well as local gateway 
agent, (Sharma, and Goel, 2017). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Virtual Power Plant complexity demands a concerted effort in the integration of the system, configuration, 
components variations, operational analysis and other control requirements. Critical technologies, analytical 
framework and architectural reference designs form a major tool for the integration of distributed resources. The 
integration of technical requirements, codes, applications, information, enterprise, exhibitors and enablers through 
industry 4.0 assures a value stream chain network to the Stakeholders. The use of these intelligent distributed 
technologies and control interfaces, gateways, networks, data information techniques, and wireless communications 
devices, protocols and cloud platforms to enable the flexibility and stability of future energy balance not only 
prompt good communication requirements of the VPP but also control strategies and deployment techniques 
especially in energy optimization.  
 
7. Future Work and Recommendations 
System integration forms the pivot of virtual power plant operational management. For energy flexibility, reliability 
and market pricing, emphasis shall be placed on Quality of Service, Maintenance, Critical Infrastructure. Impacts of 
cyber-attacks to the value chain, Scheduling, and Real-time analytics. Development of optimization module, 
Software technologies, the operational functions should be supported by standards and integrated frameworks.   All 
distributed energy resources must automatically synchronize to allow schedule event simultaneously take place. 
Other necessary functionalities for energy mix shall include skill resource Limitations, Key Enablers, and inhibitors, 
Interoperability. Energy Trading, Billing, Weather forecasting, Network operations and Real-time automated 
optimization.

Abstract 
Effective integration, optimization and management of energy sources, prompts careful selection of the 
intelligent systems to control and monitor the interaction and development of microgrids deployed for 
critical loads and for Cities. Due to the increasing energy demands and the stochastic nature of micro-
sources, the need for reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective energy flow becomes mandatory both in the 
business case and technical. 
To ensure the integration of distributed generations with responsive energy balance; higher power quality, 
protection, reliability, increased resiliency, sustainability, scalability and availability, there is need for 
correct real-time operations and coordination through the use of intelligent control interfaces, gateways, 
networks, data information techniques, and wireless communications devices, protocols and platforms. 
This paper, therefore, reviews the rubrics of microgrid systems of intelligent for effective energy 
integration and balance of flow from generation to distribution of grids. This article as a recommendation 
for proper energy integration further proposes Control techniques and strategy that will assure responsive 
energy supply and demand through a microgrid System.

1. Introduction
The increasing energy demand creates unexpected burden from generation, distribution and load consumption,
which effect is the depletion and costs escalation of fossil fuels. This energy degradation prompted the development
of microgrid systems that extended from the legacy grid of traditional (conventional) centralized generation control
and grid ‘2.0’ (smart grid) to a third-generation grid development called the future grid (grid 3.0). Microgrid uses
same concepts in operation, deploying micro sources (wind, solar, fuel cells and other types of variable energy for a
sustainable power flow.  However, the variability of these micro-sources, clouded by randomness in generation,

The primary role of the Control techniques is ensuring that no modification of existing tool exist even when new 
micro sources are added. Based on standard and requirements, control can be centralized or decentralized. Each 
micro source controller using a feedback control mechanism must autonomously respond effectively to system 
changes without requiring data from the loads. In power quality, the voltage signal on a power system is not 
independent of the current signals, (Hossain, et al. 2014; Whaite, et al, 2015; United States Department of Energy, 
2014). However, according to (Hernandez, et al, 2014), the overall control of microgrid operation and management 
is performed by the central controller which usually has two main functional modules, (Hernandez, et al, 2014; 
Whaite, Grainger, and Kwasinski, 2015). To minimize power loss, and cost, profit maximization, and environmental 
emission reduction various optimization techniques ranging from analytical, numerical and heuristic could be 
adopted. 
The Solution to issues and effective management of the microgrid in small or large scale is dependent on the 
development and use of cost-effective and grid-friendly converters by introducing real-time 
computer controllers that implement advanced and complex control algorithms. Again, the use fast semiconductor 
switches capable of switching quickly in milliseconds and handling high powers is suggested to maintain reliability 
and flexibility in DER energy consumptions through microgrid. 
However, due to the stochastic and des-patchable nature of RES and DG, a faster and effective heuristic control 
method called Action Dependent Heuristic Dynamic Programming (ADHDP) and/or another multi-objective 
programming method could be used in evaluating the DG impacts in system reliability, losses and voltage profile. 
5. Recommendations for Future Work
Due to many unknowns faced in the design of Microgrid and its operating system, great challenges arise in its
integration process especially in the use  and operation of control interfaces.  In order to achieve an optimized
integration of Microgrid system, the extra study should be engaged especially in Stabilization and flow optimization
of renewable energy integration. Apart from ensuring grid stability, studies on upgrading an existing fuel-generation
based microgrid with micro sources generation may assist in determining ways to maximized fuel savings and
increase the security of supply. Ways to maximized utilization and Return on Investments of renewable energy plant
should also not be overlooked.
6. Conclusion
This paper presented the basic component requirements, Energy Management system, the hierarchical control levels,
Standards and regulatory policies, the challenges and issues, and the basic control techniques that facilitate the
understanding and design of the microgrid structure that ensure energy production, distribution, optimization, and
consumption. For a better integration of micro-sources, and its intelligence generation to distribution, new software
technologies, sensors, actuators and other wireless communication networks, EMS techniques must be employed in
ensuring power reliability, quality, and stability which must be void of losses and harsh environments.  Essentially,
the control process is a derivative of energy demand, time functions, and critical load.

Abstract  
 
The 43D diesel locomotives reliability performance en route on the Phalaborwa to Richards Bay corridor 
is bound with challenges, despite the efforts of Transnet SOC Limited, a South African biggest freight rail 
company responsible for transport within the country and across the borders.  
 
This case study uses a quantitative data analysis to investigate the reliability of 43D model of the 
locomotive rail freight operating within this route in the areas of maintenance cost, the effectiveness of 
the preventative maintenance, poor of asset availability., and to identify other operational management 
issues affecting this critical asset.   
 
The findings show that the inefficiency resulted from lack of training, inadequate maintenance schedules, 
and inappropriate location where maintenance is conducted. 
 
For remediation and mitigation purposes, it is recommended that proper techniques and preventive 
practices and schedules be implemented; good frequent training and performance assessment of the 
engineers and technicians be regularly conducted. In addition, a proper review of the asset service design, 
and the location of maintenance site be overhauled in the entire value chain.

Figure 3. Component Failure Pareto Analysis 
 
5.6. Failure Mode Effect Analysis and Criticality Analysis (FMEA) 
The FMEA exercise that was conducted from the highest failing components and the outcome shows that the 
NOOP, Air Pressure, and Radio are the  most risk components prone to failure.  
 
 
6. Recommendations 
 
Based on the findings, the following are recommended: 
1. Reliability and quality to be viewed differently from each other. The South African railway industry must 
realize that reliable products cannot be achieved without quality and both factors are independent. 
2. Maintenance to be scheduled three hours from departure point 
3. Maintenance engineers to be placed at the highest locomotive failing locations because MTTR is averaging 
at 0.12 (7.2 minutes) for each component failure. 
4. Conduct proper analysis to be able to eliminate minor failures permanently before planning for major 
failures. Transnet must prioritize in its maintenance plan. 
 
 
7. Conclusion 
 
This paper reviewed the maintenance strategy adopted by Transnet. The result show that the strategy in use is good 
evident by 100% of the availability of components,  mean time between failures of 2290 hours per year, mean time 
to repair of  0.12 hours. This depicts a good run to the failure maintenance strategy management system. The result 
further show that maintenance of components is not the only challenge but locations and minor service checks are 
part of the bottlenecks.  
Management, all Stakeholders, and design engineers need to ensure that locomotives designed conform with the 
railway system standards so that the locomotives will be able to perform daily operations without facing much 
difficulties resulting from either poor infrastructure, design and modelling specifications, or system configurations 
leading to critical maintenance issues, failures and downtime.

Abstract 
Variety of Process improvement tools exist; with each having a similar goal which is to enhance 
the performance of the business. Total Productive Maintenance (Total Productive Maintenance) is not 
only a maintenance strategy, but also a business improvement tool that companies use to remain 
competitive whilst improving customer’s satisfaction and reliability.  
The purpose of this research is to understand the impact of the TPM elements and their performance roles 
on the facility as a whole.  
A South African manufacturing firm in the process of implementing TPM is studied, to assess the 
progress made during the implementation process and the learnings that come with it. The data collected 
before and after TPM implementation at the company used in this case study is used to calculate the 
availability, performance efficiency, quality rate, and the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE).  
The result showed that OEE consistently improved its value above Eighty percent (80%) from 
implementation. This improvement indicates the TPM pillars capability in enhancing business, 
underpinning these elements as crucial for a successful implementation.  
Keywords: TPM (Total Productive Maintenance), OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness), Maintenance 
Strategy, Business Improvement, Manufacturing 
1. Introduction
Most manufacturing processes are not cost effective in operation and support, this is due to low running capacities
that result in low productivity and manufacturing costs escalation (Sandelands, 1994). One of the contributing
factors to this negative outcome is ineffective maintenance practices on the plant equipment. Maintenance practices
ensure that the plant is available to operate, safe to work in, produces right product quality, and cost effectiveness.
Maintenance costs constitutes a significant portion of the operating budget of companies in the manufacturing sector
(Tsarouhas, 2007). TPM as a philosophy is therefore a collection of practices and techniques that aims at
maximizing the effectiveness of business facilities and processes where all are responsible. A Variety of process
improvement tools exist with each of these having a similar goal, that improves the performance of the business.
Process improvement tools include but are not limited to Total Quality Management (TQM), Lean manufacturing,
Six Sigma, Business process re-engineering, International Organization for Standardization(ISO) and Total
Productive Maintenance (TPM). TPM is therefore not only a maintenance strategy, but a business improvement tool
that companies can use to remain competitive and improve customer satisfaction, and reliability.

after implementation. The performance efficiency world class manufacturing target has been achieved for the three 
months, with the highest value achieved in July at 95,4% and the lowest in August at 95,1%. 
 
TPM elements are known to yield positive results when implemented correctly in manufacturing processes. Kocher, 
et al (2012) record improvement in the OEE that increased from 75,17% and 85,25% after the implementation of the 
autonomous maintenance pillar and focused improvement. These authors reported zero customer complaints and 
zero accidents. Similarly, this case study results show implementation of the foundational practices of TPM leading 
and managing change, environment, health and safety, teamwork, 5S, visual management, focused improvement and 
autonomous maintenance as a pillar is a consequence of consistent and an improved OEE having the lowest value at 
81,5% after implementation as shown in figure 6 and the highest at 93,3%, as opposed to before implementation 
(figure 6) with the lowest OEE value at 64,6% and the highest at 89,9%. 
 
5.  Conclusion 
The literature studied reveals that TPM implementation takes place through a series of steps known as TPM pillars 
or elements. TPM is a team based approach that thrives on the existence of these pillars [9]. The Japan Institute of 
Plant Maintenance defines TPM as an 8-pillar house or approach, but this number can change depending on the 
culture of the company, and organisational needs. TPM elements are very crucial for successful implementation. 
The elements selected for the implementation, need to address the challenges at the organisation. The TPM elements 
should be selected based on the organisational goals, in addition to allocating enough time for the actual 
implementation. Each of the TPM elements constitutes a crucial step to the overall success of the implementation of 
TPM, as each element addresses certain losses in the manufacturing process or the organisation to perform 
efficiently in all its departments.

Abstract 
 
The dynamic corporate environment has resulted in enterprise practitioners exploring optimal measures 
towards enhancing business sustainability and competitiveness. The statistical factorial technique is 
effective for experimenting with business process variables resulting in the optimal execution of business 
processes. An ideal factorial model design integrates business process variable variations, main effects 
together with interactions. A factorial model for predicting the impacts of business process variables on 
business processes is developed. Factorial methodologies serve as an effective tool for simulating 
scenario responses. The scenarios result in the desired response based on selected business variable 
effects and interactions. A framework for setting and adjusting a series of selected independent business 
process variables to obtain a dependent response (business process turnaround time) is developed. The 
factorial model allows for configurations of defined key performance identifiers based on selected defined 
metrics to quantitatively determine effects of each business process variables on enterprise operations. 
This research develops a factorial model design for predicting and evaluating what effect changing or 
combining business process variables would have on corporate operations. A factorial model case 
effectively quantifying impacts of selected business process variables on business change is developed. 
Results present a ranked layout of business process variable impacts on business processes based on 
distinct effects and interactions. Developed factorial model is efficient for large multinationals exploring 
the current and future status of business processes based on the impacts of selected business process 
variables.

1. Introduction 
Business sustainability is an essential driver to large multinationals (Jeston & Nelis, 2014 and Houy, et.al, 2010). 
This business paradigm refers to global best practice measures employed by corporate entities towards meeting 
present and future benchmark protocols relative to the execution of business functions (Thomas & Katrin, 2015). 
Business operations of large multinationals are captured based on business processes. Business processes are 
described as the collaboration of business functions (Bradford & Gregory, 2015). The literature (Medoh & 
Telukdarie, 2016) is prioritized in this research with limitations to developing an optimal statistical testing 
framework of business process variables. Medoh & Telukdarie developed a predictive model for understanding and 
testing the impacts of numerous essential business process variables on corporate functions. A framework for 
simulating the impact of business change via business process simulation and modelling techniques is explored. The 
research identified limitation in comprehensively developing an effective statistical experimental protocol for 
exploring business process variable effects on business processes. This research extends previous literature 
introducing statistical factorial techniques for comprehensively exploring impacts of distinct business process

Step 11: Model response with predictive equations 
Experimental results are adapted to develop a mathematical model representing the effects of business process 
variables on business processes (Table 10). The coefficients for each effect and interaction is determined based on a 
representative equation. The predictive equation is based on a 95% statistical significance confidence for the 
interactions and effects. At this confidence level, effect A together with interactions AB and AC are found to have 
no statistically significant effect on response. This effect and interactions are removed from the predictive equation 
representing the effects of business process variables “A”, “B”, and “C” on business processes. Literature presents a 
factorial generalized predictive equation in the form “Y = ƛ0 + ƛ1B + ƛ2C + ƛ12BC” (Mark & Patrick, 2007). 
Where “Y = predictive response”, “ƛ0 = intercept”, “ƛ1 = model coefficient of factor B”, “ƛ2 = model coefficient of 
factor C”, and “ƛ12 = model coefficient of factor BC”.

Model Coefficient of Factor BC (ƛ12)

Aligning with turnaround time outputs presented in table 10, the research defines a factorial predictive equation for 
investigated business process variables formulated in equation 1. 
 
Y = 1044.1 + 2.75B – 8.98C – 1.13BC ……………………… eqn. 1. 
 
Equation 1 is adapted to predict the effects of interactions on the response (Y) for the three investigated business 
process variables. The intercept (ƛ0) represents the line gradient indicating a rise in response (effect) divided by 
corresponding factor level iterated. The value 1044.1, therefore, indicates the mean of all actual responses.  
The model coefficient of factor B (ƛ1) and BC (ƛ12) are adapted to quantify the relative effects of the factors on the 
response (Y). The research infers from equation 1, the coefficient value of B “2.75” significantly generates a greater 
effect compared to the coefficient value of C “- 8.98” on the response. 
 
Conclusion 
This research presented an application scenario model design on the adaption of factorial techniques in predicting 
and evaluating the effects of business process variables on business processes. The research developed a factorial 
model to predict and evaluate the effect that a change or combination of business process variables will have on 
business operations. The application case explores the viability of factorial techniques to investigate business 
process variables based on defined unique metrics and identifiers. The full factorial technique is adopted in this 
research for exploring the application scenario. The output presents the optimal effects and interactions of selected 
business process variables. A representative predictive equation of the optimal effects and interactions is presented. 
This research document serves as an improvement to (Medoh & Telukdarie, 2016) presenting a factorial model or 
design of test case business process variables. The business process variables investigated are “System Resolution 
Time (A)”, “Automation (B)”, and “Business State Index (C). The research demonstrated factor effects B and C 
together with interaction effects BC are significant. Future research is essential in developing an application model

Abstract 
 
Optimizing business functions ensures corporate sustainability and competitiveness. Large multinationals 
execute business operations based on business processes. Large multinationals are constantly seeking best 
practice business process optimization measures towards enhancing and managing the execution of 
business activities. This research develops a business process optimization modelling framework for 
predicting and managing business functions. The framework is developed with considerations to 
specifying business operations in a quantifiable and independent manner. This is based on Industry 4.0 
business protocols which align with recent technological advances and smart-industry solutions. These 
are inclusive of automation, simulation, integration, interconnectivity, interoperability, decentralization, 
virtualisation, internet of things, cloud, cybersecurity, additive manufacturing, augmented reality, big 
data, and analytics. The applicability of the proposed business process optimization modelling framework 
is explicitly defined via an application scenario based on a specified set of business objective. Developed 
business process optimization modelling framework is effective in scenario options decision making 
based on business process impact variables. Results present core design and prioritization benchmarks 
relative to business priorities. Adoption of industry 4.0 business protocols based on multi-criterion 
decision-support paradigm is justified as an enhanced business-centric approach for corporate entities 
relative to predicting the impact of change on the business.

1. Introduction 
 
Business processes represent an intricate landscape of enterprise operations essential to deliver on corporate 
functionality. Business processes capture enterprise functionalities adding value by transforming corporate inputs 
into productive outputs (Becker, et.al, 2013). Continuous industrial transformations result in the development of a 
modern digital tool to bolster the management and efficiency of corporate functions. Developing these digital tools 
results in a quantum leap in the execution of business processes and an unprecedented growth in productivity for 
multinationals. This is based on the rapid implementation of smart-industry solutions throughout the business 
processes. Several literature reports on the need for an optimal execution of business processes. An enhanced 
optimization paradigm for predicting the imapct of change to automation of data information is developed. 
Developing this modelling framework to accelerate the smart-industry solutions based on industry best practices 
though compelling is achievable via the integration of industry 4.0 business enablement protocols. Business process 
optimization modelling framework presents a structure for assessing business improvement opportunities inclusive

Step 5: Select business process variables that deliver essential functions of the model 
Selects business process variables from the business process variable database based on specific business 
functionalities. Factorial or AHP methodologies is employed for ranking business process variable alternatives.  
 
Step 6: Select unique identifiers that enable the model on a virtualization basis 
Business process variables are imperative on a set of performance identifier. An example of unique identifiers for 
escalation rate business process variable is detailed in previous section of this research. The unique identifiers enable 
the business process model on a virtualization and quantification basis testing for impacts of each business process 
variable alternative on corporate change. 
 
Step 7: Select best practice benchmarks to operationalize the model 
This research adopts the simulation methodologies as a benchmark operationalisation technique. A business process 
modelling tool with simulation capabilities is selected from an enabled user interface business process modelling 
tool option database to optimally investigate the interactions and effects of the business variable alternatives on 
selected business processes. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Business processes are a major subset of enterprise operations. This has resulted in corporate entities focusing on the 
efficient optimization of business processes. Business process modelling is a global tool for business process 
optimization, evaluation, and sustainability. Large multinationals employ a variety of approaches and drivers 
necessary to develop an efficient business process optimization model. This research proposed a decision-support 
modelling framework based on industry 4.0 enablement as an enhancement to traditional business process modelling 
optimization techniques. The framework presents a flexible and enhanced analytical method for comparison, 
prioritization, and scenario option selections. An application scenario based on benchmark identifiers for review, 
iteration and optimization are presented. The predictive ability of the industry 4.0 business process optimization 
modelling framework is a key research contribution, presenting a tool for efficiently selecting scenario options based 
on business process execution and optimization. The framework allows enterprise practitioners efficiently manage 
risks, reduce business process execution time based on unique business objectives. Best practice benchmark

approaches collected from literature to operationalise the industry 4.0 business process optimization framework is 
considered. Future research can be practical on-site application of the developed business process optimization 
modelling framework specific to a business sector.

Abstract  
 
Corrosion as a major environmental deterioration phenomenon affect material infrastructures and pipes. 
The associated risks, impacts, and failures affect production and reduces return of investments globally, 
which consequence despite the commitments of Oil and gas industries results to spillage, injury, waste, 
hazard environmental degradation and damage evolution. 
  
A South African Oil and Gas company X in this case study is explored to highlight the risks associated 
with asset failures; its management due to corrosion and how to contend this mishap in the storage and 
distribution of refined oil, gas and allied products.  
 
Using a mixed research approach, preliminary results indicate a below average asset availability, an 
indication that corrosion management techniques existing in the company does not achieve the protection 
intent due to poor preventive and mitigative activities in use. 
 
Therefore, more desperate aggressive approach with approved corrosion policy, strategy, control 
standards and checks, plans, procedures and processes, structures, resources and professionals 
are required to manage corrosion in petrochemical industries.

1. Introduction 
Corrosion is the major cause of multiple fatalities and the second leading cause of asset failures in the oil and gas 
industry, (Blystone, 2015; Ratnayake, 2012). Globally, approximately $2.2 trillion economy annually is invested in 
techniques and managing of corrosion in an attempt to control its impact on the assets. Carbon steel, the most used 
metal in storage and distribution is prone to corrosion as such requires effective corrosion management (UNEP, 
1997; Koch, Brongers,  Virmani and Payer , 2007) to reduce the rate of occurrence Morshed, 2007 and loss of 
unquantifiable indirect costs in  safety  that lead to loss of life, reputational damage and threatening of license to 
operate (Hansson, 2011).  
 
Storage tanks and pipelines in company X started failing prematurely, having Loss of Primary Containment (LOPC), 
with a total of 6 out of 13 inspections done between 2013 and 2016 even before the planned inspection interval.  The 
remaining planned inspections, posed a challenge to the business as the assets failed due to corrosion effects. 
Decision to repair the assets prolonged due to budgets reallocation, which consequently extended the outages. This

Abstract 
 
This study aims at proposing a method that combines value stream mapping (VSM) and Monte Carlo 
simulation for identifying improvement opportunities in the flow of value, taking into account the 
inherent variability of the uncertainty sources. A cross-functional team was involved to draw the current 
and future state maps. Moreover, leaders were interviewed to define the most critical uncertainty sources 
of the value stream, whose variability was verified through a thirty-day in loco data collection in a 
university-hospital. These variability data were inputted into the simulation model in order to comprehend 
how the uncertainty sources impact lead time. Findings show that the proposed approach allows the 
identification of opportunities for improvement that are not taken into consideration in traditional 
application of the VSM, providing a more realistic condition of the current state.

1. Introduction 
 
Lean Production (LP), term coined in 1990s by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, refers to 
the management philosophy of increasing customer value through more efficient use of the organization's resources 
(Greef et al., 2012). LP implementation comprises five principles (Womack and Jones, 2010): specification of value 
from the customer’s point of view; identification of the flow of value; make the value flow; pull value according to 
customers demand; and seek perfection. Many companies have been aiming the implementation of LP as a response 
to an increasingly competition in a global market (Abdulmalek and Rajgopal, 2007; Woehrle and Abou-Shady, 
2010). Results obtained from LP implementation have consistently demonstrated its benefits, such as productivity 
improvement, lead time reduction, increased customer satisfaction, and others (Jimmerson et al., 2005). 
Nevertheless, there may be drawbacks in LP implementation with regard to social and human resources aspects, 
which are vital for the success of Lean Production (Martínez-Jurado and Moyano-Fuentes, 2014). 
Among the existing LP practices, Value Stream Mapping (VSM) aims to identify all the activities involved (value-
added or not) along the material and information flows of a specific product family (Womack and Jones, 2010). In 
this sense, VSM supports a systemic continuous improvement implementation in order to make the value stream 
more flexible (Jimmerson et al., 2005). VSM provides a structured method to analyze the flow of value and ensure 
that the improvement actions will be carried out at the points where there are greater opportunities and bring real 
benefits to the business (Duggan, 2002). However, it is important to highlight some limitations involved in the use 
of this practice. Tortorella et al. (2017), Tyagi et al. (2015), and Dickson et al. (2009) show the approach the VSM 
usually base their information and data collection on a deterministic perspective. In other words, along the value 
stream there are several uncertainty sources, such as inventory, processing and setup times, among others, which add 
variability to manufacturing processes (Standridge and Marvel, 2006) and undermine production management. One

4. Conclusions 
 
This study proposed the integration of a stochastic analysis of the VSM, taking into account the dynamic aspects 
usually neglected in the usual approach. The proposed method combined MCS and VSM and it is illustrated on a 
practical application in the flow of OPS from a public university-hospital. Implications of this study were two-fold: 
from the theoretical and managerial perspectives. 
First, from the theoretical point of view, the proposed method presented a complementary approach to those 
available in the literature to deal with variability in value streams. Such integration allowed the consideration of a 
more realistic scenario that drives more assertively opportunities for improvement. Furthermore, the qualitative 
analysis of the uncertainty sources criticality enabled the adaptation of the method to the contextual condition of the 
value stream under study. Second, concerning managerial contributions, the simple application of the proposed 
method might be appealing for practitioners, especially in companies whose value stream’s data are easily collected 
and pinpointed with the support of information technology. Moreover, the identification of the effects of the critical 
uncertainty sources on lead time provides managers means to systematically address variability in the value stream. 
Such improvements might entail other benefits than the ones usually foreseen by the usual VSM application. 
Among the limitations of this study, it is worth noticing that the method used to identify the uncertainty sources 
criticality can be further improved. The use of managers’ perception may be restricted to their level of understanding 
of the value stream, which mitigates the visualization of other potential uncertainties that are atypical, e.g. 
uncertainties related to non-cyclical decisions. The proposed method for considering the uncertainties also 
constitutes a limitation itself, since only MCS was used to consider the uncertainties and variability of the value 
stream. Thus, other methods that could have similar or better results were not addressed in this work. In addition, 
relatively to data collection, a used 30-day basis may have limited the analysis. Future studies that consider larger 
periods or samples could provide more extensive analysis and, hence, outcomes. Furthermore, it is suggested to 
apply the proposed method in different scenarios in order to extend its limits beyond the presented context.

Abstract 
 
This study is based on the large number of small and medium enterprises in the application of Total 
Quality Management (TQM). The lack of standardization or clarity of the quality system used in SMEs is 
rather an obstacle for SMEs in maintaining the management system. the purpose of this study is to 
analyze the application of Total Quality Management (TQM) to small and small industries in the food 
sector. After knowing the implementation result of Total Quality Management (TQM) in small and 
medium industry in food industry. The methodology used is taking primary data with questionnaires. This 
study is an empirical study using population study techniques or often referred to as census techniques in 
the data. The resulting data will be processed by the method of Structural Equation Model (SEM). The 
limitation research is the small and medium industries in the food indutries.

1. Introduction 
 
Quality has become one of the most important drivers of today's global competition (Demirbag et 
al., 2006). Living in the modern world as now requires Indonesia to meet its own needs in addition to 
exporting superior products and services. Generally the problems that occur in superior products and 
services is the productivity when generating and quality at the time the product and service is used. (Yuri 
& Nurcahyo, 2013). Quality has become a key element in the company's survival in a competitive market. 
The business success lies in the ability of a company to apply the total quality system effectively to 
maintain the quality of its products and services at a relatively minimal cost (Topalovic, 2015). 
 
It is the fact that it is also a challenge for small and medium enterprises that only compete in the 
domestic arena in a country territory, or even cover only the city area. In general, large and overseas 
corporations have almost all the advantages compared to small to medium sized businesses ranging from 
capital advantages, cost, efficiency, networking, and so on. So it can not be denied that these companies 
are able to produce very well to produce a quality product. 
 
It is generally accepted that small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play an increasingly important 
role for the global economy in countries that choose the economic system through which highly 
productive small businesses (Hill et al., 2002). Small and medium enterprises are a dynamic and growing 
sector in most economies around the world. Global economic conditions have driven the rise of SMEs

Strategic factor = 1 + 1.093 + 1,554 = 3,647 
Tactical factor = 1,472 + 1,172 + 1 = 2,644 
Operational factor = 1 + 0.908 + 1.018 = 2,926 
Financial performance = 1 + 1.068 = 2.068 
Nonfinancial performance = 1 + 1.037 = 2.037 
 
So Construct Reliability (CR) for latent constructs: 
Strategic factor = (3,647) 2 / ((3,647) 2 + 1,61) = 0,892 
Tactical factor = (2,644) 2 / ((2,644) 2 + 2,54) = 0,733 
Operational factor = (2,926) 2 / ((2,926) 2 + 0,212) = 0,976 
Financial performance = (2.068) 2 / (2.068) 2 + 0.140 = 0.968 
Nonfinancial performance = (2.037) 2 / (2.037) 2 + 2.07 = 0.667 
 
Thus latent constructs with high reliability are latent constructions. Strategic factors, tactical 
factors, operational factors and financial performance have values of 0.892, 0.733, 0.976 and 
0.968, respectively, which are above 0.70 (as required). While non-financial performance has a 
value of 0.667 CR whose value is below 0.70 (required). 
 
6. Conclusion 
From result of analysis of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), obtained result that model made 
is fit and acceptable. This can be seen from the value of GFI, AGFI, and RMSEA that have met the 
minimum limit. In addition, the value of AVE and some Construct Reability (CR) also meets the 
minimum value. 
From the calculation of CR, it can be concluded that: 
1. Most of the IKM in Indonesia have implemented TQM. This can be seen from the high value of CR 
obtained. Of the 5 latent constructs, only 1 latent construct has CR value less than 0.70. 
2. The largest CR value is in the Operational Factor, which is 0.976. This means that operational factors 
give results that small and medium industries have implemented quality management in their 
organizational processes. 
3. The smallest CR value is in Non Financial Performance, which is 0.667. This means that the lack of 
because it has not been thinking until the development of new products because it is still focused on the 
development of the industry. 
From the results of the discussion in the previous chapter, the results show that small and medium 
industries spread across Java island for operational factors are very strong. This shows that in the 
activities of the organization, the organization directly and indirectly has been paying attention in terms of 
quality. In daily production operations, employee activities show concern for quality. This has an impact 
on the company's financial performance. But it does not have a significant impact on nonfinancial 
performance. This is due to the small and medium industries focus on the development of existing 
products today and have not come to think of new product innovation. Small and medium industries are 
still focused on the development of the company to improve in terms of revenue and production capacity. 
The current research focuses on small and medium industries that do not limit the field of 
industry it runs. From this research can be further research to be more specific in the field of industry such 
as food industry, or other industries where more focus on one business area. Then for the data obtained 
can be more so it will be more valid again the results obtained. This study still lacks in terms of the 
chosen method. Further research can use other methods that can produce more detailed and in-depth 
research.

Abstract 
Industry accepted that maintenance is a key function in sustaining long-term profitability for 
organizations. In order to optimize maintenance performance, several aspects of skill and competency 
maintenance team needed to be concerned in maintenance management. Training is an important element 
in increasing skills, competency and creating high work performance culture. This research aims to assess 
impact of training to improve effectiveness of maintenance performance in order to provide information 
to formulate the right decision for the training programs. The empirical data for this research were drawn 
from some manufacturing companies in order to address the research problem. Factor analysis was used 
to test validity of the conceptual model. According to the presumption of the proposed link between 
training and maintenance, measuring the association of variable was correlation analysis. Finally, 
regression analysis was conducted to measure overall relationships that lie within the model. This 
research reveals the relationships among training and performance in the maintenance department.

1. Introduction 
Maintenance provides critical support for heavy and capital-intensive industry by keeping machinery and equipment 
in a safe operating condition (Parida & Kumar, 2006).  Basically, the maintenance function is the tactical role of 
maintaining, servicing and fixing facilities already in place (Tsang, 1998). Maintenance group is responsible for the 
development, implementation, and periodic evaluation of an effective asset maintenance plan (Mobley et al., p. 1.20, 
2008).  Since the efficiency and effectiveness of the maintenance system are essential for organizations success and 
survival, Parida and Kumar (2006) highlight the need for measuring the system performance of maintenance. 
Measurement of maintenance performance is an assessment that helps to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the 
maintenance activities (Au-Yong et al., 2014). According to Groote (1995), the competency of the maintenance labor 
force is an important factor that affecting the maintenance performance. Its mean that successful of maintenance 
performance, depend on the skill and knowledge maintenance personnel. Training will provide maintenance team 
with the additional skills and underpinning knowledge effectively to motivate and organize a multi skilled work force 
(Kempton, 1996). Khan et al. (2011), explain that training is important to enhance the capabilities of employees. 
Training will add the employee knowledge and skill, so they can apply them to their day-to-day activities (Noe, p. 5, 
2010). 
2. Literature Review 
According ISO 14224 (2016), maintenance is combination of all technical and management actions intended to 
retain an item in, or restore it to, a state in which it can perform as required. Most devices will deteriorate over time 
due to wear, fatigue, aging, and corrosion (Li et al., 2017). Maintenance is defined as a set of activities or tasks used

Abstract 
 
The Real Options Valuation allows for the consideration of possible options that are instinctively embedded 
in investment projects, in which the decision-makers have the flexibility to respond to the outcome of 
uncertainties. The business managers’ abilities to react to future market conditions tend to impact the value 
of the investment project by maintaining or improving the upside potential and limiting the downside loss. 
This process must be regulated by a decision analysis model, capable of capturing the particularities of each 
project. 
This paper presents a case study of a Moroccan infrastructure project, that had already undergone an 
evaluation, and its purpose is to review this project’s application and valuation of Real Options. The paper 
fully addresses the gaps of the previous study, provides a corrected model for an improved valuation of this 
project and a suitable use of real options. It also illustrates its application and analyzes the obtained results. 
 
Keywords 
Project Management, Investment Project, Decision Analysis, Real Options Valuation, Uncertainty. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The Real Options methodology was developed, at least partly, as a response to the inadequacy of traditional methods 
for the evaluation of capital budgeting decisions under uncertainty, namely Net Present Value (NPV). Since its 
inception in 1977, the Real Options methodology has gained acceptance among the finance community, and has been 
applied to a variety of capital investment decisions, and recently to the evaluation of infrastructure projects. 
The approach, derived from the financial option pricing theory, overcomes NPV disadvantages by allowing analysts 
to account for non-easily quantifiable elements such as managerial flexibility and strategic interventions during the 
development of a project. Accounting for these elements radically changes the nature of any investment or project, by 
incorporating flexibility into the structure of the project itself. In addition, it also corrects the expected pricing 
inaccuracies, by determining a fairer value of flexibility through the use of arbitrage pricing techniques [1]. 
Nevertheless, introducing real options valuation lays down the additional difficulty of being almost completely 
unknown to the engineers in charge of evaluating infrastructure investments, plus implementing and choosing options 
can’t be arbitrary. The mathematical complexity included in project uncertainties, as well as the difficulty of solving 
the complex mathematical models, do not make the real options valuation methods more useful to practitioners [2]. 
 
This paper aims to clarify the scientific ambiguity around Real Options (RO), and to address existing models of 
investment project analysis using this approach. It’s a review and an analysis of a case-study conducted for the 
evaluation of the feasibility and the profitability of a major infrastructure project in Morocco. This project consists on 
building a seawater desalination plant and providing for the needs of the population that will increase in the years to 
come. For this project, the study conducted by Kmad & al. [3] showed a positive NPV, however it did not appear to 
be the appropriate technique to capture the flexibilities available in decision-making, and thus underestimated the 
value of the project by neglecting to examine the positive influence of future management actions during this value.

and even similar option values are compared. We strongly advise to expand this project due to its prominent 
socioeconomic impact. 
 
As we might expect, the combined option has more value than any one of the individual options. Summation of the 
individual options may not necessarily be the same as the combined chooser option. This is because the individual 
options are mutually exclusive and independent of each other. For example, we cannot contract and expand the project 
at the same time. The value of a chooser option will always be less than or equal to the summation of the individual 
options that make up the chooser option. At each node of the binomial lattice, among the choices available, we choose 
whichever provides the maximum value; we do not add up the individual option values. 
With the chooser option, we can change the salvage value, analyze the impact of volatility, calculate the probability 
of exercising a given option at a given time. The binomial method gives us the flexibility and makes the calculations 
visible, so the results can be easily understood and communicated to management [4]. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Real options are a way of valuing infrastructure projects, which involve irreversible investment decisions subject to 
uncertainty. Whereas discounted cash flow analysis is based on fixed estimates of costs and revenues and a 
predetermined development scenario, real options focus on project flexibility (e.g., being able to defer starting a 
project, or conversely, to accelerate its development, to contract ...). Early applications concentrated on flexibility to 
overcome uncertainty on financial parameters and tended to ignore uncertainty on technical parameters (such as 
recoverable reserves) [10]. The flexibility to revise managerial and operational decisions over time in response to 
uncertain market conditions can significantly increase the value of a project [11]. 
Thus, an option has value because there is market uncertainty related to the underlying asset. The idea is that once the 
uncertainty clears, the option may be exercised and the project initiated, expanded, scaled down, or contract 
accordingly. The option lets us take advantage of the upside while avoiding the downside [4].  
The evaluation of the desalination plant of the sea water in Agadir using the chooser option and the real options 
methodology provided a much sophisticated and elaborated analysis for taking investment decisions than the early 
study using the abandon option, that drags along a bad reputation and an unrealistic application. 
This framework covered not only the valuation of real options but also the organizational, strategic, and controlling 
aspects necessary to apply real option valuation accurately. In particular, this paper focused on uncertainties 
underlying any real option and their added-value to the project’s valuation. Uncertainties are being used not only to 
identify options but also to link the interaction of uncertainties with the interaction of options [12]. More importantly, 
the real options approach is a state of mind, an ability and a desire to detect decisions that create opportunities and 
protect against setbacks, by acting on them to create value in the future and profit of the company. For a full review 
of the project we would need to consider other uncertain factors, for example, the project’s estimation of the volatility 
factor, that might trigger a substantial alteration of the valuation’s results.

ABSTRACT 
5S is a popular workplace organisation method which uses five Japanese words: seiri, seiton, seiso, 
seiketsu and shitsuke. This is to describe how a work place is to be organized to improve effectiveness 
and efficiency.  5S is applied in many fields such as FMCG, health care, banking, automobile industry 
etc. Container terminals around the world are in urge to gain competitive edge over their competitors and 
every second of their daily operations have become crucial in current business arena. This is the reason 
why the major ports worldwide are focussing on various continuous improvements techniques. The 
purpose of this research is to develop a framework that covers the two aspects of demand uncertainty for 
imported containers and addressing it with a special container stacking pattern and appointment system 
(pre gate arrangement). This sorting framework in container yard based on the 5S method also improves 
the turnaround time (TAT) of the trucks entering the terminal and improves value for their stakeholders 
eventually.

1. Introduction
The International Transhipment Terminal (ICTT) at Cochin, Kerala, India locally known as Vallarpadam
Terminal is unique in its position as it is the first transhipment terminal in India. It is also the first container terminal 
to operate in a Special Economic Zone (SEZ). It is one of the only global transhipment hubs supported by a 
hinterland that extends across the country of India, and has a captive volume of more than 8 million of TEUs. The 
vision statement of the private port operator operating ICTT focuses on continuous improvement through a culture 
of teamwork and engagement. 
The container terminals round the world are trying to achieve the competitive edge and improve their 
productivity by means of various process improvement plans including kaizen, six sigma, etc. The Kochi container 
terminal also keeps these process improvement plans as the corner stone of their daily operations.  
Implementation of 5s technique in a container terminal is challenging when compared to other process 
improvement techniques due to factors such as  

Uncertainty in demand for the containers

Involvement of third party in operation of terminals

Lack of knowledge about 5s among ground level staffs etc.

particular waterway such as depth, current and tide at any time of the day, direction and strength of wind etc.  
Maneuvering time is defined as the time duration between the point at which the pilot enters the ship and the point at 
which the first rope of ship is tied to the harbor. 
Gross berth time: The time interval between the point at which first rope is tied and the vessel is sailed is known as 
the gross berth time of a vessel. It plays a vital role in determining the productivity of a sea port. 
10. Conclusion
In truck turnaround time, it was found that the turnaround time was more for trucks with pick up laden 
mission, which further raised the overall truck turnaround time. The increased turnaround time was because of the 
re-handling of other containers in the same stack. In fact, it is not uncommon to require 3 re-handles for each import 
delivery. 
The proposed framework would reduce the uncertainty of container demand to a great extent. It also 
addresses the uncertainty that happens in two different ways i.e. demand for laden containers that has reached its 
free period end and demand for the containers that has not reached its free period end.  
First, you can setup a small ‘pre-gate’ a mile ahead of your main gate, and capture the information on the
needed import container there. This can give you maybe 15 minutes more time, which won’t help much on total re-
handles, but you can start re-handling sooner thus reducing the time the truck spends inside the terminal. 
Second, there may be patterns on pick-up time of imports you can find. For example, you may be able to 
‘guess’ the pick-up day depending on the dwell time, the bill of lading, and the trucking company supposed to pick
up the container. Then you can use that timing information in your Expert Decking configuration. However, these 
ideas won’t eliminate re-handles, but will help direct Expert Decking to make better re-handle decisions.

Abstract 
 
The customer perception plays an important role in an electricity industry growth and customer value 
generation. Until the present time, the electricity industry has been widely studied in the field of industrial 
policy/planning, but not in-depth of creating value associated with the electricity utility industry. This 
paper shows that customer value generation has drivers, which could be different according to each 
stakeholder within electricity industry, affecting its growth. Each stakeholder has different interests that 
affect decision-making process and the customer value perception in long term, which impact on 
profitability. In order to illustrate how to identify and modeling key performance drivers to evaluate 
creating value in the electricity utility industry, this study used simulation with the system dynamics 
methodology. Through simulation scenarios, this study show that, the high customer value perception 
allow to align the electricity utilities industry to create more value.  This is illustrated whit the case of 
some electricity utilities engaged in the generation and distribution in the Colombian electricity market of 
photovoltaic. The results show a new point of view that contributes to marketers and engineers in analysis 
of the relationship between the stakeholders and electricity firms.

Recently, renewable energy market has shown significant growth that has contributed in competitiveness of the

financial resources that are required, highlighting the need for marketing of the utility industry in the electricity 
sector (Paladino and Pandit, 2012). Considering that now customers are best informed and more demanding, it is a 
priority to give more value and consider the stakeholders when determining which improvements are needed

5. Conclusions  
 
This paper developed a simulation model that establishes the dynamic impact of the structure related with the 
perceived customer value for the utility industry. It is presented a framework for analysis of the solar industry that 
incorporates the effects of the perceived customer value on the customer. 
 
Although this paper not presents the effects of customer value on solar supply chain, the simulation model could be 
supported this analysis. Also, a similar strategy could be used to analyse others marketing policies, using the 
simulation approach proposed here.

Abstract 
Health care is ever more important with aging population. Assuming the number of doctors per patient is a good proxy 
for patient satisfaction, optimal investment in number of doctors may be in the form of investment in local doctors 
which requires heavy investment in universities and laboratories,and transferring foreign doctors into the country who 
require considerably higher salaries than  local doctors. No additional investment is required for foreign doctors. 
An optimal control methodology is employed to determine the optimal investment plans for the two alternative sources 
of doctors to maximize the net(of costs) patient satisfaction over a time horizon.Two models are considered. In one,the 
population is assumed to remain constant and in the other population is assumed to be increase at an exponential rate. 
It found that a nation with  insufficient number of doctors at the beginning of the time horizon should increase the 
investment in local doctors gradually while employing foreign doctors as to equate their salaries to the marginal 
satisfaction of the patients.An equilibrium exists and it is stable.

Abstract 
 
In practical shop, most of the facilities are complex systems with critical components. Those systems shut 
down only when the critical components fail, while the failures of the non-critical components will not 
cause system failure but just reduce the qualification rate. To reduce the failure caused by the critical 
components and increase the profit for the industry, it is necessary to implement preventive maintenance 
(PM) based on regular intervals. The paper tries to solve the problem of imperfect PM schedule that is 
subjected to the failure of critical components. An optimization model is proposed in this paper which 
aims to minimize the PM cost as well as satisfy production requirement. Based on the delay time theory 
and the renewal theory, the proposed model will be solved by a novel hybrid Genetic Algorithm (GA)--
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) method. A numerical example is given to illustrate the practicability of 
the model.

Abstract  
 
Due to the special geographical environment and overloaded working conditions of the port, it is essential 
to maintain the health of the port facilities as they suffer from various faults. In order to ensure the smooth 
operation of the port, it is necessary to properly arrange the maintenance of the facilities when there are 
multiple maintenance modes. This article explores the port facility maintenance scheduling problem when 
the equipment is broken down, i.e. corrective maintenance. Through the workload analysis of port 
equipment, the maintenance model is established. In the proposed model, the neural network algorithm is 
used to quantify the weights of the equipment, and the genetic algorithm is used to minimize the total 
weighted completion time of the maintenance tasks with multiple maintenance modes. A practical 
example is presented to show the practicability of the proposed corrective maintenance model. The results 
demonstrated that the proposed model is capable of optimizing the total maintenance time as well as 
fulfilling the operation requirements.

Abstract 
 
Leadership is the engine of an organisation and innovation is recognised as a critical success factor for an 
organisation’s survival. Leadership is at the core of creating an innovative culture within an organisation, 
and employees play a vital role in the execution of innovative outputs. The purpose of this research was to 
examine the relationship between leadership and employee innovation and to provide an inventory of 
leadership behaviours that promote innovation at an individual and organisational level.  Through 
examining literature, the research will present a list of characteristics and values that are required to 
cultivate and promote innovation. These characteristics were studied by means of a case study in a 
telecommunications organisation to establish whether the organisation embraces innovative behaviour. 
The scope of the literature review examined the different leadership characteristics required at the 
individual, group, and organisational level. Data in the case study was collected by means of a 
questionnaire and analysed to provide recommendations to the organisation on ways to improve the 
cultivation of innovation within their workforce.

1. Introduction 
 
Leadership is the engine of an organisation and innovation is recognised as a critical success factor for an 
organisation’s survival. Leadership is at the core of creating an innovative culture within organisations and 
employees play a vital role in the execution of innovation. Innovation is a process that can be managed and this 
encourages organizational leadership in that managers can plan, control, and organise all aspects of innovation to 
positively influence the outcome. Therefore, it is important to understand how leadership as a discipline affects 
innovation; and consequently, how a leader’s behaviour affects innovative behaviour within the company workforce. 
 
Since the implementation of Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) in South Africa, diversity and transformation in 
the workplace have made considerable progress given that the country has undergone significant changes in 
management and leadership within a relatively short time. A lack of business acumen, entrepreneurial drive, 
management skills and education, together with low technology savviness, resistance to change and a lack of 
leadership affect an organization’s work processes (Safavi and Tweddell, 1990; Hall and Sandelands, 2009; Olawale 
and Garwe, 2010). Despite these challenges, innovative methods remained and are still an effective solution for 
leaders in society (Yan, Maladzhi and Makinde, 2012). As with any paradigm shift, South African leaders needed 
not only to implement new approaches and techniques, but also novel ways of thinking. 
 
Anticipating the need for change leads to success in organisations, and this is achieved with minimal effort with a 
focus on improving outcomes (Agbor, 2008). These organisations are driven by leaders who constantly and 
effectively communicate the vision and strategy of the organisation, and where everyone in the organisation shares 
in the set of beliefs about why the strategy and vision are important (Pearce and Manz, 2009). Successful leaders

include open communication and collaboration amongst individuals, teams, departments and management. This may 
be included in all employees’ performance ratings as a communication key measuring indicator. 
 
6.2 Individual Level 
 
Self-efficacy in employees may be instilled through the acknowledgment of employee accomplishments. Successful 
and acknowledged experiences lead to a greater feeling of self-efficacy. The absence of consultation in the 
workplace weakens an employee’s enthusiasm and denies a project from fresh and novel ideas. This can be 
overcome by involving employees in the decision-making process by hosting, for example, brainstorming sessions. 
 
To ensure that there is a feedback loop between senior management and employees, it is recommended that 
debriefing sessions are held between line managers and subordinates. Additional recommendations include training 
for poor performing team members which are included as key performance indicators and followed-up to monitor 
progress. Coaching and mentorship create an ideal environment for exploring new ideas and developing action plans 
whilst maintaining continuous support and feedback. Such action allows for leaders to have individualised influence 
over subordinates, and alternatively empowers subordinates to operate beyond their current level of performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The first research question was to identify which characteristics influence innovative behaviour in an organisation at 
an individual and organisational level. Through literature review the organisational characteristics that promote an 
innovative culture in an organisation were identified; and it was found that creativity and innovation in an 
organisation can be influenced by multiple variables. From the literature findings, it was established that there are 
four organisational values that cultivate and promote innovation within an organisation, namely strategy, structure, 
support mechanism, behaviours that support innovation, and communication. It was established that if these 
determinants are not supported within an organisation, innovation will not prevail. The influence of each 
determinant on innovation was analysed through an empirical study to determine if these values are being adopted 
within a company in the telecommunications industry. 
 
The study was limited to an organisation within the telecommunications industry in South Africa, and this presents 
an opportunity to extend the research to other engineering sectors. Other disciplines, such as Finance and Human 
Resources, may also benefit from the work by evaluating what constitutes innovative behaviour within the particular 
field of knowledge.  The findings may be employed by the telecommunications industry in South Africa to guide 
leaders within such firms to promote and instil innovation in their employees towards competitiveness and business 
sustainability.

Abstract  
 
Advanced manufacturing includes the production of advanced materials and advanced technologies.   
Manufacturing industries continue to transform with every progression of the technological era.  As 
advancement in technology shapes manufacturing, the role of manufacturing to economic development 
and competitiveness continues to change.  The purpose of the study is to determine whether advanced 
manufacturing systems lies within the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0).  Descriptive statistical 
analysis was used to assess the effect of advanced manufacturing systems on competitiveness in order to 
determine the impact on productivity, manufacturing employment and manufacturing contribution to 
economic competition.  The research results revealed a proportionally high increase in productivity and 
production output that directly correlates with the application of advanced manufacturing systems.  
However, employment in manufacturing and creation of new jobs correlate negatively with advancement 
in technology.  Therefore, the question of economic competitiveness still remains contentious.

Introduction 
Manufactured goods have been satisfying the needs and wants of customers since the beginning of mankind.  The 
objective of manufacturing is one of providing products that are essential to customer’s physical and social needs.  
In the contemporary economy, however, this objective has to be fulfilled competitively through effective processing, 
efficient use of material, as well as reduction and elimination of waste in production.  This means that the techniques 
and methods of manufacturing are no longer just driven by the desire to satisfy needs and wants, they are now driven 
by competition and the desire to be competitive and profitable while pursuing to satisfy customer needs and wants.  
This contemporary desire drives and directs innovation and investment choices which organizations create in order 
to obtain the technology and manufacturing methods to enhance competitiveness and profits.  Therefore, many 
multi-national organizations and developed countries are focusing on large scale resources using more nascent 
technological manufacturing methods that are collectively known as Advanced Manufacturing Systems.  In 
Germany, this is pursued under the umbrella of Industry 4.0 (Schuh et al 2014) so called because researchers believe 
that we are in the fourth generation of industrial transformation.   
Much like most transformations, prevailing manufacturing industries have progressed over time, with some regions 
leading the transformation through innovation and technology while other regions are lagging behind.  The first 
recorded form of manufacturing was driven by individually talented artisans who crafted goods by hand.  This 
developed into more organized methods of production systems, in which these skilled craftsman were brought 
together in a coordinated production systems.  The era that followed, was known as the First Industrial Revolution, 
which began in Great Britain – the dawn of mechanical power, with machines that were powered by water and 
steam (Ezell, 2016).   The development and introduction of electrical power in production lines brought about the 
Second Industrial Revolution, which was characterized by labor mass production, assembly line manufacturing, and 
high consumption of steel products.  Productivity in manufacturing continued to increase with less and less skilled

Labor Productivity 
 
Figure 7.  Labor Productivity  
It can be concluded that unit labor cost increases with increase in labor productivity as depicted in Figure 7.  A 
negative trend in manufacturing employment in the auto sector is seen, when productivity and production output 
increase with the application of advanced manufacturing technology in the sector. Manufacturing employment 
decreased by 17% between 2008 and 2015 as labor productivity increased by 12%, in the same period.

Conclusions 
From the study it can be concluded that technological advancement in general and advancement in manufacturing in 
particular has had an influence on the traditional economic relationship of supply and demand. Progress in 
technology has reduced concept-to-market cycle time and shortened product life cycle, which has changed the 
consumption behavior of the customer.  As a result of a shorter manufacturing cycle (in some instances the cycle is 
695","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Paris, France, July 26-27, 2018 
© IEOM Society International 
reduced by more than 200%, Reuters, http:reut.tv/2yXLfrt 2017) and shorter product life cycle, the change in 
consumption behavior drives up the cycle of demand and supply in the market, which stimulate economic activity 
and economic growth. The concepts of collaborative manufacturing, autonomous reconfigurable manufacturing 
systems and autonomous flexible manufacturing systems provide agility and strategic positioning for future 
competitive advantage in meeting varying market demand. 
 
5.1 
Manufacturing competitive advantage 
The aspects of competitive advantage that look to decide location of manufacturing production in the near future are 
market value size, collaborative supply chains, talent, availability of technology, productive infrastructure, energy 
costs and availability, economic climate, market policy and political condition, management of information and big 
data.  There however, seems to be a reversal trend in the location of production facilities.  Manufacturing production 
is moving back to industrialized regions where manufacturing firms are leveraging technological advancement in 
hope to compete against low production cost non-industrialized regions, having eliminated the factor of high labor 
costs that are synonymous with their economies.  This reversal in trend is founded upon new factories that are 
manned by armies of robots in place of armies of employees that used to perform the work (Reuter.com, Oct 2017). 
The economic benefits to the regions to where manufacturing production moves to will not be in job creation. 
 
5.2 
Labor and Employment 
Employment plays a critical role in economic growth and development.  Growth in the rate of employment and in 
labor participation translates into direct economic growth.  Through increased spending by a nation’s labor force and 
expansion of the middle class, the living standard of a nation is enhanced.  Therefore, employment is a key 
ingredient to economic success and to economic competitiveness. The ability of generating high production capacity 
through technological advancement with constant decrease in manufacturing employment, indicate that labor will no 
longer be the important component that contributes to competitiveness in manufacturing. Traditional 
competitiveness of the economy that was once driven through employment generation and labor participation no 
longer seems probable under Industry 4.0.  A probable scenario is indirect employment creation and support of jobs 
in 
manufacturing 
related 
fields 
that 
constitute 
the 
advanced 
manufacturing 
value 
chain.    
 
Employment opportunities may arise in new industries that will emerge around advanced manufacturing. 
Employment opportunities may also arise in providing engineering solutions that address the still labor intensive 
manufacturing sectors such as textiles where the need for human skill is still indispensable.   
Judging from historical and current trends, jobs that have been lost will not be recovered and jobs will continue to be 
shed. On one hand, governments and industry are increasing investments in advanced and smart manufacturing 
systems; on the other hand, governments are faced with the realities of population growth and unemployment 
growth that has an added burden from economic migration and human migration in general.  The means of 
expanding job markets and creating jobs are constantly diminished and running out.  Governments of developing 
markets are also faced with the reality of shortages of skills that are necessary to support sustainable advanced 
industries.  Future competitiveness in labor lies in innovation and talent. New careers in advanced manufacturing are 
emerging in mechatronics, a study of a combination of mechanics and electronics.  There is a growing demand for 
people in maintaining equipment and machinery and less demand for operators.

Abstract 
 
Patient safety has become a hot topic in healthcare since the industry is a field of high-technique and 
filled with medical errors, which necessitate the medical risk assessment. A lot of models have been 
introduced to medical risk assessment, among which fault tree analysis(FTA) is one of the most popular 
methods. However, many researches indicate that most risk factors may occur in everyday clinical 
processes which can be regarded as a dynamic interaction between patients, providers, and devices. 
Traditional FTA has deficiencies in handling these problems due to its determinacy. In this paper, a 
dynamic fault tree is suggested to extending FTA to incorporate dynamic elements by means of adding 
extra logic gates. Thus, dynamics in healthcare such as sequence-dependent events, priorities of failure 
events and so forth can be solved effectively. We apply the proposed model to assess the probability of 
incision infection in laparoscopic acute appendectomy in a large hospital. The feasibility and 
effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated by comparing with the traditional FTA.

more flexible and information sharing has become easier. At this point, Mass Customization has become the key to 
satisfy the exact customer needs and to make higher profit margin. 
2. Literature review
The term ‘‘mass customization” was anticipated by Stan Davis in the book, “Future Perfect”: “the same large number
of customers can be reached as in mass markets… and simultaneously they can be treated individually as in the 
customized markets of pre-industrial economies” (Davis 1987). Mass customization is a new competitive paradigm that 
companies adopt to customise products in response to individual customer orders, while retaining their operational 
performance (Davis 1987). Pine in 1993 introduced an industrial perspective in the new-born concept and defined mass 
customization as ‘‘providing tremendous variety and individual customization, at prices comparable to standard goods 
and services’’ to enable the production of products and services ‘‘with enough variety and customization that nearly 
everyone finds exactly what they want’’ (Pine and Davis 1993).Mass customization aims at producing goods and services 
catering to individual customers' needs with near mass production efficiency (Tseng and Jiao 2001). 
Mass customization is generally described as a process by which firms apply technology and management methods to 
provide product variety and customization at a low cost through flexibility and quick responsiveness (Davis 1987, Pine et 
al. 1993, Kotha 1995). The foundation of mass customization is the ability to achieve customer responsiveness, cost 
efficiency, and high-volume production, simultaneously (Q Tu et al 2001).Hayes and Wheelright (1979) through their 
four-point parsimonious framework (job shop, batch, assembly line, and continuous flow) established that there is a 
systematic connection between a firms’ strategy, manufacturing tasks, and characteristics of production systems. 
According to Kumar (2004), two common threads can be traced in most definitions of MC: 
•
the product delivered to the customer is close to what (s)he wants (the product has high level of customization)
•
the price for such a product is not commensurate with the level of customization: the price is much less
MC strategy allows efficiencies of mass production through distribution of demand over a few levels/options while
allowing high level of customization through modular design of products (Kumar, 2004). Kotha (1996) found that an
optimal combination of mass customization and mass production strategies would perform better than any one of them
individually in a rapidly changing dynamic market environment. The customization literature has established a concave
behavior of the level of customization with that of price.

identity work refers to the actual decisions and actions taken for regulating identity (Iedema & Scheeres, 2003; 
Kornberger & Brown, 2007; Kreiner, Hollensbe & Sheep, 2006; Rothbard & Edwards, 2003).  
So,the following hypothesis is proposed. 
H 10: The Mass Customisation Company leaders will require all three: integrative;identity and institutional. 
While this paper is being written, additive manufacturing has emerged that is in its infancy, and hence did not get 
attention here. 
IV. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have given several theoretical propositions related to companies following mass customization. We 
conclude that leaders of mass customization firms are intuitive,thinking,and perceptive.Also leaders of mass 
customization firms are high on extroversion,openness to experience,neuroticism and conscientiousness; and low on 
agreeableness.We propose to undertake an empirical investigation shortly.

Abstract 
This paper studies the Manufacturers pallet-loading problem (MPLP), which aims to load identical small 
boxes within a rectangle pallet by maximising the pallet utilisation percentage. In this work, we propose a 
novel mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that generates layouts of an improved structure 
based on the Mega-box representation. Each mega-box simply groups boxes with the same orientation along 
the X and Y axis. Such approach aids real life operations when fast and less complex operations are essential 
to reduce the pallet loading time, which will also result into reduction of the overall supply chain cost. The 
proposed optimisation-based approach has been tested against available literature datasets with supported 
graphical layout structures. The computational and graphical layout results show the superiority of the 
proposed approach compared with existing Manufacturers pallet-loading problem layouts.

OPTIMIZING SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK DESIGN 
WITH SALBP-E ASSEMBLY LINE ISSUE

Abstract 
Optimizing Supply Chain Network (SCN) system, otherwise known as “strategic decision”, with 
assembly line balancing issue (tactical decision) is relatively at infant level in literature. Managers and 
decision makers usually will not disregard either of these activities (either disregard SCN activities while 
trying to balance assembly lines or assembly line balancing while designing an SCN) for an SCN system 
that has assembly line unit. These two key subjects are collaborative. 
This work focuses on advancing optimization criteria from one of the pioneering work in this research 
field by designing a mathematical model to optimize the SCN that includes the manufacturers/producers, 
assemblers and end users. The goal is to simultaneously minimize the transportation costs along the SCN 
line for the concerned time phases while balancing the assembly lines in assemblers so as to minimize the 
overall cost of setting up stations. A mixed-integer nonlinear model is proposed to minimize the 
transportation costs alongside the cycle time and number of stations at the assembler. This means 
minimizing the idle time and also maximizing the line efficiency by increasing the throughput rate in 
addition to the cost minimization. We propose to apply the model to real life data and subsequently 
recommend its deployment.

4.0. Conclusion 
This work focuses on advancing the work of Paksoy et al., (2012) by developing a mixed integer nonlinear 
mathematical model that supports the SC node capacity decision so as to increase the effectiveness of the SCN as 
well as the line efficiency while minimizing the idle time (thanks to the incorporation of an upper limit for the cycle 
time and the minimization of the number of stations in the assembler). The model optimizes the SCN, consisting of 
manufacturers, assemblers and customers with the overall goal of minimizing the transportation costs for the 
concerned periods while balancing the assembly lines in assemblers in order to minimize the total cost of setting up 
stations concomitantly. 
5.0. Future 
The work presented is the first phase of the research which continues with the application of the model to real-life 
data to show its utility after which recommendations for its deployment will be made. 
The model is expected to minimize the number of stations to be opened in the assembler as production rate increases 
which translates to reduction of activation costs of stations. In addition, enforcing a maximum limit of cycle times 
for all stations will ensure increase in the throughput rate of the line, that is, minimizing the idle time, thereby 
translating to increased line efficiency. Also, the overall transportation costs along the SCN network (Manufacturer 
– Assembler and Assembler – Customer) will be advantageously reduced.

Abstract  
 
Industries working under Just in time [1] as Moroccan automotive companies, are always searching to 
optimize their spending by minimizing cost without impacting customer satisfaction, performances 
continuous improvement is the best tool. The principle is to detect and correct weaknesses to achieve 
target. We can find a lot of professional referential in automotive sector all over the supply chain that 
evaluate process or decisions, and judge performance or impact. 
Our research contains proposal of a tool of diagnostic and evaluation of downstream logistic chain based 
on combination between these existing referential. 
The paper contain five parts, first one present a literature revue of professional referential that evaluated 
performance of automotive industry in Morocco. The second part explain the problematic and research 
methodology ; the third demonstrate weaknesses of these referential in terms of evaluating downstream 
logistic chain ; the fourth one propose a model that respond and correct these weaknesses ; we end by a 
conclusion and  perspectives of this work.

1. Introduction 
 
The current automotive industry is characterized by an increasingly variable and volatile demand with significant 
competitive pressure. One of the biggest challenges facing companies in this sector is the need to meet customer 
requirements.  
To meet this challenge, companies offer different products while improving their responsiveness and flexibility. 
To maintain their competitiveness they must make competitive products in an agile supply chain that adapt quickly 
to the varied demands of customers [2]. Downstream parts of these supply chains that are in direct contact with 
customers must be efficient and flexible. 
To support this strategy, these companies will seek to identify and evaluate their performances on which they will 
act to achieve their objectives.

There is a process in place that engages management, employees, and business partners in 
continually improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the SCM processes throughout the 
entire organization and with all supply chain partners. 
There is a process in place to identify and analyze constraints that limit the organization's 
ability to optimize throughput.  Actions are taken to reduce, minimize, or eliminate constraints. 
There is a process in place to continually develop the relationship between all partners in the 
supply chain. 
There is a process in place to continually develop working relationships with other functions 
within the organization to ensure that overall business objectives are satisfied. 
 
 
risks 
A risk management process is in place to ensure continuity of supplies when the organization 
is required to deviate from normal operations. 
Back-up/contingency plans for high-risk SCM processes are in place to ensure continuity of 
supply and a return to normal operations. 
 
 
7. Conclusion and perspective: 
 
To meet the needs of customers in the automotive industry, companies must master the performance of their 
logistics chain, several professional references have been implemented to evaluate this performance in order to 
control either the process or the decision area. Our work then is to offer a combined diagnostic and assessment tool 
between processes and decisions on the downstream part of the supply chain. This complementarity will make the 
downstream part of the SC efficient and adapted to the expectations of the customers. 
 
Our perspective of this work is to apply this tool within a company operating in the automotive sector and to reap 
the results.

Abstract  
Job skills of the trainees are tested on three occasions namely, Pre-training period, Post-training 
period and in the field. The population of the study has been the total number of employees being 
trained in the Zonal Railway Training Institute (ZRTI) of Southern Railways (SR) at 
Tiruchirappalli, India over two years. About 1500 probationers were trained during the study a 
period of which, about 150 of the probationers were interviewed at three stages of the process. 
The field results have been obtained approximately six months after the post training.  The new 
methods adopted in training for the front line staff of Indian railways have made the staff to learn 
and suit themselves to the latest technological advancements. The analysis indicates an impact of 
training in all three periods. The findings also indicate long term impact on employees in 
remembering the skills learnt and the tendency to apply such skills when demanded.  The 
training was held in SR training center for each segment in separate centers. In the present 
context, the training is given to employees across the cadres. When they assemble together in the 
training centre, there is a feeling among higher cadres that they are not supposed to be treated on 
par with other lower cadres. This feeling hinders the teaching and learning process

Under the cognitive section, the following findings have been drawn. The trainees were able to correlate theory with 
actual work. The respondents derived satisfaction after handling complex issues independently. Under memory 
segment, they were able to know and apply the rules and regulations by heart. The general opinion of the trained 
personnel is that the job rotation helps in updation /retention of the learned skills in various centers in SR with 
particular allotted timings. 
10. Conclusion 
The new skills imparted through the Information, Communication and Technology (ICT) have been retained and 
applied even after fairly long-period by the trainees in Southern Railways. Though, the training programs today 
achieve the results, few segments of employees are not fully reached. The training may be given to each segment in 
separate centres. Organisational hierarchy has to be set aside when they assemble together to learn something new 
through training, which is some extent impossible in the context of the study. It has been found when few categories 
of trainees were indifferent in answering critical questions due to the status in the hierarchy.

Abstract  
 
This article propose an approach to design an indicators system on upstream logistic to follow it impact 
into the global supply chain. Our method consists to use the forecasted need received from customer, 
combine with result of our research on the performances indicators used in automotive industries to be 
able to have a Hybrid model of management.  
We propose to present the result of applying this Hybrid model into a 1st rank supplier working under 
Just in Time notion in Moroccan automotive industry.

3  Measure of the new Impact of upstream logistic using the new KPI: 
 
the Measure of impact was made based on results since 2015 as previously mentioned the min value achieved before 
2017 on our trend was 282K$ but starting of 2017 and by applying  the new VTFC indicator to adjust orders and 
production plan this inventory level GAP value Vs target was reduced and stabilized on 48K$ . 
this reduction was based on the weekly orders adjustment after VTFC check, both procurement team and planning 
were sensibilized to the necessity to follow this indicator on weekly basis and adjust all below elements: 
 
firm orders sent to suppliers; 
 
forecast sent to suppliers;  
 
production planning at plant as it impact directly the procurement so the inventory levels; 
 
declare the impact f any customer variation  time to not have shortages nor huge inventory levels ; 
 
As the overall analysis was based on value not quantities the new trend is presented as below

V- CONCLUSION: 
 
Our studies have demonstrate that the proposed indicator provide  reduction possibility of inventory levels by 
following forecast need check on weekly basis which allow upstream logistic mastery of a company. 
 As the upstream logistics is not impacting only the performance of the logistics chain but also its impact on the 
overall performance of the company. this element should be controlled to be efficient and performing, The questions 
that arise now are:  
How we can control the upstream chain in global not only inventory levels? 
How we can make our suppliers efficient to avoid all problems related to the upstream part?  
How we can construct a global and performing dashboard that allow to follow the upstream logistic in global for 
companies working under Just In Time notion not only a composite of this supply chain?

Abstract 
 
Human resources are strategic assets essential for implementing and executing business objectives. 
Intricate business operations of large multinationals are intended to add value by transforming inputs into 
productive outputs.  These inputs are inclusive of human resource (labour), supplies, factory overhead, 
materials, energy, and machinery. Outputs comprise products and services. The effectiveness of business 
outputs is highly dependent on the optimal and efficient performance of corporate inputs. This research 
focuses on human resources as a corporate input. The efficient utilisation of human resources relative to 
corporate sustainability and competitiveness is considered. The dynamic nature of the corporate sector has 
resulted in business units exploring productive approaches to enhance sustainability and competitiveness. 
This research aims to identify, define and explore key human resource levers together with 
recommending solutions towards enhancing human resource efficiency. The role of the identified human 
resource levers influencing enterprise operations and objectives are investigated. Nigeria as a subset in the 
Africa context is explored to illustrate the efficient utilisation of selected human resources levers. Best 
practice questions are developed, explored and empirically tested, with a sample from the manufacturing 
sector in the Nigeria context. The results, as documented, is a significant tool for enterprise practitioners 
specific to corporate assessment, testing, and implementation of key human resource strategies.

1. Contextual Background 
Business entities are exploring sustainable practices towards developing tools for assessing organisational 
performance. This ensures business units remain stable and competitive with the demanding states of the dynamic 
corporate world. Business processes are essential operations executed in implementing any corporate set targets or 
objectives. This corporate terminology is described as a sequence of related operations executed towards the 
delivery of goods and services accomplishing a defined business objective (Fosso & Mishra, 2017 and Lehnert, et.al, 
2017). The execution of business processes has a significant impact on business performance, effectiveness together 
with competitiveness. Several business processes variables contribute significantly to the execution of business 
processes (Medoh & Telukdarie, 2016). A comprehensive list of business process variables impacting on business 
processes is detailed in (Medoh & Telukdarie, 2017). This research focuses on investigating the role of human 
resource business process variable relative to impacting on corporate effectivity, competitiveness, and sustainability. 
Human resources are described as a collection of the workforce involved in executing corporate functions (Vicki, 
2016). Collings & Wood described human resources as corporate critical assets impacting on business productivity. 
Human resource efficiency refers to the optimal utilisation of human resources based on global best practice

6. Conclusion 
The research presents a decision-making paradigm promoting the necessity for the development of a human resource 
engagement scenario in business units. The results are expected to assist stakeholders to explore distinct standpoints 
relative to human resource efficiency specifically human resource engagement. Overall result summary established 
scarcity in developing human resource engagement strategies and the necessity to act urgently in this regard. The 
results indicates most business entities lack a proper understanding of the concept of human resource engagement. 
The research established few business units with human resource engagement strategies in place still lack proper 
knowledge and tools on effectively measuring this business management paradigm. Human resource engagement 
tools inclusive of stay-interviews, pulse surveys and job crafting is recommended for business units developing 
human resource engagement strategies. This document serves as an additional tool to Medoh & Telukdarie, (2016) 
in exploring impacts of essential business process variables on corporate functions. This supports the larger 
objective of developing a sustainable business process model for large multinationals based on industry 4.0 business 
protocols. Future studies may be directed to exploring how human resource engagement tools and measurement 
effects on business productivity.

Abstract (12 font) 
 
The polar coordinate systems and polar curves, as well as the Cartesian coordinate systems, have 
been elaborated and used to analyze plots and functions of real values. In this paper, we 
brought up the concepts of primary and secondary polar coordinate planes, enabling the 
computation of the Cartesian transformation of polar coordinates more efficient. The efficiency 
of the calculation is evaluated by the amount of the minimum valid computation number 
required. The concepts are derived from the fundamental relationship between the Cartesian 
coordinate system and polar coordinate systems and provide a new approach to the proof of 
trigonometric 
functions. 
We 
gave 
detailed 
estimates for 
the 
further 
approach 
toward other trigonometric functions. Application of this study on the ‘Polar Coordinate-based 
Graphics Tablets’ is also elaborated

Abstract 
The present work is an attempt to design a reverse logistics (RL) network for an e-commerce firm based 
on one of the most frequently returned items namely fashion goods. The problem essentially revolves 
around the trade-off between cost and responsiveness in designing an RL network for an e-commerce 
firm. If returns are sent back to the vendors through faster mode of communication in frequent interval for 
improving responsiveness, the cost of transportation becomes prohibitively high although inventory 
carrying cost diminishes. On the contrary, if the returns are sent to the vendors in batch mode, cost of 
transportation would decrease due to economies of scale achieved in transportation. However, this would 
result in higher inventory carrying cost. We have considered several big residential complexes within a 
large metropolitan city in India and treated the same as customer indexes from which the returns 
originate. Several candidate nodes have been identified as initial collection centres (ICCs) in which the 
returns from the customer indexes are initially collected and stored for some time before being sent to the 
final warehouses. There are three warehouses in three different cities. We have ensured that one customer 
index would be assigned to only one ICC. The decision variables of the above problem include the 
selection of ICCs, the assignment of the customer indexes to the ICCs and finally the volume of returns to 
be shipped from the ICCs to all three warehouses. We have formulated the above problem as a mixed 
integer linear programming (MILP) problem with a view to minimizing the total cost of the network. We 
have carried out sensitivity analyses on the relevant parameters and provided rich managerial insights.

Abstract 
 
Transport demand in Ecuador, located in the Andes highlands in South America, is challenging because of 
the highly topography variability. In fact, half of the total consumption of the local energy stands from 
transportation. For this reason, this study analyzes techniques for fuel consumption reduction in a transport 
fleet. This fleet has 26 vehicles from the same model which drive the same route of 201 km between two 
cities in the highlands of Ecuador where altitude range from 1889 to 3460 meters above sea level.  The test 
was conducted before and after a transport fleet driver was trained in a vehicle that was fitted with a GPS 
and a fuel flow meter. Data was collected to determine driving parameters like time, speed, acceleration, 
road slope and instant fuel consumption. Five measurable and quantifiable techniques (idling, constant 
speed, hard braking and acceleration events, inertia, rpm) were evaluated. Results show that when applying 
eco-driving techniques compatible with vehicle and route analyzed, it is possible to generate a total fuel 
reduction of 8%, and reductions between 11% and 51% for each evaluated technique. The eco-driving 
techniques evaluated could help a transport logistics in order to reduce the fuel consumption with a low 
investment.

1. Introduction 
 
Transportation sector producedaround 24% of the world CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in 2015, due to fossil 
fuel combustion. Global CO2-emissions from road transport grew by 68% from 1990 to 2015(I T F Transport Outlook, 
2017). In order to prevent this situation car manufacturers around the world are working in more efficient engines and 
technologies. Transport companies are always seeking opportunities to conserve fuel which provides simultaneous 
emissions reductions(Xu, Li, Liu, Rodgers, & Guensler, 2017). One of the strategies that has immediate effect on 
reducing fuel consumption is eco-driving, which is a set of the techniques, used to reduce fuel consumption when 
vehicle is travelling on the road. The fuel consumption savings can reach up to 15% (Ahlstrom & Kircher, 2017). 
Vehicle fleets used for freight or passengers transportation, permanently are seeking to reduce operative costs(IDAE, 
2013). Eco-driving techniques may also prevent early mechanical failures, improve road safety and provide extra 
comfort to passengers. These eco-driving techniques include modifications to gear shifting, acceleration, idle time, 
inertia, among others (Ferreira, Almeida, & Rodrigues, 2015; (Strömberg & Karlsson, 2013).","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

4. Limitations 
 
Due to working conditions of the fleet (non-fixed schedules) and limited data logging equipment, only one vehicle 
and one driver were analyzed in this work. Variables such as throttle position or gear-shifting were not considered, 
because of the limitations of the equipment. The main challenge for applying eco-driving techniques in this fleet was 
to make the driver aware of saving fuel, while he was focused in saving time. 
In addition, the influence of variable atmospheric factors and vehicle mechanical conditions were not considered in 
this work. 
 
 
5. Conclusions and discussion 
 
The present study evaluated five common eco-driving techniques in a real-world scenario. The analysis had two 
phases, the first one was a driving evaluation without training. Whereas, the second one took place after low-
investment eco-driving training. Variables were calculated and measured to evaluate each technique. This study 
defined the most appropriate eco-driving techniques based on the route by maintaining similar conditions such as the 
driver, vehicle, and schedules. Each proposed technique showed a reduction in fuel consumption after the post-training 
phase (Idling 36%, hard braking and accelerations 35.1%, constant speed 51.82%, inertia 11.45%). The rpm regime 
increased by 3.22%, this kept the revolutions within the recommended range for an optimal consumption based on the 
engine torque-power diagram. When all the techniques were used in conjunction, a decrease in fuel consumption and 
cost of 8.3% was achieved (See Table 10). This research showed that it is possible to reduce the fuel consumption by 
following specific vehicle driving recommendations as follows:  
 
- 
Reducing idling time when the vehicle is parked (Huang & Peng, 2016). 
- 
Selecting the correct gear based on the road's slope (Pañeda et al., 2016). 
- 
Checking the tires' pressure periodically. 
- 
Avoiding hard acceleration events, especially when there is traffic or when the road is not suitable for such 
changes in speed. This recommendation also applies to braking events. 
- 
Keeping a constant speed is the most crucial recommendation when the car drives up to 70 km/h 
approximately (El-Shawarby, Ahn, & Rakha, 2004). 
- 
Taking advance of the vehicle's inertia depending on the road's conditions.

Abstract 
 
This research is intended for process control practitioners, plant decision-makers and process control 
technology leaders that are considering implementing Advanced Process Control (APC).  An 
understanding of APC is developed from an introductory level a definition, its purpose and how APC 
relates to process control and the enterprise.  Three types of APC techniques are adopted for elaboration 
on capabilities and applications.  The applicability of the selected APC technologies is investigated based 
on the type of manufacturing industry.  This investigation is conducted as there are varying approaches to 
the implementation of APC technologies in each of the selected manufacturing sectors. The key challenge 
is deciding on the best fit process control system.  Various industry sectors are explored further to gain an 
understanding of the inconsistencies in the APC selection approach and to test the proposed decision 
framework. This research proposes a framework that guides the decision-making process that ranks the 
anticipated risks to be addressed for the considered APC technique to positively contribute towards the 
profitability of the enterprise. This framework forms the basis of the deployment strategy for APC. 
Hypothetical scenarios are defined to test the decision framework and validate its appropriateness. An 
impression on how various manufacturing sectors perceive process automation is given, together with a 
process that considers both qualitative and quantitative factors into the strategic decision-making process 
for the best APC technique.

1. Introduction 
 
The plant operation is faced with process constraints regardless of the manufacturing industry or type of 
manufacturing process.  Conventional process control techniques alone do not have the capability to unlock further 
economic benefits that are caused by complex operational constraints. 
 
Advanced Process Control (APC) has been identified as one of the technologies that can address these process 
constraints to improve profitability (Eder, 2003).  Despite this, the decision-making process for the investment in 
expensive advanced process control systems and field instrumentation needs business justification (Anderson, 1999).  
Experts in the field of advanced control have proposed some pre-deployment techniques.  These techniques evaluate 
the justification of APC deployment using qualitative or quantitative techniques.

means the technology is readily available and requires minimum spend to make further improvements that would 
improve profitability.  This commercial benefit is followed by power generation being 2.1% lower than 
petrochemical refining.  The magnitudes shown by the commercial benefit from both these sectors display a possible 
opportunity for APC to improve profitability.  However, pharmaceutical is at the lower extreme of the scale with a 
15% commercial benefits.  It could be argued that the industry needs to reconsider regulations that govern the use of 
process control.  This would increase the potential commercial benefit that lies therein.  Currently 15% presents a 
risk to the firm that would consider the implementation of APC in resolving profitability challenges. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
Literature reveals inconsistencies in how APC projects are decided upon and their subsequent implementation.  
Furthermore, the barriers that prevent deployment of process automation are explored as these impact the extent of 
implementation of APC.   
 
This research investigates pre-deployment factors and proposes a decision making framework that could assist the 
implementation of an APC based project from a technology selection perspective. A decision framework is proposed 
that can be adopted in prioritizing the risks of APC projects using AHP to select the best suited APC technique.  
This investigation is based on documented literature pertaining to APC that is applied in various industrial sectors, 
specifically power generation, petrochemical refining and pharmaceutical industries. The business environment 
challenges are depicted through hypothetical scenarios that are formulated using morphological analysis. The 
presented decision framework is intended for use as a high-level tool that considers all stakeholders which are plant 
operations, management, engineering, maintenance and supplier.

1. Introduction: 
In this era, metro represents the symbol of how far the country has developed in terms infrastructure and service. 
This is because, the construction of the metro costs heavy, which requires lot of resources and investment in order to 
put it in action. The government of Dubai, given its high GDP has preplanned the necessity of building a metro 
network as a response to the challenges posed by the road networks around the city (Keilo, 2012). The main reason 
to deploy metro into the city is because of the growing demand for public transport in major cities, along with the 
huge traffic and pollution problems; which has forced the governments to think about an alternate mode of transport 
which satisfies the sustainability factors.   This can be achieved by the use of environmentally friendly fuels and 
land use patterns (Subash, 2013).  Two of the major problems that the government wants to solve with regards to 
transportation system are: Firstly, delineating infrastructure in order to coordinate policies at the national level to 
achieve a sustainable transport system and secondly. enhancing capacity of cities to improve mobility with 
sustainable operations. 
 
Some of the main goals of sustainable development include economic efficiency and sustainable growth based on 
conserving resources such as petrol and diesel, energy security, and energy efficiency by consuming as low energy 
as possible (Subash, 2013). Since the reshaping of the U.A.E in 1971, the three major modes of transportation 
(Marine, Air, Road) were incorporated in Dubai’s Global identity (Keilo, 2012, p.113). As the time went on, the city 
made a tremendous growth in terms Economy, infrastructure and population. The increasing population was a big 
concern for the government in the period of growth, just similar to what the major cities around the world had faced. 
In order to safeguard the growing population from the traffic congestion, and also to build a world class 
infrastructure in order to develop the then current place into ‘the next big city’, the government of Dubai has taken a 
major decision to create a consortium called Dubai Rapid Link (DURL) in July 2005 (Narayanaswami, 2017, p. 
161). The Dubai metro was inaugurated on 09/09/09, at 09:09pm as the “set to become the longest metro automated 
network in the world with more than 70KM of track length” (Acuto, 2010, p.274). Jack KEILO (2012) stated that 
“Opened right amidst the global financial crisis, the Dubai metro plays a major role in the drive of a revived city

Leaders of Dubai and the U.A.E. This paper thus contributes to the theory of service operations and could further be 
extended by empirical research.

Abstract 
A problem faced by integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) relates to fluctuating demand and can be 
reflected in long-term demand, middle-term demand, and short-term demand fluctuations. This paper 
explores safety stock under short term demand fluctuations in integrated device manufacturing. The 
manufacturing flow of integrated circuits is conceptualized into front end and back end operations with a 
die bank in between. Using a model of the back-end operations of integrated circuit manufacturing, 
simulation experiments were conducted based on three scenarios namely a production environment of low 
demand volatility and high capacity reliability (Scenario A), an environment with lower capacity 
reliability than scenario A (Scenario B), and an environment of high demand volatility and low capacity 
reliability (Scenario C). Results show trade-off relation between inventory levels and delivery 
performance with varied degree of severity between the different scenarios studied. Generally, higher 
safety stock levels are required to achieve competitive delivery performance as uncertainty in demand 
increases and manufacturing capability reliability decreases. Back-end cycle time are also found to have 
detrimental impact on delivery performance as the cycle time increases. It is suggested that success of 
finished goods safety stock policy relies significantly on having appropriate capacity amongst others to 
support fluctuations.

1. Introduction
Technological evolution over the last decades has enabled semiconductor industry to build increasingly complex 
integrated circuits (ICs) formed by tiny transistors into individual chips able to perform complex tasks. This trend is 
continuing. ICs constitute a fundamental part of sophisticated electronics systems and they play a central role in the 
design of end products (Rao, 2015). The semiconductor industry is one of the manufacturing industries that present a 
highest level of complexity. Companies in this specific segment of the semiconductor industry are known as 
Integrated Device Manufacturers (IDMs).  
A problem faced by IDMs relates to fluctuating demand particularly regarding market interests for ICs that show 
variations over time. The fluctuating demand impacting IDMs can be of three components in different timescales, 
namely, long-term demand forecast (more than six months horizon). middle-term demand forecast (between six 
weeks and six months horizon), and short-term demand fluctuations (less than six weeks horizon). Each of the 
components can be addressed using appropriate inventory management strategies.  
There are two main challenges to address in the development of inventory management strategies for Integrated 
Device Manufacturers: a) on one hand is the gap between the manufacturing cycle time and the industry lead time 
and b) on the other hand is the dilemma around the optimal balance between inventory holding costs and stockout 
costs. Small fluctuations in the demand of the final consumer market tend to result in large swings in the production 
and inventory levels in the upstream (Tan & Mathews, 2010).

of the assembly loads logic developed in this work that might be refined in future work. For instance, the assembly 
loads logic developed entails the projection of FG safety stock levels on future weeks. This projection is made by 
assuming an effective capacity at the back-end of 100% of the theoretical capacity. This assumption might be 
perfectly reasonable in a scenario of high capacity reliability but might require some adjustments in an environment 
of low manufacturing system reliability. 
Figure 2 represents the simulation results for different back-end cycle times. These results are simulated in an 
environment of high uncertainty (scenario C) and low utilisation levels (50%).  
 
 
Figure 2 Delivery Performance vs Average Safety Stock for different back end cycle times. 
 
A clear trend is observed in the simulation results: a longer back-end cycle time is detrimental to address short-term 
demand volatility. A way to compensate the higher exposure to uncertainty for products with long back-end cycle 
time is by carrying higher levels of FG safety stock. It is interesting to highlight that these results can motivate 
Integrated Device Manufacturers to dedicate resources to develop new manufacturing processes, reducing the back-
end cycle time. Otherwise, manufacturers must assume higher FG inventory holding costs to obtain the same 
delivery performance results than products with shorter back-end cycle times. 
 
5. Conclusions and Future Work  
 
This paper explores safety stock under short term demand fluctuations in integrated device manufacturing. The 
manufacturing flow of integrated circuits is conceptualised into front end and back end operations with a die bank in 
between. A model of the back-end operations of integrated circuit manufacturing in the context of short-term 
demand fluctuation is developed in this study and implemented using a simple assembly load logic. Simulation 
experiments based on three scenarios, namely a production environment of low demand volatility and high capacity 
reliability (Scenario A), a manufacturing environment with lower capacity reliability than scenario A (Scenario B) 
and an environment of high demand volatility and low capacity reliability (Scenario C). The analysis of simulation 
results confirms a trade-off relation between inventory levels and delivery performance in all cases and scenarios 
evaluated. This trade-off relation varies between the different scenarios. Generally, higher safety stock levels are 
required to achieve competitive delivery performance as uncertainty in demand increases and manufacturing 
capability reliability decreases. In addition, capacity utilisation is found to be key. The results indicate that the 
success of the Finished Goods safety stock policy relies on having the sufficient capacity to support swings in 
production. In addition, the influence of the back-end cycle time of the product shows a detrimental impact on 
performance as cycle time increases. The model presented considers the uncertainty in both demand and capacity 
reliability within the back-end cycle time. Statistically, it is more likely that this uncertainty manifests more 
frequently if the back-end cycle time is longer. In other words, a manufacturing system with shorter back-end cycle 
time is able to react quicker to sudden changes in the demand requirements by adjusting the assembly loads. Long 
manufacturing cycle times are regarded as one major challenge given the impossibility to react to sudden changes in 
demand. The results are indicative of the manufacturing flow studied, more so the simple assembly load logic

experimented with. The main assumptions that there exist strategies to address demand uncertainty in the long term 
and the middle term permits a focus on the short-term perspectives. Therefore, the only component of demand 
uncertainty considered in the development of the framework is strictly related to short-term demand volatility. In 
addition, the parameters determining the demand generation do not evolve over time or, in other words, the demand 
is stationary. Areas of future work should include: a) implementations using a more rigorous smart assembly load 
logic inclusive of wafer starts policy and b) explorations of the influence of long-term and middle-term demand 
uncertainty or non-stationary demand behaviour in the development of a Finished Goods safety stock strategy.

Abstract 
 
Now a days most production lines of the industries are designed and equipped with necessary machineries 
initially which cannot meet the rising demand though their capability increase. The aim of this research was 
to find solutions towards solving the bottleneck and rectifying the line to improve productivity. This study 
is based on analyzing an existing production line in Meghna Group of Industry bottle production line which 
product has a rising demand. The processing time of different workstations with their capacity were 
collected as necessary data. Simulation was chosen as a tool to analyze the line as it is a frequent technique 
towards solving problems. The statistical analysis was done through Microsoft Excel software.  The existing 
simulation model was developed using process oriented simulation software Arena to find out the 
bottleneck of the production line. Also a modified model was proposed which reduces 14.11% waiting time 
and increases 4% productivity along with increment in profit to cope with rising demand.

1. Introduction 
 
Manufacturing sector has a great incremental return to scale which provides unique benefits in different sectors. Three 
types of goods are included in manufacturing production, such as the capital goods, all intermediate goods and most 
of the consumer goods. It is the most resonant force of development (Nath, 2012). This huge manufacturing sector 
play a vital role in building up a nation’s economy of least developed countries in today’s competitive market (Fowler 
& Rose, 2004; Rahman & Sabuj, 2015). 
Production line is one of the main part of manufacturing industries as almost everything goes through a production 
line at one point (Fowler & Rose, 2004). It can be defined as a set of sequential operations where the end product is 
produced from raw material through a refining process that becomes suitable for consumption (Manivel & Sandeep, 
2014; Watanapa, Kajondecha, Duangpitakwong, & Wiyaratn, 2011; Wiyaratn, Watanapa & Kajondecha, 2013).

6. Conclusion 
 
In this research, bottleneck areas of existing production line were found out to pave a way to rectify the model to 
increase its productivity with the application of simulation. The developed model was an ARENA simulation model 
of a Bottle production line in a selected industry.  
Through the simulation of the existing line a large bottleneck area was seen in the Manual Cap Sealing workstation 
which was later replace by an automated Bottle Cap Sealing machine which reduced the average waiting time and 
increased the productivity. Along with that cost and revenue were calculated from the collected data which denote 
that with the reduction of cost in the line, the profit has also increased at a huge amount.  
Despite all this works, some limitations still exists in the line. Simulation study was conducted with an assumption of 
not considering worker fatigue and machine breakdown and there was no practical application of the proposed model. 
Besides, for the terms and conditions applicable for the industry it was not possible to get the exact cost and revenue 
related data so an average value was collected and used. Justification of proposed model by applying it in a practical 
manner can be further approach of future research in this field.

Abstract 
 
Safety is the most important aspects in every society and it is a major issue in the agricultural industry, 
which continues today as one of the most hazardous industry in the world with comparatively high fatality 
rates.  Hundreds of farmers die each year due to tractor rollovers despite the fact that a highly effective safe 
guard is available in the form of a rollover protective structure. The use of rollover protective structure on 
farm tractors has attributed to saving numerous lives and has prevented many human injuries over the years.  
Many tractors come with the ROPS factory installed; however, many rollover protective structure were 
apparently removed by the tractor’s owners due to the high clearance zone, which may cause the rollover 
protective structure to hit damage produce located on low hanging tree branches, while working in an 
orchard and that may cause farmers to lose money.  The new NIOSH third generation AutoROPS prototype 
with low clearance zone was structurally simulated and analyzed using a computer-aided design program 
ANSYS® to insure the compliance with the Society of Automotive Engineering J-2194 standard 
requirements.  The results proved that the third generations of the AutoROPS did absorb all applied loads 
in sequence and thus satisfied the J-2194 test requirements.

1. Introduction  
 
    Rollover protective structure (ROPS) structures were available for virtually every tractor manufactured but there 
are numerous tractors without a ROPS still in use.  These tractors were either had the protective structures removed 
or built before Oct. 25, 1976 - the date that all tractors with more than 20 PTO horsepower were required to be 
equipped with ROPS as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 12. Force deflection curve for the side transverse test 
 
4.4 Vertical Crush Test 
 
     The vertical load was applied on the AutoROPS.  No latching mechanisms were considered in this study, Therefore: 
a perfect contact in the overlap area was assumed.  The force applied was 16,700 lb. The AutoROPS had relatively no 
deflection during this test and no intrusion was recorded into the clearance zone. 
 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
     All of the loads were applied in sequence on the AutoROPS.  The results met the requirements of SAE J-2194 
standards; the AutoROPS absorbed all of the required energies and did not intrude into the clearance zone.  Since the 
fixed inside post for the third generation AutoROPS had smaller tube size, the ability of that posts to withstand the 
sequence of loading was questionable, but the results came positive, the post did withstand the applied loads. This 
study also focused on using finite element analysis to analyze the stresses on the base.  The results were positive and 
determined that the base did take the entire load being applied to it. Maximum stresses found on bolts were way below 
the minimum proof yield stress for the grade 8 bolt.  The base did show a good factor of safety during loading 
sequences. The redesigned version of the third generation AutoROPS has 10 inches of overlapping room between the 
posts, which met the design criteria and gave enough room for the spring to fit.  This design also allows the deployable 
post to retract all the way down to the base of AutoROPS and to have a height of 39 inches only. First and foremost, 
this study showed that the deployable AutoROPS is a novel idea to protect tractor operator in the case of a tractor 
rollover and to meet his need of having a low clearance zone while operating in the farm.  Although the third generation 
AutoROPS has proven effective in this research, it is necessary to continue research on future improvements of the 
AutoROPS.  The possibility of saving even more lives makes the continued research worth looking at. 
 
6. Recommendation for Future Work 
 
     The need for better analytical study in designing the AutoROPS becomes very important because the test standards 
were basically a pass or fail criteria.  Since the third generation AutoROPS was a new design, there are other criteria 
that need to be studied.  An example would be how the latching mechanisms would perform during loading and how 
it can be fitted in the overlapping area between the two posts. Another important subject that needs to be looked at is 
the deployment time required for the outside deployable posts to be deployed and still meet the necessary standards.  
Also, aspects of the spring criteria such as size, diameter and the release strength needed to be determined. Last but 
not least, the material properties like the strength and weight, and the cost of building the prototype need to be 
researched further.

Abstract 
Weighing mechanism is critical in any Industry. Error causing excess material shipped is loss to Industry. 
Less material shipped is loss to customer, leading to complaints, contract review and legal non 
compliance. Chemicals in this case are costly& corrosive. Reported complaints are erratic behavior of 
weighing balance because of mismatch in industry and customer readings, beyond tolerance. 
Complaints are responded by shipping the difference quantity. Small quantity shipments are risky, 
because of corrosive chemicals& results in Quality, Environment and Safety -QES risks. Deviation 
causes considered are Drift, aging, mechanical variations, moisture, wind, temperature, container 
variations, &human factor. The problem is variance attributes and multivariate analyses are non-
conclusive. The relationship between drift, calibration errors and reported mismatch is non-conclusive. 
SMART incubation center, of Aadishakti Foundation has solved this problem, bytest setup validation 
and mismatch identification at industry and at customer end defining, mutually acceptable techno-
commercial solution, QES guidelines for customer education. The case is based on primary data 
obtained from observations during the set-up validation &Techno-commercial solution, resulting in 
Academia-Industry Knowledge Bridge, by an intern. Improvements achieved are development of 
Standard Operating Procedure, acceptance norms, customer education, eliminating QES risk and 
complaints. 
Key Words  
QEMS risks, setup validation, Repeatability & Reproducibility- R & R studies, SMART incubation

1. Introduction
The Electronic indicator, reliable load cell with equilibrium correction, compensation for various errors and drift 
have made weighing easy. The weighing set up in the case, is validated by standard weights. Compensation results 
in reliable & accurate results. Compensation settings are protected by a password to ensure tamper proofing. Yet, 
complaints of erratic behaviour of weighing machine are reported as a problem. Since inception, number of 
successful projects related to problem solving, system development through ISO 9001, ISO 14001, ISO45001, 
ISO 27001, ISO 22001, SA 8001& ZED certifications; people, products and process improvisation are being 
executed for Industry, Academia, society and NGO, by Smart incubation centre of Aadishakti Foundation. The 
problem, although complex is taken up, to mentor the intern and build an Academia Industry Knowledge Bridge; 
thereby, reducing impact on safety and environment, thus also contributing to society.

customers agreed to follow the SOP and checklists. The customer appreciated it and agreed to review the 
acceptance norms.  The solution is techno-commercial and resulted in knowledge bank and QES system 
improvements. This eliminated all the risks and non-compliances and converted the complaints to customer 
delight. 
 
5. Conclusions 
In brief this study resulted in a knowledge bank, and knowledge build for the industry and customer. This 
eliminated quantity mismatch complaints and noncompliance in contract review, & QES risks. Simple technique 
like setup validation, agreeing on acceptance standards, Repeatability & Reproducibility study, customer 
education, risk mitigation by SOP development is proven very effective. With help of trained student, a complex 
problem having negative impact on organisational image, legal, safety and environment concern is solved. Role 
of the intern is to carryout studies for multiple observations and data collection to identify root causes. The intern 
has also developed the knowledge bank & shared it during training to convince the customer& educating the 
customer for the various mismatch attributes to help them in refining the acceptance norms. The solution 
eliminated the QES risks associated with the complaint resolution by small quantity shipment. 
 
Carrying out experiments at site and various locations is very difficult by the industry staff, due to production 
pressure. Knowledge built, such as dedicated SOPs - Standard Operating Procedures development and process 
design and validation are contribution of trained student & academia with mentoring. This is feasible due to better 
research acumen and lack of production targets. In brief all three student, Industry and Mentors have together 
contributed to resolve the problem and ensure system compliance. Such Industry Academia knowledge bridge is 
proven very effective to solve a complex problem.

Abstract 
The supply chain of spare parts is the intersection between two different organizations: the supply chain 
and the after-sales and maintenance services. The traditional configuration of organizations of spare parts 
management, is the decentralized management configuration, causes the lack of information 
sharing between technicians, unshared inventory, and ultimately, the logistics flow of deliveries and 
supply time significant which can engender costs important and low quality of service. 
In order to mitigate these effects, several maintenance organizations have directed towards 
centralized management of a supply chain of spare parts. For example, some authors have 
attempted to define improvement paths in terms of models to satisfy performance criteria such as hybrid 
methods for demand forecasting and approaches for the selection of management methods based on 
inventory management criteria. 
In addition, other authors are directed towards the integration of risk management in forecasting 
and management of the stock through the probabilistic models. Among these models, the graphical 
models are the most used for example the Bayesian networks and petri nets. 
This work involves developing a comparison of the models and approaches that deal with 
the forecasting and performance evaluation of spare parts inventory management.

Abstract 
In a vendor-buyer cooperative inventory system several factors including planned shortage, controlled 
sales price, shipment size and frequency affect the total profit. Though a larger order size reduces the 
number of shipments, it conversely increases the lead time and transportation cost. On the other hand, 
planned shortage of items reduces the buyer’s storage cost; at the same time it increases the backorder 
cost for the buyer. By controlling sales price, the buyer can affect the rate of market demand which 
eventually affects the total profit. The problem is to find an appropriate sales price, backorder quantity, 
ordering size and frequency that lead to maximum joint total profit. Considering all of these aspects for an 
imperfect production system, this paper presents two joint total profit models for two different cases 
depending on the location of the quality inspection. A search approach, based on random walk with 
random restart method, is used to solve both models for obtaining suboptimal solutions. A numerical 
instance is presented to illustrate the solution approach. The numerical instance presents that the solution 
noticeably differs when quality inspection is done by the buyer instead of vendor. 
 
Keywords 
Cooperative inventory, planned shortage, imperfect production, controlled sales price.  
 
1. Introduction 
Recently, joint economic lot size (JELS) problems have been in the spotlight of researches on supply chain. 
Many firms have adopted this type of lot-size models which coordinate inventory replenishment decisions between 
the buyer and the vendor. It has been proved that in most case if vendor and buyer make decisions jointly to 
determine the best policy, it is more rewarding for them than if they make decisions independently. Since JELS 
models have received more attention by firms, it has encouraged lot of researches to determine the best policy which 
can get the minimum total cost or the higher supply chain profit under an integrated vendor-buyer cooperation.  
In many researches on JELS models the imperfect production, lead time, pricing decisions or planned shortages 
have been studied separately. Indeed, since Goyal (1977) introduced the joint total cost for a vendor and a buyer and 
Benerjee (1986) extended Goyal’s work to determine the joint optimization of the cost functions of the vendor and 
the buyer, many researchers have studied JELS model in a lot of streams. 
The imperfect production has been introduced in an economic order quantity model by Porteus (1986). Salameh 
and Jaber (2000) extended Porteus’s work by finding the expected annual profit considering a 100% screening 
process where the rate of defective items is a random proportion. They also considered that imperfect items will be 
sold at the end of the screening process, in a single batch. Salameh and Jaber’s work has inspire many others 
researches. Huang (2002) considered a two-stage supply chain where a penalty cost is applied to the vendor if a 
shipment contains defective items. As well as Huang, researchers as Eroglu and Ozdemir (2007) added shortages to 
Salameh and Jaber’s model. Wee et al. (2007) also studied an optimal inventory model for items with imperfect 
quality and shortage backordering. Since this study, Chang and Ho (2010) extended Wee et al.’s work by using the 
renewal-reward theorem to modify the expected profit. Ha and Kim (2012) also reported a cooperative inventory 
model for imperfect quality. 
On the other hand, pricing decisions have impact on the profit of a model and on the demand. Researches that 
consider pricing decisions in JELS model have been conducted in many streams. Viswanathan and Wjang (2003) 
studied discount pricing decisions in distribution channels with price-sensitive demand. Ordering and pricing 
policies with price-sensitive demand have been studied in the research of Sajadieh and Jokar (2009a). In that 
research the maximize profit have been found by assuming a linear demand.

Hence in this part 20 examples have been resolved with the two search procedures for the two cases. The parameters 
for these 20 example are listed in Table 1. The two set of solutions (random walk with random restart and goal seek) 
in each cases are seen as paired observations (total profit). A paired t-test have been realized and it proves that the 
two methods give equal solutions. This result convinces us that a local optimal solution exists and that the search 
procedures developed give a correct approximate solution. 
These examples consider the case when the inspection occurs at the vendor. The parameters of the 20 examples

6. Conclusion 
A joint economic lot size (JELS) problem with imperfect production, pricing decisions and planned shortages is 
presented in this paper, when the lead time and transportation cost are significantly correlated with the order size. 
The objective of the problem was to maximize the joint total profit, by optimally determining the order size, unit 
selling price, backorder quantity and number of shipments. The problem is mathematically formulated for two cases 
and solved heuristically. A closed form solution for order quantity and unit selling price is not on hand due to lack of 
global concavity. The solution method follows derivative approach for finding optimum number of shipments and 
backorder quantity. Whereas, the order quantity and unit selling price were determined by a search heuristic namely, 
random walk with random restart. An efficient heuristic development is the potential extension of this research. 
Depending on the instance, a case based concavity in a certain solution range can lead to the finding of a local 
optimum solution.

Abstract 
The main objective of this research is to raise a proposal for the application of Lean Manufacturing tools 
for the reduction of waste in the textile industry. This paper presents of seeking the theoretical foundation 
of the philosophy of Lean Manufacturing, followed by a diagnosis was developed in a textile company 
where the main problem of 31% of non-fulfillment of orders is established, reaching measurements of 
activities that add value and does not add value, getting to elaborate the current Value Stream Mapping of 
the situation this company. Finally, the prioritization of the tools with criteria of cost, time, feasibility of 
the implementation, achieving definition of the proposal of 5S's and Manufacturing Cells. The 5S’s Lean 
Manufacturing Tool, will reduce waste or activities that do not add value to the product. This implies that 
the cycle time of the cutting process decreases from 4'04’’' to 3'50’', stamping, of 4'24 '' at 4'16’’ and packing 
from 2'40’’ to 2'36"" to himself, the work environment will be improved, from 46% to 87%. By 
implementing the Manufacturing Cells in the manufacturing process, the cycle time will reduce from 8'28'' 
/pajamas to 4'55''/pajamas, this implies that the production capacity of the process will increase from 1.080 
pajamas for month to 1.964 monthly pajamas, exceeding the customer demand with 23% which will reduce 
the order failure from 31% to 0%. This will allow the company to fully comply with the 1,589 monthly 
pajamas demanded by the customer.

1. Introduction
At the present time worldwide, Lean Manufacturing (LM) has revolutionized the way of producing by eliminating
those activities that do not add value to the final product (Bhamu and Sangwan, 2014), also called waste (Khalili et
al., 2017). Over the years, numerous improvement techniques have been developed, such as Total Quality
Management (TQM), Business Process Reengineering (BPR), the competitive advantages of the Porter diamond
model and the emergence of the Philosophy of LM with which seeks to raise the parameters of productivity, quality,
aiming at industrial excellence (Shah and Hussain, 2017).
Being the reason for study of this work entitled HME Application Proposal, this system is based on the reduction of 
waste, through the use of tools such as; 5S's, error-proof (Poka Yoke), Manufacturing Cells (CM), Total Productive 
Maintenance (TPM), Identification through cards or labels (Kanban) (Villena, 2016).

Transportation: The total traveled distance is 54m which was reduced to 38m, this reduction is achieved by reducing 
the activity transferring garments to packing from 32m to 16m, by changing the location of the packing process from 
floor 2 to floor 3, and this represents a decrease from 3'27'' to 1'30''.  
 
Unnecessary movements: The time of change or preparation is 2h 47'24 '' which was reduced to 2h 27'50 '' when 
applying the first phase to organize the 5S tools which focused on reducing the ANV as : look for negatives 17'35 '' 
which was reduced to 6'05 '', look for frames and tools 10'28 '' to 4'15 '', in total it was reduced 28'15 '' in activities 
that do not add value to the product having a positive impact on the cycle time since it was reduced from 4'24 '' to 4'16 
'', the remaining time is of ANV but which are necessary. 
 
Packaging process  
Disorder: By applying the 5S's in the manufacturing process, the compliance level will be improved from 47% to 
87%. 
 
Transportation: The distance traveled is 40m is reduced to 24m which is achieved by the relocation to the second 
floor, this also represents a reduction in time of the activity looking for garments in reprocess from 5 'to 1'45' ', this 
activity is considered as ANV to the product. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The Lean Manufacturing system helps deliveries to be quick, at the lowest price and the amount required by improving 
the work environment, eliminating the seven classic wastes present in any industry. 
 
When performing the initial diagnosis, it was determined that there is a 31% non-fulfillment of orders, this caused by 
processes without standard times, efficiency of 60% and with a CT 8'28 '' greater takt time of 6 ', which is considered 
as bottleneck or critical process. 
 
When implementing the MC in the manufacturing process, the CT will reduce from 8'28 '' / pajamas to 4'55 '' / pajamas, 
this implies that the production capacity of the process will increase from 1,080 pajamas per month to 1,964 pajamas 
per month, exceeding al to the customer's demand with 23% which will reduce the non-fulfillment of order from 31% 
to 0% this will allow the company to fully meet the customer's demand. 
 
When applying the first phase, organizing the 5S's in the cutting process will eliminate the activity to look for orders 
and look for tools, reducing 24'30 '' which reduces preparation time from 1h4'08 '' to 39'38 '' , on the other hand, the 
CT will decrease from 4'07 '' to 3'50 '', in print the activity will be reduced to look for negatives from 17'35 '' to 
6'05''and the activity of looking for 10 '' paintings 28 '' to 4'15 '' which will decrease the preparation time from 2h 47'24 
'' to 2h 27'50 '' and the CT from 4'24 '' to 4'16 ''.

Abstract 
What emerged in the last few years, it is the massive use of Information and Communication 
Technologies ICT in industrial production, in addition the automated systems are integrated in several 
industries such as automobile, textile and agri-food industry. The objective behind the introduction of 
automation in these industries was the optimization of the energy, improvement of productivity, and of 
course the alleviation of the burden of the operator’s work. Technological progress is constantly, 
automated systems are becoming more and more developed which require a skilled and versatile 
workforce adapted to this technology.  
ITC are more and more used in the Moroccan industry, including the use of automated systems in Small 
and Medium-Sized enterprises SMEs to improve productivity, competition and ensure the best product’s 
quality. The agents of these systems have found difficulties with the advent of the technological 
development of the automation by what the industry of the future requires qualifiers agents, competent 
or even versatile. The acquisition of new skills, that this either hard or soft, has become a necessity for 
the users of automated systems in order to keep their jobs within the SMEs. Among the means to help 
them to acquire the skills is training, several researches related to the training have been established in 
several areas of activities. Yet the industrial sector has not benefited from such research to find out the 
impact of the training on the employee, the work and the company.  
In this article we will present the results of our survey in the three industrial sectors dominant in Morocco 
(textile, the agri-food and the automobile) by focusing our study on employees of the automated systems 
and their relations with the training.

SMEs 
INTRODUCTION 
Small and medium-sized companies are constantly seeking to improve their employees’ skills based on internal 
and external training. Moroccan SMEs, too, invest in the continuous training of their staff to deepen their skills, 
but in a very modest [1] and non-fair way between operators, technicians and engineers. 
Several studies dealt with the influential theory of the training on the skills [2] In the field of public administration 
[3], health professionals [4], the maritime industry [5] and of the industrial process [6], as well in the various points 
such as the impact of training on the economic [7] and Social plan [8]. All these studies demonstrate that the 
continuous training has had some positive impacts on the personality of the trained, on their ways of working and 
on the company.  
Yet, there is no such study on the impact of the training in the Moroccan SMEs regarding the users of automated 
systems. In our study, we are going to deal with this point because the advent of the industry of the future (Industry 
4.0) makes their situations very vulnerable in relation to the other functions and the competent employees are rare.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 
A modest interest of SMEs by continuous training, agents of automated systems do not benefit from training in a 
fair way (by gender and the Professional grade) compared to their colleagues, which makes their jobs more 
vulnerable by this that the new technologies require very high skills. With the advent of the industry of the future 
called Industry 4.0, the machines will be more connected therefore the Human intervention will be at the strict 
minimum [30], the employees who do not have flexibility and versatility will suffer the consequence of this 
technological progress, that is to say that these employees will have to acquire new skills to not be lay off.  
Several researches show that the continuous training of employees has had positive effects in different areas on 
the three aspects: the personality of the employee, the manner of the work and the company. In addition, a study 
[31] has demonstrated the advantage of training continues on the health of the trained person, a monetary value is 
assigned by person and by training, which means that the employee must pay an amount for the improvement of 
its health through training.  
The role of agents of automated systems will reside on the analysis of data and the intervention in the appropriate 
time with more correct decision, therefore the training on similar case will be an asset for these agents. The 
automation makes the industrial physic tasks of employees very relieve, counterpart it puts their jobs in high risk 
due to their substitutions by these systems, and in addition it makes the mental and cognitive task more complex 
[19].  
In our study, we found that the continuous training has positive impacts on these three aspects, which coincides 
with the majority of the research on the training [32], despite the preference of men to women to benefit from the 
training. In addition, the majority of training is carried out in internal to the company and the themes of training 
are in relation with the information and the communication technologies.  
These results present a modest interest by SMEs to the training of their employees, we hope that the employers of 
these SMEs attach more investment in the training of their employees, by what the positive benefits [33] will be

Abstract 
In a very dynamic environment of today’s world, students face many forces destructing them from their 
studies like trend of internet use, other assignment of curricula, social requirements, fitness issues etc. 
Groups formed in a class also affect their performance. As group of good students will not allow weaker 
students to enter in their group. It makes the class learning very low and students less 
responsive/productive in writing their examinations. Cooperative approaches are supposed make them 
more responsive towards their performance by mixing them by breaking their informal structures. It may 
bring more flexibility in managing their time and effort. One such cooperative method of learning is 
Jigsaw method, a group based learning. This paper presents an effort to implement this method of 
cooperative learning to management subject taught in a top institute of INDIA. It highlights the feasibility 
of such approach in the professional studies. A pilot test was conducted for a topic of a subject. 
Evaluation of the groups and the class is done in steps. It is learnt that overall performance of each 
students has raised and the knowledge of the topic to each one was good. Results were exciting. Study 
highlights the pros and cons of this method as applied to a course of a professional program.

These results were tested statistically using t test with null hypothesis as “there was no significant difference in the 
performance of students in groups after and before discussion evaluation and also there was no significant 
difference between the performance before and after the study”. Student t test was performed to see if there was 
any significant difference between the performance of the groups before and after discussion performance in expert 
and home groups.  This test was performed on SPSS software on  a CP having windows 10 with intel R CORE i 5 
with RAM 4GB. p values from student t test were less than 0.05 for all the groups and class, so null hypothesis was 
rejected for every case. p and t values from t test are summarized in table 3. t test results showed that there is 
significant difference in performance of students after and before discussion in both Home Groups and Expert 
Groups. Also there is significant improvement in performance of students after the completion of the study. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Result of the study show that the performance of students improved significantly during each step of the study. 
Increase in average performance of students after expert group discussion was 59%. Individual expert group 
performances were increased by 74%, 49%, 37%, 78.8% and 62.8% for Expert Group E1, E2, E3, E4 and E5 
respectively. Increase in average performance of students after home group discussion was 24.55%. Individual 
Home Group performance increment was 22.15%, 22.5%, 27.15%, 31.45% and 18.32% for Home Group H1, H2, 
H3, H4 and H5 respectively. 
In conducting this study, few problem were faced. (A) decision of allowing students to discuss their topics at their 
residence was not correct and led to more time consumption. (B) Absetesm was another problem as students were 
participating in some cultural function and did not attend the class missing the respective part of the study. Overall 
increased 
cumulative 
time 
was 
a 
great 
disadvantage.  
All peers with the instructors believed that this study must be planned well and designed for time.  Else, tudents 
were enthused with this type of approach and performed well, general. This study can be extended to remove the 
barrier of time and inclusion of complex topics of management.

Abstract 
The number of crane being used in loading and unloading is rising along with growth of shipping activity. 
However, the growing number of crane is not simultaneous with crane technology development. Crane 
operation requires the skilled operator to move containers from ship to shore or vice versa. This is not 
efficient because a container moving pace and the accuracy depend on operator’s skill, and also for a port 
to operate 24-hour needs to shift the crane operator. To reduce work accident due to crane operator error 
and to increase the optimum time of crane use significantly, we offer autonomous container gantry crane 
to simplify crane operation based on image processing and distance calculation. Using Convolutional 
Neural Network, and centralized crane operator, it will be able to reduce the number of crane operator and 
increase the accuracy that will affect crane productivity. It can be operated easily, efficiently, and in the 
future it is expected to solve the loading and unloading problem.

CONCLUSION 
Autonomous CC is a conventional CC that 
modified into driverless automatic CC. Using added 
components such as two cameras, two encoders, one 
computer, and single microcontroller in each CC, the 
conventional CC will work automatically controlled 
from the main office. So then the implementation of 
autonomous CC will be able to reduce CC operator 
from 10 operators to 3 operators on each shift. The 
operator of autonomous CC is also safer than 
conventional CC since they are working indoor. 
Undoubtedly, the using of autonomous CC is very 
effective to cut down the operational cost of a port. 
Based on the case in Container Terminal of Teluk 
Lamong the using of autonomous CC will cut down 
the price to 599,627,310.63 IDR each year, from 
859,995,026.40 IDR can be reduce to 260,367,715.77 
IDR. The use of autonomous CC will benefit many 
parties, such as ship owners, port, and shipping 
company. In the further, Autonomous Container 
Crane can be developed so it does not require signify 
modification on the container to make it very flexible 
if applied in the feeder port that mostly found in 
eastern Indonesia. Therefore the use of autonomous 
CC can accelerate the rate of the maritime economy 
to support Indonesia as world’s maritime axis. 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST 
The existence of autonomous CC does not cause 
any disadvantages to one of the parties. Port, ship 
owner, and shipping company will be involved in 
mutually benefit. The addition of the coloured circle 
at the top of the container can use weather proof 
sticker material and does not cause any significant 
changes in the form of the container. The 
conventional CC operators can be redirected to the 
other stations such as container handling at the 
terminal since the number of port capacity is rising.

Abstract  
 
In supply chain practices, designing supply network is a strategic decision that affects the survival of an 
organization. Although demand and supply uncertainties are well observed in supply chains, it has not 
been addressed pro-actively in the design model.  Vast literatures on network design model had been 
dealing the problem using either deterministic (using mean value) or stochastic programming. We 
propose a mathematical model using robust approach where the variability of system performance is 
taken into account early in the modeling process.  Using this robust optimization approach, the knowledge 
of demand and supply distributions is not critical. Furthermore, only a small number of scenarios are 
needed to solve the problem and yet it is able to maintain the adequacy of the model. The result from an 
illustrative example shows that total costs vary following a normal distribution where its variance depends 
on the risk parameters.

1. Introduction 
Nowadays, most companies believe that decision making based on the supply chain concept is necessary to ensure 
the survival of their organizations. In an emerging environment of demanding customers, companies must correctly 
respond to their needs in timely and swiftly manners. Consistencies of meeting demands at the right amount, at the 
right time and at the right qualities are becoming more important to the customer.  
 
It is well observed in supply chain practices that uncertainties are present in many ways. Demand forecasts are 
subject to errors which may results in real demands higher or lower than their forecast average. In some countries, 
transportation lead times are very difficult to forecast due to heavy congestion, weather and accidents.  If companies 
do not deal with these uncertainties appropriately, they are prone to poorer performance in particular the total cost of 
meeting demands. It is therefore necessary for companies to take these uncertainties into account when developing 
their strategic plans. According to Geary et al. (2002), uncertainties in supply chains can be categorized into process, 
supply, demand, and control uncertainties. Gupta and Maranas (2003) stated that those uncertainties needs to be 
tackled with supply chain planning because decisions made in supply chains are very critical to the survival of the 
company.   
  
Mulvey et al. (1995) introduced the robust optimization approach when dealing with uncertainties.  Their approach 
is proactively seeking the “best” solution in term of robustness which is insensitive to uncertainties. This robust 
optimization concept has been widely applied in many areas of decision making including in supply chains (e.g. Ben 
Tal, 2005, Bertsimas and Thiele, 2004). To the best of our knowledge, however, these methods have not been 
implemented for supply network design. The problem has been solved by using stochastic programming (Nagar and 
Jain, 2008, Santoso et al, 2005, Kallrath, 2005).  We believe that solving the supply network design problem with 
robust optimization approach will bring about some advantages, for example there is no need for the assumption of 
parameter distribution.

4. Conclusion and further research 
In this paper, we develop a robust optimization model to network designs taking into account both supply and 
demand uncertainties. As expected, the resulting solutions are depending on how decision makers view risks and 
their implications both to costs realization and unmet demands or supplies.  The total costs vary following a normal 
distribution where its variance depends on the risk parameters.  Using the same ߣ parameter, the mean cost deviation 
is larger with larger 𝜔 while the unmet demands and supplies is getting smaller.  Conversely, the results also show 
that when using the same 𝜔, the mean cost deviation is smaller with larger  ߣ .  The mean unmet demands/suppliers, 
however, is larger with larger  ߣ. 
 
In the future, we still have to investigate the model and its solution approach, in particular the effect of discretization 
of demand and supply distributions.  Furthermore, computational complexities of the problems still need to be 
investigated.

Abstract  
 
Worldwide the issue of food waste is highly relevant and intensely discussed in public media and social 
networks. The focus is often on grocery retail, not least because it is easily accessible to the public and 
there is direct contact with the final consumer. The research work presented here establishes a direct link 
between this issue and the grocery retail and provides a solution for waste reduction in stores of a 
stationary food retail company. It consists of reducing the average stocks of quickly perishable goods in 
stores of grocery retailers. We propose a methodical transfer of quickly perishable goods between grocery 
stores. Our solution shows the reduction of inventories without increasing the costs in the grocery stores. 
The approach is to achieve a daily delivery and an internal transfer of goods between stores. As a result of 
the decline in average inventories, both waste volumes and total costs are reduced in stores. A realistic 
simulation study shows that the transfer of goods is a suitable method for the reduction of waste in the 
considered application area. The developed approach can be implemented in practice without loss of the 
customer service level.

Abstract 
 
The decision-making process can be biased by virtue of the role that mental shortcuts play in human 
decision making. Although many researchers have studied this fact in form of psychological behaviours 
and behavioural economics, limited research has explored the role of heuristics and biases in the selection 
and definition of infrastructure projects. Accordingly, this paper provides a baseline for further research, 
presented in a “codex model”. A survey has been conducted to address the extent of people's awareness of 
heuristics and biases. The results show that more than 80% of the participants are not familiar with the 
concept of decision-making heuristics and biases. This research is important because it highlights the fact 
that increasing the awareness of decision-making heuristics and biases may lead to improved project 
decisions.

1. Introduction 
To start with, it is essential to define the term “infrastructure” for clarity and focus of this paper. The word 
“infrastructure” comes from the combination of the words “infra” and “structure”. “Infra” is a Latin prefix which 
literally translates to the word “below” and “structure” is an English context which means the arrangement of 
complex elements. According to (Beeferman and Wain, 2016), analysts are split in two groups by virtue of 
categorizing the term infrastructure. Some analysts categorize infrastructure into economic infrastructure and social 
infrastructure. Economic infrastructure involves facilities that can generates reasonable income such as tunnels, toll-
roads, bridges, airports, rail network, as well as, shared utilities like gas and water distribution networks, electricity 
and renewable energy production and distribution. Social infrastructure, includes health care facilities and schools. 
Unlike economic infrastructure, there may be no identifiable revenue generation from social infrastructure. On the 
other hand, other analysts categorize infrastructure into three divisions: social infrastructure, transportation, and 
utilities. 
 
Infrastructure projects have a great impact on economic growth and improving regional Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP). This fact has been confirmed through different reports and publications, as several regions including Europe, 
North America, South America, the Middle East and some parts of Africa have gained valuable lessons from 
developing infrastructure projects (European Commission, 2014; Freund and Lanchovichina, 2012; Kumo, 2012; 
Ismail and Mahyideen, 2015; Copeland, Levine and Mallett, 2011; The Federation of Canadian Municipalities, 
2012; The Canadian Chamber of Commerce, 2016; Development Bank of Latin America, 2011). The development 
of infrastructure projects has also an essential role in countries’ growth and the quality of living for the citizens of 
those countries. As the requirements of the modern lifestyle quality, such as electricity supply, transports and 
telecommunications, are exponentially increasing, robust decisions should be taken to mobilize the implementation 
of infrastructure projects.

The results obtained from the survey show that the concept of decision-making heuristics and biases is not highly 
known in the context of selection and definition of infrastructure projects. In the survey, participants were asked if 
they are familiar with the concept of psychological traps (decision-making heuristics and biases). The results show 
that 88% of the participants are not aware of the concept.

6. Discussion and conclusion 
The decision-making process can be biased by virtue of the role that mental shortcuts play in human decision 
making. Although many researchers have studied this fact in form of psychological behaviours and behavioural 
economics, limited research has explored the role of heuristics and biases in the selection and definition of 
infrastructure projects. Accordingly, this study shows that there is poor awareness about the concept of decision-
making heuristics and biases in the context of selection and definition of infrastructure projects. 
 
Base on the conducted survey, 88 percent of the participants were not familiar with the concept of decision-making 
heuristics and biases, and this may result in distorting and perceptions while making a decision. As evident in the 
survey the poor level of awareness is also true for people who are involved in the decision-making process, where 
71% of the participants have been involved in decision-making. The fact is also true for people whom get involved 
in projects with an average rough order of magnitude proposed cost of 10 million and more. 
 
The low level of awareness on decision-making heuristics and biases may discourage the decision-making process. 
McCray, Purvis and McCray (2002) have stated that through the explicit recognition and purposeful mitigation of 
unwelcome heuristics and biases the project management process can be enhanced noticeably. This establishes the 
importance of increasing the awareness of the psychological traps can help to avoid some of the mental pitfalls 
(Chatzipanos and Giotis, 2014). With the given figures, further research is required to answer the question of how 
the role of heuristics and biases affects the decision making in infrastructure projects? To what extent does do 
people fall into do people fall into the decision traps when selecting an infrastructure project? And how the 
effectiveness of decisions in infrastructure projects can be affected by the presence of heuristics and biases? 
 
6.1 Future work 
1) Develop a model and show the potentials of DM-HB: the selection and definition stage of infrastructure 
projects requires lot of works, data to be analyzed, modelling across individuals and teamwork. A useful thing 
to do, as it has been suggested in previous literature, is to increase the awareness of the DM-HB. This can be

obtained by developing a model that describes the decision-making process and show the potential DM-HB that 
might occur in each step. 
2) Personality testing: Other work can be done by relating people’s personalities to the potential of DM-HB. 
Such as using Carl Jung’s theory by showing which personality has a bigger chance of falling into specific traps. 
This can help to understand the potential of each trap in an individual level.  
3) The contribution of heuristics and biases in the decision-making process: The decision-making process in 
SD-IP typically involves multidisciplinary team where the majority of the individuals might not be experts in 
DM-HB. Hence, prioritizing the DM-HB can be useful in individuals and organizational levels to know which 
of the biases should be given more attention, and which of the heuristics and biases have more impact on 
causing failures in infrastructure projects.

Abstract 
Lean thinking is one of the most modern and well-established methodologies which provide an effective structure to 
improve the performance of production and service processes including healthcare systems. The objective of this 
study is to minimize the length of stay (LOS) of patients at the Emergency Department (ED) by using the principles 
of lean production, and thus to increase the satisfaction of patients and medical staff. Process improvement 
methodology and tools were applied in parallel with lean principles to detect the critical quality factors affecting 
LOS, and to seek non-value added activities in the emergency service processes. Moreover, other tools of Lean-
Kaizen such as fishbone diagram, brainstorming, and VSM are used to analyze the root causes of waste and propose 
the improvements. Appropriate improvements were generated based on lean philosophy coupled with a simulation 
model.

Introduction 
Healthcare organizations, known as complex business systems, need to balance the amount paid for the medical care 
services and the overall outcome generated from them considering the needs of relevant expectation groups 
including patients, workers, hospital owners, etc. [1], [2]. Efforts to achieve this balance should focus on whether (1) 
the services provided by both public and private healthcare organizations are sufficient to meet the patients’ needs 
and expectations, and (2) the resources are allocated and utilized efficiently [3]. These two issues are especially 
critical for the management of the emergency care services.  
Among others, emergency care services have been recognized as unique and critical units of the hospitals due to a 
high demand of patients with various and unpredictable cases which may also require different and complex care 
processes regarding the type and severity of the case. Such services should be provided in a timely fashion and in a 
correct way, which also requires sufficient service capacity, operational flexibility and speed, and knowledgeable 
stuff. Overcrowding and long waiting times are reported as the major problem at most of the emergency departments

 
To prevent the ""5S"" method from becoming a non-recurring case, it is essential to evolve a policy to sustain 
workplace improvement. Therefore, the 5S audit sheet should be prepared every month in order to support 
improvements. 
 
The value stream map for each product family should be plotted every six months to review the process 
details to enhance the pull system flow and reduce wastes in processes, if necessary, the process should be 
redesigned.

Discussion & Conclusion 
The implementation of lean methodology in the healthcare sector is an area which has attracted the interest of 
practitioners and researchers to improve the performance of medical services. This study was also aimed to improve 
quality and productivity of healthcare processes through lean production initiatives by focusing on human value 
rather than products only. 
One of the challenges in this study is the work in an emergency department which is the most complicated part of 
the hospital because different patients' requirements depend on each patient's situation so there are different flows 
with different time cycles and processes. By taking advantage of the product family idea in lean manufacturing 
which is another contribution to the study; the patients represented as service/products to identify patient families at 
emergency department based on triage process by using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI). Moreover, from the 
study it is evident that simulation model is an effective, and methodology will help in gearing up the process by 
eliminating root causes of the problem, and reducing the length of stay of patients. This will lead to increase the 
turnaround in the emergency rooms and increase of the satisfaction level of the patients and employees. The 
effectiveness of the lean projects in health care can be increased by the integration of simulation; many of the risks 
in the adjustment of an existing system can be avoided, and possible improvements can be observed in a very short 
time. In this study, the positive results mentioned earlier in the methodology confirmed the decreasing in the length 
of stay (LOS) of patients and increasing the process cycle efficiency. Hence, this will lead to the increase in the 
satisfaction level of patients and the medical staff. Therefore, the novelty of our study is applying lean methodology 
with taking the advantage of product family idea and using simulation model to implement improvements. Clearly 
from our results, Lean method has emerged as an important methodology in investigating and reducing the wastes in 
the flow cycle of patients at Emergency Department. 
As a sequel of the work to gain more customers and keep existing customers, it is important to study costs besides 
reducing the LOS at the hospital. Moreover, the patient volumes increase during the winter months because certain 
illnesses are more prevalent, and in particular during the day shift. Since patients will suffer longer delays when the 
demand is high, a further study to level the workload may be needed. 
It is important to mention the shortage points in this study, which could be included in a future study, as follows: the 
limits of time the Level 1 is not considered, and the most repeated flow scenario is taken into consideration for each 
product family and the other flows were neglected. Furthermore, the simulation model could be used to show further 
analysis such as the bottlenecks in the system, as well as the utilization percentage of the rooms and medical staff.  
Finally, the main barriers to implementation of lean methodology at the hospital in this study were: difficulty in 
obtaining baseline data on process performance; especially there is no record of the time consumed by patients at the 
hospital and the lack of both information exchange between employees and management, and the improvement 
culture.

Abstract 
Aging population and expecting a higher living standard in the developed countries cause demanding 
and high quality service in healthcare industry respectively. However, one of the customer requirement 
is to reduce the waiting time to see the doctor in the high demand of public medical. As a result, 
service appointment scheduling is the important issue.  The poor medical service scheduling may 
lead to the complaints from patients on waiting time. Researchers tried to minimize the hospital explicit 
and implicit cost and maximize patient’s satisfaction by adopting the appointment scheduling rules. 
The trade-off is considered in appointment scheduling problem. In general, solving appointment 
scheduling problem includes simulation and analytical method. The proposed approach allows hospital 
to take as a reference to further improve the appointment scheduling system. In this research, appointment 
scheduling optimization model with LINGO software using the exact algorithm is applied into the 
appointment scheduling problem for the outpatient clinic. The performance of the appointment 
scheduling optimization model is examined in difference case scenario and performance improvement is 
realized.

1. Introduction
How do we assign the patients to see which doctor at the particular time-slot? Will hospital consider setup a best
appointment system for maximizing profit in one day while minimizing the patient waiting, doctor idle time and
overtime? When the patient no-show or cancelled the booking, what will be the new arrangement and how to re-
scheduling them? If there are many cases have to see by the same specialist in one-day, how will the hospital take
actions to consider this kind of worst-case scenario? There are many challenges faced by the healthcare industry which
needed to be solved. Besides, in the healthcare industry, the purpose of the hospital is not only to cure the patient, but
also to consider about the customer satisfaction. Customer satisfaction has become the most important concern, as it
can reveal the quality of healthcare services. With the problem of aging population, the elderly has become the most
demanding group with a large amount of patients who requires all types of medical services (MacLeod et al., 2014).
For instant, the elderly patients have high risk of suffering chronic disease. Therefore, they would more concern
whether they can have the timely and appropriate treatment (Xie & Lawley, 2015).
Furthermore, treatment-processing time can be extended when the disease becoming pro-longed without taking care, 
so patient have to address for a longer period of recovering time in the hospital (Hall, 2006). To maintain an 
outstanding performance while balancing the resource equally, effective resources allocation and planning is required 
so as to assign the number of nurses or doctors in a consultation room. Facilities planning such as utilizing the 
appropriate number of consultation room in the hospital enable smooth diagnosis operation. Beside excellent service, 
simulation method is used to enhance service qualities (Mustafee & Katsaliaki, 2015).In case there is not enough nurse 
in one ward but with a large group of patient. Patients may not satisfy with service because of long waiting time. As 
usual, this kind of scheduling need to figure out the trade-off between waiting time of patient and hour rate of doctors 
(Saremi, 2013). For hospital point of view, maximizing the profit, margin and resource usages is the goal. On the other 
hand, doctors expect the less overtime hours or idle time to serve all booked patients within the clinic operation hours. 
For patient, they are expecting shortest waiting time as well as quality medical care services (Lailomthong & 
Prichanont, 2014). Therefore, a well-planning schedule for the doctor and patient is important to maintain a satisfied

For the case study scenario 1, the total makespan of each doctor is 170 minutes, which means that the completion time 
of each doctor is 11:50am. Comparing to the leaving time, the 10 minutes left of each doctor can handle one more 
patient for taking an advice or it is one of the buffer zone for the doctor to take rest. As a result, doctor will not getting 
idle or overtime, the patient’s appointment schedule will be shortened due to more patient can be handled for the time 
left in the buffer zone. This method can provide a base to hospital that the appointment scheduling system can be 
improved. 
 
For the case study scenario 2, the waiting time for each patient is around 26 minutes and each doctor waiting time is 
around 25 minutes. While the solver is giving the result for the hospital to know appointment schedule for each patient, 
and the waiting time could be eliminated or minimized by assigning the patient arrival time of that session (i.e. 
Assigning patient 1 and 2 come at 9:00am and patient 8 and 9 at 9:15am). For the overtime problem, doctor can put 
the patient in the next session (i.e. patient 5 and patient 7) and put the other patient in this timeslot to prevent idle or 
overtime. As a result, the problem would be minimized so as to increase the patient satisfaction and decrease the 
doctor performance. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Appointment Scheduling Optimization techniques can solve different problems like manufacturing problem, job-shop 
scheduling problem or appointment scheduling problem. To sum up, in this research, a formulation of general n-
patient, m-doctor outpatient appointment scheduling problem by minimizing the makespan, waiting time and overtime 
as the criterion. Computational results of the case study are reported using the proposed mixed integer linear 
programming model to solve the appointment scheduling problem. It would be generated by the method of LINGO 
and it would be interpreted by tabular representation. As a result, hospital can treat the result as a reference and further 
develop a better appointment scheduling system. Besides, it can show that a good appointment scheduling leads to 
different kinds of benefit among doctor, hospital and patients. Patients do not need to stay for a long time to seek the 
doctor advice;, doctor can clearly answer the question from the patient and increase their own performance; and 
hospital can increase their patient flow from minimizing the makespan so that the hospital can enhance the efficiency 
of public health service and alleviate the problem of long waiting time of appointment booking. 
 
Future research in outpatient appointment scheduling problem may summarize as followings. Firstly, the scope of the 
linear programming model can be extended for other country not limited to Hong Kong. Secondly, more uncertain 
factors should be determined and should be put into the formulas to ensure the result more close to reality. Thirdly, 
more data like service time duration should be taken to ensure generating a more accurate result.

I. Introduction
Customer dissatisfaction is the degree to which the products and services offered by an organization fail to meet
customers’ expertise. Customer dissatisfaction can be described as the unhappiness or disappointment a customer
experiences when comparing the Percival performance of the outcomes to the expectations they had in mind. For
when customers are not satisfied with the services or products they receive in a certain company, they tend to complain
and usually leave with immediate effect. Customers are considered as the primary stakeholders of any successful
organization. Customer satisfaction is important because it is the major indicator measuring the likelihood of a
customer in making repeat purchases because it is also considered to a point of differentiation in a way that it assist
the organization to strive for success and provide all possible means of keeping their customers happy. By so doing,
customer churn decreases through measuring as well as tracing customer satisfaction through the provision of
customer service quality, which lead to customer period value increment, simply because customer satisfaction is an
important factor concerning the amount of revenue a satisfied customer produces for the organization, through
decreasing the level of negative word of mouth and keeping an eye on satisfaction changing trends. It is therefore
financially easier for an organization to keep a regular customer rather than to recruit an exclusive one. Many
organizations strive to have satisfied and happy employees in order to achieve the competitive advantage and customer
satisfaction. Those that fail to do so, they usually have a room filled with complaints from their customers about the
poor service quality they receive from their employees.
The banking industry is definitely the most auspicious industry in a country. In general, the word ‘Bank’ brings an 
understanding that this organization deals with capital .There are various types of banks, namely: agricultural bank,

Abstract 
Service quality in today’s business industry is one of the most important aspects to meet customer 
needs and exceed their expectations. For the organization to offer good service quality, it starts with 
motivating and empowering employees. If employees are not motivated, this will lead to bad customer 
service but if employees are recognized at their workplace this will lead to customer satisfaction and 
loyalty. Organizations that offer good service quality to their current customers, make profits, acquire 
new customers, and also achieve competitive advantage. The purpose of this research was to analyze 
the service quality of Engen Petrol Station by focusing on the frontline employees and also getting 
feedback from their customers on how well do the employees of the branch meet their needs. The 
objective was to identify problems and give recommendations. Problems were identified in the 
management whereby they don’t give enough motivation and also empower their employees. The other 
problem was also employees’ not meeting customer needs.

I. Introduction
Each and every organization need to make progress towards greatness with a specific end goal, to do as such organizations
need to guarantee that they provide suitable quality services to meet customer desires. The key aim of organizations is to
grow their operating profits while diminishing costs. One of the components that can help to expand sales is customer
satisfaction, which consequently will result to customer loyalty. The look into service quality started in the 1980s
(Parasuraman et al., 1985), to highlight its solid effect on business execution, cost reduction, customer satisfaction, and
customer dedication (Gurau, 2003; Newman, 2001; Silvestro and Cross, 2000; Sureshchander et al., 2002). Service quality
is to a greater extent a correlation of the customer expectations and the service performance. Although the principles of
enhancing product quality are also relevant to service, it is essential to know the focus parts of improvement as regards to
increasing customer satisfaction in service quality management. This should be possible by measuring the gap between
customers’ expectations and how they see the services offered to them. The bigger the gap size, the more changes to be
made. Service quality management is the process of being in charge of services provided to customers based on their
expectations. It is basically analyzing how good a service has been delivered, in order to enhance its quality in the near
future, distinguish problems and solve them to increase customer satisfaction. Service quality management includes the
monitoring and maintenance of the different services that are offered to customers by an organization. Customers are the
heart of organizations, because without them organizations do not exist. Obliging the necessities of the customer is critical
to customer retention. To give an outstanding customer service, a culture of serving customers must spread throughout the
company. At the point when all workers comprehend that satisfying customers is associated with the success of the business,
they will step up with regards to build a superior customer experience. A business with high service quality will meet or
surpass customer desires while remaining financially focused. The enhanced service quality yields 2 financial gain and long
term competitiveness. The enhancements to service quality might be accomplished by enhancing operational procedures,
distinguishing problems rapidly and comprehensively, setting up legitimate and reliable service performance measures and
measuring customer satisfaction and other execution results. In light of this, this research is an attempt to investigate the 897",,,european 2018

Abstract 
 
This study is to review the multi-organizational team integration practice to enhance the organizational 
strategies in delivering the construction projects. Therefore, this paper aims to integrate the key 
determinants of multi-organizations and reviewing the literature in merging a set of key determinants of 
multi-organizational integration with the well-established McKinsey 7S model. Subsequently, a set of 
questionnaires was designed to gain insight and opinion from experts in terms of the relevancy of the 
determinants underpinning the dimensions of the McKinsey 7S model. The identified 23 key 
determinants (KDs) initially assessed by award winning construction organizations from Malaysian 
Construction Industry Excellence Awards (MCEIA). Then, the validated KDs presented by 34 
construction practitioners to figured out its relevancy to the strategies in the McKinsey 7S model. The 
findings showed that the KDs of multi-organizational integration complementary with the strategies in the 
McKinsey 7S model. This study recognizes that while the success of multi-organizational integration 
depends on many determinants, it further extends the integration literature by giving insights into what are 
the dominant organizational strategies influencing the multi-organizational integration practice.

1. Introduction 
 
In construction nowadays, organizations are giving more focus on the topic of multi-organizations 
integration. Thus, more integrated approach need to revise to solve the problems and constraints in construction as 
well as need to be strengthen. In addition, due to the complex nature of construction, the integration approach needs 
to be highlight and refined to avoid problems in construction. Therefore, the multi-organizational collaboration is a 
vital importance in construction needs to achieve significant cost reduction and to reduce overall service cost. 
Otherwise, will increase the trend towards a focus on core and outsourcing noncore competencies that will leads to a 
narrowing of capability and increased specialization (Purchase, Parry, Valerdi, D, & J, 2011). The various team 
unable to work as a team and collaborate as expected to deliver the project effectively because of the structure and 
current practice in the construction project delivery tends to be relatively fragmented (Ibrahim, Costello, & 
Wilkinson, 2013). The main influence on the effective integration is the organization strategies itself whereby the 
effectiveness of a conceptualization of an integrated team and well-established organization able to guarantee a 
successful restructuring. According to the previous scholar, strategic planning is one of the useful tool which helps 
on managing projects especially if strategic of the strategies and plans can be implemented successfully throughout 
the organization. Obviously, a great organizational strategies developing a strategic plan and once developed, a great 
deal of strategic management brings its aims to the good integration (Rahmat, Ibrahim, & Endut, 2017). The 
integration defined as the “combination of different disciplines or organizations into a single cohesive and mutually 
supporting unit, with alignment of processes and cultures” (Bernard K Baiden & Price, 2011; Rahmat et al., 2017). 
Therefore, the objective of this paper is to conducts a validation on a set of KDs with the McKinsey 7S model 
elements and to formulate a conceptual framework aimed at developing and sustaining good relationships and 
performance levels throughout the multi-organizational team integration (MOTI) for construction projects in the life 
cycle frame.

that aid in improving the forecast results of the project as well as a master control schedule and budget need to be 
made include phase and project scope. For example, one of the interviewee said that, determining and predict the 
cost overrun by conducting qualitative and quantitative risk analyzes, measure probable costs and determine the 
risks involved would be easier if planning the better schedules. However, this strategy also known as risk 
identification which can play a complementary role in laying the foundation for cost-effective project management 
and project performance. Another strand of literature, the strategy is vital important to overcome the challenges in 
managing the project. Hence, the strategic planning and schedules is important to remain effective and software 
needed to manage the costs and budget (Walker & Llyod-Walker, 2015). Developing a strategic plan by focusing the 
goals and objectives that will lead to the outcomes in the long-term results and one of the strategy. This dimension 
provides a perspective or strategy that can then be mapped and managed through stated objectives, identifying the 
most appropriate measures that provide evidence of success, to document the goals, and initiatives that provide fast 
action in reaching the goal (Walker & Llyod-Walker, 2015). This element is categorized under the strategy as it 
provides a manageable and well-defined perspective, and a great way to identify the steps to measure the success, 
document the targets and deliver fast initiative action in achieving goals. From the construction manager points of 
view, focusing on goals and objectives is part of the strategy in which more focus on a team and organization level 
is priority instead of an individual level. For example, creating objectives helps the organization to set the priorities 
for its goals. In addition, set goals and develop a comprehensive management strategy prior to focus on employees is 
an important part of strategic management (Pellicer, Sanz, Esmaeili, & Molenaar, 2016). 
In terms of structure, the creation of single team location as one fundamental indicators and needs to be 
brought together from the beginning of the project. Otherwise, throughout share information within team will 
increase collaboration through shared information. However, some of the procurement does not necessarily call for 
the creation of the single co-located although collective working was encouraged in the project. Additionally, project 
teams will integrate effectively, work collectively as well as build relationship throughout enables project by 
locating together at the common office (Izam Ibrahim et al., 2013). From the expert’s point of view, project manager 
points out that, project teams will be able to effectively integrate if they work on the same site and thus solve the 
problem easily. For example, by locating the project team in the same building or adjacent sites and held discussions 
at a strategic project team. This statement supported with literature, the establishment of a single project team, where 
all members are located together in a common office in a single project team (Bernard K Baiden & Price, 2011) 
enables project team to integrate effectively, build relationships and work collectively (Izam Ibrahim et al., 2013). 
Additionally, project teams will integrate effectively, work collectively as well as build a relationship throughout 
enables at the same office (Rahmat et al., 2017) In general, the level of governance and structure in the project 
organization known as structure that shows the coordination and implementation of project activities. The objective 
is to create interactions among team members by reducing duplication tasks as well as conflicts and disruptions in 
the organization. This is one of the important decisions for the project management to establish the organization 
structure that will be used for the project (PM4Dev, 2007; Walker & Lloyd-Walker, 2015). However, it can be 
conceptualized through the different sets of decision making, coordination mechanisms, incentives (Yin & Zajac, 
2004) also in different level of influences that coordination and controlling the activities in the organizations. The 
level of governance and structure is having a unified way that each project delivery team party legitimizes its actions 
through rules, standards and norms, values and coordination mechanisms such as organizational routines, and the 
way that committees, liaison and hierarchy represents a unified or complimentary way of interacting. This impacts 
the quality of explicit understanding of how teams should collaborate and communicate (Walker & Lloyd-Walker, 
2015). From the expert’s points of view, project manager stated that, “To be effective, the individuals who direct the 
program and those who oversee its work activities must be organized, and their contributions must be modeled to 
ensure that authority and decision-making has a clear source, the work of management and oversight is efficient, and 
the needs for direction and decisions are all addressed”. From the statement supports with literature stated by Walker 
(2015), with regulatory and structural projects, a method identified to unite the project team is to verify the action 
through rules, standards that conform to norms, values and coordination mechanisms such as routine organizations 
for each unified and easy-to-understand committee. This can provide an understanding among team project in order 
for information to be clearly convey within team members about their roles, collaboration and communicate 
effectively and well (Lin & Ho, 2013; Walker & Lloyd-Walker, 2015). 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The study aims to give an overview of the key determinants of multi-organizational team integration using 
McKinsey 7S model in construction projects from experts Malaysian construction builders’ point of view. Based on 
13 interviews and 21 online survey, it has shown that 23 key determinants are important and have relationship with

the McKinsey concept. This research suggests that McKinsey 7S model in team integration is useful for improving 
the effectiveness of multi-organizational teamwork. Practices that meets the various requirement of multi-
organizational team integration in fulfilling the key determinants of effective integration teamwork. Therefore, it has 
been identified the key determinants in seven categories of McKinsey 7S model supports the position of that multi-
organizational team integration is desirable to improve the teamwork effectiveness. Since the key determinants were 
validated from Malaysian organizations’ perspective towards McKinsey 7S model, it is suggested that further study 
should be conducted to further understand on the nature and characteristics of the KDs locally and in other countries 
for comparative purposes.

Abstract 
 
The new trend is to avoid high-volume batch-and-queue manufacturing to produce small batches with 
short lead-time due to fluctuation in customer demands. However, producing more products at small 
batches results in more changeovers. Thus, a rapid changeover provides to be able to manufacture small 
quantities of the large diversity of customer demands. One of the most common method for changeover 
time reduction is Single Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED) which is a technique of Lean Manufacturing. 
The developed prototype intelligent SMED decision support methodology uses the expertise of different 
experts, professionals and scientific papers. Intelligent system approach for SMED has two main 
functions. First one is gathering data that the system asks some questions to the user to obtain the facts of 
the company and the second one is intelligent recommendations. According to “the facts” and “inference 
engine”, the system manages the SMED application and can give some suggestions. The methodology 
has forward chaining mechanism and 90 rules. One of the original aspects of the system is starting the 
methodology with the vision of the firm and strategy. If the strategy is proper for the firm, the system may 
continue, if not, suggest another strategy such as outsourcing or investment in production technology.

1. Introduction 
 
Today more investment or having enough experience is not sufficient for companies to provide a competitive 
advantage. The way to come to the fore in this competition is based on optimum control of existing workforce, 
machine, material and processes. In the globalizing world, the way of establishing this mechanism on robust mean 
depends on effective use of information.  
Lean manufacturing is an approach aimed at cleansing all wastes that is causing burden. Lean manufacturing system 
aims to meet customer demands with least amount of source, in the shortest time, with the cheapest cost and without 
an error. In other words, it enables just in time and high variety manufacturing in small lots with zero defects.  
One of the popular approaches for productivity is to manufacture small sizes with short lead-time for rapidly 
meeting to changes in the customer demands (Sullivan, et al., 2002). Customers want to product range only as their 
needs according to high quality, affordable price and quick delivery principles. The SMED methodology helps to 
meet customer needs with less wastage (Shingo 1996). Setup times may be too long. If the machine is a bottleneck 
one, setup time will be more important. Decreasing the setup time provides that firms produce more products at 
smaller batch sizes results in more changeovers (Goubergen and Landeghem, 2002). The quick changeover 
capability eliminates this disadvantage.

Some rules used for the iSMED are shown below. The rules can be determined by an expert from industry about the 
SMED or an academician. If rules are obtained from the academicians, they are shown as a reference and mentioned 
at the end of the paper in References section. 
 
If the strategy is proper for the firm, the system may continue, if not, suggest another strategy such as 
outsourcing or investment in production technology. 
 
If you do not determine bottleneck machines with value stream mapping technique, by taking into account 
shifts determine whether there is bottleneck machine. 
 
If there are too much bottleneck machines, select the most important one by using Pareto Analysis 
technique. 
 
If setup time of the selected bottleneck machine is high, apply the SMED to the selected machine. 
 
If some maintenances can made during setup activities, make them while machine is running and if needed 
assign to an additional personnel. 
 
If a part that needs to be exchanged has only 2 sizes, put one fixed on the machine (Goubergen & 
Landeghem, 2002). 
 
If one cannot measure, then one will never be able to have a setting ‘right from the first time’. Measuring 
devices should be accurate enough: in one plant there was a very critical setting, the accuracy was in the 
order of 10ths of a millimeter, but the operators were only using a flexible steel rule to do the setting 
(Goubergen & Landeghem, 2002). 
 
If constraint equipment is selected, minimize the potential risk by building temporary stock and otherwise 
ensuring that unanticipated down time can be tolerated (Lean Production, n.d.). 
 
If moulds using in changeover process are untidy, place moulds to shelves by planning mould layout and 
using 5S rules. 
 
If preliminary is not made, while previous mould is running, bring the new mould near to the machine. 
In addition, there are some general advices: 
 Use videotaping to observe activities. 
 While videotaping the changeover have several observers taking notes. Sometimes the observers will notice 
things that are missed on the videotape (Lean Production, 2018). 
 Only observe, do not interfere in any activities. This makes the changeover normal. 
5. Conclusions and Future Research 
In this study, a prototype intelligent SMED methodology is developed and applied in a textile firm. The SMED 
methodology is one of the most important techniques in the lean manufacturing implementation.  
Before applying the SMED, bottleneck machines must be determined in the production line of the company. An 
injection machine in the line is selected and foot of roller blind, which is one of the products that has high sale 
volume. 22 observations were made and it is seen that average of the setup time is 51.82 minutes. After applying the 
SMED, company reduces the setup time approximately 73.1 %, from 52 minutes to 14 minutes. 
An expert system approach can be used for the application of the SMED as further research. The application can be 
expanded not only the textile industry but also other manufacturing and service industries. Service industries may 
include emergency and surgery department of hospitals because time is very important and vital for these 
departments. An intelligent decision support system software can be developed. Besides, Poka-Yoke (mistake 
proofing) techniques can be added to the knowledge base of the intelligent system.

Abstract 
Almost all quality improvement methods require data collection and analysis to solve quality problems. The 
combination of six sigma and lean manufacturing creates lean six sigma methodology that aims to reach six sigma 
quality levels, less than 3.4 part per million defectives, by reducing variations and wastes within processes. 
Achieving the goal depends on data collection to overcome quality problems.  
Although many traditional data analysis techniques can be used to develop quality of products and processes, 
massive data sets collected by industry 4.0 technologies should be mined with powerful data analysis methods that 
produce meaningful results from big data. It is possible to make effective decisions by utilizing these analysis 
methods in each step of lean six sigma cycles. The use of data analysis methods at every stage, especially in the 
measure and analyze stages, has critical importance to make powerful decisions. 
The aim of this study is to provide a guide that allows applying lean six sigma to make faster, more reliable and 
satisfied decisions with data. It contributes to the manufacturing processes with lean six sigma by reducing the lead-
time, producing better quality products; on the other hand, it aids to make effective decisions using different mining 
techniques.

Introduction
Since many competitors produce the similar products, quality is a critical problem. Improving quality depends on 
collection of big data and extraction useful information from it. Quality improvement methods such as inspection, 
statistical process control, total quality control, zero defects, kaizen and lean six sigma (LSS) need to collect data 
about quality problems to solve (Köksal, et al., 2011).  
LSS emerged initially as different two methods. Similarities and complementary features of them make it useful to 
use these two philosophies together. It has thus become a powerful and effective tool for sustainable operational 
outcomes. These two methods creating LSS are six sigma and lean manufacturing. Six sigma has been widely 
adopted as a discipline that use a systematic problem-solving approach and methodology in a variety of industries 
(Lee, et al., 2004; General Electric, 2017). Sigma is a statistical term for measuring how a given process deviates 
from perfection (Angoss Software, 2011). With six sigma, the errors in the manufacturing are reduced to the error 
level of 3.4 parts per million (ppm) and it is aimed to go to zero defect. Given the increasing customer expectations 
considerations, it is of great importance for successful companies. Six sigma asserts that this goal can be achieved if 
the variance in production is within a certain range.  
On the other hand, lean manufacturing aims to make production with value-creating operations by removing all 
kinds of activities that are worthless from the customer's point of view. The cost is reduced by determining and 
eliminating all kinds of waste and so, the lead-time is shortened. The difference between lean manufacturing and six 
sigma is to define the basic causes of waste in different ways. While lean manufacturing claims that wastes in the 
processes are due to non-value added activities to the final product, the six sigma argues that wastes come from the 
variation in the processes. However, the common goal of both is to create a production system that meets the 
customer expectations most effectively by producing quality products. Because of its advantages on high quality, 
LSS has gained worldwide popularity, providing both output and quality-based improvements. This approach, which 
simplifies systematically manufacturing processes and improves product quality with less than 3.4 ppm errors, has 
saved significant improvements and cost savings in many companies such as General Electric (2017), Dell Inc. 
(Lovin ve Yaptangco 2006) and Xerox Corp. (2004).

Figure 7. Design Phase 
In the last step of DMADV cycle, some metrics are created to keep and a pilot run is developed to verify the new 
process. Results can be visualized using Graphing or Visualization as PM methods to see whether there is any 
potential failures affecting quality. Like in control step, a proper machine learning algorithm can be used to give an 
alarm when the process is out of control. Figure 8 shows the suggested roadmap for the Verify phase.

4. Conclusion 
There are various methods such as inspection, statistical process control, total quality control, zero defects, kaizen 
and lean six sigma to improve quality. In this study, lean six sigma as a method quality improvement is chosen. It 
aims to reduce variations and wastes within processes using different techniques. Lean six sigma collects data to 
achieve its goal. Collected data should be analyzed to make optimum and correct decisions. However, industry 4.0 
technologies make possible to collect enormous amount of data. Therefore, traditional data analysis techniques are 
not sufficient because they require more time and cost. It is possible to benefit from advanced techniques, which are 
suitable for big data, such as big data analytics and process mining in addition to traditional techniques to make 
effective decisions for quality problems. Each step of lean six sigma cycles, DMAIC (define-measure-analyze-
improve-control) and DMADV (define-measure-analyze-design-verify), contains various techniques. They were 
shown in Table 2 and flowcharts for each phases are drawn separately. 
The aim of this study is to provide a guide that makes easier, faster, more reliable and satisfied decisions with data 
for improving quality in processes. As a further research, the suggested guide will be used in a manufacturing 
project that intends to solve quality problems using lean six sigma methodology.

Abstract 
 
Today, developments in information technologies make knowledge even more important. Having 
knowledge and managing it effectively are very important for firms to gain competitive advantage in 
rapidly changing environment conditions. Knowledge management effectiveness depends on capacity of 
firms about creating new knowledge and sharing or transferring current knowledge. Knowledge transfer 
(KT) facilitates organizational learning, offers financial advantages to firms and increases firms' 
performance. Understanding of how knowledge is transferred from one unit to another is very important. 
The purpose of this study is determining the factors that affect KT intention of employees in 
organizations. Data was collected from 377 employees working in various sectors. A model is formed and 
trust, self-efficacy, transactive memory system, organizational rewards and organizational structure’s 
effect on KT, and Transactive memory system’s mediating effect are investigated with Structural 
Equation Modeling using SPSS Amos.

1. Introduction 
 
Knowledge becomes a key resource that organizations own in order to compete and live in the competitive 
environment. The value of the organizations has been started to be measured by the knowledge they own. Today, 
economical power is handed by knowledge owned organizations. Natural resources, raw materials, big facilities or 
cheap workforce are no longer enabling competitive advantage (Barutcugil, 2002). Therefore, it is vital for the 
organizations to manage knowledge effectively. Knowledge management effectiveness depends not only on creating 
knowledge and but also transferring knowledge to the other parties. The knowledge transfer enables employees to 
reach needed knowledge easily and in a fast way. Organizations and their employees should understand that 
knowledge value increases when it is transferred (Zaim, 2005). However, not all organizations become successful in 
transferring the current knowledge within the organization among employees. Understanding the factors affecting 
the effective transfer of knowledge may lead companies to achieve competitive advantage to their rivals.  
There are studies in the literature that focus on the effects of knowledge and knowledge management on firm 
success. However, there is lack in studies that link daily organizational knowledge with knowledge transfer between 
individuals, entities or organizations (Yucelen, 2005). The aim of this study is to understand the factors affecting 
knowledge transfer intentions of individuals in organizations based on a survey data collected from employees 
working in various sectors of Turkey. A model is formed which includes knowledge transfer intention, trust, self-
efficacy, transactive memory system (TMS), organizational rewards and organizational structure.  
The rest of this paper is structured as follows: The second section presents an overview of the literature on 
knowledge transfer and hypotheses. In the third section, research methodology is presented; data analysis and results 
are given. Conclusions and suggestions for future studies are provided at the end.

Abstract 
In  today’s  competitive  business  environment,  a  six  sigma  quality  output  from  a conversion  process  
of  raw  materials  to  products  can  be  obtained  not  only by focusing  on equipment / machines and 
materials but also on the production-worker who manages the other two  elements.  Since  the  major  asset 
of  most  Indian  manufacturing  SMEs  is  the  production-worker who will have a  hands-on  role in turning 
out the desired quality output, a more focus is required on this element. A production-worker at work is 
affected by a set of factors that needs to be  addressed  to  strengthen  the  overall  effectiveness  of  the 
worker  for  a  near  six  sigma  level output.   In  this  paper,  an  attempt  is  made  to  examine  the 
influence  of  various  factors  on  the production-worker  by  formulating  and  testing  hypotheses.  The 
data  for  this  analysis  were collected  from  production-workers  of  Small  and  Medium-sized  
Manufacturing  Enterprises (SMMEs) in north Karnataka through a questionnaire survey. It was found from 
the study that the output level or ‘overall worker effectiveness (OWE)’ of a production-worker is influenced 
by three main factors, viz. personal, technical, and external or environmental.  The results show that 
personal and technical factors have a significant influence on the overall effectiveness of production-worker 
and hence on the level of output from him/her. 
Keywords: 
Production-worker, Overall worker effectiveness, Six sigma level output, SMMEs. 
1. Introduction
Manufacturing SMEs in India are the major source of supply for most large industries and produce a variety of goods 
and/services required for end users as well. They have created a huge employment base and contribute significantly 
to the economy of the nation (Raju, 2008). However, there are problems associated with most discrete products 
manufacturing SMEs and one of the major problems is the increased rejection rate at various stages of manufacturing 
process. These rejections affect the desired output level from a process as well as the overall desired output level of 
the manufacturing enterprise. The rejections in any manufacturing process do take place predominantly because of 
the basic three ‘Ms’, viz. men (or women), materials, and machines (or equipment) involved in the conversion process. 
These Ms can broadly be classified as organic components (men or women) and inorganic components (materials and 
machines) in the process of converting raw material into finished goods. An organic component that is directly 
involved in the conversion process is the production worker. In a discrete products manufacturing SME, if a sound 
technology for producing the products is in place and materials are from certified suppliers, it can be argued that the 
rejections from a process can happen due to the organic component, i.e. production worker. 
A production worker is one who has a ‘hands-on’ role in converting a set of inputs (raw materials) into finished 
components or products required by the end user or a downstream operation in the manufacturing process. He / she

6.1.8 Test of Hypothesis-8 
 
It is found during the analysis that among the four external factors identified, only ‘‘working hours and shifts’ is 
perceived important in influencing the workers (Mean and Median values ≥ 3). Hence, the hypothesis is tested only 
for this factor. That is, 
H0 - The perceived importance of influence of ‘working hours and shifts’ on the availability of production workers 
do not differ significantly among different categories.  
H1 - The perceived importance of influence of ‘working hours and shifts’ on the availability of production workers 
differ significantly among different categories. 
 
H0 : μq = μqe = μue 
H1 : H0 is not true 
q: Qualified Worker 
qe: Qualified and Experienced Worker 
ue: Unqualified but Experienced Worker

workers (Grouping variable: Worker category; Test variable: Working hours and shifts on availability) 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The results of the Table 9 above reveal that significant difference is not evidenced in the perceived influence of 
external factor on the availability of all category workers (H=.219, p >.05). This external factor is perceived to be, 
more or less, equally important by all the three category workers in influencing their availability, as is evident from 
the mean ranks of ‘Qualified and Experienced’ workers (123.21), ‘Qualified’ (119.5) and ‘Unqualified but 
Experienced’ category workers (124.24). However, ‘Unqualified but Experienced’ category workers perceive this 
factor slightly more important than the other two category workers. From the above test, it can be concluded that 
research hypothesis is rejected. 
 
7. Conclusions 
 
The paper has highlighted that thee production-worker in most manufacturing SMES is one of the causes of rejections 
since he holds a hands-on role in the conversion process. This is because the components of output level (worker’s 
effectiveness) – performance, output quality and availability - are influenced by technical, personal and external 
factors. The factors were identified through literature review and personal interactions with experts from industry and 
academics. The influence of these factors on the components of output level of workers (overall worker effectiveness) 
was examined through developing and testing relevant hypotheses. The test of hypotheses through Kruskall-Wallis 
statistical test revealed that technical factors are perceived to be important by production-workers in influencing their 
performance and output quality. However, this perceived importance was found to be different among different 
category workers. Similarly, the test of hypotheses on personal factors to influence performance, output quality, and 
availability revealed a significant difference in the perceived importance of different category workers. External 
factors are perceived to be equally important by all category workers. By addressing the barrier effects of a factor 
pertaining to the components of output level of a worker (overall worker effectiveness) the output level can be 
enhanced and the production-workers will be capable of turning Six Sigma level output in terms of quantity and 
quality.

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is to present a case study on the implementation of a Quality Circle project under 
TQM in an auto component manufacturing industry ABC Ltd. (name changed) situated in Gurugram, 
India to highlight the benefits gained by the company. The TQM implementation at ABC Ltd. was 
initiated in 1998 and completely implemented by 2003 in a phased manner. Quality Circle is not only a 
problem solving tool, but it may be treated as a communication tool also which helps the organization for 
continual improvement. The rejection rate of intermediate shafts used in steering column of cars was 
significantly high and particularly the rejection of Nissan intermediate shafts was 68.5% of the total 
rejections. The company was interested to decrease this high rejection rate using the Quality Circle 
approach.  After successfully implementing the countermeasures proposed by QC, the rejection rate of 
Nissan Intermediate Shaft (IMS) reduces to zero with in a period of five months.

1. Introduction
In the present scenario various management practices such as Total Quality Management (TQM), Total Productive 
Maintenance (TPM), Six-Sigma, Just in Time (JIT), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) etc. are in use by industry 
to improve their operational capabilities. In TQM, the companies deploy some of the statistical and management 
tools which are further oriented towards assisting the teams in finding solutions for enhancing organizational 
capabilities. Quality control circle is a group of people of all levels, who work together on solving the problem or 
issues to propose the best possible solutions. Quality circles not only improve the performance but also boost the 
morale and skill of the employees.  
A good number of researchers have reported the applications and advantages of Quality Control Circle’s 
(QCC) with the presentation of case studies. The development of employees at all levels is the first and most 
important priority of the Quality Circle program (Alexander, 1981). (Ross & Ross, 1982) suggested Quality circle 
activities improved the three main areas: quality, productivity and attitude. The success of quality circle in an 
organization depends upon the support of the senior management (Cole, 1984). Employee productivity and 
absenteeism rates also improved where quality circles were active (Grady Jr. 1986). Fukui et al. 2003 state that the 
philosophy of QCC is based on the concepts of participative management and humanistic management. Quality 
Circles develop positive attitude among employees and encourage total employee participation concept (M.Y. Ismail 
2006). Employee’s participation and communication have significant and positive effect on employee’s job 
satisfaction (Azadeh Tourani 2012). Chitra Sharma (2013) reported the use of quality circles in many manufacturing 
organization for drawing cost saving or quality improvement goals. Quality circle activities have positive and 
significant relationship with job satisfaction, commitment and participation in decision making of QCs members 
(Subbulakshmi et al. 2015). Rajesh Choudhary & Lalit Yadav (2012) suggested focusing on the implementation of 
Quality circles towards employees and organization. It leads to overall improvement in organizational culture as

countermeasures the rejection quantity reduces to 0 units by June 2016. The rejection trend was shown graphically 
in the Fig. 8 which shows before and after applying the countermeasures.

2.7 Conclusion 
In order to reduce the rejection rate of Nissan Intermediate shaft of steering column, three main potential causes 
found by project team responsible for higher rejection rate were to be addressed immediately. The main 
countermeasures taken were: providing Dowell pins to machine unit, mounting hydraulic pressure gauge in front of 
the operator of the machine and increase the quantity of grease volume. It was found that due to weak design, the 
claw position was disturbed during machining of intermediate shaft of steering column. So it was decided to provide 
the Dowell pins to both side of mounting unit to stop the widening of claw play. To control the tool flow variation 
hydraulic pressure gauge was provided on both side of the operator and interlinked with machine. To avoid the 
needle out from bearing case, the quantity of grease was increased from 0.23 gram to 0.35 gram which resulted in 
less friction between needle bearing and spider. These three corrective actions helped the industry in reducing the 
rejections of Nissan intermediate shaft of steering column and thus the target of quality improvement by reducing 
the rejection rate to zero was met successfully.

Abstract  
 
In POWER GRIDS many issues are involved, namely, storage, generation, quality (fluctuating frequency, 
fluctuation in power voltage), distribution, power consumption and deciding the rates at which customer 
needs to be charged. Complexity of power grids is very high, namely storage, generation and distribution; 
and in it role of technocrats is very high. Aging assets and lack of resources to repairs and maintenance is 
a very big issue. In this paper, we focus primarily on revenue management by the use of SMART GRIDS, 
and also suggest a plan for SMART GRID implementation. We also give few propositions for addressing 
issues of interoperability and security.

generation and usage. In [3],[4] authors raise the issue of interoperability when new power using 
nodes are added and deleted (especially during power failure). When there is power failure, APS 
must have the capability to refigure quickly. In [5] authors reported a study, which noted that 
power users would adopt to APS if they see some benefit for them.  
 
In the section given below we give few interesting propositions.  
 
 
2. Developing Few Propositions  
 
It has been proposed in literature that multi agent system (storage agent, generation agent, 
distribution agent, power consumption and an integrator agent) be used for managing power grid. 
It has been argued (see references below) that putting smart meter (that communicates with 
computer system for managing power grids by supplying data on quality and quantity of power 
being used (over internet)) in every American home is economically not feasible due to cost 
considerations. It appears to be reasonable to assume that large power is consumed by a smaller 
number of power users. Also for higher quality of power, the users must be asked to contribute to 
build appropriate infrastructure. This high end segment of the power users will be profitable, and 
the surplus be used to prepare infrastructure for the lower end segment. Hence we have the 
proposition given below. 
 
Proposition 1: Smart meters to be put up first only in the affluent class (Users consuming 
large power). And complete details of power factor be communicated to centrally located 
972","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operation Management Paris, France,

computer systems. And on a complete range of power factor, the large power users to be 
charged (instead of only two rates; one rate for house hold sector and other for commercial 
users). The large users should contribute capital for building necessary power 
infrastructure.  
 
Complexity of power networks is very high and also cost of having smart meter to be installed is 
prohibitive. Hence we have the following. Also changes in one section of the country affects the 
whole power network, we have the following proposition.  
 
Proposition 2: Smart Grid should be implemented in an ‘incremental’ manner and NOT in 
a big-bang fashion.  
 
In the high end segment of the power users, the complexity of APS will be much higher, and 
hence we propose the following. 
 
Proposition 3: For achieving interoperability more efforts will be required in high end 
power users. 
 
The high end power user’s information will be more sensitive, and hence we propose the 
following,  
 
Proposition 4: Security will be a much bigger issue in the case of high end power users, and 
hence their information will be kept on a private and dedicated cloud.  
 
3. Conclusions:  
 
It may be noted that current understanding is that the implementation of Smart Meters appears to 
be economically infeasible, but in the long run when system comes to substantial size, the 
information made available (that is like knowing the state of heart and pulse of the economy), is 
useful to policy makers and members of industry (just like credit card information is used by 
marketers for developing strategy) and it will generate huge revenue. This revenue stream may 
also be considered while deciding to go for SMART GRIDS; and it may change the balance in 
favor of SMART GRIDS (from economic perspective).

Abstract 
Technology centered businesses are highly motivated and accepted in the present Information age. More 
organizations are trying to inculcate ICT in their daily operations and making their business leaner and 
flexible. But technology adaptation comes with a cost (Short term/long term). Brick and Click Retail 
formats like hypermarkets, specialty stores and convenient stores are using technological platform for 
widening their reach to the customer.  Internet of Things (IoT) is a commonly noted technology, specially 
in European markets. Mostly three layers of IoTs are used in Organizations. Convenient stores (smallest 
retail format) is prone to use three layered IoT system for the operations as it is less expensive and the 
current business requires minimum flexibility. Specialty stores go for five layer IoT since the organization 
size is small as compared to Hypermarkets and they require next level flexibility than convenient stores. 
Hypermarkets have high budget for technology incubation and require point to point communication and 
high level of flexibility because of their reach in diverse region, hence they go for seven layered IoT. This 
piece of research tries to show the relationship between the cost and the strategy of a retail format with 
the adaptation of IoT in their operations.

Abstract  
 
Research in the field of Green Supply Chain Management has known a big growth in recent years as the environmental 
aspect has become a major concern for all internal and external stakeholders of the supply chain. Indeed, several researchers 
have proposed tens of collaborative practices at the Green Supply Chain Management level to enable partners to reduce the 
environmental impact of their activities while ensuring a better level of overall performance of their supply chain. But the 
implementation of these practices is closely related to other parameters that could have a direct influence on this performance. 
Therefore, the objective of this research work would be to propose a framework that would, on one hand, facilitate the choice 
and implementation of GSCM practices, and on the other hand, study the relationship between GSCM and overall 
performance of the supply chain based on a key parameter which is the capability of collaboration.

1. Introduction 
 
In order to be more competitive in a highly globalized market, organizations tend to expand their supply chain around the world through 
large investments, which has tremendously increased the demand for natural resources. In addition, with increasing attention from 
customers, stakeholders, government legislation, and environmental organizations, companies are driven to consider environmental impacts 
while doing business. All these external and internal calls for reducing environmental impacts and rationalizing the use of natural resources 
have led companies to think about integrating the ""Green"" concept into their supply chain. Over the last decade, many companies around the 
world have implemented Green Supply Chain Management (GSCM) to improve their competitiveness in the global market. In this context, 
a large number of researchers are interested in the subject of the GSCM. Today, sustainable development, or the social and environmental 
issues of the supply chain have become one of the main concerns of researchers. Thus, several studies have tried to study the impact of 
Green practices on the overall performance of the supply chain. Indeed, a large number of publications on the effects of environmental 
practices on the performance of the supply chain is present. In addition, a large number of studies have examined whether the 
implementation of GSCM strategies leads to an improvement in the performance of the supply chain. Collaboration has also been seen as a 
key element that facilitates the transition to GSCM, and therefore can have an impact on the performance of the supply chain. Indeed, 
GSCM strategies involve a wide range of activities, requiring the expertise of almost all members of the supply chain. In addition, 
collaboration with a wide range of actors, including suppliers, customers, governments and non-governmental organizations, can be 
beneficial for the performance of a supply chain. Despite the large number of studies done on GSCM strategies, their impacts on the 
performance of the supply chain and the role of collaboration in these strategies, there are still challenges in terms of studying and 
understanding the relationship between the GSCM and the performance of the supply chain. Indeed, several researchers call for a more 
nuanced examination of the relationship between GSCM practices and performance. On the other hand, the choice of Green mechanisms 
and practices on the basis of the collaboration capability of the various partners as well as the evaluation of the impact of this choice on the 
performance of the supply chain also remains an area of investigation. 
 
2. State of art 
 
2.1 Supply Chain 
 
The supply chain is a concept that has been widely discussed in the literature in recent years, so a variety of definitions and analyzes from 
different angles are proposed. The logistics chain can be seen as a network of interacting companies whose purpose is to deliver a product 
or service to the end user by coordinating the activities associated with the movement of goods from the raw material to the delivery of the 
final product by effective combinations of resources that contribute to the creation of value. It should be noted that recent research on the 
concept of the supply chain involves the integration of constraints related to sustainable development. Indeed, ""the supply chain must be 
coordinated with voluntary integration of economic, environmental and social considerations with a conception of the main inter-
organizational processes, oriented towards efficient management of materials, information and capital flows related to the placing of orders,

Faced with increased internal and external demands for reducing the environmental impact of industrial activities, supply chain decision-
makers are today obliged to review and adapt their strategies in order to make all their activities more ecological. In this context, several 
researchers are calling for the implementation of GSCM strategies for the success of this environmental transition through a panel of dozens 
of GSCM practices. These are treated and categorized in different ways to encompass all the activities of the supply chain involved directly 
or indirectly in this negative impact on the environment. 
Implementation of these GSCM practices remains difficult due to several challenges that supply chain partners’ face. Indeed, the integration 
of the GSCM into the traditional SCM requires careful analysis and systematic changes in existing systems. For this reason, researchers also 
stress the role of collaboration in these strategies as a company cannot be more environmentally sustainable than its suppliers. On the other 
hand, the adoption of a GSCM strategy can have an impact on the financial and environmental performance of the supply chain. Several 
works in the literature consider that the GSCM and the performance of the supply chain are two inextricably linked concepts and incite in-
depth analysis to explore the nature of this relationship. Indeed, several researchers are calling for a more nuanced examination of the 
relationship between GSCM practices and the performance of the supply chain. 
On the basis of these observations, we can conclude the following points: 
 
The implementation of a GSCM strategy is full of obstacles and requires a more careful analysis. 
 
Several GSCM practices are proposed in the literature covering the majority of the functions of the supply chain. 
 
Collaboration is a key element that plays a major role in the success of GSCM strategies. 
 
The GSCM and the performance of the supply chain are two closely related concepts. The nature of this relationship requires further 
reflection. 
Despite the large number of studies conducted on GSCM practices, their impacts on the performance of the supply chain as well as the role 
of collaboration in GSCM strategies, there are still challenges to be faced in terms of studying and understanding the relationship between 
GSCM practices and the performance of the supply chain from different angles. In addition, the implementation and choice of practices to 
be implemented in collaboration with other partners as well as the evaluation of the impact of this choice on the performance of the supply 
chain also remains as an area of investigation. Indeed, there are still interesting challenges that could certainly be deepened: the choice of 
the mechanisms to be implemented according to the level of maturity of each partner, the most appropriate mechanisms to select on the 
basis of the inter-organizational collaboration structure. 
Following the same direction, the objective of this research project would be to propose a framework to facilitate the choice and 
implementation of GSCM practices and to analyze the relationship between the GSCM and the performance of the supply chain. Based on 
another parameter which is the capability of collaboration. This one can be defined as the ability of a company to leverage the resources and 
knowledge of others. Several researchers consider the ability to collaborate as a separate factor. Indeed, there is growing evidence that a 
firm's ability to collaborate should be conceptualized as a separate factor. 
4. Conclusion and perspectives:  
 
The originality of this research project lies in its contribution to further reflection on the relationship between GSCM strategies and the 
measurement of the overall performance of the supply chain. Indeed, several researchers call for a more nuanced analysis of this 
relationship. In addition, the proposed analysis introduces another moderating element of this relationship, which is the ability of the various 
supply chain partners to collaborate to see how much influence it has on these two components. Thus the methodological framework that 
will be developed at the end of this work would have as objective both the production of scientific knowledge and also the proposal of a 
practical decision panel for the managers of the supply chain based on a methodology research action / intervention known by its cyclical 
nature as well as a strong implication of the actors of the organization. The architecture of the scientific contribution can be summarized as 
follows: 
Scientific contributions: 
 
Analyze the structure, the action plan and the obstacles related to a GSCM strategy. 
 
Identify the different GSCM practices as well as the possible measures for their implementation. 
 
Study the concept of collaboration capability in the context of the supply chain. 
 
Analyze the GSCM strategy relationship and the overall performance of the supply chain by introducing the ability to collaborate 
as moderator of this relationship. 
 
Study the design of performance measurement systems in relation to GSCM strategies. 
Managerial contributions: 
 
Propose a clear roadmap for the adoption of a GSCM strategy. 
 
Develop a framework that is both methodological and practical for the implementation of a GSCM strategy. 
 
Design an overall performance measurement system for the proposed framework.

Methodological contributions 
 
Use the action / intervention research method that allows both the production of scientific knowledge and participation in the 
transformation of a process, system or organization. 
 
Design the framework based on real data. 
 
 Use different types of variables to enrich the results of the research. 
In conclusion, this work is a first step of the conceptual research related to the subject of the GSCM which aimed to make a bibliographic 
study of the state of the art and still needs to be followed by an empirical study allowing to answer to the predefined problematic which lies 
in the study of the relationship between the GSCM and the performance of the supply chain. 
The search for other moderators of the relationship between GSCM strategies and the performance of the supply chain can be proposed as a 
perspective for future research.

Abstract 
Global warming has led to severe climatic changes worldwide, including rise in sea level, depletion of 
ozone layer and many others. As a consequence of the same, the scientific community is focusing its efforts 
towards harnessing renewable energy resources and development of environment friendly energy efficient 
systems. However, the initial cost and specific operating conditions for adapting these innovative 
technologies are of major concern towards their practical implementation. Based on the climatic conditions 
in India, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) is a major contributing factor in total power 
consumption of residential, commercial and industrial sectors. Anticipating the rise in per capita 
consumption in the decade to come, the conventional energy sources would not only be insufficient to make 
ends meet, but also affect climatic conditions. The present work describes a few innovative technologies in 
the HVAC industry which includes improvement in products with conventional energy sources as well as 
combination of traditional and renewable energy systems. The working principle, methodology of product 
design and return on investment (ROI) analysis are discussed. Summarizing the same, an optimum 
technology is recommended for specific applications under given conditions.

1. Introduction
Energy is undoubtedly an important asset for a developing country like India, which is the third largest energy 
consumer in the world after China and the United State of America [1]. In spite of the same, with a population of 1.27 
billion [2], India has one of the lowest per capita energy consumption in the world, which is one-third of the world’s 
average per capita energy consumption [1]. The present energy scenario in India is characterised by frequent power 
cuts, especially in rural areas, and large disparity between the urban and rural consumption. In spite of having almost 
self-sufficient capacity of power generation currently, the main reasons for this situation are inadequate infrastructure

conventional and renewable energy. Conventional air conditioner is partially assisted with a renewable energy source 
to reduce its impact on global warming and assist energy saving. India is blessed with substantial amount of availability 
of solar energy throughout the year and over a large territory. Accordingly, residential places having considerable 
space to install solar panels and commercial as well as industrial sites could easily employ this equipment and save 
energy consumption by harnessing solar thermal energy. Such equipment could be designed for any medium range 
applications.

Abstract 
 
The present work analyzes the characteristics of the existing relationship between the suppliers, the agents 
in the food industry and the management of the supply chain with a sustainable approach. In this 
perspective, the analysis focuses on the link between the management of sustainable supply chains and a 
series of external factors that determine its viability. The methodological proposal develops an exercise to 
identify factors that affect the results of the supply chain through spatial georeferencing and content 
analysis techniques in the food industry. With this objective, we will identify a corpus of scientific articles 
that allow us to characterize these factors, including issues such as the selection and development of 
suppliers, supply of raw materials and supplies, integration of corporate strategy and analysis of social 
and environmental risks, among others.

1. Introduction 
 
Currently, sustainability has been defined as the capacity to meet needs in the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet theirs (WCED, 1987). For companies, sustainability has become one of the key 
issues in planning and management within organizations and between supply chains (Subramoniam, Huisingh & 
Chinnam, 2009, Huang, Chen & Fan, 2010, Jayal, Badurdeen, Dillon & Jawahir, 2010). 
 
The different approaches to sustainability analysis have shown a growing interest in the study of the practices that 
companies have adopted to assume sustainable objectives at the level of management and production. One of the 
axes of work, which has stood out for its appearance in the literature, focuses on the design and operation of the 
supply chain (Hutchins & Sutherland, 2008; Darnall, Jolley & Handfield, 2008). 
 
The tendency in the business sector is to recognize sustainability as a central point in the development of operations 
(Browne, J., 2002; Aragón-Correa, J.A. & A. Rubio-López, E., 2007), especially in the food industry due to its high 
degree of impact on the quality of life of the population.

Abstract 
Materials called very fine aggregate or filler may affect the performance of concrete in an either 
positive or a negative way. Discussions on aggregate containing very fine material are vitally important. 
The goal of the study was to determine how the content of filler might affect properties of concrete. 
The effect of applying different amounts of filler on concrete was then determined. An 
experimental approach developed a building product consisting mainly of limestone dust, which is 
considered as waste or by product material of aggregates industry. The majority of abandoned 
limestone powder wastes (LPW) is accumulated from the countries all over the world and causes certain 
serious environmental problems and health hazards. This paper presents a parametric experimental 
study which investigates the potential use of LPW combination for producing a low-cost and 
lightweight composite as a building material. The results of investigations on the suitability of using 
limestone dust as aggregate in lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC) production are reported. In this 
way, different amounts of limestone dust were used. Some of the physical and mechanical 
properties of concrete mixes having high level of LPW are investigated. The obtained compressive 
strength, 
flexural 
strength 
and 
unit 
weight 
satisfy 
the 
relevant international standards.

Abstract 
In order to maintain their level of competitiveness in the globalized market, multinational firms are 
undeniably confronted to make strategic choices to increase their profit and ensure their sustainability. The 
re-design of multinational groups by the relocation of a part of their supply chain or the totally of it to other 
countries are among the crucial decisions of the supply chain management. We provide the most important 
factors that drive the Multinational firms to delocalize. Through this article we define an analytical model 
of decision making tool for delocalization taking into account the financial constraints of potential 
destinations. We present then new financial guidelines and recommendation by the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in terms of profitability and cost allocation. Through a 
case study of tangible and intangible activities, we evaluate the impact of financial policies and specially 
the transfer pricing policies on the amount of manufacturing capacity to relocate. We give managerial 
insights ad new directives to be explored for feature works in the context of delocalization.

1. Introduction
Today companies seek profit maximization and have to adopt restructuring strategies that include relocation in order 
to ensure their sustainability. In general terms, delocalization is the relocation of capacities of production abroad 
mainly to low cost countries while the final product is redirected to the same market. The goal is not a market 
expansion but essentially to take advantage from lower labor expenses and many factors such as the attractive 
economical political environment as well as the legal/regulatory environments of the host countries.  Therefrom the 
concept of delocalization has been raised in order to identify the operations in which the production is ensured inside 
the group but abroad by its own subsidiaries (OECD, 2004). Once relocated, the group will be composed of a parent 
company and other subsidiaries located abroad and exchanging both goods and services. The values of these traded 
goods are valued in terms of transfer price (TP).  
Borkowski (1997) define the Transfer price as the strategy for pricing tangible goods and intangible services 
transferred between parent and subsidiaries, or between subsidiaries, to maximize profits, minimize taxes, maintain 
goal congruence and/or evaluate managerial performance. O’Connor (1997) stated that transfer pricing is the most 
important international tax issue facing multinationals today, and is expected to remain so far for the near future.  In 
fact, the transfer price has a major impact on firm’s revenues and may contribute to divergent results according to the

Figure 5 demonstrates the instability that may occur in this case. If company adopts scenario 4 then its ATGP decreases 
from 17% to 7% which is a big gap that has many risks on company’s activities and further strategies. For sure if 
company did not transfer any capacity as per scenario1, then the ATGP remains steady over the four years. Although, 
the ATGP fluctuates noticeably while increasing the amount of capacities transferred to site2. From here we can see 
the importance of a pre-agreement on transfer pricing method in order to ensure legal security and fiscal stability for 
relocated firms.

Conclusion and perspectives 
We conducted an overview analysis of the different dimensions and parameters that influence the optimization of 
supply chain models in the context of firms delocalization. We have shown the importance of transfer pricing as a 
decision variable in the capacities delocalization. BEPS project, on its part, has introduced new challenges in terms of 
transfer pricing. By analyzing results of a case study we measure the impact of using different price methodologies 
on the overall profit of the company as well as the decision of capacity transfer. Our model can be generalized to make 
decision for big instance of potential subsidiaries and decide the capacities to be installed in each of these new 
locations. We plan also to introduce the other OECD constraints and especially the ones related to risk and intangible 
cost allocation. It will be a tool to draw new conclusions useful for government and multinational firms.

Abstract 
 
Accelerated advancement of technology and the global economic crisis have prompted the need to 
improve equipment reliability to reduce unpredicted equipment failures and operating costs. Increasingly, 
attention is focused on the life cycle cost to improve understanding of the equipment’s operational and 
maintenance costs which are driven by the system maintainability, reliability and required replacement 
time. This goes hand-in-hand with data availability and quality which play a vital role in the success of 
life cycle cost implementation.  The research provides insight to the field of life cycle cost, as well as to 
quantify the major cost drivers of the high pressure grinding roll during its operating and maintenance life 
cycle for a period of four years. From the research findings, it is evident that reliability and 
maintainability management must be regarded as a vital element corporate strategy. Successful 
implementation of this strategy is reliant on the support of senior management which in turn will ensure 
that organizational market share is increased and that competitive advantage is maintained.

1. Introduction 
The term life cycle costing (LCC) has been researched and employed in literature since 1965. According to Dhillon 
(2012), LCC refers to a method of estimating the cost summation of the equipment incurred by consumer from 
acquisition to disposal of such equipment; in short it is the total cost of ownership. The cost of ownership can 
fluctuate from 20 to 200 times the equipment acquisition cost (Seif and Rabbani, 2014). As a result, industry 
continues to seek means of controlling and minimizing these costs.  
Moreover, an emerging research trend shows growing concerns on stringent availability and performance 
constraints, specifically system reliability (Dersin, Péronne and Arroum, 2008). The trend extends focus on the 
equipment’s operational costs which are primarily driven by the system and component-specific maintainability, as 
well as required replacement time (Hinow and Mevissen, 2011). According to Al-Chalabi, Lundberg, Wijaya and 
Ghodrati (2014), the prime objective is to identify key factors affecting both system availability and LCC. The aim 
is to provide valuable information with guidelines to achieve forecasted availability targets at considerably lower 
operational costs.  
It is evident that the consumers’ decision is not only dependent on the maturity of the product but predominantly on 
the LCC (Wang, Li, Yang and Dong, 2009). Thaduri, Verma and Kumar (2013) emphasized that the crucial 
consideration for consumers to purchase a particular product depends on the availability, maintainability and 
reliability costs of its entire life cycle. 
2. Literature review 
 
A review of the literature aimed to provide an in-depth insight to life cycle costing. This included understanding of 
the LCC concept, available LCC models, implementation of LCC analysis within an organization and the benefits 
thereof; as well as ways of quantifying LCC through the use of existing numerical formulae.

From the results it can be noticed that the highest cost driver is contributed by the labour cost portion at over 22%. 
In descending order, this value is followed by roll refurbishment at 10%, gearbox refurbishment at 8%, hard metal 
studs at 7.4%, main motors at 5.4%, conveyor drives at 5.3%, gearbox supply at 5.3%, refurbishment (torque arm, 
gearbox and roll change) at 4.9% as well as the remainder of the components between 0.2 to 3.7%.  
5. Conclusions 
The research findings confirm that certain components have a higher influence on the overall LCC. The approach 
without considering NPV is more applicable where cost information is available and of good quality; whilst the 
approach considering NPV also provides a better understanding on anticipated future costs which can assist in better 
planning and decision making on investment. 
The results indicate that the LCC during the operation and maintenance phase was significantly higher than the 
acquisition cost. This was possibly due to factors which could not be foreseen during the design and acquisition 
phase, such as unplanned events and repeated breakdowns and failures.  
It is evident that much work has been carried out to develop LCC models with an attempt to aid organizations to 
make informed decisions and manage costs associated with a product or equipment. The following conclusions are 
drawn from the current research: data availability and quality plays a vital role in the success of LCC analysis; 
implementation of LCC is reliant on proper record keeping and an efficient enterprise resource planning system; 
practical implementation of LCC models and analysis within organizations is still noted as a challenge; successful 
implementation of an LCC analysis should be viewed as a long-term project and can only be implemented if it were 
supported by top management and relevant personnel in the company. 
A limitation of the research is that the LCC was modeled on one HPGR where not all the relevant information could 
be obtained. However, sufficient knowledge has been provided in this research to quantity the life cycle cost of the 
HGPR and to confirm major cost drivers. Future research may consider the following:  reliability of the HPGR in 
comparison with the calculated life cycle cost; the improvement of reliability on cost control; and how maintenance 
strategies could be implemented to improve LCC.

Abstract  
 
Geothermal energy was a renewable energy source that uses geothermal fluids to generate electricity. 
Besides, geothermal fluids contain noncondensable gases (NCGs) which can be an negative impact for 
power plant and environment. NCGs can decrease power output and work in Geothermal Power Plant 
(GPP). In addition, the higher concentration of NCGs, Carbondioxide, contribute to Global warming 
potential in the world. Therefore, selection of NCG Removal system (GRS) becomes a major concen at 
planning and basic design stage which aims to maximize power output and minimize cost of GPP in a 
long-term perspective by modeling to simulate dry steam of GPPs to examine the thermodynamic and 
economical performance of GRS. This model is validated against actual data in Kamojang unit-1 with low 
disprecancy level (<5% error). To Optimize the model, 3 GRS configuration was investigated, Steam Jet 
Ejector with low of motive steam, Steam Jet Ejector with high of motive steam, and Compressor System. 
The allowable condenser and separator pressure was defined to set constraints. Under the best 
configuration (Compressor system), the gross power output and overall exergetic efficiency are 53.6 MW 
and 26%, respectively. Furthermore, by 1.5% of Interest rate, Net Present Value of the proposed plant 
was 3,467.

Abstract  
 
 India being an agrarian country, more than 60% of population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. 
Commercial crop is a backbone of Indian agriculture and currently contributes to around 16% of GDP. 
But the varying levels in the prices of the commercial crops and the increasing costs for agriculture 
activities along with the resource constraints has made the farmers think about determining the right crop 
mix so as to maximize the income. Therefore, in order to gain maximum benefits in agricultural activities, 
a lot of focus is now on the implementation of scientific methods of farming. This research thus focuses 
on determining the right mix of crops to maximize the income for the four commercial crops, namely 
arecanut, pepper, coconut and rubber considered in the study. 
 
In this research, the LP technique was used in planning the agricultural activities for the two different 
farms. Primarily, a linear programming technique was applied to determine the optimum mix of crops that 
should have been followed by the farmer so as to fetch the maximum income considering the resource 
constraints. Later, the results obtained using LP technique and traditional methods of farming adopted by 
the farmer for the allocation of the crops were compared and it was found that the LP technique were 
superior to traditional methods. Since reallocation in the existing farm land is not viable due to the 
limitation in commercial crops, suitable suggestions were given with respect to the cropping 
combinations that can be applied practically. A sensitivity analysis was then carried out to determine the 
optimal capital requirement for the respective farms.

Abstract 
 
The rapid growth of real estate development in the Southern Luzon (Philippines) has fundamentally 
affected the traffic condition at Metro Manila Skyway. The lack of efficient public transport system from 
the South has led many residents to acquire their own vehicles to conveniently transport them from home 
to their respective destinations. This has contributed to the significant increase of both public and private 
vehicles traveling from South to the metropolis. Despite the government efforts to build alternative 
infrastructures and regulations to minimize the traffic condition, the traffic becomes even worse in recent 
years. This study has been conducted to develop an alternative solution to alleviate traffic condition at 
Metro Manila Skyway that connects South Luzon to Manila. Variable pricing strategy has been applied to 
different industries in the Philippines, especially in regulating oil prices but has not been applied to 
address the worsening traffic condition in the country.  This paper aims to simulate variable toll pricing 
strategies to reduce traffic congestion in Metro Manila Skyway (MMS) and determine the optimal 
revenue generated from the best price strategy. In addition, the study seeks to find out the public 
acceptability of the best pricing strategy for Metro Manila Skyway. The results of the study have shown 
that 44% of the respondents chose to use the Elevated road during peak hours with heavy traffic despite 
paying a higher toll rate, while 42% chose to leave earlier or later the peak hours at a lower toll rate.  The 
rest of the respondents chose to use At-Grade road during rush hours or Elevated road when traffic is 
moderate with both normal toll rates.

1. Introduction 
 
Traffic congestion, in which the demand for road space exceeds the supply and the transport system approaches to 
capacity  (Abanes, Maniago J.M., & Jos , 2017) is becoming a serious problem throughout the world especially 
those countries with populated cities  (Wang, Chen, & Li, 2014).  In the Philippines, the critical zone for traffic 
congestion is in Metro Manila with the daily commute time of 90 to 150 minutes and can cost the country up to P2.4 
billion a day (more than 10% of the gross regional domestic product)  (Santiago, 2016). Moreover, to ease this 
problem, the government built infrastructures and rules which can reduce traffic and satisfy the demand of the 
people in transportation such as expressway system  (Suarez, 2016), Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program 
(UVVRP) also known as number coding  (Regidor & Tiglao, 2014), truck ban and U-turn scheme  (Regidor & 
Tiglao, 2014) together with the establishment of elevated expressway system or skyways  (Ganiron, 2014) and 
recently the 3-digit coding scheme during Christmas season  (Montenegro, 2016). However, it seems that traffic still 
continues to grow especially in Metro Manila due to rapid increase of motor vehicles  (Santiago, 2016). 
 
With the Philippines economy continuously increasing, Metro Manila’s transportation problem continues to worsen 
as more and more people chose to drive their own cars. Economists have claimed that congestion pricing is the most 
efficient solution to heavy traffic, but its implementation seemed to be more complicated in early years. With recent 
technological advancements and continuous research, many cities in the world applied the concept and have proven 
to be effective (Cramton & Geddes, 2017). Pricing plays an important role in this concept for it can be the factor to

Abstract 
 
Corporate project failure in recent times has been associated with poor stakeholder management. These 
avoidable adverse events are not only prevalent in business corporations; but also in government owned 
enterprises. Project stakeholders have become more influential in the decision-making processes, in 
project planning and execution. Stakeholders cannot be avoided when decisions are made as their 
exclusions in decision-making may derail organizational objectives. The increased use of consultants in 
state owned entities has seen some internal stakeholders such as departments and sections within the 
companies play a less significant role in projects executed by the organizations. The objective of this 
paper is to explore the implication of ignoring internal units in a large organization in corporate project 
management. The fundamental flaws identified were associated with stakeholder identification and 
subsequent inclusion in the planning and execution of the project. The process of identifying the key 
stakeholders in the bulk flow meter replacement project, the subsequent stakeholder analysis and the 
emergence of excluded stakeholders are explored; flaws analyzed, and possible solutions given for such 
future projects. The project revealed the need for project managers to acquaint themselves with the 
culture, structure of the organization and the interdepartmental and sectional relationships within the 
organization. The paper exposes why it is unwise and risky for a project manager to view an organization 
as a single stakeholder. The article concludes with lesson learnt from this project, which are applicable to 
future projects.

1. Introduction 
 
It is imperative in the 21st century that organizations are responsible and responsive to those who are affected or can 
affect the successful implementation of organizational goals and projects (Andriof, Waddock, Husted, and Rahman, 
2017). Corporate project failure in recent times has been associated with poor stakeholder management (Nwobodo-
Anyadiegwu & Mbohwa, 2017). These avoidable adverse events are not only prevalent in business corporations; but 
also, in government owned enterprises.  
 
For successful execution of projects; comprehensive project management plans are necessary to direct a project 
towards its desired objectives. Projects vary from a simple project that may require a few days to complete to large 
complex projects that require years to complete. However, regardless of the duration and complexity of the project, 
a successful project management strategy is required, and central to this success is the satisfaction of key

There are no two projects that are completely similar, so a ‘cut and paste’ of project specifications should never be 
encouraged. The engagement of the end user team in the formulation of the bulk flow meter replacement project 
would have provided valuable information and feedback concerning flow metering, challenges faced and possible 
reasons for the present status of the flow meters.  
Their exclusion resulted in a generic description of project specifications which left out some vital information. End 
users usually contribute detailed knowledge about specific aspects to the knowledge base, information gained 
through years of experience and observation (Bijlsma et al 2011: 4) 
 
Lesson 2 – Stakeholder Identification and Involvement 
It is important that the identification of internal project stakeholders within an organization must not be entrusted to 
an individual, but rather that a diverse group of individuals from both the consultant and client organization, be 
assembled to identify and prioritise the project stakeholders (Bourne 2006: 14). The organization should be 
disaggregated? to its individual departments and sections to identify all the stakeholders because the organization 
cannot be viewed as one stakeholder. 
 
Lesson 3 – Conflict Management 
The emergence of stakeholders after the project has commenced will bring with it complications and disagreements 
which are likely to cause conflict among stakeholders. Failure to manage these conflicts or address the different 
stakeholders’ concerns may lead to project failure (Wei et al 2016: 474); a definite conflict management plan must 
be put in place. Successful projects are those completed on time and within budget, conflicts cause delays which 
affect project completion time. 
 
Lesson 4 – Scope Management 
The importance of involving all stakeholders’ input in formulating project scope was brought to surface in the bulk 
flow meter replacement project. Stakeholders’ input ensure that a comprehensive and inclusive scope statement is 
developed which minimises the need for scope creep later during the project lifecycle. Furthermore, a good scope 
change management plan might become ineffective if key stakeholders are not identified and involved early in the 
project. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Stakeholder analysis plays a vital role in the success or failure of a project as it is central to project planning. This 
article explored the effect of internal departments, sections and personnel in the projects under organizations which 
have been viewed as one stakeholder. The article has shown that it is indeed unwise to view any organization, 
regardless of its size, as a single stakeholder as there may be various stakeholders lurking in its departments and 
sections. For a comprehensive and inclusive project scope to be developed, a thorough stakeholder identification and 
engagement process must be conducted to ensure that all necessary input to project scope is extracted from all the 
relevant stakeholders. Failure to identify and analyse all stakeholders will result in project scope changes, delays and 
cost escalations, furthermore, it exposes the project to risks of conflict later on during the project lifecycle.  
 
The main objective of this study - to explore the implication of ignoring internal units in a large organization in as it 
pertains to corporate project management was achieved through observation and engagements with key employees. 
The scope of the study was limited to one case study of a project under the SOC and this limits the generalisation of 
the findings. The scope can be expanded in future research by exploring more consultant run projects under different 
SOEs to give a wider view of the influence of consultants in the behavioural pattern of an organization.  
 
For further studies, we recommend overall exploration of project management in State Owned Entities especially as 
it has to do with outsourced projects. This study contributes towards edifying policy makers, politicians, and 
bureaucrats in their decision making when it comes to allocation and management of projects executed under State 
Owned Entities.

Abstract  
Although implementation of lean production has been widely spread, it has been noted that there is a gap 
in the current literature regarding studies that consider implementation of lean production from a regional 
context. Hence, the presented study addresses the impact and contingencies of regional context on the 
implementation of lean production. More specifically, the results of two case studies that were conducted 
in the United Kingdom are presented and discussed. The data collection included in depth semi-structured 
interviews with the managers and employees of the selected companies as well as observations of their 
processes. The results show that the regional context does in some degree impact the implementation of 
lean production and therefore the operational performance of the company. This research study attempts 
to cover the shortcomings of previous studies that have not covered the issue in detail and provides 
empirical evidence that adds new insight to the current literature in regard to successful implementation 
of lean production. Hence, the findings give direction to managers about different dimensions that 
contribute to the successful implementation of lean production.

1. Introduction 
   
Although implementation of lean production has been widely spread, it has been noted that there is a gap 
in current literature about studies considering implementation of lean production from a regional context. 
Hence, this paper addresses the impact and contingencies of regional context on the implementation of 
lean production. Differently from other studies, such as Hines et al. (2004), that have not investigated lean 
production and its implementation in detail, this research as part of a doctoral study aims to take a more in 
depth look into lean production from perspectives that have not been sufficiently investigated before. To 
that purpose, and following the suggestion of Lewis and Grimes (1999) this paper is looking into the 
implementation of lean production from three lenses; lean production practices, lean production as design 
of production system and lean production as theoretical conception. Lean practices consider the type of 
practices and how they can be implemented (i.e. Bortolotti et al 2015; Rahman & Bullock 2005; Shah & 
Ward 2003); lean production as design includes the principles of lean and how to structure a firm using 
the principals of lean (i.e. Åhlström 1998 ; Bhasin 2013 ; Low et al. 2015) ; and finally, the theoretical 
conception of lean production, refers to the theory of lean production (i.e. Schmenner & Swink 1995 ; 
Wacker 1998).  
This paper looks at the regional context for lean production and how that influences its implementation. 
The regional context on lean implementation is limited in the literature and mostly focus on one region or

Abstract 
This paper studies bargaining in two-sided supply chain networks where manufacturers on the demand 
side purchase an input from suppliers on the supply side. The manufacturers may have heterogeneous 
valuations on the input sold by the suppliers. In such a supply chain network, a manufacturer and a 
supplier must have a business relationship or “link"" to bargain and trade with each other. However, a firm 
on one side of the supply chain network might not have a business relationship with every firm on the 
other side of the supply chain network. We show that valuation heterogeneity, supply and demand 
balance, and network structure are the main factors that influence the equilibrium prices, trading pattern 
and surplus allocation in such a supply chain network. Valuation heterogeneity among manufacturers can 
mitigate unfavorable supply and demand balance to protect some surplus for the manufacturers and leads 
to higher price dispersion in the supply chain network. We demonstrate that bargaining effectively takes 
place in smaller subnetworks in a general supply chain network and develop an algorithm to decompose 
the general network into these smaller subnetworks, which simplifies the analysis of the general supply 
chain network significantly. We then identify what types of supply chain networks are competitive so that 
all trades happen at the same competitive price defined solely according to the aggregate supply and 
demand balance in the supply chain network and/or efficient so that only manufacturers with the highest 
valuations are able to trade. We also identify what types of links can be added into a supply chain network 
to improve its competitiveness and/or efficiency.

Abstract 
 
The phenomena of global warming have increased the frequency of natural disasters. These 
disasters generate thousands of tons of waste and cause loss of human lives, environmental damages, and 
economic losses every year. Increased resilience against future disasters can only be achieved by working 
on long-term planning and setting goals for ecological, economic and social sustainability in disaster 
response policies. Keeping in view the importance of the considered issue, this study proposed an 
optimization model for disaster waste processing supply chain network considering economic aspect via 
total waste processing cost, environmental aspect by Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from waste 
processing, and social aspect by job opportunities from waste processing. A possibilistic programming 
approach is used to cope with the post-disaster uncertain environment and a generic interactive fuzzy 
solution methodology has been proposed to obtain preferred compromise solutions for proposed model. 
Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed supply chain network optimization model and 
solution methodology numerical experiments and sensitivity analysis are performed on a large scale case 
problem.

1. Introduction and literature review 
 
In the last few decades, the frequency of disasters has rapidly increased. Hurricane Katrina (2005), 
the Indian Ocean tsunami (2004), and the Japanese tsunami (2011) are a few large-scale disasters that 
have occurred since the start of the 21st century. Such mega-disasters generate thousands of tons of waste 
which is equivalent to the many years municipal waste (Brown et al., 2016). For example, 8.9 scale 
earthquake and tsunami in Japan (2011) generated 28 million tons of waste (Ide, 2016). Proper treatment 
of such a huge amount of disaster waste is necessary, otherwise, it poses a serious threat to the 
environment and human health due to chemical decay that would ultimately contribute to decreasing the 
resilience for future disasters (Habib et al., 2016). Amaratunga et al. (2011) suggested that increased 
resilience for future disasters in a region can only be achieved by working on long-term disaster waste 
planning and setting goals for ecological, economic and social sustainability. Keeping in view the 
importance of disaster resilience in this research disaster waste management (DWM) considering all three 
dimensions of sustainable disaster recovery: economic, environmental and social, has been discussed. 
Most of the previous studies on disaster debris management provide a very good theoretical 
analysis of disaster waste management efforts, which are actually based on the guidelines proposed by 
professional disaster management bodies like Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the

Sensitivity analysis is performed to consider multiple sets of optimal solutions and choose the best 
among them based on the preferences of the decision maker. The proposed model in this study considers 
three objectives which are conflicting in nature and sensitivity analysis will enable the decision makers to 
understand the relationship among objectives. Details of the sensitivity analysis using proposed 
methodology are provided in Table 13.

Following conclusions can be drawn from the results of the sensitivity analysis: 
1. If disaster waste managers want to achieve the minimum total debris processing cost while ignoring 
the rest of the two objectives, the maximum possible amount of disaster debris must be landfilled 
and the minimum possible amount of debris must be recycled because per ton debris recycling cost 
is the highest among all three possible debris processing techniques. 
2. If disaster waste managers want to achieve a minimum level of total carbon emissions while 
ignoring the rest of the two objectives (economic and social), then the maximum possible amount 
of debris must be recycled and incinerated and the minimum possible amount of debris must be 
landfilled.  
3. If disaster waste managers want to achieve the target of a maximum number of job opportunities, 
then the maximum amount of debris must be recycled and landfilled and the minimum possible 
amount of waste must be incinerated because incineration process has the lowest job opportunities 
potential. 
4. Conclusion 
This study proposed a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model to address the 
disaster waste processing supply chain network design problem considering economic, environmental,

and social objectives. Since the post-disaster environment is very uncertain and obtaining precise 
information is difficult, an interactive fuzzy possibilistic programming approach was applied. Using the 
aforementioned concepts and techniques, the model obtained a sustainable disaster waste processing 
supply chain network by which decision makers can obtain efficient solutions based on their preferences. 
An important contribution of this research was the incorporation of all three sustainability dimensions: 
economic, environmental, and social in disaster waste processing supply chain. Furthermore, to minimize 
the capital investment it considered the cement plant kilns as potential locations for disaster waste 
incineration in the optimization model. Finally, the results and sensitivity analysis of the numerical 
example, which was based on realistic data, demonstrated the viability of the proposed solution 
methodology in handling the uncertain environment of disaster waste processing.

Abstract 
 
Two-dimensional Cutting & Packing problems consist in allocating a set of two-dimensional items into a 
set (possible singleton) of two-dimensional larger objects in such a way that items are completely 
contained in the objects without overlapping. A particular instance of two-dimensional Cutting & Packing 
problem arises in the context of thermal building renovation. This special case deals with the design of 
insulating envelopes by packing a set of rectangular and parameterizable panels (items) over rectangular 
facades (objects). Taking into account the particularities inherited from the industrial problem and the 
need of aesthetic results, we propose in this paper a constraint-based heuristic, named CaSyE, based on 
guillotine cuts technique. First, we introduce the industrial problem and its particularities. Then, the 
constraint-definition of the problem is presented as well as the scheme of the CaSyE solution. At least, the 
results of the heuristic over realistic facades are shown before the conclusion.

1. Introduction 
 
Two-dimensional Cutting & Packing problems consist in allocating a set of two-dimensional items into a set 
(possible singleton) of two-dimensional larger objects in such a way that items are completely contained in the 
objects without overlapping. A particular instance of two-dimensional Cutting & Packing problem arises in the 
context of thermal building renovation. This special case deals with the design of an insulating envelope by packing 
a set of rectangular and parameterizable (in terms of dimension and position) panels (items) over rectangular facade 
(objects). The envelope is used to reduce the thermal transfer between the interior and the exterior of the building in 
the aim of reducing the building’s energy consumption. 
In two previous reports, the authors have developed heuristic solutions to solve this problem: The first using an on-
the-fly greedy approach (Barco et al., 2014) and the second using a filtering-based approach (Barco et al., 2015). 
However, the generated envelope solutions from these heuristics do not count with aesthetic aspects needed for the 
retrofit (such as symmetry). Indeed, tacit knowledge as aesthetics is a major challenge for both the modeling and 
implementation of computer-based solutions. It is known that aesthetics flair has no universally agreed standard. 
Nonetheless, properties like symmetry are well accepted as aesthetic concept in different domains such as human 
beauty (Jacobsen and Hofel, 2003), web design (Tuch et al., 2010), computer interfaces (Bauerly and Liu, 2008) and 
art (McManus, 2005). In consequence, we have adopted symmetry as a reference point for envelopes aesthetics and 
considered it as the alignment of panel junction. 
One interesting direction to tackle the design problem is Cutting (Wascher, 2007). This is a technique from 
operations research widely used to solve different industrial problems (Bennell et al., 2013; Christofides and 
1084","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Paris, France, July 26-27, 2018

6. Conclusions 
 
In this paper, we have proposed a sequential heuristic, named CaSyE, which exploits facade geometrical structure 
and takes inspiration from the human aesthetic concept of symmetry to design buildings insulating envelopes. The 
motivation behind the cutting approach is the need for designing aesthetics insulating envelopes for facade in an 
automated fashion. Given that no standard definition of aesthetics exists, we have considered the junctions 
alignment (symmetry) as a good criterion. The heuristic is based on the well-known technique of guillotines cuts and 
is able to generate up-to two envelopes. Then, it tries to artificially behave as a human being would behave in the 
sense that conflicts with frames are avoided while attempting to provide a pleasant appearance. 
The guillotine cuts technique allows to avoid conflicts of the constraint stated in the model. Also, given that cuts are 
made from one extreme of the facade to the other, panels junctions are aligned thus given a symmetric appearance. 
The final position and size of panels are defined according to the non-conflictive areas and panels’ size upper 
bounds in the aim of minimizing the number of used panels. Finally, it is important to highlight that our solution is 
built under the semantics of each constraint in the model thus guiding the reasoning of the problem and the 
application development.

An Engineering Perspective on the Design of

Abstract 
 
Despite an extensive body of knowledge about organisational design for manufacturing, the question 
remains what organisational structures fit best with which competitive priorities and which capabilities of 
resources, also caused by a lack of comparative studies.  Four characteristics of organisational design 
suggest that the structure of manufacturing organisations is a result of inductive and teleological methods, 
similar to product design and engineering.  None of the four traditional approaches embeds principles of 
the engineering perspective.  To demonstrate the suitability of the ‘engineering perspective’, action 
research at a manufacturer of agricultural equipment has been undertaken.  The interplay between the 
analysis and the organisational redesign yields not only insight about the effectiveness of this fifth 
approach but also about the limited relevance of the four traditional perspectives.  Perhaps the design of 
organisational structures for manufacturing organisations is best served with derivations of the principles 
and methods of engineering.

Introduction 
According to Shirazi et al. (1996, p. 199), the efforts in developing organisational structures date back to the 1940s 
but could also be attributed to earlier periods.  In this perspective, knowledge about organisational design for 
manufacturing goes back to the Arsenal of Venice, according to some (e.g. Leijonhufvud, 1984, pp. 3–4), and to 
Frederick Taylor, according to others.  In the opinion of Voss (2007), the first study is De Re Metallica, written by 
Georgios Agricolo in 1556, which describes processes and operations management for the process industry, 
particularly the mining industry.  These early notions are often descriptive, directed to one method and could be 
considered as best practice.  The tradition of best practice has continued today, with the most notable example being 
‘lean production’ (Womack et al., 1991), despite serious concerns being raised about the value of best practices (for 
example, Edge and Richards [1998] and Purcell [1999] for human resource management, and Davies and Kochhar 
[2002] for manufacturing practices).  Therefore, it may be worthwhile to explore if there are approaches for 
organisational design of manufacturing organisations. 
1.1 
Background 
Given the limited reach of best practices, the question remains what organisational structures fit best with which 
competitive priorities and with which capabilities of resources.  This has led to a considerable stream of publications 
about the so-called manufacturing capabilities (e.g. Swink and Hegarty, 1998; Ward and Duray, 2000), about 
specific concepts, such as lean production (for example, Åhlström, 1998) and about world-class manufacturing (for 
instance, Hayes and Pisano, 1994).  Notwithstanding efforts to link manufacturing capabilities to organisational 
design (for example, Safizadeh et al., 2000), the evidence remains weak what the ‘best options’ for organisational 
structures are for a given firm. 
Hence, this paper argues that an engineering perspective on organisational design of manufacturing is (formally) 
lacking.  The position is commensurate with the stance of van Aken (2004), and van Aken and Romme (2009) about 
‘design’ in management science.  It does not support Pandza’s and Thorpe’s (2010, p. 178) contention that 
‘irreversible solutions’ are created, because akin engineering the design of the organisation solutions created by this 
process can be accepted or discarded by stakeholders.  In this perspective, it should be mentioned that the culture of

Abstract 
Described here are three hybrid constructive algorithms which combine heuristic and exact methods for 
solving the scheduling of passenger’s vehicles for public transportation with multiple depots (MDVSP).
The first algorithm assigns each one of the scheduled trips to the depots, taking into account the 
chronological order of the trips and the cost of serving each trip from the depot and then the itineraries are 
built on a heuristic way (Concurrent Scheduler). The second method depicts a general attention sequence 
with all the services. This combines two criteria: chronological order and Nearest Neighbor for the trips. 
In order to establish the depot that serve the set of trips, the mathematical model of the Generalized 
Assignment Problem is used. The third method assimilates graph theory to build itineraries of minimum 
cost using models of general assignment and minimum flow in a network. In order to validate each one of 
the algorithms, 90 cases were extracted from the literature, having between 2 and 5 depots, and 100 and 
500 trips. The algorithms have response times ranging from 0.015 to 1.7 seconds approximately. The 
focus of this work is to provide efficient methods in computation times for the real-time reprogramming 
of vehicle itineraries. Primarily to ease the operation when there are contingencies in the Mass Transit 
System of the Centro Occidente de Centro Metropolitana de Colombia AMCO, whose operation consists 
of about 5000 trips daily. These algorithms have been applied successfully in our cohort of trips.

Abstract 
This study is focused in the construction of work shifts for the drivers of the massive transit system in the 
city of Pereira, Colombia. Starting with the multiple tables of services designed by the public 
transportation tactical agency (Megabús), the problem consists on finding out the minimum and feasible 
set of work shifts that must be attended by the drivers. Arises the need of an adequate division of each one 
of the time tables, so that each partition meets the constraints of continuous work, and also the maximum 
work time allowed for a driver in the same day. The methodology consists on a two-phase heuristic 
algorithm to solve the Crew Scheduling Problem. The algorithm is tested in the massive transit system of 
the West-center Metropolitan Area (AMCO), operated by Integra S.A., which attends around 5000 
services during weekdays. The proposed methodology reduces the number of work shifts for operating 
the massive transit system of the AMCO. The algorithm has a good performance in terms of computing 
time, it reaches good quality solutions in limited times by the operation, and it is an adequate solution for 
reprograming the attention of the services during contingencies in the system.

Abstract: 
 
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is an enterprise-wide information system designed to coordinate all 
the resources, information, and activities, it provides a unified enterprise view of the business for all 
functions and departments, and also an enterprise database for all business transaction, but despite all 
the benefits they are also seen as an expensive, profoundly complex, and notoriously difficult to 
implement because it is different from other IT systems. There are as many reasons for successful ERP 
implementations as there are for failed projects.It is really difficult to measure the success of a project 
of implementation because each organization can look at the success of ERP implementation differently. 
It is important for the organization to have as much information as possible before embarking an ERP 
project, and also respect some critical factor for the success of the project. Measuring and knowing the 
importance of each factor will help an organization to make the right decision, at the right moment. This 
survey examines and also tries to determine the necessary critical success factors (CSFs) in 
implementing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems and also try to examine the impact of this 
technology on the performance of the whole organization. We were able to identify six critical success 
factors by the survey. They are (1) Infrastructure, (2) Business process management, (3) Project 
management, (4) Project team, (5) Culture, communication, and change management, and (6) Training 
and education.

The academic community divides and opposes the positive, negative, or null effects of technology and ERPs on 
business performance. 
As far as our research is concerned, we have focused more on the positive effects that have been generated after 
the implementation of ERPs within companies. We will not go into the details, but we will show through the data 
received which aspect is most affected by the implementation of the ERP.  
From the data, we can notice that two aspects have been positively influenced by the implementation of the ERP: 
Organizational aspect (69%), and Human aspect (31%). the result is not so surprising, since the implementation 
of an ERP opens new perspectives, and facilitates the transition to more polyvalent organizations that rely on 
horizontal coordination and more decentralized decision-making processes, on the other hand it contributes to the 
improvement of staff knowledge. Indeed, the influence on both human and organizational aspects can be shown 
in the short term. Also, ERP systems are expected to reduce costs by improving efficiency, productivity and hence 
profitability. Referring to the above it can be seen that the ERP improves the economic performance, but the results 
are generated in the long term. 
 
Conclusion: 
The objective of this work was to know the perception of Moroccan companies about the CSF considered very 
important for the implementation of ERP systems, and also to know the impact of ERP implementation on business 
performance. Initially, we were able to select six CSF and, among these, three were treated in this article through 
the data received from the questionnaire. 
To carry out our investigation, we made a questionnaire; it allowed us to collect data from the different participants 
of different Moroccan companies from different sectors about their perception in terms of importance of these six 
CSFs .The questionnaire was sent to almost 100 emails, of which 24 were completed. It is important to notify that 
the respondents belong to the Moroccan companies, and most of them were involved and participated in different 
phase of the project of ERP implementation. Our survey is distributed in several waves. The first is at the end of 
2017 and the additional waves are planned. The survey is also divided into three parts.  The first one allows to 
have the maximum of information on the companies. The second part sought some critical success factors on the 
ERP implementation. The third part is the part where we try to evaluate the implementation of the ERP by 
measuring the performance of the company.This paper is a presentation of the data collected through the 
questionnaire to provides a snapshot. Thus, and after the end of the data collection phase, we will be able to 
continue our research by analyzing and exploring the data.

Abstract 
 
The main objective of this paper was to highlight the correspondence between patient satisfaction and 
hospital logistics. We sought to demonstrate that the factors influencing patient satisfaction are 
dependent on logistics activities within hospitals. In this perspective, we tried, in a first step, to 
establish a synthesis of the different factors influencing patient satisfaction. In a second step, we 
focused on hospital logistics, its activities and opportunities to improve the patient satisfaction. The 
methodology followed is based on an analysis of the research studies relating to patient satisfaction 
and hospital logistics. The main result of this research states that, to improve the quality of healthcare 
services and patient satisfaction, healthcare institutions could take advantages from the improvement 
of the efficiency of hospital logistics activities.

Introduction  
 
The main mission of healthcare organizations is to respond to the health needs of the society, the communities 
and the individuals. Respect for patients' needs and wishes is central to a health system (Cleary et al., 1991). 
Patient satisfaction is an important and commonly used indicator for measuring the quality in health care 
(Prakash, 2010). It is, according to various international organizations including WHO1, IOM2 and OECD3, one 
of the main dimensions of quality of care (WHO, 2006; Institute of Medicine, 2001; Kelley and Hurst, 2006). 
In the United States and Europe, patient satisfaction plays a very important role in quality of care reform and in 
the delivery of care generally (Mohan and Kumar, 2011; Bleich et al., 2009). In France, since 1996, measuring 
patient satisfaction has been a regulatory obligation for hospitals (Perruche et al., 2008), also in Germany, it has 
been mandatory since 2005 as part of quality management reports (Schoenfelder et al., 2011). Therefore, 
healthcare institutions need to know where to focus their improvement efforts and which problems to prioritize, 
hence it is very important to identify and understand factors affecting patient satisfaction as it would enable 
health facilities to focus their improvement efforts. In this context, several researches have concerned the study 
of patient satisfaction issue and have identified various factors that affect the level of satisfaction.  
In order to enhance patient satisfaction level, hospitals may take advantages from hospital logistics. According 
to (Kriegel et al., 2013), logistics activities in hospitals have a major influence on how patients view the quality

Abstract 
The aim of the study was to identify causes of the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of employees and 
management at the largest hospital in South Africa, to improve the overall service rendered to patients, and 
to improve the overall operations of that hospital. An observational study approach was followed for the 
purpose of this study. As part of this approach, observations of particular areas within this hospital were 
conducted, questionnaires were distributed to a total of 450 participants both patients and hospital 
employees. With a response rate of 78%, the questionnaire results were able to allow the researchers to 
develop an Ishikawa diagram pointing to the root cause of inefficiency and ineffectiveness of employees 
and management at the largest hospital in South Africa. This paper presents very critical aspects of 
healthcare services inefficiency as well as ineffectiveness. Recommendations made from the findings of 
this study should allow management improve service delivery at this hospital.

1. Introduction
The public health sector is one of the largest sectors, which is paid for by the South African state. It occupies about 11% 
of the states total budget, which is usually allocated to the country’s nine provincial departments. Though the 
government spends an estimated amount of R13.3billion on public health facilities, the health care sector still remains 
appalling. The issues of poor health services in public clinics/hospitals, poor management, lack of medication and 
proper resources have been in existence during and post the apartheid regime. 
1.1 Background, Rationale and Scope of the Study 
According to Hilbert Simons, author of Administrative Behaviour efficiency can be defined as taking the shortest path 
and using the cheapest means to attain a desired goal (Simon, 1976). Effectiveness on the other hand is defined as the 
level of quality with which a task or process is carried out that eventually leads to higher overall business performance. 
Both efficiency and effectiveness came to existence during the industrial revolution where the performance of different 
means of production such as machinery, manpower were evaluated in order to identify whether or not the industry is 
productive (Bentley, 2014). When these concepts were correctly understood and used by philosophers during the 
revolution, it was found that machinery helped fewer employees produce more goods in a shorter period of time which 
allowed subordinates to concentrate on other tasks to increase the industry’s productivity (Bentley, 2014). 
Efficiency during the revolution made it possible for things such as weaving cloth to be done twice as fast which in 
today’s world is used to create clothing garments and cloths (Bentley, 2014). Some studies say merchants were able

the reason why employees are not motivated. The second major branch was found to be absenteeism which had a total 
of 3 sub branches, namely: (1) Low workplace morale, (2) burn out and (3) stress which could be due to a larger work 
overload. The last major branch was listed as the lack of autonomy which had a total of four sub branches. The following 
items were listed as sub-branches: (1) an autocratic chain of command which strips away each employee’s power to 
make immediate decisions within the hospital even in times of emergencies; (2) lack of trust from the Department of 
Public Works and (3) the lack of proper understanding and educational background on decision making. A sub branch 
was then branched out from the last branch which was related to the issue of no training and development programmes 
on decision making for all employees at the hospital. Because the major problems causing inefficiency and 
ineffectiveness together their respective sub headings were identified, the next step was to review the data and suggest 
possible recommendations that would either eradicate the existence of each of the problems identified or reduce them 
so as to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of every single employee at the hospital. Figure 4 represents a 
depiction of the Ishikawa diagram resulting from the data analysis. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The research at this hospital proved that many of the problems experienced by patients were due to the internal 
problems that the hospital and its management team failed to identify and attend to. The Ishikhawa diagram discovered 
that the umbrella problems that led to poor service, inefficiency and effectiveness of staff and management were due 
to the lack of motivation, lack of autonomy, series staff shortage and the lack of knowledge and understanding of the 
hospital sector. A series of recommendations are given. Should they be implemented and maintained the quality of 
service and patient satisfaction will greatly improve. 
 
6. Recommendations and the Way Forward 
 
From the findings obtained after analyzing the data obtained in this study, the researchers have made the following 
recommendations: 
1) Workshop for employees and management should be organized: The department of public works should 
organise training workshops for employees and managers in the hospital to ensure that each of them has the 
adequate knowledge of how to handle patients. These workshops will also educate managers on how to 
handle and lead staff because it is said that the reflection of staff is through its management, so, if managers 
are disciplined, handle complaints with absolute courtesy and encourage and motivate employees, the 
efficiency and effectiveness of staff will be improved overtime (Rust and de Jager, 2010). 
2) The chain of command should be reduced: The department of public works should consider reducing the 
chain of command in order to give managers the autonomy to make decisions that will be faster and beneficial 
for the hospital and patients. The approach of having to report the breakdown of machines, shortage of beds, 
shortage of medication etc. can be handled by management to ensure that a much more speedier process takes 
place instead of wasting time waiting for response from the department of public works which normally 
responds months after the problem was reported (Rust and de Jager, 2010). To address the issue of trust that 
exists between the hospitals staff and the department of public works, training and developmental 
programmes for managers and general employees should be put in place where employees are excessively 
trained on how to make viable business decisions on behalf of the organisation to help improve service given 
to patients (Rust and de Jager, 2010). 
3) There should a standard appraisal system put in place at the hospital: A performance appraisal system for 
all staff at the hospital should be derived where an employee seen as the hardest working is given recognition 
and rewarded with the employee of the month title which may come with a few benefits one that hospital or 
government can afford. This approach will help motivate and inspire many individuals working in the 
hospital irrespective of the position they hold. The overall quality of service will be tremendously improved, 
and many employees will start feeling appreciated and like their service in the hospital is recognised. 
Appraisals may take place either in groups, departments of individually depending on what management 
decides upon, however group or departmental appraisals are considered good and fair more especially if a 
company is implementing the process for the very first time (Rust and de Jager, 2010).  
4) Management should urgently consider development programs: To address the issue of the shortage of 
hospital staff, development programmes can be started for individuals who wish to improve their skills and 
education in the nursing field. Six-month courses may be offered to employees willing to improve their skills 
1157","where they will be trained on the basics of nursing and how to go about assisting a sickly patient (Bentley, 
2014).  
More studies should be conducted in order to ascertain the effectiveness of the Ishikawa diagram use in this study.

Abstract 
 
Lean Manufacturing has become one of the pillars of modern industry, since customer satisfaction 
remains the priority of the production system by respecting delivery time through eradicating all 
worthless elements, the work overload generated by processes not adapted, variability and irregularity. 
However the Lean manufacturing is generally used with a stable demand that changes slightly over the 
time which makes it possible to apply all these basic principles however during the production there are 
always some irregularities that can arise at the last moment without preplanning which disrupts all the 
process. 
Our study will focus on these urgent orders, and how Lean Manufacturing philosophy solve them, while 
respecting the basic principles and what are the challenges the production faces to solve those problems?

Abstract 
 
This article investigates the state of affairs of Project Management as one key discipline that is beneficial 
to both private and public organizations in the country. A gap analysis was conducted in reviewing the 
literature of published articles that are relevant to the project management’s practices and standards, to gain 
insight with regard to what has been covered by academics in the field of Project Management. It was 
established that various authors consider project management as a tool that is not limited to projects but 
applicable strategically by different organizations in different fields, despite their uniqueness. Therefore 
strengthening the ability of project management practitioners through project management programs is a 
cornerstone in the country’s economic growth and stability.

1. Introduction 
 
The opening statement by Jeffrey K. Pinto in his book titled Project Management (PM) – Achieving Competitive 
Advantage is the most critical assertion indicating the nature of the field and its importance, not only for business 
organizations, but also for our lives. Projects are one of the key means by which we change our world, our reality (Pinto, 
2017).  
 
Considering the above statement, it is safe to say that PM is no longer viewed as niceties because it is trend rather a 
discipline that is necessary for the survival of the organization (Silvius and Schipper, 2014). Moreover, organizations 
realize its importance in helping them handle complex undertaking and the strategic role it plays in positioning 
businesses in the market through the achievement of organization’s goals (Rwelamila and Asalan, 2010). In as such 
that PM centers on managing project, its methodologies are applicable to management of organizations (Ahlemann et 
al., 2009). Considering the centrality of PM in contemporary organizations, the adherence of its standards becomes the 
‘backbone’ of its effective implementation in projects (Cooke-Davies et al., 20009). Numerous organizations today 
engage in multiple projects at the same time, with limited resources (Svejvig and Andersen, 2015). Such authors as 
Cooke-Davies, T.J, Crawford, L.H. and Lechler, Y.G defend this by stating that, in the process of chasing predetermined 
particular goals organizations end up undertaking numeral projects (Ahlemann et al., 2009). Therefore, it is vital for a 
robust project manager to successfully coordinate scarce recourses in the realization of numerous projects (Svejvig and 
Andersen, 2015). Consequently, without a doubt the process of selecting a project manager is of utmost importance 
(Pons, 2008). Effective execution of projects through PM is not only important to specific organizations but it does 
influence all industries and different countries (Hans, 2009). It is further asserted that PM plays a fundamental function 
in society in today’s world (Rwelamila and Asalan, 2010) 
 
With that in mind, it is to state that the inconsistent PM competence is a contributing factor in the downfall of service 
delivery in the public sector in South Africa (Hans and Rwelamila, 2012).

understand the temperament of project management and how organizational strategic goals can be addressed by PM 
(Aubry et al., 2007). This will lead to a new era of will of quality, excellent private and public organizations in South 
Africa. Project management is not limited to just managing projects, but scratches through different industries, 
therefore it is recommended that future studies can focus on the identifying means to bridge the gap between Project 
Management knowledge based and the skills required by all layers of the South African economy (Chihuri and L.  
Pretorius, 2012).

Abstract  
 
 
 
The establishment and planning of an urban traffic that meets all the requirements of mobility is the basis for 
achieving of effective economic and social activities within an agglomeration. To do this, several models and 
software simulations have been developed for very different purposes. The Traffic simulation is a tool to 
study the design and operation of facilities, to estimate the evolution of the traffic conditions on a network 
and to evaluate their consequences. Through this article, we propose an overview of the models and tools for 
modeling and simulating road traffic. At first, we start, through some definitions, to make an epistemological 
distinction between the notions of modeling and simulation in the field of traffic. We will then discuss the 
different modeling approaches used for the road traffic study. Subsequently, a classification of dynamic 
simulation tools and software will be presented.

3. Conclusion  
 
This work was intended to present the different models, from the literature, that can understand, model and quantify 
road traffic. As well as the simulation software most commonly used in this field. We have proposed a table of the 
models treated in the traffic studies, which we have grouped into four classes, namely: displacement demand forecast 
models, ground occupancy models, flow models traffic and traffic regulation models. These models differ according to 
the objective envisaged, the planning horizon and the spatio-temporal scale chosen. 
In a simulation study the quality and quantity of the data is very often the first difficulty that arises to analyze a 
network. Through this article we proposed the general approach of a study of traffic.

Table 1. Typology of models processed in the field of traffic studies 
 
Models related to traffic studies are transcribed quickly in dynamic simulation tools. As part of our study, we are 
particularly interested in models of dynamic simulation of road traffic. As a result, the most commonly used road 
modeling and dynamic simulation tools will be detailed in the next section. 
 
2.3 Modeling tools and dynamic simulation of the road traffic 
 
Many tools exist in the literature for each component of the simulation (law of pursuit, queuing changes, conflicts, etc.) 
and commercial software does not use all the same models. Dynamic traffic simulation software can simulate 
microscopic, macroscopic or mesoscopic scales (Buisson & Lesort, 2010). The presentation of these tools is divided 
according to whether the software is purely commercial or that it comes from the field of research. Table 2 shows a list 
of the most commonly used dynamic traffic simulation software.

Abstract 
 
The new industrial revolution which called industry 4.0 will radically change the factories into a smart 
manufacturing. In current research it is concluded that lean will be an important part of this revolution, 
adaptable lean tools to industry are required to manage the difficulties of the connected industry solutions 
and to keep the explosion of information flow which caused by internet of things (IOT) in the right way. 
Some lean tools are adaptable, but what about other tools?  
 
This study identifies the challenge in the integration of Lean tools in industry 4.0 and discusses the 
possibilities of their adaptation.

Figure 11 : Japan’s Goods Vehicle Accident Rates by Road Type and Carriageway Width. Source: World Road 
Association 2007. 
In Japan, the highest accident rate of commercial vehicles in 2005 was found at roads that are less than 5.5 m wide 
(see Figure) (World Road Association (PIARC), 2007). We also note that the rate of accidents of goods vehicles in 
urban areas is greater at the level of smaller roads. 
 
4. Recommandations 
The impact of freight transport on road safety is very important as reflected in the number and severity rate of 
accidents involving vehicles moving for freight transport, which shows considerable percentages as presented in the 
statistical analysis established in this work. In addition to the human damages, the cost generated by this type of 
accidents is very important. In South Africa, the cost of the externalities of road transport accidents is estimated at 
750.27 million euros, and in the United States the social loss due to accidents involving freight vehicles is estimated 
at, 42, 5 million dollars for light commercial vehicles ; 131.5 million dollars for heavy goods vehicles ; and 
articulated trucks ; and 39 Million dollars for trucks (Laaraj, N., Jawab, F, 2018). It would be necessary to take the 
measures to reduce the impact of freight transport on road safety. Studies on the causes of accidents involving a 
freight vehicle, and the necessary solutions to take are carried out (Bouceddour. S, Yerpez. J, 2005) (Newnam, S., 
Goode, N., 2015) (Nations Unies CNUCED, 2015).Here are some recommendations from these studies:     
 Involvement and collaboration between the public and private sectors ; 
 Ensure sufficient investment for the improvement of an adequate infrastructure ; 
 Integration of road safety management into the management framework of the freight transport sector ; 
 Improvement of internal policies (Driver Training Program; Management of load planning and vehicles 
used; Safety audit and control of mechanical condition of vehicles; Control of physical and psychic 
capacity of driver; ...) ; 
 Integration of the “Avoid,Shift,Improve” method (avoid inefficient freight transport, adopt more reliable 
and cleaner modes of transport, improve infrastructure, logistics and operations) ; 
 Improved transportation policies for hazardous goods ; 
 Adopt intelligent transportation systems (Shock and fire protection systems; Electronic engine control 
devices; Intelligent logistics solutions; Computerization of routing and scheduling; Fatigue detection 
systems; ) ; 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In this work, we have explained the extent and the weight of the UFT on road safety and more particularly traffic 
accidents. To do this, the methodology we have deployed is based on the analysis of statistical data at the 
international level and is spread over the last two decades. We first presented the concept of sustainable 
development in relation to the transport of goods in the city. Subsequently, we have identified, through international 
statistical data, the contribution of general freight transport to road safety by specifying the nature of the accidents

caused ; the types of vehicles and goods involved ; the areas involved ; and the schedule of the claims and the 
damage caused. Then, zoom in on the extent of urban goods transport on traffic accidents, which is the focus of this 
work. Through the analysis of statistical data, it can be seen that heavy goods vehicles are not particularly dangerous 
if we compare the number of accidents involving this type of vehicle compared to the number of accidents involving 
light commercial vehicles. In terms of accidents, the number of people killed due to transport accidents in urban 
areas remains as low as the number of accidents caused by road transport of goods outside the urban perimeter. We 
have also shown through statistics that in urban areas road accidents caused by TMV are often more concentrated at 
the level of communal roads, and roads. All these findings show the importance of TMV in the road safety of 
agglomerations. Finally, recommendations to reduce the impact of freight transport are suggested.

Abstract 
One of the more common problems in a manual assembly line is the difficult to balance the operations,
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
dealing with different concerns as the way to distribute operations and to accomplish takt times. The
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
complexity of assembly operations also affects the inequity of the workstations’ time and generates non
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
value added activities revealed in the total cycle time. The manufacturing plant of this case study
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
produces bus chassis in a very manual assembly operation, and has two different assembly lines: one for
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
urban chassis production (UC) and the second one for foreign chassis production (FC). The purpose of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this research paper is to reorganize the job in the workstation for a better use of headcount looking
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
forward to make a 20% reduction. In order to achieve this paper’s main objective, the research team used
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a Lean Six Sigma approach and DMAIC methodology. The activities completed for this case study
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generated a new operations balancing proposal reducing and eliminating the non-value added activities
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
using Kaizen. This paper is relevant for operations management professionals since it represents one of
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
the most studied issues in manufacturing assembly lines, and provides an integrated approach combining
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
different tools to solve this problem in a multinational company.

Abstract 
SMMEs are drivers of economic growth in many economies. In South Africa, they play the strategic role 
of mediating on the triple challenge of poverty, unemployment, and inequality. However, many SMMEs 
fail within the first five years because of diverse challenges which they face regularly. Location decision is 
one of the ten critical decisions of Operations Management. Although, numerous SMMEs owners or 
managers do not pay attention to the importance of location decisions, yet the location of a business 
significantly impact on the performance and survival of the business. Several factors affect a location 
decision, which either provide a positive or negative outcome on business performance. The objective of 
this research is to examine location factors that may affect location decision and how these factors affect 
the performance of SMMEs. The results of the study show that positive relationships existed between 
electricity affordability, customer flows, safe and healthy areas of business environment (independent 
variables) and business performance (dependent variables). Affordability of electricity tariff scored the 
strongest positive relationship; showing that business owners/managers consider electricity cost as an 
important factor to observe when searching for suitable business premises. Each location choice provides 
various potentials opportunities and sometimes threats which often emerge as an advantage or an 
impediment. It is therefore imperative that business owners or managers pay attention and consider 
seriously, those factors that will determine the quality of their location decisions. This study provides 
SMMEs owners or managers with empirical evidence that location factors indeed affect location selection, 
and hence business performance.

1. Introduction
While the importance of the Small, Micro, and Medium enterprises (SMMEs) is internationally acknowledged,
defining an SMME is a challenging task, as  SMMEs are variously defined on the basis of problematics surrounding
their countries’ governance, economy, social, geo-localisation opportunities, and local perspectives (Credit, 2011)
(Berisha and shiroka-pula, 2015). In South Africa, The National Small Business Act of South Africa defined SMMEs
as distinct business entities managed by its owner or owners. Generally, any enterprises can be classified in accordance
to employment, turnover and assets. Although all three criteria are applicable to an enterprise, for practical purposes,
the number of employees is regarded as the most important criterion when defining SMMEs. With reference to South
Africa, the National Small Business Act 102 of 1996 stipulates that SMMEs are grouped into four levels of
development: (1) survivalist, (2) micro, (3) small, and (4) medium-sized enterprises (NTSIKA, 1997: 9). The first
category, “survivalist”, performs in an informal way.  SMMEs within this category are usually operated by unskilled
individuals who seek financial survival. Survival enterprises have minimal investment, capital; hence, they do not
generate as much income as they need to grow. Owners of the businesses lack basic training needed to manage a
business. The second category are Micro enterprises which also operate like survivalist enterprises. However, micro
enterprises are likely to change to a formal small business. In the third category of small enterprises, also called ""very
small enterprises"", less than ten paid workers are employed. Finally, the third category, “small enterprises”, belongs
to the formal economy in which owners of businesses are able to employ less than hundred employees who are capable

6. Conclusion and recommendations 
Many start-up mistakes can sometimes be remedied, but a poor location decision is difficult, and sometimes impossible 
to change (The staff of entrepreneur media, 2015). The location of a business significantly impacts on the business’s 
survival. Each location choice provides various potentials, opportunities and sometimes threats which often emerge 
as an advantage or an impediment. It is therefore imperative that business owner and managers pay attention and 
consider seriously, those factors that will determine the quality of their location decisions. 
 
Given the high level of business failure among SMMEs all over the world and South Africa in particular; the study is 
a contribution to the illumination of the understanding of new ventures in the area of location decisions; so that they 
are able to make informed decisions which may improve the chances of survival of their businesses. This research has 
presented the perception of location decision of SMMEs in the city of Johannesburg. Particularly, the research 
investigated the degree to which the predetermined variables (labour, electricity factors, proximity to customers, 
proximity to suppliers, proximity to competitors, and safe and healthy location) affect the dependent variable which 
is business performance.  
 
The research established that among all the variables, affordable electricity tariffs has the strongest and positive 
relationship with business performance. It was also discovered that safety and health and high customer flow have a 
relationship with business performance. Nevertheless, the theoretical results show that all six independent variables 
influence location decisions and therefore business performance.  
 
Furthermore, more companies as part of their contribution to the growth and development of SMMEs, should sponsor 
programs and conferences to share ideas and experiences on the import of location decision and what criteria can be 
used for location analysis to enable SMMEs make informed location selection decision for their business.

Abstract 
 
The study discusses employees' awareness of quality. According to the literature, the success of quality 
depends on a number of factors such as quality awareness, quality understanding and the benefit of quality 
of quality at workplace. The objective of the study is to assess the extent to which employees of the ABC 
Company are aware of quality and they do understand quality at their work, as well as to establish the 
benefit that comes with quality. To carry out the study a mixed research methods approach was used for 
research in six departments with the ABC Company. A sample of more than 50% of the total staff 
complement made up of 88 employees was selected. Data was collected in a form of questionnaires. Face 
to face interviews were also conducted. According to the findings there are critical factors that hinder the 
awareness and understanding of quality at the workplace, such as communication, management support, 
adequate training for employees. This particular research aims at providing a practical insight into service 
organisations’ understanding of their quality management system from their employees’ perspective. This 
should allow the organisation to improve how quality is perceived internally, subsequently the perception 
of quality by their customers.

1. Introduction 
 
Quality is about making the organization perform to the best of its ability for their stakeholders. From improving the 
processes, product, systems and service that the organisation provides to their customers, and to make sure that the 
organization as a whole is fit and is effective (Stevenson, 1999). Various organizations are now turning to programs 
of quality management in the effort to improve their performances. To such extent that organisations aim to improve 
on their products, and the quality of their services when implementing quality programs. It can be noted that these 
programs include, but not limited to empowering employees, involving employees in organization decision making 
and communicating to employees the vision and mission of the organization, which requires good communication 
from top management to employee at workforce level.  
 
Employee awareness is the degree to which employees knows a particular situation, policies, documents or any other 
important information related to their organisations. Therefore, it is very critical for employees to understand their 
suppliers, customers, shareholders as well as their community. This is due to the fact that delivering as an organization 
means you must know who your stakeholders are and understand what your stakeholders want or expected from you 
as an organization in order to meet those needs and exceed their expectations now and in the future. With this in mind, 
it is important to indicate that employees central to the implantation of any quality programs within the organisation. 
As indicated by Goetsch and Davis (2014), out of the eleven characteristics of Total Quality approaches, eight literally 
refer to employees’ participation. These characteristics are depicted in the figure below, with characteristics related to 
employees circled in red.

E) Training 
Training specifically on quality is barely provided to employees of ABC Company, which in normal cases lead 
to poor quality service. Poor quality cost the company substantial amount of money due to mistakes made by low 
level employees up to high level positions. 
 
According to the findings, factors that affect the quality awareness and understanding at production level are lack of 
communication from top management, job insecurity, lack of training on quality in their respective departments and 
the organisation as whole. Although employees are committed to improve quality, the lack of knowledge is a major 
issue since training is not provided. Management commitment/support is also an issue within the company. 
 
6. Recommendation 
 
The study recommends that management set up in-house or external training for its employees. Employees need to 
understand their work, quality related to their work, and what is expected from them in terms of improving their 
department output. The company also need to provide training on ISO 9001:2015 to enable employees to understand 
what this quality standard entails. It is also recommended that during their weekly safety meeting, supervisors should 
include a quality awareness topic, for example, who is a customer (internal and external)? In this way employees will 
always be aware of quality in their respective department. 
 
Management needs to come up with a system that will improve communication within the organisation. It is critical 
that communication flows from high levels to low levels positions within the company. Internal quality audit should 
be held every month in different departments focusing on communication as it should be one of the factors that these 
audit exercises should look out for according to ISO 9001:2015. 
 
It is evident that employees of company ABC do bring forth ideas and are committed to improving the company’s 
performance as it is currently struggling. It is recommended that the company run competitions on improving the 
quality in the workplace. This competition would provide incentives on a quarterly basis to motivate the 15% that will 
only participate when there are monetary rewards involved. 
 
ABC Company should also look into balancing the gender representation in the production level. It has been identified 
that gender equity is literally non-existent, therefore bringing a gender balance might improve the organisation’s 
performance as female workers would gain confidence in numbers as opposed to being intimidated by their male 
counterparts, as it is currently the case. 
but balancing the gender might even help the company in improving.

Abstract— We are interested in this writing to the location of 
logistics platforms necessary for the Transportation of Goods in 
the City such as the Urban Distribution Centers (CDU). For this, 
we present in the first part the problem related to the concept of 
localization of UDCs as well as a state of the art of the problem of 
localization of logistics platforms. The second part will propose a 
mathematical modeling methodology that takes into account the 
location of potential customers of the site. The last part will 
propose a case study, modeling and optimization using the 
genetic method using Matlab software, a distribution platform 
specialized in computer and office supplies in the city of Fez.

Introduction  
With the rapid development of the world economy and the 
demographic concentration in the city (the inhabitants in the 
city pass from 52% in 2014 to 67% in 2050), the organization 
of urban distribution has become essential for the proper 
functioning of the city. [1,2]. A distribution system based on 
pooling can not only improve the traffic flow and mobility in 
the city, but also reduce the costs of urban transport [3,4]. In 
this system, Urban Distribution Centers (UDCs) find their 
place increasingly as intermediaries between suppliers and 
customers. The problem of location of these is a strategic 
problem and concerns the selection of potential locations of 
centers and the transportation of products to minimize the total 
cost of transport. 
I. LOCATION OF AN URBAN DISTRIBUTION CENTER
A. Problems
Our job is to determine a site to locate an urban distribution 
center (UDC). CDUs are groupage-unbundling platforms, 
usually located a few kilometers from the city center, whose 
purpose is to manage flows to dense areas [11]. Their main 
functions are grouping / unbundling of goods, warehousing, 
distribution of goods in dense areas with less bulky and 
greener vehicles, and pooling between the different 
stakeholders. CDUs are often set up by a public initiative, and 
can be managed by private or public actors. 
In most cases, there is no land that can accommodate UDCs. 
In parallel, the suppliers and customers of the center are 
known in advance, and we aim through this writing to locate 
UDCs by minimizing the total costs of transportation. So our 
problem 
is 
a 
Continuous, 
Deterministic, 
Static 
and 
Monocritical problem (CDSMo). 
B.
State of the art of localization problems
Localization models have been studied in various forms for 
hundreds of years. Even if the contexts in which these models 
are located may differ, their main characteristics are always 
the same: customers whose location is well known, spaces 
whose characteristics are known in advance, equipment and 
means of transport to availability [12]. Thus, location location 
is determined by an objective function. 
The literature review was developed on thirty articles. The 
table below lists the most recent references.

Solution method and results
 Several optimization methods exist. We chose to use the 
genetic algorithm, given its ease of programming, in addition 
to its effectiveness in the problem of simple location at a level, 
capacity, static and nonlinear. 
We chose as software for solving the MATLAB problem. This 
software allows thanks to its toolbox module allows to have 
results for this kind of problem. 
The optimal location determined by the software is the area 
containing the point S (536.25, 381.75). This point is located 
on Allal Ben Abdellah Avenue. This position minimizes the 
distances between the platform and the customers. But at the 
same time, the place is located on a large artery of the city. 
This location will therefore minimize transport costs. At the 
same time, the location is accessible only by road, nuisance 
can be observed following the current traffic supported in the 
area in addition to that which will be generated by the 
platform: 
• Social nuisances such as congestion and stress for drivers
and residents
• Economic losses due to the loss of time caused by
congestion
• in addition to local environmental nuisances in the area.
In addition, the location is located on an area where
installation costs will be very important given the price per
square meter.
Conclusion 
In this article, we have proposed a mathematical model for a 
strategic problem of urban logistics: the location of urban 
distribution centers. A concrete case has been proposed, 
modeling and optimization by the genetic algorithm on Matlab 
software. 
It has been noticed that, despite the optimization of distances 
between the platform and the customers, several other 
parameters can intervene and change or modify the location. 
As an extension of our work, it will be useful to take into 
account during the modeling several other factors that 
influence the choice of the optimal location.

Abstract 
 
The main objective of this paper is to highlight the potential of hospital logistics for improving the 
quality of care. In this perspective, we have apprehended the quality of care in three main dimensions: 
patient satisfaction, care providers’ satisfaction and the compliance with care standards established by 
the WHO. The literature relating to these dimensions shows that the areas of hospital logistics 
interferes with the determinants of satisfaction as well as the care quality standards. This led us to 
conclude that improving the quality of care depends on the efficiency of the logistics activities within 
hospitals. The methodology adopted was based on the synthesis of articles and scientific reports 
dealing with the following topics: quality of care, patients’ satisfaction, satisfaction of caregivers, 
hospital logistics. 
1. Introduction  
 
Healthcare institutions are subject to changes in their social, economic and regulatory environments, which force 
them to improve the quality of care. In this context, they need to meet a set of requirements including those 
relating to satisfaction (patient satisfaction and care provider’s satisfaction) and to comply with international 
standards of quality of care. Understanding of the concept of quality of care, the variables influencing patient 
satisfaction and variables affecting healthcare professionals’ satisfaction and also standards of quality of care, is 
needed to improve the quality of care. 
Although many factors may contribute to the satisfaction of patients and providers, it is important to identify 
those factors that have the potential to be systematically improved within healthcare facilities and could have 
tremendous implications for quality of care. The same for quality care standards that constitute references to 
ensure good quality.  
In order to provide high quality, Healthcare institutions may adopt a variety of approaches including the 
optimization of their logistics, that has been considered, by several authors, as one of the efficient ways to 
improve the quality of care (Bourgeon et al., 2001; Kriegel et al., 2013; Costin, 2010). This article establishes 
the link between hospital logistics and quality of care, and examines how strong is the impact of an effective 
logistics on the delivery of a high quality. It is beyond the scope of this paper to cover all aspects of quality of 
care. Instead, interest will be given to the field of hospital logistics as a tool of quality improvement.  
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section present the research methodology followed 
to treat the subject, section 3 tends to address the issue of quality from three dimensions: patient satisfaction, 
healthcare providers’ satisfaction and compliance with relevant WHO standards. It provides a brief review of the 
literature and a synthesis of patient and providers’ satisfaction factors, and a list of standards of quality of care 
relating to logistics areas. Section 4 is devoted to understanding the role of hospital logistics in improving the 
quality of care.  
 
2. Methods 
 
The approach adopted to deal with quality of care was based on the exploration of three dimensions: patient 
satisfaction, healthcare providers’ satisfaction and standards of quality of care. The two first dimensions were 
studied to identify factors that are important for patient and care providers and influencing their satisfaction. This

Abstract 
The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it measures the relative  performance of six operators in 
the largest Morocco’s cities for the  year of 2013. Secondly, it identifies the potential 
performance improvements  for the under-performing companies. To this end, Data Envelopment  
Analysis (DEA) methodology is applied for comparing operators  according to three performance 
dimensions namely; Production  efficiency, operational effectiveness and overall performance. The  
D.E.A results revealed that company operating in Casablanca city  was the most efficient of the 
sample. In addition, the companies  operating in Casablanca and Marrakech cities are classified, 
respectively, as the  best performing of the sample in terms of operational effectiveness  and overall 
performance. Also, based on the  overall performance measure, the research outcomes identify the  
percentage that an underperforming operator needs to increase its  outputs or reduce its inputs in order to 
achieve best  performance.

operators would  have to make if they want to be (100%) well performing (or  the performance score is equal to 
unity). 
 
Table 4 provides the target values of the inputs and  outputs derived from the CRS-DEA model to measure 
the  overall performance. To explain the results, take the case of a  single operator, for example, the worst performer 
of the  sample (operator of Fez city). The overall performance score  of this operator is 0.782, which implies that this 
operator could  become efficient if all his outputs are proportionally increased  by 20% ((1/(0.782(φ))-1), and 1/φ is 
the overall performance  scores of an outputs-oriented model reported by the DEAP  software). However, even with 
this proportional increase  required in all outputs, this operator would not achieve best  performance. In order to 
project this operator on the  efficiency frontier, other ""slack"" adjustments are necessary  because non-zero input-
output slacks appear for this operator.

The company operating in Fez city has to make three  adjustments to become best performer. First, it should  increase 
all its outputs by 20%. Second, it should increase the  number of Bus-kms and total passengers by 
27.91%  respectively. However, despite the increase in its output, it still  does not perform well. No other output can 
be increased.  Thus, the operator should also reduce his bus network length  by 30.06%. The first adjustment is 
known as a radial  adjustment, whiles the second and third types of adjustments  are known as slack adjustments. A 
similar interpretation can  be used for other underperforming operators. 
 
Finally, it is interesting to note that operator managers  should be aware that some of these 
performance  improvement options (and target values) may not be  practical. They can choose to implement only 
some of these  potential improvements (especially the increase in outputs)  because the quantities of inputs selected in 
this study are  predefined in the specifications and in contracts established  with delegating authorities. Their change 
must be the subject  of a prior agreement between the operator and the delegating  authority . 
 
 Conclusion  
 
In this paper, we conducted a comparative analysis of the  performance of six public bus transport operators in 
major  Moroccan cities for the year of 2013. To this end, Data Envelopment  Analysis method was used to evaluate 
and compare  performance along three dimensions, namely production  efficiency, operational effectiveness and 
overall performance. 
 
The D.E.A results revealed that company operating in  Casablanca city was the most efficient in the sample. As 
for  the operational effectiveness, the companies of Casablanca  and Marrakech cities are the most effective of the 
sample.  Finally, these two operators are ranked first, in the sample, in  terms of overall performance.  
 
Based on the overall performance measure, the search  results also identify potential performance improvements 
for  each underperforming operator. This result provides practical  information to operators or delegating authorities 
on the  percentage that an operator needs to increase its outputs or  reduce its inputs in order to achieve 100% 
performance (or to  achieve an overall performance score equal to 1).

The major contribution of this research is to capture a  preliminary image on the performance of public bus 
transport  in major Moroccan cities using limited available data. The  results allows operators to compare their 
performance against other operators in different geographical contexts. However; one of the limitations of this study 
is that performance measurement  were done without taking into account the environment in  which these companies 
operate. Future research will focus on  determining the external factors that affect the estimated  performance.

Abstract 
The entrance rate of vehicle bodies into assembly lines to complete the assembly process is so important for 
managing and increasing the daily production. In this paper, using discrete simulation technique and a simulation 
methodology, which is designed by simulation technical committee of Michigan University, we modeled and 
simulated the mechanical assembly line of RIO vehicle in SAIPA Corporation to find the optimum entrance rate, 
such that the daily production and total productivity are increased, besides the entrance rate and cycle time are 
shortened, reasonable and feasible as simultaneously. The entrance rate of RIO vehicle bodies into mechanical 
assembly line is one vehicle per 6 minutes. The daily output is in arrival [53, 69]. After various running of simulated 
system of mechanical assembly line of RIO, we found its optimum status such that the outputs and productivity are 
increased. In this regard, if the entrance rate is reduced as much as 2.2 minutes, the daily output of mechanical 
assembly line will be in arrival [65, 77], where, the lower bound of the assembly line production will increase as 
much as 12 units and the upper bound of daily output rate will increase as much as 8 units or vehicle bodies.

Abstract 
 
Nowadays customers’ requirements demand higher quality and better products but at a lower and more competitive 
price, such as the agricultural enterprise in this case study. The company defined a global goal of cost reduction for 
all its facilities to continue being competitive and a leader in the agricultural market, so the opportunity was set on 
the hydraulic sub-assemblies components and parts. The present case study was developed at the strategic sourcing 
department, looking to reduce the hydraulic components cost supplied by different providers due to the scale 
economy through the global supply chain without affecting the quality delivered in their final products and facing 
the demand growth.  The methodology used to accomplish the goals at the present study and research, was divided 
in four different stages such as a diagnosis of the current situation, the design of the new sourcing strategy, 
implementation of the strategy and monitoring and control of the results and key process indicators, also based on 
the Design for Manufacturing and Assembly methodology (DFMA) and Kraljic’s global sourcing strategy to 
accomplish the expected target on the total cost reduction.

To finish the operations, the physical cell was built and the manuals to operate the cell, Kanban calculations, process 
sequence documents, visual aids, aerial locations, and the containers were developed. 
In both cases, the cost reduction was achieved. 
6. Conclusion 
 
In summary, the supply management is a great opportunity for cost reduction in manufacturing. Classifying the 
purchased products with the KPM is a very interesting effort that helps the purchasing manager to make clear and 
good decisions related on how to handle the supplied parts and achieve the company goals with a strategic sourcing 
approach. 
When the strategy is defined, and the products in bottleneck quadrant are identified, the DFMA methodology helps 
for a good manufacturing process design to continue reducing the total product cost.

Abstract 
 
In recent years, material imports in the steel industry has increased for several reasons, therefore 
efforts have focused on optimizing port logistics processes to increase their efficiency. The steel 
slab is a semi-finished steel product of rectangular section, obtained by continuous casting 
processes for its use in rolling mills to produce rolled steel rolls. On the other hand, the port of 
Brownsville represents for the company under study the main point for the importation of steel 
slabs. Due the demand growth of this material in the last years and the reduction of space in the 
closest yards to the unloading zone inside the port, the management of the material handling is 
indispensable. The case study presented on this article aims to reduce costs in their logistic 
processes in the importation of steel slabs starting on the material unload of the ship to the load 
of rail wagons that go to the manufacturing facility. Based on the methodology for the analysis 
of logistics processes a reduction of more than 30% of logistics costs was calculated.

Abstract 
Ruthless competition, pression from authorities and constant demand from customers to purchase an eco-
friendly product, make the modern company condemned to reduce the social and environmental impacts 
for their supply chains. Not to forget optimize the operational costs making the logistic operations more 
sustainable. In this paper, we investigate the added value of sustainability on a distribution network via a 
multi-agent simulation. The aim of the proposed model is the minimization of operational costs and the 
environmental burden as well as maximizing the social benefits of the network. We are mainly interested 
in the way the distribution network and the facilities behave under sustainability constraints. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Without a doubt, logistics network are complex systems with dynamics proprieties. Not only they deal with 
uncertainty of data but also, they have to be time dependent. The main contribution of this paper is to shed light on 
how Logistics networks perform in a dynamic environment. This performance, would help decision makers to 
predict the changes in the network configuration based on sustainability pillars: economic, environmental and social. 
For decades, the logistics network design or distribution network design was linked to location science. More 
precisely: the location facility problem. The similarity of both problems is argued to be due to the fact that they have 
the same purpose. Both problems try to find the best location of distribution centers, hubs or warehouses in order to 
minimize the total costs. This traditional objective of operating the distribution network under minimum costs is 
justified by the crucial role that logistics networks play as a key of profitability, since they affect directly the costs of 
the supply chain as well as customer satisfaction (Chopra et al, .2004). 
In today’s business environment, the logistics systems widely evolved during the last decade. This said evolution is 
marked by: The decrease of the size of the transported lots and the size of inventories, the industry aims more 
towards just in time; Flexible transportation; Increased reliability; The availability of more transportation solutions 
of via one 3PL and 4PL; The acquisition of more logistic operations by the logistics agents such as the storage, the 
handling, the packaging and the maintenance; And the development of the e-commerce and the use of Information 
and Communication Technologies (Savy, 2006). But nowadays, this economic performance is not enough to face 
the challenges exerted from customers and from NGO (Non-Governmental Organization), on companies to address 
their sustainability level. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follow: The first part of the article presents a background on sustainability 
optimization and agent modelling in distribution networks. The second part, exposes the proposed methodology. The 
third part presents the case study, the finding and discusses the results. Finally, we end the paper with a conclusion 
and future research perspectives.

4.3 The simulation results 
The manufacturing plant operates seven days in a week and has a capacity not to exceed. The RDCs place their 
orders each week. We consider that the waiting time at the manufacturing time follows a uniform distribution 
(Min=2h; Max=4h).  
Initially, the company possesses a number of trucks, this number could be overestimated/underestimated for the 
optimal configuration offered by the optimization. We conducted a simulation experiment in Anylogic software. 
This later, combine both a GIS and an Agent architecture to model a selected scenario then run an optimization 
experiment, to maximize the utilization rate of the fleet of the vehicle owned by the company, followed again by 
simulation to test the viability of the solution. Table 3 shows that major gain is obtained after running the 
optimization simulation program. The current vehicles fleet configuration was overestimated, causing higher 
holding costs of the trucks. The proposed framework allows the decision makers to choose solution from the pareto-
optimal solutions and simulate the chosen scenario to finally adjust their decisions in case of a major change in the 
distribution network environment.

5. Conclusion  
In this paper, our aim was to answer the research questions: How to design an optimal sustainable distribution 
network? To answer this problematic, the authors contributed in the following way: 
- 
A Mixed integer Linear Problem was formulated to solve a multi-objective optimization problem 
and location-allocation problem when it comes to decisions related to the opening/closing of 
regional distribution centers; 
- 
The environmental impacts evaluation in a more comprehensive way using ReCiPe 2008 as a 
LCIA method; 
- 
A social benefits objective function was formulated and added to the Analytical model;

- 
A simulation model combining both GIS and an Agent Model using the Anylogic software was 
introduced to take decisions related to the size of the vehicle fleet and especially optimize the 
trucks load. 
From the obtained results, it appears that the total costs and environmental impacts minimization have the same 
effects on the network configuration. Social benefits maximization comes, however, with higher costs and 
impossible to achieve for decision makers. Hence, a set of solutions of compromise must be offered in order to 
design a more sustainable distribution network. 
The proposed methodology, in order to answer properly the research question, need to explore more research 
avenues such as: 
- 
Using the Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA)  to model the social objective function, since the 
social aspect of logistics is difficult to quantify and no standard measure exist in literature yet; 
- 
Incorporating uncertainty in the model;  
- 
Using metaheuristics for the resolution of the optimization problem.

Abstract 
The paper deals with the dairy valorization problem. A new stochastic model for optimizing dairy 
valorization model is proposed. It takes into account the multipurpose and batch characteristics of dairies 
and employs the time resource distribution over the processing nodes and products. The dairy valorization 
model developed and analyzed in three scenarios. The first one refer to the definitive space, which 
indicates the lack of demand dependence on various factors and in the second as well as the third 
scenarios denote eliminate the space of certainty and it is to consider the quantity demanded of the 
products, quantity and quality of the incoming raw material (Raw Milk), respectively. Iran’s Kurdistan 
dairy supply chain is used as a case study. The results of the analysis will be presented in two ways, 
considering and non-considering of byproducts. The results reflect improved supply chain profit in case 
of using byproducts instead of discarding them. The model shows that, by utilizing any byproducts, while 
increasing supply chain profit, the amount of nutrient loss decreases. By entering space of certainty into 
an uncertainty, the chain's profit reduces, which indicating the importance of acting to reduce demand 
fluctuations in order to improve the overall supply chain profit.

1. Introduction 
Dairy industry had been found its position all over the world. Increasing importance of dairy products lifts their 
market demand and affects the processing sector. Supply chain (SC) models, appears as a useful tool for efficient 
analysis of the environmental impact in dairy products and their portfolio optimization. There are three main actors 
which have the following goals in dairy supply chain: 1) dairy processors – looking for maximum profit; 2) markets 
– pursuing customers’ demand satisfactions; and 3) milk collection centers – aiming to sell most of the collected 
milk. It is very important to have a clear picture of the tradeoff margin existing between these three actors 
(Vaklieva-Bancheva et al., 2007). 
The main difference of dairy supply chain with others is its perishable products, which it influences the whole 
supply chain, from getting milk at dairy plants till delivery end dairy products to consumers. In dairy supply chain 
the time factor has a very important role such as seasonality factor, thus each factor that influences it, is more 
significant and effective factor in studies. In the case of seasonality, affect qualitative and quantitative features of

A suggestion for future research in this area could be the development of a new portfolio of industrial products in 
the dairy supply chain of Iran’s Kurdistan province. In order to change the demand from the traditional sector to the 
industrial sector and thus to contribute in economic growth, it is possible to use byproducts in the production of new 
products at processing centers. Rooting and identifying infrastructure gaps in the supply and distribution processes 
of the dairy supply chain will lead to improved quality and quantity of dairy products processing, help the country's 
economy, increase customer satisfaction and reduce food waste.

Abstract  
 
This work describes an implementation of a oil drilling data mining project approach based on the 
CRISP-DM methodology. Recent real-world data were collected from a from historical data of an actual 
oil drilling process in Hassi Terfa field, situated in South of Algeria. During the modelling process. The 
goal was to predict the rate of penetration (ROP) based on input parameters that are commonly used at the 
oil drilling process (weight on bit, rotation per minute, mud density , spp, ucs) . At the data preparation 
stage, the data were cleaned and variables were selected and transformed. Next, at the modeling stage, a 
regression approach was adopted, where three learning methods were compared : Artificial Neural 
Network, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. The best learning model was obtained by the 
Random Forest method, which presents a high quality coefficient of correlation. The results of the 
experiment show that the proposed approach is able to effectively use the engineering data to provide 
effective prediction ROP, the ROP prediction allows the drilling engineer to select the best combination 
of the input parameters to have a better advancement.

Abstract 
 
Purpose– This paper aims to evaluate the current implementation of Lean Six Sigma (L6σ) in 
two tertiary hospitals in Oman that used this concept recently as part of its quality improvement 
initiatives. 
 
Design/methodology/approach– The study has used a questionnaire consisting of 112 questions 
under two sections. The first one was about pre-implementation of L6σ which is consisting of 
two dimensions; identifying service and mapping value streams. The second section was about 
evaluation of L6σ by using DMIAC process. In fact, the answer of each question was recorded as 
Good Point (GP) if it was YES or Bad Point (BP) if it was NO. Consequently, BPs are 
distributed into Problem Categories (From PC1 which is the worst to PC-5 which the lowest). 
 
Findings– The results have shown that 50% of the quality managers’ answers were recorded as 
GPs whereas the second half was BPs in different PCs. There were no PC-1 answers that indicate 
serious problems in L6σ implementation in both hospitals. The answers were distributed under 
PC-2, PC-3 and PC-4. The study has recommended that L6σ teams have to give more attentions 
during value streams mapping in the new projects to increase the effectiveness of L6σ 
implementation. 
 
Originality/value– To the best of authors’ knowledge, no study has evaluated the current 
implementation of L6σ in Oman’s hospitals. These results assist L6σ teams in healthcare sectors 
to reach performance improvement against a best practice benchmark.

ABSTRACT 
The alternatives options pertaining to the use of separated impurities such as carbon dioxide (CO2) have 
attracted high interest over the recent years. CO2 utilization is offering many additional economic benefits to 
biogas upgrading technologies. By means of these technologies, the separated CO2 can be used for various 
purposes as an eco-friendly and financially sustainable product in enhanced oil recovery (EOR), algae 
production, mineralization and carbon sequestration. On the one hand, the anthropogenic climate change and 
the mitigation thereof are the main reasons of the increasing interest for CCS technologies. On the other hand, 
the financial aspect of upgrading technologies is still an important criterion always considered before the 
commencement of projects due to the production of impurities. To optimize the economic viability of biogas, 
this study proposes a synergy between biogas upgrading and CCS technologies to generate tremendous benefits 
in the future. This study aims at promoting the deployment of biogas and CO2 utilization to avail governmental 
incentives and subsidies in order to eradicate present hurdles in the energy sector.

membranes technologies seemed more economically effective than others, the loss of methane remained high and 
low methane recovery remained low. As such, there was an urge to reduce further operational cost by increasing the 
profitability of technologies in place. In this perspective, alternatives options pertaining to the use of separated 
impurities often discarded such as CO2 has attracted high interest over the last recent years.CO2 utilization is offering 
many additional economic benefits to biogas upgrading technologies. Upon appropriate separation, the separated CO2 
can be used for various purposes as an eco-friendly and financially sustainable product.

ABSTRACT 
Managing multiple projects simultaneously is the current trend in project management particularly in the 
oil and gas industry. The objective of this research is to investigate the impact of teamwork quality on 
project effectiveness in a multiple-project management setting in order to help project managers manage 
multibillion dollar projects effectively. Teamwork quality is measured against six variables: 
communication, coordination, balance of member contributions, mutual support, effort and cohesion, while 
effectiveness is measured by project performance. A total of 184 project managers participated in the 
survey. The findings show that all six variables of the teamwork quality construct had a measurable impact 
on project performance. 
Keywords 
Managing Multiple Projects, Teamwork Quality, Multi-project Manager, Project Performance. 
This study is conducted within the field of project management in the oil and gas industry, and it focuses specifically 
on project managers who lead multiple projects simultaneously through showing the impact of teamwork quality on 
project effectiveness. Leading more than one project at a time of multimillion/multibillion dollars is a difficult task 
for project managers. Project managers are required to deliver successful projects within schedule and budget. 
Therefore, multi-project managers require more effective ways and tools to help them improve project performance 
in terms of time, cost and quality. Teamwork quality is found to be one of the most important factors impacting 
projects performances. This study investigates the impact of teamwork quality on project performance. The findings 
show that teamwork quality has a positive impact on project performance. Hence, multi-project managers may 
improve project performance by evaluating their project team collaboration using the following six factors: 
communication, coordination, balance of member contributions, mutual support, effort and cohesion. Improving these 
factors within a project team shall enhance project performance.    
1. Introduction
Oil and gas is one of the major industries globally, particularly in the USA. This industry is also the main source
of energy in the USA (Guilford, Hall, O’Connor & Cleveland, 2011) and in many other countries. Oil and gas products 
are heavily used in our everyday lives for power generation. As the world demand for oil and gas increases, producers 
invest more in developing new projects, both on shore and off shore, to increase and enhance oil and gas production 
worldwide (Campbell & Laherrère, 1998). The sizes of such projects vary between small, medium, large, major and 
mega, depending on the project’s value and scope of work complexity. Currently, it is common in the oil and gas 
industry to have multiple projects running simultaneously because of market need and high demand; hence, project 
management discipline is mandatory to improve the management of multiple projects and boost their performance 
and efficiency. Project management has become increasingly important. Indeed, many project managers lead more 
than one project simultaneously for many reasons, such as the market need, project manger’s skills and expertise in 
managing multiple projects, linking multiple concurrent projects, and leading multiple teams, while others lead single 
projects (Patanakul, 2013).  
The focus of this study is the effectiveness of project performance through project managers who lead multiple 
simultaneous projects. Usually, such type of management for different project simultaneously are independent in terms

Abstract 
The masking effect due to noise manifests itself not only on auditory warning signals, but also 
verbal communication. Communication in noise increases both the workload of the person 
who sends and the one that receives; indeed, the first must raise their voices, the second 
attention makes an effort to understand the message. This difficulty understanding increases 
when the operator must pay attention simultaneously to the verbal message and signals from 
other sources. In this case, the focus of attention on the verbal message reduces the attention 
span and therefore the operator's ability to meet competing demands.

Abstract 
Qatar is one of the top 10 countries in the world in terms of per capita food waste; which ranges from 584 
to 657 kilograms per year. The combination of high food consumption rate and very low food waste 
recycle rate, results in mountains of food dumped into landfills where they get burned and produce 
harmful gases. In this paper, we are introducing a practical solution to recycle food wastage at home. The 
solution is to design an eco-friendly machine that converts food waste to fertilizer. The use of recycled 
food waste as compost improves the soil health and structure, increases drought resistance and reduces the 
need for supplemental water, fertilizers and pesticides. The composting process is fully automated, it 
consists of several steps under controlled environmental conditions to fasten the process. A mechanism is 
designed to reduce food waste volume and experiments were conducted to figure out the best conditions 
of temperature, moisture content and the bulking agent that would result in a high-quality homemade 
fertilizer within hours. We constructed a prototype of the machine where we focused on the aesthetics 
aspect by designing an elegant machine with a suitable size to be placed in any kitchen.

1. Introduction
Food waste is becoming a critical global problem due to the continuous increase in the world population. 
Figure 1, shows that If food wastage were a country, it would be the third largest emitting country in the world
(WRI’S Climate Data Explorer). It is stated that one-third of the food produced in the world for human 
consumption every year — approximately 1.3 billion tons — gets lost or wasted (UN reports). While in Qatar, 
around 3,002 tons of domestic waste is generated on a daily basis (ministry of development planning and 
statistics reports, in 2015). Aside from the social, economic, and moral implications of that waste—in a 
world where an estimated 805 million people go to bed hungry each night—the environmental implications 
of food waste to climate change is catastrophic. Thus, there is an urgent need to take appropriate actions to 
reduce food waste burden by adopting new combating practices. The benefits for the environment and 
agriculture are represented in protecting the quality of groundwater and reinstating the structure of soil after the 
natural soil. In addition, disposing food waste into the landfill can cause the organic matter to react with other 
materials and create toxic mixtures (Risse and faucette, 2006). Thus, recycling food waste to compost is 
preferred more. Moreover, composting food waste will reduce the volume of the disposed waste and the 
disposal cost (A Guide to Composting Yard & Food Waste, 2013). In addition, it has a big environmental 
benefit, which is the absence of synthetic chemical fertilizers in compost. Thus, with all the benefits that the 
compost we get when recycling food waste holds makes it healthier for human usage than the man-made 
compost sold in the market.

4.12 Prototype Construction  
 
Prototype construction is the last part of the product design process, because it helps engineers in testing 
theories and confirming performances to the specified PDS (i.e. product design specifications). In this project, 
various design iterations were done to come up with the finalized mechanical and electrical systems of the 
prototype. It is important to note that the prototype is scaled one to one which is shown in figure 21.

5. Conclusion  
All in all, this paper aim is to show the importance of recycling food waste and helping the environment by 
building a machine that converts food waste into compost. The machine is completely manufactured in Qatar. This 
food waste recycler machine is to be built and used at home safely. The design methodology and the engineering 
solutions that will be used in this project were explained in the engineering design process. Followed by the 
identifying the customers, knowing their needs and taking their feedbacks, which are considered important since our 
purpose is to satisfy the customer’s needs. Furthermore, a quality function deployment was used to translate 
customer needs into design specifications. In addition, the external and internal constraints and the design standards 
were identified. Moreover, the conceptual design for the machine, the design alternatives, alternatives evaluation, 
and the machine’s final design all were discussed briefly and shown in detail in this paper. Since the world is 
seeking sustainability, our machine aims to lessen the food waste that is thrown into the landfills, which pollute the 
environment by recycling the food waste and turning it, in less than 24 hours, to compost that can be used in 
fertilizing the soil to plant healthy and organic food, and contributing in creating a safe and sustainable world.

Abstract 
 
This project has been undertaken to define the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) and its applications to real 
transportation optimization. In this paper, the first part is dedicated to stating the Vehicle Routing 
Problem through a literature review. Then, the definition of the mathematical model used to evaluate 
Vehicle Routing Problems is provided. Different algorithms and software used to solve the Vehicle 
Routing Problem will be discovered through this project as well. At the end, the results obtained are 
interpreted from the optimization of a real case study of the Moroccan Company, VIR.

1. Introduction 
Mostly, supply chain operations chain back to customer satisfaction in terms of the quality of the service 
delivered (response time, product availability, price and quality…). Therefore the customer is perceived as a vital 
partner in the decision making process, making the company in a pressing and continuous need to optimize their 
operations and be able to pass on part of their profits to their customers for ultimately promoting a high level of 
customer satisfaction. Supply chain operations vary from sourcing, production, inventory and transport or 
distribution processes. Each of these involves expenses as time and costs that need to be optimized in order to 
ensure efficient and faster responses to customers that lead to an improved and a high level of quality service. In 
fact, the transport costs count for a high percentage of any company’s total expenses. Transportation cost 
represents different expenses a company incurs to move its products, personnel, inventory from one location to 
another. That is why huge resources and funds have been allocated to optimize transportation costs (Caplice 2006, 
Applegate 2011). In this context comes the Vehicle Routing Problem, which is one of the main issues in the field 
of distribution management. The Vehicle Routing Problem deals with finding an optimal set of routes for one or 
more vehicles under a predefined set of constrains (Hansen 1992). Numerous old (Hansen 1992) and even recent 
attempts (Erdogan 2017, Gayev 2017, Yao 2017) were conducted by researchers to solve the Vehicle Routing 
Problem and minimize transportation costs for companies using advanced algorithms like the improved artificial 
bee colony algorithm proposed by Yao et al. in 2017, showing that this is a subject that matters much for 
companies.  
 
In the first part, a literature review will be presented to define the Vehicle Routing Problem and realize where 
scholars have arrived trying to solve this problem. The Mathematical model, which is a linear programming one, 
will be defined as well to better understand the problem in terms of the objective function to minimize and different 
constrains to respect. The second part will be dealing with different algorithms to solve this optimization problem. 
There exists a variety of approaches to deal with the VRP. Therefore, I will be solving manually two algorithms 
which are most used to deal with optimization problems. At the end, the analysis of VIR Company will be presented 
incorporated with the results I was able to get. Recommendations, suggestions and future work will be the subject of 
the last part of this project.

 The use of vehicles with capacity of 30 or more. The payback period of this investment will remarkably be 
small since multiple shifts are being transported on a daily basis.  
 The use of vehicles with bigger capacity will help the company gain considerable time every day. This may 
contribute to the increase of production for VIR. Also, this decision will help the company minimize both 
risks and costs. 
 The use of optimal set of routes and vehicles with bigger capacity is directly linked to Green Logistics. The 
company should adopt this strategy to help reduce CO2 emissions and consequently decrease the risk of 
pollution and climate change.  
 Conclusion 
 
This work summarizes the models of the Vehicle Routing Problem. This logistics problem consists of 
finding an optimal set of routes for one or more vehicles visiting different locations.  
Working on this project, various obstacles were encountered mainly relatively to the technical aspect of the 
problem. Working with software like Matlab was limiting in terms of the luck of adaptability for inserting new 
constraints. OptiMap was limiting in terms of the number of stations allowed and also for insetting a variety of 
constraints. Therefore Excel was used to solve a large scope problem with using clustering and incorporating 
constraints relative to the capacity of the vehicles and also to time windows.

Abstract 
Construction industry has the multiplier effect cross the section in the country such as manufacturing, 
services and financial sector. The adoption of Industrialised Building System (IBS) has been 
introduced since 2008 with the main objective to reduce the dependency of foreign worker. The 
advantages of IBS in the construction industry are high quality, shorter construction period, less 
wastage at construction site and reduce the overall cost. However, the current procurement process for 
IBS project payment method is not suitable with IBS project progress which different from the 
traditional project payment method.  Thus, this study will propose the new payment method for IBS 
project using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) through the ranking of the development of new 
payment method’s criteria. There are four key criteria with sixteen sub-criteria in the development of
new payment method which are Initial Cost, Material, Drawing and Design Matters and Contract 
Document. This study is expected to help the IBS player to sustain in the construction sector 
especially for Small and Medium Enterprise (SME).

Abstract: This research aims to contribute to the development of a solution to the barriers that can create a 
direct and indirect impact of various forms of plant and equipment procurement in Kaduna state Tertiary 
Institutions in relation to, need assessment, delay in completion, costs and non-conformance with specification 
by suppliers and installation related issues, likewise the involvement of professionals in procurement activities. 
Questioner’s, interview, stakeholder’s information and procurements records were used to generate data to 
ascertain the present barriers so as to identify strengths and weaknesses of the organizations, results were 
analyzed using various statistical tools to establish the existence of these barriers. The knowledge of the 
existence of these barriers was used to provide a solution for future reoccurrences. 
Keywords Procurement, Equipment, Plant, lean, agile 
Introduction
The Tertiary Institutions in Nigeria is a place where Large sums of money and a lot of time are put into 
procurement. These among other aspects, because many plant and equipment procurements actually shape our 
Institutions and asist in the provision of quality research and graduates, this among other reasons why different 
stakeholders in procurement are interested in its success. Plant and equipment procurement throughout history 
have been overall mostly neglected in Nigeria, and this in combination with it being a conservative business 
generates few incentives of changing the way it is conducted today. It is, however, necessary to accept the fact 
that the market is constantly changing and the procurement need to take countermeasures in order to keep up. 
Creating a more flexible and adaptive way of proceeding with the planning and implementation phase may 
generate more communication between the different actors in a procurement. This would hopefully result in a 
more precise planning and implementation. It is cheaper and easier to make changes in the earliest stages of a 
procurement than after implementation. 
The evolution of lean and agile initiatives in the context of world and Nigeria in particular, and its importance to 
the society explains the need of the lean and agile procurement,performances and its expected role in providing 
advantages and opportunities to tertiary institutions .Ariff and Ahmed (2005) used a case study of a medium-
sized industry in Malaysia to present strategies to instill supplier capabilities and the support activities in 
creating a lean supply chain across multiple tiers of Small and Medium-sized Industries (SMIs). On the other 
hand, Christopher (2000) offered a distinction between the philosophies of  leanness and agility, apart from 
discussing the appropriate application of these agile ideas in supply chains. As a distinction to the mass 
production system (Womack et al., 2007), lean needed half the human effort, manufacturing space and capital 
investment (Lean Enterprise Institute, 2008), where strong partnerships with suppliers were essential (Liker, 
2004). Instead of learning new practices, trade barriers and other impediments were set up before it was realized 
that Toyota and their production system was the new guideline to follow for improved quality, productivity and 
flexibility (Womack et al., 2007).  
Along with Toyota’s success and the increasing awareness of lean, a global transformation was innitiated in
almost every industry to lean manufacturing and supply chain philosophy methods (Liker, 2004). Lean has 
successfully been applied in other industries than the automobile, such as the service industry, healthcare and 
government, and continues to evolve and spread (Bowen & Young dahl, 1998; Larsson, 2008). For instance 
Liker (2004) highlights that lean also efficiently can be applied in all business processes, including procurement. 
Additionally, supplier relationships are of high importance in lean for its success (Arnold & Chapman, 2004; 
Liker, 2004) and generally, the supplier plays a vital part in order to survive in the increasingly competitive 
market place (Bergdahl, 1996).

The regression analysis in table 3.0 shows that there is significant relationship between the measures adopted for 
plant procurement of equipment and the Value for Money. This is because the calculated p value of 0.000 is 
lower than the 0.05 alpha level of significance and the computed F value of 637.361   is higher than the 3.00 F 
critical value. The Model summary analysis showed that the relationship between the value for money and the 
independent variable (the measures adopted for plant procurement of equipment)   is very strong this is because 
the computed R value of 0. 816, the computed R square value of 0.738 and the Computed Adjusted R value of 
0.737 are all higher than the 0.838 standard R.  Therefore the null hypothesis which state that there is no

Abstract 
Truck driving is known as one of the occupations with the highest accident rate. Truck drivers have also 
shown to increase risk for developing musculoskeletal disorders. The risk for accident and 
musculoskeletal disorder were mostly attributed to factors such as human, vehicle, work conditions and 
other variables. Because of this, truck drivers face a variety of occupational risk.  This paper aims to 
develop a predictive model on the severity of musculoskeletal disorders and severity of accidents 
encountered by truck drivers in the Philippines. To analyze this problem, literature review, survey, 
ergonomic evaluation and statistical analyses were used to verify significance of each factors in the 
occupational risk of truck drivers. This paper had found that significant factors that affect the 
musculoskeletal disorder of truck drivers are age, BMI, blood pressure, travel duration, frequency of 
deployment and truck ban. On the other hand, significant factors that affect the severity of accident are 
work shift, type of truck driven, driver mood, type of roadway, road character and traffic condition. To 
further address the problem, health guidelines, traffic regulations and safety precautions were developed 
by the researchers in order to minimize the risk of musculoskeletal disorder and accidents of truck drivers 
in the Philippines.

1. Introduction
Land Transportation Office (LTO) statistical data shows that a total of 266, 915 trucks widely populate the entire 
country of the Philippines while a part from those are about 2.3 Million Filipinos employed as drivers, truckers and 
truck helpers dependent to the said industry. Workers in the trucking industry experienced the most fatalities of all 
occupations, accounting for 12% of all worker deaths. About two-thirds of fatally injured truckers were involved in 
highway crashes. Truck drivers also had more non-fatal injuries than workers in any other occupation. Half of the 
non-fatal injuries were serious sprains and strains that may be attributed to the fact that many truck drivers must 
unload the goods they transport (OSHA, 2016).  
There are several occupational risk factors that may affect the work performance of truck drivers that may lead to 
health issues. According to Copsey et al. (2011), road transport drivers are regularly exposed not only to the dangers 
of the road but to a broad range of hazards associated with both driving and non-driving tasks. One of these issues is

4 Conclusion 
The objectives of the study were all met with the use of tools and techniques relative to data gathering, analysis, and 
proposition of feasible solutions. Using a survey questionnaire, the researcher was able to gather information on the 
drivers’ personal profile, working condition, and details on accident involvement. With this, it helped the proponent 
to identify the risk factors present in logistics operations. With the use of Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort 
Questionnaire, it was found that upper back (21.55%), followed by right shoulder (14.37%), lower back (12.52%), 
and right upper arm (10.20%) are the body parts of the drivers that are most exposed to musculoskeletal disorders. It 
was also found that 79% of the respondents did not have any proper training since they have engaged in driving 
profession. Hence, many were not practicing proper seating adjustment that may lead to discomfort and potential 
accidents. Furthermore, there were two (2) types of trucks used in logistics operations: straight truck and trailer 
truck, although may have same design of the cockpit but have different sizes and load capacities. Also, most of the 
trucks used in logistics operations were acquired from auction dealers or private owners hence, the trucks are old 
and 75% are 15 years and above. 
 
Moreover, the number of drivers among the respondents who were involved in accident was also collected wherein 
49% were involved, in which 4% of the severity were fatal, and that 67% were due to human factors. Accident sub 
factors were also collected in order to determine the significant predictors of the accidents. 
 
With the use of ergonomic tools and techniques the researchers were able to determine the significant factors 
affecting the severity of musculoskeletal disorders and the severity of accidents.  The final RULA score for the 
driving posture of the respondents pose medium risk to MSD that led the researchers to recommend an ergonomic 
truck seat based on the technical and customer requirements and anthropometric measurements of truck drivers.   
 
 
Additionally, it was identified that personal factors, physical working condition factors, and vehicle factors appear to 
be good predictors to the severity of musculoskeletal disorders while vehicle factors and accident sub factors are 
significant to the severity of accidents. With the help of the Minitab software, it was determined that age, BMI 
(obesity), blood pressure, most frequent continuous travel, average frequency of deployment, and truck ban are 
significant factors affecting the severity of musculoskeletal disorders. 
 
Meanwhile, the work shift, type of truck, driver mood, type of roadway, road character, and traffic condition were 
found to be significant factors to the severity of accident.  
  
 
Since most of the drivers did not undergo proper training in driving profession, the researchers recommended that 
trucking companies must require their existing drivers and potential applicants to take the Driving (Articulated 
Vehicle) NC III offered by the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). With this, the 
drivers will be educated on restrictions codes, minor repairs on the assigned vehicle, and compliance with traffic 
rules/regulations and ordinances. 
 
Relative to the training and development of the drivers, this study also provides guidelines on traffic regulations and 
safety precautions to minimize the risk of getting involved in accidents. As per the predictive model, the identified 
significant factors to the severity of accidents are the type of roadway and road character. From this, the researchers 
collected information in order to serve as guide for the drivers. This include the maximum allowable speed limit 
depending on the type of roadway, proper overtaking and passing, right of way and signals, proper turning at 
intersections, and being aware of blind spot. 
 
By following these recommendations and guidelines, it is expected that the severity of musculoskeletal disorders as 
well as the severity of accidents will at least be minimized if not eliminated.  
 
From the computation of the sample values from the actual data and comparing the results to the recommended 
target results, the researchers were able to show that the severity of accident show that the fatality from 2.86 (Fatal) 
was reduced to 1.09 (Non-fatal) under the circumstances that the drivers travel at night, using a straight truck, with a 
relaxed mood, on a two-way lane and straight road, and when on a standstill or unmoving position. 
1388","Furthermore, the researchers have validated the effect of the recommended truck seat, seat accessories, and ideal 
seat angle adjustment. From the initial assessment with the final score of five (5) which indicates a “medium risk, 
further investigation, change soon” level of MSD risk, the final score yielded in the post assessment has reduced to 
two (2) which indicates an acceptable posture or a negligible risk and no action is required. 
 
Generally, the researchers therefore conclude that all of the objectives were satisfied with the help of appropriate 
tools despite the constraints on the conduct of this study.

Abstract 
The most recent of increasing beyond of quality product among the industry has encouraged the 
organization to adopt the criteria of sustainable product development that have an effect to 
organizational performance. The objectives of sustainable product to be developed are to satisfy 
a customer, achieve sustainability in business and finally to meet stakeholders demand of the 
industry. Therefore, adopting the criteria’s of sustainable product into new product development 
in industry is rarely present, especially in an automotive industry. This study to address the 
relationship between the criteria’s of sustainable product development and effect to an 
organizational performance. Thus, the outcome of this study contributes to the enhancement of 
criteria’s sustainable product development in the automotive industry and to other related 
industries. The causal relationship approach is adopted in this study by use sample random 
sampling among the 273 automotive suppliers in Malaysia. The analysis result use PLS SEM 
was revealed that the criteria’s of sustainable product development that consists of economic, 
social and environment are contributing significant positive effect to an organizational 
performance in automotive industry.

Abstract 
In workplaces that are not well organized, a cluttered environment with a lot of items piling around creates confusion 
and time delay to execute a work. Valuable space is occupied by items that are either useless or used less. Employees 
struggle to locate files/documents when required. Loose, sagging electrical cables lead to unsafe environment. Work 
places are found unclean and not conducive to work effectively. The objective of this article is to examine the impact 
of the techniques of 5S concepts and its implementation in educational institutions. This work includes five phases 
namely: Sorting, Set in order, Shine, Standardize and Sustain.. This working model created a conducive environment 
in the institution which resulted in effective utilization of space and time. This also resulted in a conducive work place, 
which gives motivation for the stake holders. This enables to attain total organizational cleanliness in alignment with 
Swachh Bharat Mission (Clean India Mission) initiative of Prime Minister of India. 5S implementation helps the 
institution to improve the effectiveness of all the processes involved and improve the overall quality of service in such 
a way that we can meet the requirements of all the stakeholders. Hindustan Institute of Technology & Science is the 
first educational institution to have obtained the Global Certification for 5S Implementation in India from TuV 
Rheinland. 5S implementation is done based on the present strength and commitment of students and staff which are 
very dynamic. Hence challenges are more in sustenance and we hope to overcome this by making 5S practices as a 
habit through intense training.

1. Introduction 
 
5S is a method to organize the workplace. This technique originated from Japan. Two major frameworks have arisen for 
understanding and applying 5S to business environments, one was proposed by Hirano and the other by Osada.[1][2]. 5S is the 
acronym for five Japanese words Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seikitshu and Shitshuke, which mean that Sort, Set in order, Shine, 
Standardize and Sustain respectively. 5S is a continual improvement process which eliminates waste, maintains orderliness and 
cleanliness. 5S practice is a technique used to establish and maintain quality environment in an organization for improving the 
effectiveness and the morale of employees [3]. 
 
These systems have been widely adopted in all engineering industries like automobile manufacturers. 5S is a proven concept to 
improve Quality, Safety and Productivity. Effective participation of all stake holders is a key factor in 5S implementation. Zhang 
et al.[4] explained about the experiences of 5S implementation in the laboratories of educational institutions and reported that there 
was effective utilization of space in the respective areas and saved a considerable of amount of time.

6. Conclusions 
Creating awareness and training of all stake holders is a critical step in 5S implementation. All stakeholders 
Management, Staff, Students, service agencies have equal participation and contribution to make the system efficient 
and effective. The outcome of 5S implementation has created a clean and orderly environment. Self- discipline of 
Staff and students have improved considerably. Hindustan Institute of Technology & Science is the first educational 
institution in India to receive global certification from TuV Rheinland for 5S implementation. This has inspired the 
minds of all Management staff, Faculty members and Students to excel in a clean, safe and thought- nurturing 
environment. In future various non -value added activities in the system shall be identified for necessary corrective 
actions. Also, the monitoring of time management for various activities shall be made which can improve the overall 
efficiency further.

Abstract:  
Collaborative planning is an international practice that encourages the integration of companies 
in supply chains. The objective of this article is to systematize a strategic model of collaborative 
planning among the actors of the supply chains to improve their competitiveness in Ecuador, 
Mexico and Cuba. It is validated this proposal in five cases applied to agrifood chains (tomato 
puree chain and milk in Cuba, orange juice chain in Mexico, milk chain, Ilex guayusa and panela 
in Ecuador) because it is what prevails in these countries. The main results are focused on the 
low integration of these study chains, although not all of them are manifested in the same way.

training of human potential. Like Hill's studies, Zhang et al. (2018), related to the technique of 
collaborative planning, forecasting and collaborative replenishment, and adds elements of 
structural equations. This last element is the follow-up of this investigation. 
5. Conclusions 
A model of collaborative strategic planning in the supply chain, as well as its validation in two 
real cases of supply chains (Ecuador, Cuba and Mexico) is proposed. All cases belong to the 
food industry. The relevance of this question, whose solution is managed in this article, is 
confirmed with the development of SCSPCM and its application in supply chains under study. 
The theoretical proposal shows the supply chains in collaborative planning relevance and the 
contributes to the adoption of best practices worldwide what represents a significant conceptual, 
theoretical and practical reference.  
The existing models analysis in collaborative planning literature reveals the absence of a 
strategic level model. Collaborative planning variables, at the strategic level, in the supply chain 
that contribute to the supply chain competitiveness, in terms of providing a high service level to 
end customers are synthesized. This article has social value, contributing to improve the supply 
chain competitiveness.  
The results of applying the model to the different cases in studies show their validity. The model 
demonstrates its applicability in different planning environments like Ecuador, Cuba and Mexico 
and demonstrates its ability to improve competitiveness in all cases.

Abstract 
Better quality products capture larger market shares and yield higher profits.  However, 
improving product quality takes time, during which a competitor may develop and 
introduce a product to usurp a market share, leaving a smaller market for the laggard firm.  
Competing firms must balance these two effects in determining their strategies of new 
product development of quality and timing of its introduction.   
We model this innovation competition as a stochastic game between two firms and 
characterize their equilibrium strategies.  We show that in equilibrium, each firm will set a 
target quality that it aims to develop before introducing the product into the market.  The 
technologically stronger firm is shown to set a higher target quality and capture a larger 
market share than the weaker firm.  Competition to be the first is shown to induce both 
firms to set lower targets and introduce inferior products sooner than they would without 
competition.  However, the consumers are shown to be better off with competition than 
with a weak monopolist.  A strong monopolist is shown to yield an even better outcome 
for the consumers, which is in fact shown to be socially optimal.  Finally, this socially 
optimal outcome is also attainable with competition among equally strong firms, and is in 
fact attained at a pace faster than that with a monopolist.  Thus, competitive innovation 
among competitors of equal strengths is shown to be the best industrial structure for the 
society.

Abstract 
 
Much of the success of an organization is focused on making decisions in its operations function. 
Managing properly the men and machines that intervene in their transformation processes, becomes a real 
challenge in order to increase effectiveness. For this, the optimization based on discrete event simulation 
constitutes a tool of great potential by its capacity to minimize errors in decision making. The present 
work was proposed to demonstrate the strengths of these tools as support on decision making, for 
optimize the assignment of these resources in the productive processes with certain level of complexity 
and that guarantee a good performance of the system. For that, the Flexsim software was applied as 
discrete event simulator. The results are presented with the application to a case study related to a 
company producing socks and belonging to the textile sector of Imbabura province, Ecuador. The men 
and machines assignment is made by each of the sections and subsections that make up the limiting point 
of the production process, adjusted to the amounts determined in the Master Production Schedule for each 
type of socks, ensuring minimal total cost and good performance of the principal metrics in that operation.

1. Introduction 
 
The advance of programming languages and commercial softwares have made simulation one of the most used 
techniques in Operations Research and Administration Sciences. Examples of this are its applications in inventory 
management (Goodsell & Kley, 2000), in the analysis and improvement of the supply chain (Chan, Tang, Lau, & Ip, 
2002), in the analysis and validation of performance measures in manufacturing systems (O'Kane, 2004) and in 
applications of improvements through Six Sigma deployments (Mahanti & Antony, 2005), just to mention some of 
them. As a descriptive tool for Operations Research, it demonstrates its usefulness in the process of analyzing and 
designing complex systems in view of the need to study them to increase the understanding of the relationships 
between the various components, or to predict performance under new operating conditions (Law & Kelton, 2000). 
Another area of application is in production systems, among other reasons, because simulation proves to be useful in

Of the solutions analyzed, solution 92 stood out with relative better results, with an average utilization of 73.25% 
and 73.45% for threaders and turners, respectively. In addition, with a machines utilization of 86.84%, determined 
by a 4.70% (5.78 hours) of breakdowns (B variable) and an 8.46% (10.41 hours) of waiting for the threaders to 
attend said breakdowns (WOM variable). 
Other causes that affected performance; and therefore, the movement continuity of the items, were the waits for the 
turners, whether for the hauling of the stockings (WO variable), or for the transportation of the dozens throughout 
the entire operation (WT variable), with 5.42% (6.67 hours) and 5.94% (7.31 hours), respectively. In addition, for 
this solution, the production plan was met above 95% and 100% was reached in most cases. 
 
4. Discussion 
 
The decrease in the quantities to be produced from one week to another conditioned the measures to be taken in the 
assignment of resources. The following measures were suggested to move from to week PWS (l-1) to the week 
analyzed (l): 
 Implement solution 92 for having achieved lower total cost and higher compliance of the plan and 
throughput. In addition, it achieved better results in the use of human resources and machines. 
 Maintain the same number of workers with respect to PWS, both for threaders and for turners, with the 
exception of relocating a turner from (d,1) to (c,1). 
 Control the use of the workers in those subsections with the worst results (threaders in (e, 2) and (c, 1) and 
turners in (e, 1) and (d, 1)), which can collaborate in the work with the subsections a and b or with other areas 
of the factory. 
 Decrease the quantities of machines destined to the productions of the different types of items, that is, 
preserve them transiently and according to the results obtained in table 4.

In this work, the optimization, based on the simulation of discrete events, is integrated with the assignment of human 
resources and machines in the productive systems, which demonstrates the potential of these tool in decision 
making. When applying the logic of the model, together with its programmed functionalities, it is evident the obtain 
of a feasible Production Master Plan and adjusted to the existing resources in the operation of bottleneck, which is 
executed at a minimum total cost, with high levels of compliance with the plan and with a good use of the 
production factors available. In addition, this logic allows identifying the best scenarios in which workers must be 
assigned to each of the sections and subsections of work, as well as, the machines assignment for each type of sock 
to produce. 
The solution 92 is selected as the best alternative for the planned week with a minimum total cost of $ 34941.52, a 
plan compliance of 99.48% and a throughput of 1.52 dozen/minute; accompanied by uses of 73.25%, 73.45% and 
86.84% for threaders, turners and machines, respectively.

Abstract  
 
The Waste of Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) presents major growth than urban 
solid waste reverberating on impacts for environment and human health care. Due to 
development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) the Higher Education 
Institutions (HIE) have adopted measures to correctly manage WEEE, as HIE contribute to 
growth of WEEE by replacing and/or disposing equipment to strengthen and satisfy institutional 
operations. The objective of this article is to propose an institutional framework related to 
Reverse Logistics (RL). The Study of Times and Value Stream Mapping was conducted establish 
the connection of agents involved in the management. Results show the potential in HIE to 
fortify management activities through RL obtaining economics and environmental benefits.

Abstract 
 
Nowadays, Enterprise Resource Planning systems are the framework of management of all businesses 
regardless of company size. ERP systems have evolved to be as crucial as water that keeps living 
possible. ERP systems has been defined as a common framework of data register that keeps records of 
user defined actions in the purpose of proper planning, monitoring, and controlling business processes. 
The system uses a common deployment schema across all ERP applets that feed into same database to 
eliminate duplications, and seamlessly retrieve data to be used for their intended purpose. The drawbacks 
of common ERP systems is that the collection of data is a time consuming activity where usually collects 
more information than what is needed, hence, they work as waste data, and consume digital space. 
Another drawback of the ERP systems is that the developers have worked to deploy applications to an 
extent where it is useful or applicable to the perspective of the developer with minimized interference 
with the end user; this ends up as having the end user to use functions, or use processes that do not seem 
optimally applicable to their business needs. This research works on designing framework for 
development of lean based ERP system that is oriented to optimized business processes, storage uses, 
aligned with business and individuals’ goals, and optimally uses the architecture of database management 
systems to eliminate waste data collection. The research outputs consist of standardized checklists, 
process flow models, and standardized lean ERP architecture.

Abstract 
 
Background – Outpatient services in oncology wards have become a central point in cancer patients’ 
treatment, who may experience long waiting times from the moment they enter the hospital until the end of 
the day treatment. 
Objective – The aim of this research paper is to assess the treatment process (activities and actors) of an 
outpatient service in order to improve the patient flow.  
Method – The study was conducted in the outpatient service of an oncology hospital to identify all elements 
relative to the patient flow process. Data was extracted and structured following problem structuring 
methods through interviews and observations. First, the decision context was assessed through the 
development of a cross-functional diagram. Then, a value stream mapping was developed, based on lean 
technics, to identify wastes and bottlenecks in the different treatment activities. 
Results – The first part of the analysis presents and links the five steps of the treatment process (check-in, 
doctor’s appointment, treatment prescription, pre-treatment and treatment) with the four medical actors 
(receptionists, doctors, pharmacists and nurses). Different care pathways were identified. Then, value 
stream mapping shows how each activity influences the treatment process and thus impacts patient waiting 
time.  
Conclusion – The application of problem structuring methods in conjunction with lean management can 
improve the patient flow in outpatient services. Results of this study will be used for future work on decision 
making analysis.

Abstract  
A flexible manufacturing cell (FMC) is studied in this paper under operation of machine failures and repairs 
in a situation of stochastic model. Three machines served by a robot for loading and unloading purposes, 
and a pallet handling system is used in FMC. The model is developed using ARENA software to estimate 
system performance measures. The simulation model validated with available exact solutions for the 
selected cell operations. The model utilized to analyze the FMC performance such as production rate, time 
in system for pallet and utilization of the system components under equipment failures and repairs. The 
simulation results show that FMC performance measures are sensitive to robot speeds, machining rates, 
pallet rates and pallet capacity. Finally, conclusions are presented and future works are discussed

1. Introduction 
A flexible manufacturing cell (FMC) consists of more than one machine served by a robot for loading and unloading 
of parts, and an automated material handling system. FMS have more revolutionary than transfer line, growing 
customer demand for quick delivery. In general, the flexibility of FMCs can lead to benefits such as adapted to these 
changes, increased productivity, reduced inventory, reduced production cost and improved quality.  
 
(Sabuncuoglu and Hommertzheim 1989) and (Cogun and Savsar 1996) considered stochastic and simulation models 
for evaluating the performance of FMC with respect to system configuration and component speeds, such as machining 
rate robot and pallet speeds. The study of (Simeu-Abazi et al. 1997) uses decomposition and iterative analysis of 
Markov chains to obtain numerical solutions for reliability and dependability of manufacturing systems. (Adamyan 
and He 2002) presented a methodology to identify the sequences of failures and probability of their occurrences in an 
automated manufacturing system. They used Petri nets and reachability trees to develop a model for sequential failure 
analysis in manufacturing systems. The study of (Abdulmalek et al. 2004) presents a simulation model and analysis 
for tool change policies in an FMC with two machines and a robot based on ARENA simulation software by (Kelton 
et al. 2002) which allows flexibility in modeling manufacturing systems. The work of (Al-Titinchi and Al-Aubidy 
2004) addresses an interactive hierarchical model based on colored Petri net (CPN) for general flexible Manufacturing 
system (FMS) Scheduler. (Srinoi et al. 2002) introduced scheduling model based on a fuzzy logic for the scheduling 
of a flexible manufacturing cell (FMC) with three different parts.  
 
(Savsar 2004) introduced simulation models based on the SIMAN language for the flexible manufacturing cell with 
three different parts, which is operated under a variety of time between failure distributions and different operational 
conditions. (Kost and Zdanowicz 2005) presented the modeling process of a cell flexible system with the application 
of Petri network theory, involving the identification, modeling and simulation of the operation of flexible robotized 
manufacturing systems. (Savsar and Aldaihani 2008) studied performance of FMC that consists of two machines, 
served by a robot under different parametric conditions and equipment failures and repairs.  They used Markov 
processes and determined closed-form solutions for the probabilities of system states that are used to compute system 
performance measures. (Maheshwari et al. 2010) introduced a mathematical model for unreliable flexible 
manufacturing cell (FMC), which is operated under stochastic environment and produces a variety of parts, for two 
machines that served by one robot and a pallet handling system. These performance measures are machine utilization, 
robot utilization, pallet handling system utilization and production rate.

Abstract 
Profile monitoring is usually performed by establishing control charts. In most of the cases, the in-control 
values of the profile parameters are assumed to be known in Phase II, whereas it is not valid in many 
practical situations. In this article, we investigate the effect of parameters estimation from in-control 
Phase I samples on the in-control and out-of-control performance of two Phase II control charts for 
monitoring multivariate multiple linear profiles designated as 
 and 
. The out-of-
control performance of the methods is evaluated by using corrected limits to consider the variability due 
to parameters estimation. The performance of the monitoring approaches is compared in terms of 
statistical properties of ARL distribution including AARL, SDARL and CVARL in order to consider 
practitioner-to-practitioner variability trough a Monte Carlo simulation algorithm named as ARLS. The 
results showed that parameters estimation severely effects on the performance of the monitoring schemes.

1. Introduction 
In some applications, the quality of a product or process needs to be explained through a relationship between a 
response variable and one or several explanatory variables, which is named as “profile”. Profiles are categorized 
based on the structure of this relationship, i.e. simple linear, multivariate linear, multiple linear and non-linear 
profiles which are more complicated.  
Profile monitoring is commonly performed in two phases: Phase I and Phase II. The methods of profile monitoring 
in Phase I and Phase II are usually different. In Phase I, the main goals are monitoring the process stability over time 
and estimating the process parameters through in-control data set; whereas in Phase II, we are intended to detect the 
shifts in parameters, quickly. Furthermore, different metrics are implemented for evaluating the in-control and out-
of-control performance of the profile monitoring approaches in Phase I and Phase II including probability of an out-
of control signal and Average run length (ARL). Many researchers have studied on the simple linear profile

As we can see, 
 and 
 methods have smaller values of SDARL compared to other 
competing methods. However, in small shifts, the performance of 
 method is better than 
 method. Furthermore, LRT method performs uniformly better than 
 method. The 
noteworthy point is that despite of the worst performance of LRT method in terms of AARL and SDARL, this method 
has the best CVARL performance among all competing methods. This point can potentially affects choosing the 
superior method when the process monitoring is performed based on the estimated parameters. 
 
6. Conclusion remarks and future study suggestions 
In this study, we evaluated the performance of two Phase II control charts for monitoring multivariate multiple 
linear profiles: 
 and 
 control charts proposed by Eyvazian et al. (2011) when parameters are 
estimated. Three different criteria: AARL, SDARL and CVARL are applied to compare the in-control and out-of-
control performance of monitoring approaches by a new Monte Carlo simulation algorithm named as ARLS. The 
results showed the significant impact of parameters estimation on the both in-control and out-of-control performance 
of the monitoring approaches. The simulation study illustrated that the number of Phase I samples should be as large 
as possible in order to achieve an accurate estimation. 
 According to the results, 
 method performs better than other MEWMA method in terms of in-control 
AARL and CVARL. This method also performs better than MEWMA method in terms of SDARL metric except in 
small shifts. 
The out-of-control performance of each method was evaluated using ARLS algorithm in terms of all three metrics. 
The results showed that 
 method is the best method in detecting shifts in regression coefficients in terms 
of out-of-control AARL, SDARL and also CVARL metric. 
It can be concluded that the 
 method that is the extension of MEWMA method is better than its 
classical version in about all the cases based on estimated parameters 
As future researches, we recommend evaluating the effect of parameters estimation on the performance of the 
control charts for monitoring other types of profile such as: polynomial and nonlinear profile. Furthermore, 
proposing new metric for measuring estimation effect can be remarkable.

Abstract 
 
This paper explores the dynamic process of change and change management. While change is about 
moving to a future state, change management is the process of supporting individual employees impacted 
by the change through their own transitions. The study aimed to investigate the causes of continuous 
resistance to change towards the implementation of a centralized HR Support Services from business 
units of a multinational mining house, Company X (pseudonym) with operations in Southern Africa. The 
study used both quantitative and qualitative research methods using survey questionnaires and semi 
structured interviews for data collection to explore different experiences of key employees and 
management of the mining company and industry as a whole. This study found that poor communication, 
poor leadership, and poor change management result in resistance to change. Some key recommendations 
put forward for Company X leadership are to produce a change management framework specific for each 
business unit concerned, including feedback sessions, and the need to have a communication plan about 
the need for change and its benefits to be used to persuade employees to accept the change programme. 
This research contributes significantly to thought leadership on the issues of change and change 
management in the South African mining industry.

David (2001:254) stated that resistance to change can be considered the single highest threat to effective and 
successful strategy implementation in an organisation. The business environment especially, is prone to constant 
change due to various external factors that influence the way companies operate in order to remain competitive. The 
management of any change initiative can be sometimes overwhelming for management and employees alike, and 
can result in resistance to the changes. As much as change is necessary and inevitable, it is complex, hence 
managing resistance to change is fundamental for any organisation. CIPD (2015) agrees that change management 
matters because, though change is taking place at an ever-increasing pace, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that 
most change initiatives fail. Research by CIPD has established that less than 60% of re-organisations met their 
identified objectives which are generally bottom line improvement; and this has been consistent with other published 
research (CIPD, 2015). 
Mining is a cyclical complex industry, with various chains of operations strongly influenced by external factors, and 
the attraction and retention of skilled workforce. Recruitment in this sector is challenging due to the shortage of 
skills in certain disciplines, and the attraction of skills to undesirable working conditions. A global mining house,

Figure 11. Future with Company X 
 
As depicted in Figure 11 above, an overwhelming 72.73% of the survey respondents stated that they were still at 
Company X as they considered it to be a good company to work for, whilst 22.73% were willing to stay and adapt to 
the changes. Only 4.55% were unhappy and on the job market. As much as there was some unhappiness and 
resistance from employees, most of them still found Company X to be a good company to work for. Reasons 
provided were the developmental opportunities and financial well-being of the company despite the current mining 
economic challenges and cyclical nature of the industry. This would suggest the financial and development rewards 
of Company X to be possible employee retention factors despite the continuous resistance shown and experienced.    
 
5. Conclusion 
This research has provided valuable insight on the importance of organisations being ready for change in order to 
implement change successfully. The findings suggest that change planning processes and systems were not 
adequately in place or implemented which led to discontent amongst employees at company X. Popular theory states 
that employees as well as the structure of the organisation must be ready for change. Majority of the respondents felt 
that more rigorous change planning and deeper stakeholder engagement could have prevented some of the 
challenges experienced at Company X. The current socio economic climate is increasingly unstable for company X. 
From reform in the global mining sector to issues of social risk in the South African labour market, the company 
should take this opportunity to learn, reflect and improve ways of working through localised solutions and 
meaningful engagement with staff teams. The conclusions to this research have been summarised around the 
research questions of the study which are directly aligned to the objectives. 
 
5.1 What are the perceptions of employees towards effective change management at Company X? 
There was disengagement in perception and misunderstanding of the change that was identified as being prevalent at 
both BUs. The difference in perception of top management and employees towards effective change brought about 
lack of alignment, wrong perception of the change to be implemented, resulting in a low sense of urgency for 
employees at Company X. A disconnection between top management and employees’ perception is present in that 
management is of the view that the change was warranted based on thorough analysis of their BUs in SA. 
Management stance was that blue chip companies had to follow predominant industry practices that have success 
records once implemented. Management is able to see the positive changes that the new HR model brings, such as 
better policies, better control systems; better employee engagement, and cost reductions. However, although workers 
attest to the HR model being efficient, they have negative perceptions on its implementation process. 
 
5.2 What are the root causes of the continuous resistance to the implementation of a centralized HR 
Support Service at Company X BUs? 
Parochial self-interest, possibility of jobs becoming obsolete, fear of job losses, and a preference to continue with 
previous ways of working so as not to lose control were identified as some causes and barriers to change within the 
BUs. Lack of effective leadership in change management was instrumental in the resistance to change; there was 
disengagement in the views of top management and those of the managers and employees at the operational level 
that have to work with the new HR model. The lack of efficient change agent was also identified as a possible cause 
to the continuous resistance to change as there was not sufficient interaction and engagement with the affected 
employees. Critical decisions about change were made without their input nor consultation. Employees at Company 
X shared the desire to have experienced a more personal and transparent leadership style. Lack of employee 
involvement in the decision making processes can lead to employees not assuming ownership, lack of commitment, 
manifesting in work stoppage, high turnover, or absenteeism. The findings show a lack of trust amongst employees 
and top management and this hampered relationship building during the change implementation process.

5.3 How has the culture at company X contributed to resistance to change? 
Lack of cultural sensitivity was a contribution to the resistance to change and is a factor that needs to be taken into 
consideration.  Culture sensitivity is critical during change implementation as identified at Company X, especially 
for a multinational organisation operating with a diversity of race, religions, cultures, and languages such as that of 
Company X. The global culture of Company X should not have dominated the cultures of the BUs; but the change 
agents should have made it a priority to understand the cultural differences and be more cultural sensitive in 
communicating the change. An approach used in one location may not be ideal in another. For a multi-national 
company, the cultural context of different BUs should be recognized and respected. For example, in South Africa, 
hierarchy is deeply engrained in work culture, hence the resistance shown when ‘cultural protocols’ are ignored. 
 
5.4 How has leadership contributed to the resistance during process of change within Company X? 
The use and/or abuse of power was one poignant aspect which may have prevented a successful change management 
initiative at the BUs. Ritualisation of change, due to the continuous change programmes that had been introduced are 
no longer seen as much meaningful by employees; and the ivory tower change pitfalls, which is characterised by 
change driven by senior agents were all present. Lastly, for employees in managerial positions, the loss of control 
and humiliation felt contributed to the resistance. The research findings suggest a transformational type of 
leadership, transparency and support could have helped ease resistance at Company X.  
 
5.5 How effective was communication during the process of change at company X? 
The lack of transparency and consistency in communication brought about some challenges for Company X during 
the change management process that resulted in resistance. Lack of consistent feedback may have fuelled the 
resistance. Feedback should be provided consistently to improve the quality of information disseminated and the 
manner in which the information is delivered. As described by respondents, a one-way communication is an 
ineffective way to work in an organisation and especially during change.  
 
5. RECOMMENDATIONS 
The current socio economic climate is increasingly unstable for company X. From reform in the global mining 
sector to issues of social risk in the South African labour market, the company should take this opportunity to learn 
and reflect and improve ways of working through localised solutions and meaningful engagement with staff teams. 
Light has been shone on this increasingly relevant topic and will contribute to further research studies on change 
management in South Africa and beyond. The recommendations put forward are listed below: 
 
Company X needs to produce a change management framework specific for each business unit concerned, 
including feedback sessions, and recommendations to management 
 
A communication plan about the need for change and its benefits can be used to persuade employees to 
accept the change programme. 
 
Townhall meetings should be held to increase participation and involvement – improved communication at 
all stages, transparency and shared involvement in the implementation of change.  
 
Facilitation and support should be provided to employees to reassure those affected by the change. 
 
This research report should be made available within the mining sector to improve the sharing of change 
management best practice. 
 
Company X should review its change management processes at least yearly so as to capture the effect of 
the changes in the organisation and its impact on the diverse workforce

Abstract 
The implementation of Value Added Tax (VAT) in Saudi Arabia took affect at the beginning of 2018, 
at a rate of 5% added on to all products and services inclusive of the housing sector. This action is an 
attempt to reform the existing tax revenues system with the aim to generate sufficient funds required 
for public expenditure projects. A consideration towards adding various economic factors such as 
depreciation to the tax revenues system could complement the process with tangible outcomes. Steering 
the directive actions to satisfy a larger segment of citizens in need to own property for self-use. The 
objective of this paper is to reflect on the potential positive impact of depreciation for mortgage buyers, 
on the total house unit cost, once added to a house. Where the value of land increases over time, the 
value of the house standing on it, depreciates over time reducing the overall house unit cost for mortgage 
buyers by 18 percent. Decreasing the minimum monthly salary criteria of customer segments complying 
with the debt burden ratio from the salary bracket of 22,000 Saudi Riyal or 5860 U.S. Dollars down to 
a lower monthly salary bracket of 18,605 Saudi Riyal or 4961 U.S. Dollars.

1. Introduction
Eltony (2002) identified a wide gap between the actual GCC tax revenue and the potential GCC tax revenue with 
great potential for higher tax revenue collection through the introduction of rigorous tax reform programs. Eltony 
(2002) found that despite the increasing efforts for a better tax index trend almost all the GCC tax revenue is lower 
than the potential, especially in UAE, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The results found to be not uniform across 
the GCC as Oman and Bahrain’s tax effort indices shown a relatively stable performance over a six-year period 
slightly above the unity tax index particularly in the year 2000. However, the GCC budget deficit can be reduced 
by the introduction of tax reforms that could increase tax revenues. The GCC conclusive initiative towards 
reforming the tax revenues system took effect on January 2018 with the implementation of the VAT across all 
members' states. As with any newly implemented reforms, the process for refining essential factors is an ongoing 
one with the objective to better adapt the various tax systems with the respective business sectors, creating a 
balance between the collection of tax revenues required for public expenditure projects and a steady market growth 
across all business sectors of the economy. Currently in the Saudi Arabia housing sector , only 20 percent of the 
targeted citizens earn an adequate monthly salary that would enable them to purchase a piece of land with the aid 
of a credit facility from a bank (Dorchester, 2014). Oil price volatility has a major impact on the Saudi Arabian 
economic growth. Where for the year 2016 for example, the annual citizen income was 20,484 U.S. Dollars (Al-
Sasi et al 2017), an amount that would enable a potential customer to obtain a credit facility from a bank in form 
of a mortgage at a maximum loan amount of 102,420 U.S. Dollars which is below the minimum market price for 
a house unit. The Debt Burden Ratio (DBR) is the ratio of total monthly installment such as payable loan 
instalments and outstanding payable credit card limit or any other committed monthly repayments to the total 
income of an individual. The current DBR for borrowers intending to purchase a house with the aid of a mortgage 
credit facility is fixed to a maximum monthly installment rate equivalent to 50 percent deductible from the bank 
account deposited monthly salary. A piece of land and a building constructed on it are real property (White et al, 
2012). Whereas the building on the land is depreciable, the land itself is not (Department of the Treasury, 1996).

5. Conclusion
As with any newly implemented reform, refining essential factors is an ongoing process that has the objective to 
better adapt the various tax systems with the respective business sectors, creating a balance between the tax 
revenue collections required for public expenditure projects and a steady market growth across all business sectors 
of the economy. The placement of the depreciation factor into perspective complements the main objective 
targeting tax revenue increase, in addition to the improvement of the housing business sector, reducing constraints 
that would increase the range of targeted citizens, who are seeking to own a house for personal use by 18 percent.

Abstract 
 
Open innovation is a paradigm proposing that companies can benefit from using external pathways 
and knowledge and that firms should cross their boundaries in the product development and 
innovation management. Since several firms have gained success from practicing open innovation, the 
paradigm has received high attention from the academia and businesses.  However, in spite of the 
service sector’s high economic contributions, open innovation in the sector is still under-researched. 
This study focuses on open innovation stages in the service sector and identifies the important 
processes and barriers in each stage. The results include four stages of open innovation 
implementation and insights on processes including process selection, partner selection, goal setting 
and influential factor control. The information used in this study came from the interviews with 
service companies in Thailand from three industries, which include financial intermediation, 
telecommunications and knowledge-intensive industries. The study closes the gap in the academic 
area as well as provides managerial insights and guidelines for service companies to adopt open 
innovation more effectively.

1. Introduction 
 
Open innovation refers to a paradigm proposing that firms should go beyond their boundaries in product 
development. Ideas do not always have to be initiated or developed within the companies. In other words, 
companies should combine external knowledge with the internal knowledge pool or take the internal ideas to 
develop outside in their innovation management. To practice open innovation, firms need to have a business 
model that integrates the external and internal knowledge to create value and to capture that value. (H. W. 
Chesbrough, 2003) 
Studies on open innovation were commonly focused only on the manufacturing sector. However, no study 
particularly emphasizes on how service companies implement open innovation although the service sector 
generate the highest contribution towards the economy in today’s industrialized world. Even though there is 
evidence that service companies have adopted open innovation, the insights on the implementation process has 
not been sufficiently known and documented.(Mention, 2011; Mention & Asikainen, 2012; Patrick Schueffel1, 
2015) Therefore, because of the rising importance of the service sector, it is worthwhile to explore the stages in 
open innovation implementation in service firms. 
This study aims to answer the questions: what are the stages in open innovation implementation in the service 
sector and what are the important processes and barriers in each stage? The stages were determined to 
understand the steps firms have to go through in the open innovation implementation. Identifying the important 
processes provides the firms with the guidelines on how to implement open innovation effectively. Furthermore, 
by knowing the barriers, firms could be aware of the challenges they might face and prepare some mitigation

open innovation. The clear understanding of these aspects can be generated by having sufficient communication 
within and between teams. By doing so, managers can ensure that the negative feelings towards partnering team 
are reduced and willingness to transfer knowledge is created.  
Lastly, managers need to ensure that the firms have a dynamic environment that supports flexibility. The 
management style has to support open innovation by encouraging staff to be innovative and have an appropriate 
mindset. The staff are allowed to make mistake and learn from them. They can present ideas and successful 
achievers are rewarded. Workshops or activities need to be regularly held to encourage staff to be openminded 
and have the appropriate skills.  However, achieving appropriate company culture and environment is a long-
term process which requires time to be met. Therefore, the management needs to be up-to-date to technological 
advancement in order to equip their staff in time.   
5.3. Limitations 
Limitations in this study include the followings. Firstly, the interview participants only include companies in 
Thailand. Therefore, the findings may be influenced by national factors. Secondly, the companies selected might 
not be accurate representatives of the industries and, therefore, limit the results. Third reason is the study 
approach as the interviewees might just give partial answer.  
5.4. Future work 
Firstly, since the data was gained from companies in Thailand, similar study can be done by interviewing firms 
in other countries. Secondly, study can be done in the knowledge transfer process as companies reported to have 
challenges in implementing this process. Additionally, similar study can be done on other industries since this 
study only focuses on only one category of the service sector.

Abstract
Discharge times, tD, of sub-micron ultrafine and micron-size superfine powders from a circulating 
fluidized bed (CFB) with the cyclone upside stream were investigated using a Geldart A-C mixture of 
ultrafine and superfine Al(OH)3 powders and coarse FCC particles.  tD which refers to the time needed for 
complete depletion of the fine powders contents from the fluidizing system.
Variation of discharge times of ultrafines and superfines with the equilibrium water content of FCC 
particles was investigated at a 5 wt% maximum loading of ultrafines and superfines. The superfines
discharge times decreased noticeably using bed particles humidified with gas of higher (larger than 50%) 
relative humidity. Bed particles humidified using lower (35%) relative humidity showed very high 
discharge times at higher contents of fines. Relatively larger discharge times of the cohesive ultrafines 
were measured compared with those of the less cohesive superfines.
Key words: circulating fluidized bed; discharge times; equilibrium water content; ultrafine 
powders, superfine powders  
1. Introduction
Practical applications of Geldart-C powders (Geldart, 1973) are increasing widely due to their 
extreme specific surface area per unit volume. It is concluded that fine powders, <10µm, have 
strong adhesion and cohesion characteristics (Jacques, 2002). Motion of superfine powders of 
few microns and sub-micron ultrafine powders in fluids is rather difficult due to poor aeration 
(Bruni et al., 2007). They tend to form bridges, adhere to surfaces, form agglomerate, clumps and 
solid aggregates when flowing (Wang & Kwauk, 1998). However, cohesive fine powders still
exist in fluidized beds as individually dispersed particles. 
Extensive studies have been made on the cohesive forces and other various forces affecting 
fluidizing systems in presence of fine powders. Factors affecting formation of agglomerates, 
clumps and solid aggregates, such as the particles density, superficial gas velocity, etc. were 
presented by Chaouki et al. (1985). Interparticle adhesion forces were found to reduce the 
entrainment rate during fluidization of fine particles (Santana et al., 1999). Experiments studying 
effects of liquid bridge forces (Mc Laughlin & Rhodes, 2001) and magnetic forces (Rhodes et al., 
1498

moisture contents. Bed particles humidified of lower water contents showed large average 
discharge times of superfine powders. Natural cohesion and adhesion properties of ultrafine 
powders were found to control fluidization quality rather than water contents of the bed 
particles.

Abstract 
Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) has been examined in a number of studies as a tool in downtime 
reduction. The basic goal of TPM is to keep all equipment in top working conditions at all times in order 
to reduce or even eliminate delays during manufacturing processes. 
In this study, Autonomous Maintenance, that is, utilizing the resources of operational personnel as a key 
component of TPM, is examined. Observations and data that are derived from two production lines in 
regard to maintenance issues are analyzed in the context of Autonomous Maintenance. 
Data analysis using Microsoft Excel and Minitab was conducted and then the differences were noted and 
plotted on charts. The study was conducted over a period of one year , and by comparing shift reports for 
the operation lines to ascertain the reasons for stoppages during their runs, it was possible to determine the 
efficiency of Autonomous Maintenance as a reliable tool in TPM.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect of recycling strategy on organizational performance by 
collecting and analysing data from the household appliance industry in Egypt. In addition, this paper also 
tests the effect of resource allocation as a moderator variable for the relations between recycling strategy and 
organizational performance. The proposed research model describes the impact of recycling strategy on 
organizational performance and the effect of resource allocation as a moderator variable for the relation 
between recycling strategy and organizational performance.  The proposed research model and hypotheses 
were tested using correlation analyses, regression analyses and structural equation modelling based on data 
collected from 89 companies in the Egyptian paper industry. According to the results of the study, recycling 
strategy are positively associated with organizational performance. Moreover, resource allocation moderates 
the relation between recycling strategy and organizational performance. The generalization of the study 
results may be limited by the size of the sample. This study provides a useful working model in the household 
appliance industry. The results suggest that using recycle strategy will contribute to improving organizational 
performance, and appropriate resource allocation will moderate the relation between recycle strategy and 
organizational performance. 
 
Keywords: Recycling Strategy, Resource Allocation, Organizational Performance, and Egypt. 
 
1. Introduction: 
 
The aim of this research is to investigate different activities related to reverse logistics and its role in creating 
competitive advantages and improving the company’s performance. One of the main activities related to reverse 
logistics is the disposition of the returned product without polluting the environment as well as reducing the cost of 
disposition. The current research investigated the effect of recycle strategy as one of disposition strategies on the 
company’s performance and how to use such strategies to gain competitive advantages and create sustainability. Data 
from 108 companies in the Egyptian household appliance industry were collected and tested using Correlation 
Analyses, regression analyses and structural equation modelling. 
 
Reverse logistics is the reverse flow of the product from the point of consumption to the point of producing the 
product. The product may be returned because it does not fit the customer need, or a part of a product, such as cans, 
can be returned to be recycled. We could differentiate between  many reasons for returning a product such as the 
following: faulty order processing, retail overstock, end of product life cycle, product replacement, manufacture recall 
programs, installation or usage problems, warranty claims, etc. (Schatteman, 2006). 
 
Managers are often unaware of the impact returns management can have on their customers, resources or bottom 
line. In fact, improving reverse logistics can help companies increase revenue up to 5% of total sales. Companies often

strategy as a tool for gaining a competitive advantage through reducing cost and improving performance. In addition, 
the companies need to allocate adequate resources for such strategy to make sure of its effectiveness. 
 
The current study is one of the few studies in Egypt that evaluated the relation between one of the strategies of 
disposition and performance levels and also tackled the impact of resource allocation in this relation. Nevertheless, 
one of its points of weakness is its application on one industrial sector only. Hence, the hypotheses of the study must 
be reassessed and reapplied to different industrial sectors to form a clear image of the nature of the relation between 
the variables of the study in Egypt. In addition, this study has not taken into account external environmental variables 
such as laws and governmental legislations, which have an impact on the given relations between the variables of the 
study.  
 
Finally, a number of recommendations could be set with the aim of attracting attention to disposition strategies 
and their impact on the environment: 
1-The state and its institutions must set a number of mechanisms and legislations to contribute to the application and 
usage of different disposition strategies due to their positive effect on the environment. 
2-Non-governmental organizations in Egypt must raise awareness of the importance of protecting the environment 
and its impact on the level of performance and profitability of companies.  
3-The private sector and its different companies should work on passing on the experiences of companies in developed 
countries and the technologies used in handling dispositions in a way that maintains the environment.

Abstract 
This project aims to reduce mango waste and clean polluted water by using carbon derived from 
mango seeds. Mango seeds were carbonized through chemical activation. First, mango seeds 
were mixed with phosphoric acid and heated to approximately 100 ℃. The temperature was later 
raised to 500 ℃ in nitrogen. The resulting carbon was washed and dried. Methylene blue was 
used to represent a water pollutant. Concentrations of methylene blue in the water were 
monitored by a custom-made photometer. The photometer consists of an Arduino UNO, a 
colored LED, a light sensor, and an LCD display. The Arduino UNO was programmed through 
Arduino Web Editor - Arduino Create. Different concentrations of methylene blue were 
measured. The values were used to calculate adsorption and percent removal, which shows the 
effectiveness of carbonized mango seeds to clean water. The results from the chemical activation 
of carbon was compared with thermal activation of carbon.

Abstract  
 
Forecasting accuracy is an important issue for effective decision making in the areas of strategic planning, 
production planning, inventory management and other areas. In particular, this aspect is most relevant for 
items that have demand patterns with important levels of intermittency and lumpiness. This work 
describes the efforts of a Mexican company to look for opportunities to improve the level of forecasting 
accuracy through the application of demand aggregation to all the items of the company´s catalogue. The 
level of demand aggregation considered is a period equivalent to the review plus de response time periods 
of the periodic review management system used by the firm. Initial results are obtained from a pilot study 
carried out in all the stores of the Tijuana plaza of the company. The resulting forecasting mean squared 
error (MSE) was decreased significantly in the range of 32 to 56%. The firm estimates a reduction in the 
order of 17.7 to 33.9% in safety stock requirements will be possible due to the improvement in 
forecasting accuracy.

Introduction 
Forecasting is a prediction of future events used for planning purposes that has to do with the estimation of the value 
of a variable (or set of variables) at some future point in time. Monks (1987) defined forecast as estimate of 
occurrence, timing or magnitude of future events, that an operations manager uses as a rational basis for planning 
and scheduling activities, even though actual demand is quite uncertain. Krajewsk, et al., (1998) see forecast as a 
prediction of future events used for planning purpose and this is needed to aid in determining what resources are 
needed, scheduling existing resources and acquiring additional resources.  
 
Decision making in Supply Chain Management requires the use of demand forecasting to manage future 
uncertainties and risk. Strategic and operational planning success depends in a great extent on the accuracy of 
forecasts. Thus, managers are willing to spend money, time and effort to achieve it. 
 
According to Kurzak (2012), the level of competitiveness of a market economy determines the variability of demand 
for particular goods. The level of production should reflect customer demands that can be estimated by means of 
forecasting. The goal of forecasting is providing possible most objective and substantial prerequisites for making 
business decisions and analysis of the events that might occur. The need for forecasting is inherent in each 
enterprise, regardless of whether they manufacture, provide services or sell goods. Therefore, it is essential that 
forecasting is used in decision-making processes as it might contribute to improved accuracy of decision-making.  
Forecasting in production enterprises allow for finding the most probable course of processes. When defining the 
most important tasks for the enterprise, the managers should be based on the forecasts.  
 
An essential part of managing enterprises is ability to forecast future events, i.e. forecasting. No decision can be 
made without accurate and precise forecasts as they are primarily concerned with the enterprise's future. Therefore, 
the causes of development of forecasts in the enterprise are:

The impact on inventory of the previously described initiatives is described in this section. For our case study, the 
main impact of improving forecasting accuracy is expected to be on the determination of safety stock. The 
forecasting and inventory management of “The One” is a dynamic system that is updated every time a new forecast 
is obtained. The firm estimates safety stock for each item by using a desired service level multiplied by the standard 
deviation of the forecasting errors.  
 
It should be pointed out that the MSE is an estimate of the variance of the forecast error. Thus, the root mean 
squared error (RMSE) will also be an estimate of the standard deviation of the forecast errors. Under these 
circumstances, the management of “The One” is expecting safety stock reduction in the order of 17.7 – 33.9% 
(Table 1).

Conclusions and recommendations 
The level of competitiveness of the retailing sector is dependent on the level of product availability at the store. 
Under these circumstances, the effectiveness with which inventory management is performed becomes very 
important. Too much is expensive, and too little implies the appearance of more frequent stockouts.  An important 
factor that impacts significantly inventory management is forecasting accuracy. 
 
The case of study treated in this paper deals with the improvement of the level of precision of demand forecasting at 
the store level. The company was dealing with the problem of having excessive level of inventories in its stores in 
terms of days of inventory. An exhaustive analysis of the contribution to this excess was developed and found that 
forecasting performance for inventory management purposes could be improved. Thus, an initiative based on the 
application of the ADIDA (Nikolopoulos et al., 2011) methodology could be implemented for these purposes. The 
impact expected with the full implementation of the previous initiative is a safety stock reduction in the order of 
17.7 – 33.9%. Given these expected results, “The One” management decided to pursue full implementation during 
year 2018.

Abstract 
Forecasting is a process of predicting or estimating the future based on past experiences in the 
similar situation and using present data. It plays a crucial role in the first stage of every planning 
procedure. Most of the organizations fails due to lack of proper forecasting or because of 
erroneous forecasting. In this thesis, we will develop a sophisticated forecasting technique for the 
banking sector of Bangladesh. For this, we will first analyze some of the most relevant 
forecasting techniques such as Exponential Smoothing method, Holt’s Method and Winter’s 
Method. Then, we will analysis the applicability of advanced forecasting technique in the Bank 
Management system. Finally, combining forecasting and queuing system M/M/s/GD/∞/∞, we 
will develop an advanced Ad Hoc forecasting technique to predict the number of customers, 
number of entity of customer daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. We will observe that, this 
method will also help the manager of a bank to estimate the number of speakers or service men 
in order to serve them by producing reliable forecasts of the number of customers for each day so 
that the customers do not need to wait for long to get service as well as any banker will not pass 
time idly. Our method will also determine the length of time a customer is willing to wait to get 
service. This method will help the bank manager to minimize the total cost by determining the 
optimum number of bank tellers. Using real life data from a bank, we will compare the forecasts 
obtained from our advanced method with that of other forecasting methods and will present them 
graphically.

Abstract 
 
The following paper introduces the Overall Material Efficiency (OME), a performance-measurement 
concept for material usage in semiconductor manufacturing. The OME breaks down the total material 
usage into main categories. The concept has proven useful to drive improvement in material management 
by highlighting areas for improvement, via tracking both the amount and cost of materials used in each 
category over time. The OME is also generic – the authors believe that the concept is relevant to all 
processes that involve production. 
 
Keywords:  
Overall Material Efficiency, material efficiency, material productivity, material losses 
 
1. Introduction 
In the semiconductor industry, the costs of production can be divided into personnel, capital and material costs. For 
backend manufacturing, there is a growing focus on managing material usage as it steadily becomes a big lever for 
cost reduction. This is especially so for large power semiconductor modules used for automobiles, photovoltaics and 
industrial drives. However, there seems to be an absence of an industry-wide standard governing or guiding material 
usage. This paper aims to fill in that gap by introducing the OME, forming a framework to classify material use and 
losses into logical categories. This clear identification of material losses can then be used to highlight areas for 
improvement, target setting and drive down material costs.

7. Conclusion 
The proposed measurement system using Overall Material Efficiency (OME) is still in the early stages. It has 
already trigger the stakeholders to have a thorough relook at the material usage in terms of both what they plan as 
target and what they actually consumed in the real production world. The next challenge will be how to enable 
consistent tracking of performance for regular review by key stakeholders.  
 
The authors believe this measurement system will give rise to potential productivity opportunities such as those seen 
and experienced at the Overall Equipment Efficiency. This will also help to enable to reduce some of the 7 Wastes 
of Lean such as Defect, Transportation, Inventory, Motion and Over-Processing that incurred due to unprofitable 
activities carried out while handling material.

Abstract 
The global stage has a lot to achieve by simply having energy at its beck and call. However, its unavailability could 
only mean its inefficient use when available. The objective of this study is to determine how various operations with 
population and gross domestic product (GDP) as resources affect global energy consumption. These operations 
include overall, technical and scale efficiencies. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique was used to carry out 
this study applying it to the world energy consumption from 1995 to 2009. Out of the 15-year period, six years were 
reported as overall efficient, three years were discovered technical efficient and three years as scale efficient. 
Indications from this study reiterates for policies to be formulated that are globally favorable and not biased to any 
continent or country.

Introduction 
The global stage has a lot to achieve by simply having energy at its beck and call. However, its unavailability could 
only mean its inefficient use when available. The world government has observed the continuous increase in energy 
demand [1]. The concerns regarding the environment is majorly focused on the consumption of energy primarily as 
demand in energy increases. Among those environmental concerns are air pollution, acid rain and climate change [2, 
3]. Energy-related CO2 emission has been recorded to have an estimate worldwide increase from 31.2 billion metric 
tons to 45.3 billion metric tons between 2010 and 2040 [4]. The recent growth in the global economy has been possible 
through the sacrifices made by energy resources and the environment. These sacrifices have resulted to energy 
resource exhaustion and environmental ruin [5]. 
The impact of human activities on the environment together with the continuous decrease in energy resources have 
justified the attention of the universe towards sustainable development [6]. Every challenge associated with energy 
saving and the protection of the environment are huge [7]. For a change to occur, the supply and demand of energy 
would need drastic adjustments [8]. These adjustments will include energy users being efficient. A careful 
understanding of energy consumption and conservation’s pattern as well as awareness form efficient policies and the 
changes in lifestyle are also required [9].  
The objective of this study is to apply efficiency technique to determine how various operations involving population 
and GDP affected the global consumption of energy between 1995 and 2009. A non-parametric technique that has 
achieved credit in its application to determine how consumption of energy could be efficient is data envelopment 
analysis (DEA). Energy efficiency can be defined as ‘measure for the amount of energy used per unit of activity’. In 
logical sense, energy efficiency can be influenced by the technical energy efficiency, that is, the energy consumed by 
buildings, equipment or processes under constant operating conditions as well as the operation of buildings, equipment 
and processes. The pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency also play a part in the total efficiency possible. 
Among the literature studied in the application of DEA to determine how efficiency could be obtained during energy 
consumption include but not limited to [10] [11] [12] [13]. In evaluating the operational performance of a thermal 
power plant, [10] applied DEA in such a case in Taiwan. Their study considered 12 plants (DMUs) between 2004 and

Conclusion 
This study proposes DEA to evaluate the global consumption of energy taking world population and GDP as the 
determinant factors. Demonstrating how activities affect energy consumption was well represented by the proposed 
model. From the results gathered, the following conclusions can be drawn. First, most of the global years of energy 
consumption are not efficient, and the world should adjust its activities in the form of human behavior, waste of 
resources and how production of goods are made to allow possible saving and conservation. Second, energy use has 
a great correlation with population and GDP, which is very fundamental to sustainability, hence policy makers should 
consider this as vital in formulating policies. The last but not least, energy use under different continents, countries 
have different policies governing their use. The better for the world should the various continents and countries come 
to an agreement with a universal policy that is not biased to one continent or country. This should not be ignored. 
There should be a framework exploring all possible scenarios of energy use pertinent to every continent. 
Future studies will involve breaking GDP into the various sectors as well as dividing the population to various classes 
i.e., working class and retired class, which will expose where resources are not used optimally leading to inefficient 
energy use.

Abstract 
The global stage has a lot to achieve by simply having energy at its beck and call. However, its 
unavailability could only mean its inefficient use when available. The objective of this study is to determine 
how various operations with population and gross domestic product (GDP) as resources affect global energy 
consumption. These operations include overall, technical and scale efficiencies. Data Envelopment 
Analysis (DEA) technique was used to carry out this study applying it to the world energy consumption 
from 1995 to 2009. Out of the 15-year period, six years were reported as overall efficient, three years were 
discovered technical efficient and three years as scale efficient. Indications from this study reiterates for 
policies to be formulated that are globally favorable and not biased to any continent or country.

Introduction 
The global stage has a lot to achieve by simply having energy at its beck and call. However, its unavailability could 
only mean its inefficient use when available. The world government has observed the continuous increase in energy 
demand (Bilga et al., 2016). The concerns regarding the environment is majorly focused on the consumption of energy 
primarily as demand in energy increases. Among those environmental concerns are air pollution, acid rain and climate 
change (Peng et al., 2013, Seow et al., 2016). Energy-related CO2 emission has been recorded to have an estimate 
worldwide increase from 31.2 billion metric tons to 45.3 billion metric tons between 2010 and 2040 (EIA, 2013). The 
recent growth in the global economy has been possible through the sacrifices made by energy resources and the 
environment. These sacrifices have resulted to energy resource exhaustion and environmental ruin (Chen et al., 2017). 
The impact of human activities on the environment together with the continuous decrease in energy resources have 
justified the attention of the universe towards sustainable development (Naji et al., 2016). Every challenge associated 
with energy saving and the protection of the environment are huge (Allouhi et al., 2015b). For a change to occur, the 
supply and demand of energy would need drastic adjustments (Allouhi et al., 2015a). These adjustments will include 
energy users being efficient. A careful understanding of energy consumption and conservation’s pattern as well as 
awareness form efficient policies and the changes in lifestyle are also required (Hara et al., 2015).  
The objective of this study is to apply efficiency technique to determine how various operations involving population 
and GDP affected the global consumption of energy between 1995 and 2009. A non-parametric technique that has 
achieved credit in its application to determine how consumption of energy could be efficient is data envelopment 
analysis (DEA). Energy efficiency can be defined as ‘measure for the amount of energy used per unit of activity’. In 
logical sense, energy efficiency can be influenced by the technical energy efficiency, that is, the energy consumed by 
buildings, equipment or processes under constant operating conditions as well as the operation of buildings, equipment 
and processes. The pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency also play a part in the total efficiency possible.

Abstract
Oil and Gas companies adopt various maintenance strategies. TAM is one of the major maintenance 
strategies used in the most oil and gas plants. It is considered an expensive both in terms of time and 
cost due to a plant shutdown. These plants consist of complex pieces of equipment that run 
continuously under harsh operating conditions caused by overpressure and fluctuated temperatures. A 
part of these equipment cannot be inspected and maintained unless entire plant facilities undergo 
shutdown to conduct the TAM event. The present study aimed to optimize TAM performance based 
on Critical Rotating Equipment pieces (CREs) of gas plants by using the TAM model that included 
three stages: i) At the first stage, Non-critical Equipment pieces (NEs) are identified and removed 
from scope of work (SoW) of TAM to proactive maintenance policy, ii) At the second stage, critical 
failures of each selected critical rotating equipment are analyzed in order to identify critical 
components for those pieces based on Risk-Based Failure (RBF) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), and 
iii) At the third stage, failure probability and reliability function for those selected critical pieces of
equipment are assessed to determine duration and interval of TAM for the gas plant.
This study is characterized by presenting the TAM model, which is represented the real tool to
implement it in oil and gas plants to minimize duration of TAM in order to eliminate failures and
extend component life and to reduce TAM cost and production losses, also maximize interval of TAM
in order to improve availability and reliability of the plant. The result of TAM model application at
gas plants showed that the duration and interval of TAM could be optimized based on gas turbines
risks that represented threat to the operating performance and reliability of the plant. An improvement
in availability and cost were also presented to evaluate TAM performance optimization.

Abstract 
This study presents a two-echelon supply chain model for short life deteriorating products with an 
application of preservation technology. Various preservation policies have been defined to improve the 
lifetime of deteriorating products. The recent innovations in this regards include several types of 
preservation technologies to reduce the deterioration rate. Use of such technologies increases the supply 
chain profit of such fixed lifetime products. Unlike several researchers, who proposed a continuous 
reduction in rates of deterioration with investment in the preservation technology, this study focuses on 
more real circumstances by proposing model of such a preservation policy that improves lifetime of a 
product and minimizes the effects of deterioration in such a way that magnitude of decrease in 
deterioration reduces for additional investment in the preservation technology. The model is validated 
with numerical example. The implication of investment in preservation technology is illustrated by 
evaluating increasing value in product’s lifetime and the profit which authenticates the proposed model.

1. Background and motivation 
 
Most of the food products, for examples bakery items, fruits, and vegetables start deteriorating as soon as they are 
produced. Due to deterioration, quality of the food products is either reduced or these products become perishable 
after a certain period of time, thus making them unfit for human consumption. At retail stores, such food products 
are usually discarded, when they are no longer fresh because they will not catch customers’ attention and will just 
create inventory costs. Such disposals not only create an economic loss but also affect the environment and natural 
resources. In United States, approximately 15% of the food products expire due to deterioration before reaching 
their consumers. It is reported that, throughout the world, 1.3 billion tons of food products are discarded every year, 
which is approximately 33% of all the food produced for human consumption. The focus of this study is to minimize 
these losses by providing preservation policies for such food products. 
Product’s deterioration (PD) has been discussed in literature by many researchers. First model for deteriorating 
inventory was proposed by Ghare and Schrader (1963). Sachan (1984) developed an Economic Order Quantity 
(EOQ) model with shortages and time dependent product demand where inventory items deteriorate at a constant 
rate. Chang and Dye (1999) improved the model by considering backlogged shortages. This research dimension was 
further explored by Skouri et al. (2009) and they proposed an inventory model with time dependent rate of 
deterioration and ramp type demand rate considering partial backlogging. Theory of stochasticity for the rate of PD 
was introduced by Sarkar (2013). He proposed an Economic Production Quantity (EPQ) model considering three 
probabilistic (uniform, triangular, beta) deterioration rates to find the optimum lot size and number of deliveries. 
Chen and Teng (2014) developed an EOQ model with deteriorating items having maximum life time and permissible 
delay in payments to minimize the total cost on optimal value of retailer's replenishment cycle. Goel et al. (2015) 
considered variable quadratic rate of PD in a deterministic inventory model and they proposed a supply chain model 
considering supplier, manufacturer and a retailer with stock dependent demand and partial backlogging. In their 
model they considered ''critical time at which inventory goes zero'' as decision variable. Sarkar et al. (2015) studied

5. Concluding remarks 
 
This paper discussed a supply chain system in which preservation technology is used to increase life time of short 
life deteriorating products and proposed a model to find optimal value of investment in preservation technology. The 
proposed model suggested that life time of a deteriorating product is increased significantly by applying preservation 
technology and consequently the rate of deterioration is decreased. The authors also recommended that product 
having longer time to expire is sold at higher price and it contributes to increase the profit. The hypothesis was 
verified through the results of numerical illustrations that shows a remarkable increase in the profit of the supply 
chain when preservation technology was applied. Moreover, it was proved that the investment for preservation 
conditional is more significant than the investment for preservatives. This research can further be continued to study 
on how the investment in preservation technology affects the maximum life time of the product. Moreover, it can be 
investigated that how the variable component of product selling price is affected by maximum life time of the 
product for a deteriorating product system.

Abstract 
 
As the business grows, the customer volume, varieties and complexity also grows accordingly.  In the 
testing area, the complexity is also higher with combinations of the tester, handler, test program, 
temperature and product. An effective solution is required to classify the accuracy of test time and index 
time and recommend the attention to the focus problem area. In this paper, the management of big data 
analytics was explored for recommending V93K tester platform focus area with high test time and index 
time deviation. The systematics will be able to summarize and help to decide quickly on the focus list for 
the factory engineers, manufacturing manager and operations to work on for productivity and gap closure.

With this project, the team is able to achieve 3 important outcomes: 
1) Increase the plan UPH from the initial plan UPH –Out-Of-Control-Faster (Yellow zone)  to UPH OK
(Green zone)
This gives the factory and operation the confidence that the machine UPH is stable and predictable on the 
output. The engineers can now focus on those machines or products that are truly the real problem. 
2) The amount of time to generate Top 20 focus list was reduced from 1 month to 15-30 minutes. The
engineers can now work efficiently with this automated time study.
3) The engineers able to detect quickly the Out-Of-Control-Faster / Out-Of-Control-Slower for
improvement either caused by the test time and/or index time deviation.
Conclusion 
This UPH Improvement Systematic allows various functional departments of Industrial Engineers, 
Equipment Engineers, Planners and Operations people to align better. This in turn leads to better machine 
stability, better capacity commitment and fulfillment of demand. 
Includes this improvement project in the weekly productivity meeting and reflect any changes required.

Abstract  
 
In the dynamically changing manufacturing environment, human resource management has always been a 
complex process as it is challenging to quantify and relate the job complexity to the required work effort. 
This is mainly because indirect labor deals with technical project oriented tasks and the driving force 
behind its requirement is not directly related to unit output. In this study, a data-driven systematic 
approach is developed to characterize the job complexity of indirect workforce and predict the optimal 
workforce requirement and performance targets via data envelopment analysis (DEA). Firstly, the job 
complexity is defined by its attributes and quantifying them in the form of an index. Subsequently, 
together with other key performance measurable, they serve as the outputs and number of engineers as the 
input for the non-parametric frontier modelling. The model is validated by evaluating the past relative 
efficiency performance of the different teams which will then be used as benchmark for the study. The 
effects of varying the output measurable on the optimal workforce requirement are illustrated via three 
real case scenarios. The approach provides a clear understanding of the team performance based on 
different performance measurable, and also serves as a decision-making tool for the managers to allocate 
their workforce in the light of changing manufacturing environment so that their shortages and excesses 
can be addressed more efficiently and effectively, thereby boosting productivity.

Abstract  
Technology centered businesses are highly motivated and accepted in the present Information age. More 
and more organizations are trying to introduce ICT in their daily operations and making their business 
leaner and flexible. Brick and Click Retail formats like hypermarkets, specialty stores and Convenience 
stores are using technological platform, like Internet of Things (IoT) for widening their reach to the 
customer. This piece of research tries to show the relationship between the cost and the strategy of a retail 
format with the adaptation of IoT in their operations.

1. Introduction 
In the age of modern technology where the life cycle of product is decreasing with a multiplying factor and the 
technology is becoming obsolete so frequently, the retailers need to keep pace with the changing market scenario.  
In past decade, retail sector has grown rapidly as compared to other sectors. Various formats of retailing have been 
introduced time to time which helps to cater the large variety of products amongst the existing and the potential 
market. With the boom of e-commerce and variety of products in the market consumers as well as retailers have 
shifted to a new age of retailing which brings the experience of buying and purchasing to next level, generally 
known as ‘brick and click’ model. In this model, the time and physical constraint has been removed which helps the 
stakeholder to choose the convenient way of buying and selling.  
One of the most trending topics in Information Technology (IT) sector is Internet of Things coined by Kevin Ashton 
from P&G. IOT tries to reduce human intervention and tries to promote devices’ interoperability, that is why it’s 
been accepted by most of the organizations. Internet of things refers to communication and sharing of information 
amongst real life objects through internet (Ashton, 2009). This paper researches about how IOT implementation will 
benefit the retail organizations.  
 
2. Literature Review 
 
2.1 Retailing  
Retailing is one of the largest and the fastest growing Industries of the world. This growth has accelerated more in 
the last decade. Retailing involves those companies that are engaged in procuring products from the manufacturers 
and reselling the same goods to the consumers. Retailers are trying to be more consumer oriented and building 
personal contacts with them by exploiting insights into consumer preferences and behavior. (Kumar, 1996) 
 
‘Brick and Mortar’ Retail Format  
(a) Convenience Store - The size of Convenience stores (c-stores) is determined by the variety of products that they 
store. They can be as small as a kiosk with a size of around 800 sq. ft. or as vast as 4000 to 5000 sq. ft. The items 
stocked by convenience stores are the daily use products. Most of the sales of convenience stores come from

retain existing customers. (Herhausen et. al., 2015).  Integration of ICT into supply chain helps in specialization of 
jobs which leads to more professional jobs and requires different skills’ sets which have to be performed by 
professionals All the functioning is held under standard processing with a formal channel of communication. Big 
players try to inculcate standardized process in their structure to reduce ambiguity but due to changing demand and 
market needs, to increase the flexibility, procedure need to be modified with the product to fulfill the demand. By 
integrating the physical facility with internet technology which can share the information brings the synergy up as 
well as the flexibility goes up. (Steinfield et al, 2002)  
 
H1 : Hypermarkets have greater variety in products with high level of uncertainty in the market. Hence required 
frequent reconfiguration of IoT systems. Thus, seven layers of IoT is required to cater these needs. 
 
H2 : Specialty stores have dynamic relationship with both customer and suppliers; and for example, if limited (or at 
most) three specialty stores out of hundred can be pooled to use one IoT system to reduce cost. Hence required five 
layers of IoT. 
 
H3 : Convenience stores have predictable customer base due to its convenience and they need to take care fo 
suppliers which requires simple or minimum IoT system, thus, ten or more Convenience stores out of hundred can 
be pooled to use one IoT system to reduce cost. Hence required three layers of IoT. 
 
Different layers of IoT systems can be deployed for a pool of different retailers on same floor in a hypermarket , 
instead of implementing seven layers of IoT for whole hypermarket. It reduces the overall cost as by pooling, the 
retail formats lower level of IoT system can be leveraged and at the tie of failure of one IoT system, additional load 
can be transferred to another and can be used as a risk management strategy.  
 
H4 : In a hypermarket, on the same floor there are many stores with similar strategy (i.e., convenience store or 
speciality store). Then a subset of all specialty stores on a given floor be assigned to an IoT with more number of 
layers, and similarly for convenience store on the same floor of given hypermarket. Also, it follows that much lower 
number of specialty stores be assigned to a given IoT compared to larger number of convenience stores that may be 
assigned to a given IoT. 
 
This ensures lower cost and at the same time removes redundancies with a fault tolerant experience for all stores. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Technology adaptation and openness to technology are two different aspects and organizations need to analyse it 
with their s-curve (technology adoption curve). Big organizations mostly do mistakes in earlier adaptation of 
technology because of peer pressure in the market, but not able to leverage the maximum outcome of the particular 
technology. In case of large scale e-retailers (hypermarkets), they are encouraged to adopt and upgrade the new IoT 
technologies but keeping in mind of the long term strategies. Spending high budget in technology does not ensure 
the competitive edge. Sometimes, lower level of technology at right time of the market drivers will produce great 
results. In this research, we have seen like hypermarkets (big-budget stores) are spending high amount on 
technology adoption but they need to critically analyse and synchronise the technology with their organizational 
structure and strategy. Retailers need to classify their needs of IoT and small retailers need to pool themselves for 
technology adoption to reduce the overall cost and leverage the maximum potential of the particular IoT.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of the research was to establish a framework for performance measurement and management 
(PMM) for facility management companies (FMC). The research will focus on shared offices spaces as 
FMC. Using the DMAIC approach to define the problem that will face such FMC and how to measure 
them, then analyze them, afterwards improve and control them. Using SIPOC approach will help to define 
the information in each stage of the analysis. In the analysis the FMC needs are identified in such all daily 
& occasional needs and requirements are listed and broke down to different categories. In the process, 
using Value Stream Mapping (VSM) will show the whole process and where there is value added, enable 
non-value added or non-value added process. In output, after processing the input the result of it gives 
availability of the needs in right time with the right material. In doing so the costumer key performance 
indicators (KPI) of interest are satisfied and identified as such; Pantry Defaults, Printing Needs Defaults, 
Internet Connection, Defaults During Event, Printed Material Excess, Manpower Availability, and 
Customer and Public Satisfaction. Using facility design layout approach will increase the efficiency of 
meeting the KPI goals by setting up the layout in a proper way.

Abstract  
 
Today many production companies are proposing free shipping as a marketing strategy to attract 
customers in e-commerce. In this paper we empirically examine the impacts of free shipping on the 
performance of a production system. Two cases of the transport services are considered: the first is a 
classic case in which the delivery charges are paid by the customer and the second is the case of the free 
shipping in which the delivery charges are paid by the company. Discrete flow model is used to describe 
the production system and to take into account delivery activities. The objective of this work is to provide 
a performance evaluation study that allows choosing the suitable case according to the indicators of 
interest such as delivery cost or the demand increase. Numerical results are presented to discuss the 
choice of the suitable case. In addition, an optimization study of the production system with free shipping 
option is presented.

1. Introduction  
 
One of the most important sections of supply chain management is distribution. Delivery cost is one of the parts of 
the total price of the product, which make it engaging for consumers. That is why manufacturers and companies 
more often try to attract customers and encourage them to order more are increasingly offering free shipping. 
Moreover, different types of free shipping have greater effect on customers than discounts. In this this topic we 
found interesting works, Lewis et al. [1] empirically find that free shipping with or without conditions is very 
effective in generating additional sales. The authors say that consumers are very sensitive to shipping charges and 
that shipping fees influence order incidence and basket size. Promotions such as free shipping and free shipping for 
orders that exceed some size threshold are found to be very effective in generating additional sales. However, the 
lost revenues from shipping and the lack of response by several segments are substantial enough to render such 
promotions unprofitable to the retailer. Wen-Hsien Huang et al. [2] examine how consumers evaluate and respond to 
two economically equivalent but different forms of threshold free shipping (TFS) policy: They demonstrate that a 
piece-based TFS will result in a higher intention to shop than a dollar-based TFS. Mehmet Gäumäus et al. [3] 
presented study results which showed that the optimal strategy for retailers with a large segment of shipping-charge-
skeptics is to offer free shipping to their customers. Michael Lewis [4] empirically studied the effects of shipping 
fees on customer acquisition and customer retention. It was found that shipping fees greatly influence order 
incidence rates and graduated shipping fees significantly affect average expenditures. Furthermore, a profitability 
analysis suggests that shipping policies that provide incentives for larger order sizes may outperform free shipping 
promotions. Guowei Hua et al. [5]   examined a new free shipping problem in business context where the demand

As we see in the figure 3, when the ratio between the unit sales cost and the unit delivery cost is more than 6.5, the 
free shipping option will be profitable for company. Hence, this study allows to a manager to take decision about 
offering the free shipping option according to the sales cost and delivery cost. 
 
In the next section we will study the optimization of the production system with free shipping. 
 
 
4. Optimization of Production System with Free Shipping. 
 
In this section we have the interest to optimize the production system with free shipping option. Indeed, we will 
determine the optimal capacity of the stock inventory that maximizes the total profit function CT2(S*). To determine 
the optimal value of the capacity, we use an optimization algorithm based simulation ([17]-[25]). We use the same 
simulation parameters that are in the section III. The average demand in case2 is fixed to13 products /time unit. In 
what follows the results. 
 
Table 1.  Optimal capacity of the stock inventory 
S* 
CT2(S*) 
11 
661669056 
 
 
The optimal capacity of the stock inventory is equals to 11 with the total profit is 661669056 monetary units.  
According to the figure 2, when the capacity of the stock is equals to 30 and the average demand equals to 13 
products /time unit the total profit equals to 525682624 monetary units (which correspond to 30% increasing in 
demand). Hence to optimize the production system that offers the free shipping option, the manager should to reduce 
the capacity of the stock level to 11.  
 
 
5. Conclusion 
In this paper we studied two cases of the delivery services in production system: the first is a classic case in which 
the delivery charges are paid by the customer and the second is the case of the free shipping in which the delivery 
charges are paid by the company. To describe the system in both cases, discrete flow model is adopted and which 
take into account the delivery activities. We provided a performance evaluation study that allows choosing the 
suitable case according to delivery cost and the demand increase. Numerical results are presented and analyzed to 
discuss the choice of the suitable case. We studied the optimization of the production system with free shipping 
option with respect to the stock level capacity. 
For future work we will consider a production system with several types of products. Then we will treat a lot size 
problem in the case of free shipping.

Abstract 
 
A novel EMSR (Expected Marginal Seat Revenue) concept is proposed by considering the future value of 
airfares and seat inventory allocation. The seat allocation resulting from the extensions of EMSRa & 
EMSRb will be examined in terms of the protection limit, booking limit, and the possible maximum 
revenues. In our findings, we suggest that the decision makers should recognize the actual value of the 
revenues from the lower fare classes in the early stage of a flight booking period and adjust the seat 
inventory allocation in real practice.

1. Introduction 
Over the decades, Revenue Management (RM) has played a crucial role in the success of airlines, which can be 
classified into 1) pricing, 2) demand forecasting, 3) seat inventory control and 4) overbooking (McGill & Van Ryzin, 
1999).  Seat inventory control has long been a research area for airline industry researchers and it was the main subject 
of this research as well. Littlewood (1972) was introduced the Littlewood’s Rule, which is designed for more 
complicated models, from the expected marginal seat revenue (EMSR) control for multiple classes (Belobaba, 1987), 
to optimal booking limits for each class and bid-price control in the RM of airline alliance (Wright et al., 2010). In 
most of the seat inventory control models, multiple classes models assume that the demand for the lower fare class 
will come first when the reservations for the lower class have all been received or equal to the booking limits, after 
which the customers booking a higher fare class start their booking. In the process of calculating the protection levels 
and setting the booking limits for each fare class, however, the future values of the lower fare are not considered, 
especially the value of EMSR. In this research, the effects of the future value of fares on the revenues were analyzed, 
especially in the seat inventory control area. 
 
Many airlines apply a wide range of fares structures for the travel market, which is price discrimination, including 
discounted fares directed at the price-sensitive travelers as well as the higher-priced business and first-class fares 
(Botimer & Belobaba, 1999). It is assumed that the lower fare or discounted fare demand comes before the higher fare 
demand. On one hand, this pricing strategy can help the airline to capture more revenues from the travelers who are 
price-sensitive. On the other hand, the scheme ensures the cash flow of the airline. As airlines can gain the revenues 
from the lower fare demand first, which can be a type of liquidity resources, they can use it to invest in internal 
operational improvement or other financial investments that enable airlines to gain the returns on investments from 
improved services as well as combat inflation.

Figure 1 shows the percentage changes of maximum revenue when we compare the extensions to original 
methods at different return rates on investment or inflation. From the figure, we see that there is a positive 
relationship between the return rate and the changes of maximum revenues. When the return rate increases, the 
change of maximum revenues in term of percentage will also rise. The extension of EMSRb will cause a slightly 
greater change in the maximum revenue compared to the extension of EMSRa. 
 
The implication of the finding is that the decision makers of seat inventory control need to recognize the actual 
values of the relatively low fares. As the revenues from the lowest fare class will be obtained at an early stage 
that it will help airlines to ensure their internal cash flows. Airlines may make use of such revenues to make 
internal investments or utilize other investment tools to combat inflation. Under the global airline network, 
airlines have customers from different countries with different inflation rates. Decision makers need to identify 
the inflation rate of different currencies and consider the actual value of each fare price and implement 
appropriate seat inventory allocation over the whole booking period. 
 
5. Conclusion 
We have examined the results of protection limits, booking limits and the possible maximum revenues from 
different EMSR models, especially the extensions of EMSRa & EMSRb. We found that, if we consider the 
future value of fares, as the return rate on investment or inflation rate rises, the protection levels for the higher 
fare classes will be decreased and the booking limits for lower fare classes will be increased and the possible 
maximum revenues will increase. The results reflect that the managers of seat inventory control need to recognize 
the actual value of the revenues from lower fare classes and should apply the concept to their seat inventory 
allocation practices. If the return rate of revenues from the early stage of booking period is high enough, it is 
more appropriate to allow more bookings in the lower fare classes in terms of maximizing the revenues.

Abstract 
Banks need a way to evaluate performance and consider some important financial ratios and 
find the strengths and weaknesses. The banking system is one of the most important 
economic sectors in the Iran that has the most relationships with the country's 
macroeconomic; therefore, any kind of volatility and instability in it can influence the 
country's macroeconomics. Therefore, assessing the performance of the country's banking 
industry and analyzing the banking soundness is important. One of the more conventional 
methods to analyze and evaluate the banking soundness is using the CAMELS rating system 
which has six dimensions included to measure the performance of the bank. Each of these 
dimensions has many components and together with the variables that influence them and the 
interactions between them constitute a complex economic and monetary system. In this study, 
using the system dynamics approach, a systemic analysis of the structure of this issue will be 
provided. The results show that the factors Incomes and Expense are the most important 
issues of an Iranian bank in managing banking soundness and the way out of them is the

Also, in the scenario of bank deposits increase, though the stable deposits make better 
bank liquidity, and volatile deposits will reduce the liquidity of banks, hence, the sum of 
these two factors has a very little impact on improving the banking soundness.  
It seems, for proposed model of banking soundness, the scenario of increasing revenue 
and reduces costs are the effective scenarios. Because one of the ways to increase profits, is 
increasing revenue and thereby leads to an improved rate of return, the rate of return on 
assets, profit margin, operating margin, productivity and earning of a bank which ultimately 
has a huge impact on the banking soundness. Also, another way to increase earning is to 
lower costs through which the ratings of productivity, quality of management, and earning 
are improved which ultimately further affects the banking soundness.  
According to the results of simulating, we can say that one may control this system 
through two way: management and planning to increase earning and cost reduction.  
The results of recognizing system indicate that the factors that can increase the banking 
soundness, are mainly those which affect the banking soundness qualitatively. As a result, the 
study points out that it is better that banking executives apply their policies on this factors to 
get a better position of banking.

Abstract 
 
In this paper, the measurement system of a pharmaceutical company is evaluated by Gauge Repeatability 
and Reproducibility study. The objectives are to identify inadequacies of the measurement system and 
provide guidelines for performance improvement. Measurement variability is evaluated by two 
components which are the variability due to the operators (reproducibility) and the variability due to the 
gauge itself (repeatability). In this study, designed experiments are used to isolate and estimate the 
components of variability in the measurement system. The data are analyzed by Analysis of Variance and 
gauge capability is evaluated by precision-to-tolerance ratio and the percent contribution of variance 
components to the total variability. The results are interpreted and suggestions are made to improve the 
performance of the measurement system.

1. Introduction 
 
Tests and measurements are applied to samples taken from production lines in order to control whether the products 
meet the required performance characteristics and quality levels. It is also necessary to evaluate the performance of 
the measurement system to be able to rely on the test and measurement results. The measurement errors can cause 
both poor quality products to be delivered to the customers and good quality products to be rejected and not 
delivered. Therefore, it is important to take into account the measurement errors in the system to prevent the 
misclassification of products and misleading decisions. 
 
In this paper, the measurement system of a pharmaceutical company is evaluated by Gauge Repeatability and 
Reproducibility (GR&R) study in order to identify inadequacies of the measurement system and provide guidelines 
for performance improvement. GR&R studies focus on quantifying the measurement errors (Pearn and Kotz, 2006). 
Reproducibility is defined as the variability due to different operators using the gauge (or in general, different 
conditions) and repeatability as reflecting the basic inherent precision of the gauge itself (Montgomery, 2005). The 
gauge is a measuring instrument. The capability of the gauge is assessed by its ability to repeat and reproduce 
measurements. A measurement system is repeatable if its variability is consistent and it is reproducible when 
different operators produce consistent results (Pyzdek and Keller, 2010). 
 
Most studies using operators and tests employ two primary methods to calculate GR&R results which are the 
average and range method (a.k.a. the Automotive Industry Action Group method) and the Analysis of Variance 
1610","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

instrument should be increased. Calibration, proper use and maintenance of the instrument or replacement are the 
solutions. 
 
It should also be noted that repeatability component will be overestimated because of destructive measurement 
system. Although the test samples are taken from the same batch of production and the variation in these identical 
parts from the same batch is assumed negligible, there will be some variation that will cause repeatability be 
overestimated. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
This paper presented the principles of a Gauge Repeatability and Reproducibility study and its application to the 
measurement system of a pharmaceutical company. A nested design and a crossed design were used for experiments 
in order to isolate and estimate the components of variability in the measurement system. The experimental data 
were analyzed by Analysis of Variance and gauge capability was evaluated by precision-to-tolerance ratio and 
percent contribution of variance components to the total variability. 
The GR&R study provided guidelines for improving performance of the measurement system. The variability due to 
the operators (reproducibility) was eliminated through a new measurement procedure and operator training program. 
Calibration, proper use and maintenance of the instrument or replacement were suggested in order to reduce the 
variability due to the gauge itself (repeatability).

A Methodology for Relative Performance Comparison of 
Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks and Legacy 
Expendable Sonar Sensors

Abstract 
An Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network (UASN) is compared with the use of legacy expendable sonar 
sensors.  A simple means is derived to compare these two types of systems, namely the UASN and 
expendable sonobuoy sensors, to determine the relative comparative use of the UASN as opposed to the 
legacy sensors. The comparison is utilized to demonstrate the potential advantages of using such a system 
over conventional sensors if the system exceeds the operational efficiency of legacy underwater 
expendable sonar systems by a given factor.  The methodology uses a simulation of a distribution of 
sensors which have a performance in terms of target detection based on a Median Detection Range 
(MDR) and the use of a ‘cookie-cutter’ approach.  The comparison between the dissimilar sensors is 
accounted for by a Relative Sensor Performance Factor (RSPF) of acoustic performance which although 
is based on range should also account for the sensor system performance under the same acoustic 
environmental conditions.  Only passive acoustic underwater sensors are considered. An example 
deployment is used in a choke-point scenario, for the Straits of Gibraltar.  Given even a nominally small 
RSPF between the sensors, the UASN could provide a higher operational advantage over legacy sensors.

1. Introduction
1.1 Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network vs. Legacy Expendable Sonar Systems 
The Defence R&D Canada Atlantic Research Centre is in the process of developing a wireless Underwater Acoustic 
Sensor Network (UASN).  The system, as shown in Figure 1, comprises of a buoyed vertical line array which is 
anchored to the seabed.  Multiple numbers of these sensors distributed over the sea floor provide a network of nodes 
that are capable of communicating with each other and to the surface for reporting of underwater contacts [1].  The 
problem of communication between the sensors and relays to the surface is the subject of considerable study, as 
discussed by Heidemann et al [2].  However, this aspect has benefited from recent developments and acoustic 
modem technology has progressed to a point where this is not perceived as being a technological hurdle, though it 
still requires astute design.  Similarly, the design of the various layers, such as the physical layer, data link layer, and 
network layer [3] are the subject of research which is also not considered here.

An example of Signal Excess (SE) for the case of 14 sensors is shown in Figure 6.  The row of sensors is shown 
with a target having passed the barrier, where the brighter color (red) represents a higher signal excess and blue 
represents a lower signal excess.  The approximate MDR for the sensors in the example is 800 meters.  The heat 
map spanning the Strait of Gibraltar shows an example of sonar performance where an SE of 0 dB gives an 
approximate PD of 50%.  This example, constructed using the Multistatic Tactical Planning Aid (MSTPA) courtesy 
of the NATO Center for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) [7], provides a visualization of what the 
potential acoustic performance of the UASN could be for a given set of environmental and system parameters.  Such 
visualizations are thought to be useful particularly to the operational community [8].

4. Summary and Conclusions 
 
A methodology for comparing an Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network (UASN) to legacy sensors is used to 
differentiate the UASN from the use of legacy expendable sonobuoys.  The methodology uses a simulation of a 
distribution of sensors which have a performance in terms of Probability of Detection (PD) of the target based on a 
Median Detection Range (MDR) for the sensor and the use of a ‘cookie-cutter’ approach.  The scenario chosen for 
the example was the Straits of Gibraltar in which a straight line of equidistant sensors are placed across the Strait.  
The number of sensors required to achieve a PD up to a maximum 100 percent is used to give a relative performance 
between the systems.  The difference between the systems is accounted by a straight forward difference in decibels 
converted to range as a Relative Sensor Performance Factor (RSPF).  The number of sensors and the resulting PD 
can then be determined for each system, when the system parameters are known. The system parameters for the 
UASN should then be determined from Operational Trials and Analysis (OT&E). 
 
Future enhancements to the methodology could examine the temporal nature of the problem, since the endurance of 
each sensor is also a factor in their employment.  In addition, active sensors are also a possible UASN development,

considered in the current study.

Abstract  
 
South Africa, as a developing country, has the responsibility to deliver developmental programmes such as reliable infrastructure, 
which could assist in the transportation of goods to other countries. Road infrastructure is a necessary condition to economic 
growth. This study adopted a quantitative approach in order to investigate on a stakeholder’s perspective on the causes of poor 
service delivery of road infrastructure. Structured questionnaires was circulated to 75 stakeholders in construction industry in 
Gauteng Province, which were registered with various approved councils, construction professionals and contractors such as civil 
engineers, project managers, directors, quantity surveyors, construction managers and resident engineers. 50 came back 
completed and eligible to use. Random sampling method was used to select the respondents in various organizations. Research 
findings revealed that community unrest and land proclamation were the highest ranked causes for poor service delivery. 
Followed by, time, financial constraints, cash flow, lack of proper planning, resources, delivery of material, plant and equipment, 
shortage of skilled labourers, lack of equipment, lack of materials, performance guarantees, project duration/period, cost overruns 
were the major  causes of poor service delivery of roads infrastructure according to stakeholders perspective. Therefore, 
mitigating the causes would be by having proper management planning, skills transfer through PPP’s, proper communication 
channels and legality. It is recommended that road agencies (SANRAL,JRA), municipality engagement  should play a vital role 
in the service delivery and maintaining roads. In addition, quality work is encouraged in order to avoid rework and save time and 
cost, hence more roads can be constructed. Good roads are an important aspect of society that could contribute to the African 
Renaissance. Moreover, roads contribute to poverty alleviation by promoting growth through provision of infrastructure in 
corridors that connects nations and access to land locked countries.

1. Introduction 
Good roads are an important aspect of society that could contribute to the African Renaissance. Moreover, roads contribute to 
poverty alleviation by promoting growth through provision of infrastructure in corridors that connects nations and access to land 
locked countries [1]. The roads make our life easier in many ways as they link province to province even into other neighboring 
countries of South Africa [1]. In generally roads boost the country economy and simplify people’s life. Furthermore, it creates 
employment, income for people and construction entails a complex interplay of client, consultants, contractors, tool, equipment’s 
and materials [2] [3]. Moreover, roads boost the economy in terms of transporting goods, mineral resources in mining, farmers, 
and improve the access of different facilities such as schools, hospitals, shopping centers, work places and recreation centers [3]. 
If roads are in good conditions, they also reduce travel times and people save fuels on their vehicles, reduce production costs for 
the ever-growing number of goods shipments [4] [1]. The construction industry is the main distinct part that provides vital 
components as business, high recruitment of people and developing entrepreneurs for economy development [5].  
 
However, the road construction has been facing some challenges that cause poor service delivery. Road construction challenges 
causing poor service delivery are examined to be one of most repeatedly problem in the construction industry in South Africa.

9. Conclusion 
 
Community unrest was the highest ranked factor which is a major concern to all stakeholder (client, consultants and 
contractors). Community unrest such as strikes, stoppage of project by business forums, councilors interruptions 
disrupt the project spending more time negotiations of the community grievances delay project and sometimes total 
abandonment of project sites is the biggest threat to road construction projects and causes poor service delivery.  
Moreover, the existing services and land proclamation also pose a huge challenge to delivering a project on time, it 
needs to be taken into consideration during early stage of the project. Therefore, proper planning, skills transfer and 
timeframe to respond would aid in the poor service delivery. Good communication with the various communities 
and different department must take place especial during the preliminary stage, and transparence, honesty must be 
key to every individual who is involved in the project. The Gauteng municipalities have the duty to carry out the 
routine maintenance and some of the municipalities can handle light construction activities such as rehabilitation of 
the road and resurfacing of the road. Therefore, the municipality must stop outsourcing rehabilitation of the road so 
as to decrease the budget expenditure unnecessary. Moreover, different municipalities need to increase their 
investment to roads infrastructure; provide long-term vision to maintain roads infrastructure.  
 
 
10. 
Recommendations 
 
It is recommend that all three parties (client, consultant and contractor) should perform continuous training courses 
to improve capability of personnel and professionalism its encouraged to think out of the box. It is necessary for 
skills transfer to the youth as number of youth receive qualification without skills on the ground to use those 
qualifications on site. It’s recommended that companies and government sectors employ talented workforce to assist 
in skills transfer to benefit the organization. PPP’s would assist the government in the transfer of skills

Abstract  
 
The new technologies are progressing at staggering speed, such that the organizations especially search 
for the solutions with an indescribable expedition to ensure their survival in this agitated and chaotic 
condition. So, applying the Business Intelligence in the organization is considered to be an inevitable 
commitment and necessity for the purpose of dominating over new technologies. The Business Intelligence 
means a broad dimension of applications and technology for collecting data and knowledge for generating 
inquiry in the analysis of the organization for the adoption of accurate and intelligent organizational 
decisions. The questionnaire was designed in Likert scale & distributed among 272 experts in the 
automotive industry in Iran. Cronbach alpha is calculated as %81, which is well above the minimum 
desirable limit of 0.70. The study investigates 26 factors & extracts four important ones, which strategic 
orientation, competitive environment, organizational vision, information tools. In this paper to analyze 
data has been used factor analysis and Multi-Criteria Decision Making.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
the present article aims to analyze the difficulties of today's marketing  by identifying the effective factors in Business 
Intelligence and its   concentration on the organization decisions so that they could be anticipated and   resolved by 
evaluating and analyzing this new intelligent technology, before the jeopardies threat the organization and their 
exorbitant economic injuries obstruct  proper market and also the market opportunities advantages were taken, before   
they were identified by the competitors' accurate and meticulous eyes and before the organization be deprived of the 
opportunity of progress and development. 
The proposed study of this paper has extracted four important factors including strategic orientation, competitive 
environment, organizational vision, information tools. A critical component of business intelligence is the most 
important factor in organizational vision (by a factor of 0.345), competitive environment (by a factor of 0.301) and 
Strategic orientation (by a factor of 0.214) respectively the second & third priorities which can be considered the 
custodians of this section.

 Patent Analysis ""has been a powerful tool and play as the light to find way   for the big 
companies in the world for many years, this tool is considered as a shortcut for developing 
countries, in-order to accelerate the development of technology in the country relies on. As such, 
it can be used to monitor competitors and monitor rival companies and firms. In the general view 
of analysis this research has addressed   in developing a methodology to build the right 
organizational capabilities that can improve local innovation of an existing patent. Most of 
innovated product is often obtained from competitors, because a competitor's product has market 
achievement that indicates the possible success of similar new products. The design engineers 
then lay out proposed design solutions, and they have to identify specific structures or functions 
which may result in infringement of   patent claims. The R&D of companies reliably has to 
extract and summarize the core knowledge of related patent documents in-order to enable them 
for competing to create new technologies and products. The strengths about methodology    
provide robust method as a way of getting important data on processing system in patent. The 
KM and patent analysis will serve as a basis for decision makers who are usually technical 
persuaded to make effective decisions that will yield improved existing patented products.  This 
research consists of two parts. The first part extract useful knowledge and support decision 
making, with an emphasis on design around approaches that can be generally applied to patent.     
The second part is   with help of innovation idea   develop a   pattern for capturing patents data 
and to summarize content for design around exiting products.

Abstract 
Within the manufacturing company, production planning is considered as a vital component, and it plays a 
crucial role in keeping the company’s competitiveness in the market where the trend of competitors is 
increasing dramatically during the current decade. Additionally, production planning is a key player due to 
the high costs associated with the energy use, raw materials, and maintenance of product line. Over the 
current decade, the South African meat processing industry has experiencing a serious issues relating to 
meat supply shortage in the market. The main cause of this crisis has been largely attributed to ineffective 
production planning that could not meet the high demand from consumers. Consequently, this situation has 
negatively affected the business, the quality and throughput of the meat produced as well as the reputation 
of meat manufacturing industry. It is from this backdrop that this study aims to determine the issues of 
waste in South African food market. The red meat manufacturing industry in the province of Gauteng was 
used as a case study. The results revealed that supply chain networks; food policy and regulation; market 
infrastructure; consumer behaviour; operational capability; supply chain partnerships; Information 
technology; supply chain insecurity; food characteristics. 
Keywords

I. Introduction
Since the existent of human beings’ food and its production have been an important daily element of survival. The 
food processing sector is globally a critical key element for economic growth and wealth (Godfray et al., 2010). Hence, 
the production planning process is a key player for company’s competitiveness and also meeting customers’ 
requirements as well as expectation. This is due to the fact that production planning includes all the stages from the 
raw material to after-sale product. When the process is well-maintained it can assist in increasing food supply by 
meeting the customer’s satisfaction and reducing customer’s dissatisfaction.  In light of this, decision makers in food 
processing companies are requires to efficiently and effectively manage all the phases associated with production 
process in order to avoid any setback in the market. Particularly for the food production industry which is vital to any 
national state.   
II. Production planning
Production planning is one of the most important activities in manufacturing enterprises. Manufacturing companies
normally prepare a production plan at the end of every financial year for the next year (Lopez and Roubellat; 2008).
The plan is drawn with the objective of determining the number of goods to be generated for that financial year in
order to meet the demand in the market. In light of this, the production plan is generally drawn for weekly, monthly,
quarterly or even yearly basis in accordance with the customers demand. Additionally, Amponsah et al (2011) argue
that production planning is always designed on the availability of resources and market demand during a certain period
of time. Amponsah et al (2011) further informed that production planning main goal is solely based on satisfying
customers’ requirements such as the quality of the goods, delivery time, demand and supply. Furthermore, production
planning is also drawn in order to efficiently and effectively meets customer demand in the market at a minimum cost
(Amponsah et al., 2011).

Abstract 
This article aims to build sustainability in a biofuel supply chain. Ethanol is chosen to represent the 
biofuel and is assessed in terms of economic, environmental, and societal benefit feasibility. A unified 
optimization model of product, process and supply chain and life cycle assessment (LCA) is proposed to 
give the optimal solutions for sustainability. The decision parameters of process synthesis and logistics as 
well as raw materials production synthesize a closed loop economy. The techno-economic analysis 
embedded into the LCA so that the supply chain design achieves technical feasibility. The results show 
that integrated product and process design in the supply chain could achieve sustainability. Therefore it is 
proposed to extend further the design towards the SC contribution to energy grid of the local community.

1. Introduction
This article aims to build sustainability in a biofuel supply chain (SC). Sustainable SC covers not only sustainable 
production but also sustainable demand and supply. Sustainable biofuel is chosen since the fuel is necessary in the 
near future to replace fossil fuel to sustainably produce sustainable goods and services. However, nowadays the 
processing technology of biofuels SC is far from mature. In supply side, lignocellulose biomass are often used for 
other needs, for instances, in Indonesia farmers often use rice straws for fertilizer, feeding cattle, or even electricity 
production (Seabra and Macedo 2011). Therefore, no commercial rice straws to ethanol conversion but sugar cane in 
Indonesia and even worldwide, can be used as references (Perales et al., 2011). Indeed, the conversion of 
lignocellulose biomass into bio-fuel is expected reduce the combine-climate-change and health costs from $469 
million to $208 million (Hill et al., 2009). 
An integration of life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic optimization from cradle to grave, is proposed 
in this article to realize sustainable production that emphasizes on the environmental, societal and economic aspects 
of a firm’s actions (Tseng, 2013). The objective of the integration is to create circular economy that able to 1) reuse 
its own waste, 2) receive other industrial waste, and 3) generate local economy. In that sense, the assessment 
includes mass and energy balances, inputs and output analysis that could reduce emission inventory and carbon foot 
print.  
The study starts with a brief introduction to the definition and objective of BET supply chain from rice straw, their 
principles, and the objectives of this study. The remainder of this study is organized as follows: A theory of LCA is

Considering carbon emissions, the article benchmarks the emissions against literatures. It is shown in Figure 8 that 
the techno-economic analysis that is embedded into LCA is capable of reducing emissions significantly.

3. Conclusion 
 
This article combines techno-economic optimization and LCA in order to get an optimum solution towards 
sustainable supply chain. The integration needs a detail process design from raw materials extraction to final product 
end-of-life. Due to the complexity of production and supply chain networks, the article proposes a solution method 
that could address the computational challenge. A case study from a developing country is taken into consideration. 
The outputs of the analysis is interpreted in terms of its usability in real applications. Therefore, this article suggests 
standard operations of ethanol production from syngas fermentation technology.  
 
For future recommendations, the analysis could be extended further by looking forward of energy integration 
between the proposed technology and other green production technology to meet local community energy demand 
so that the supply chain support local community sustainability.

Abstract  
The last two decades has placed emphasis on services and the delivery of quality services to customers.  The notion 
that organizational culture impacts on service quality, which in turn influences customer satisfaction and 
organizational performance, has gained widespread acceptance in both academia and organizational practices.  
Therefore, the purpose of the study was to establish the existing culture which is adopted in an organization based in 
the electrical energy industry.   This organization was selected to study the impact of culture on service quality.  
This is a survey based research study. Primary data was gathered with the aid of a questionnaire. Data collected 
included dimensions of organizational culture (involvement, consistency, adaptability, and mission) and dimensions 
of service quality (Tangibles, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance and Empathy). Organizational culture and 
service quality are considered the main variables of this study. Sample size is (n=96), 61 respondents completed and 
returned the questionnaires, therefore the response rate was moderately low at 63.5%.   Descriptive statistical 
analysis, correlation and regression analysis have been utilized to determine the relations between organizational 
culture and service quality. The overall findings reveal that organizational culture has a strong significant impact on 
service quality levels within this organization. 
 
Keywords Organizational culture, service quality, correlation 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Service quality within organizations cannot be over-emphasized, it is not voluntary rather a must have to boast 
economic performance (Tsoukatos, 2011). Service quality from (Aftab, Sarwar, Sultan, Qadeer, 2016) means the 
degree to which customer’s expectations have been met, “It is comparison between expected and perceived service”. 
Good quality service guarantees satisfied customers. Good quality service can be achieved when a quality 
management system which is a mechanism to manage and continually improve quality of products and services 
(James & William, 2014) is integrated within business processes. 
Quality management system provides confidence to customers that organizations are in control of their processes. 
With that assurance customers believe that organizations will be able to consistently meet their requirements and 
even strive to exceed them. A very disappointing behavior though, is that organizations implement quality 
management system just for certification or “a badge on the wall” not with the customer in mind (James & William, 
2014). The beautiful systems don’t seem effective because the change that is brought about quality management 
system is hardly embraced. While treating quality management system as an add-on without integrating it into 
business processes, one of the benefits the organization misses out is the ability to consistently meet customer’s 
requirements which helps to instill confidence in both the customer and organization, in turn leading to more 
customers, more sales, and more repeat business.

5. 
Conclusion 
There are several factors which influence service quality but this study focused on organizational culture. The study 
arrived at the following findings after conducting the study: 
 
 
Employees are not clear of what is expected of them in their roles, and they are not aware of the customer 
requirements, however it has been determined that there is a significant relationship between organizational 
culture and service quality, this has created more awareness and understanding amongst employees. 
 
The qualitative analysis found that organizational culture plays a significant role on service quality and 
there is a strong positive correlation between the independent and dependent variables of the study.

Abstract  
Manufacturing organizations strive to be the industry leaders with regard to the products and services they 
offer. In order for these organizations to become industry leaders, they should master the requirements of 
their customers. The purpose of this study was to identify the major factors which affect consumer buying 
behavior of durable household products in the Kempton Park region, which is located in the East-rand of 
Johannesburg, South Africa.  The findings of the study will provide the manufacturer of durable 
household products with an indication of influencing factors when designing and developing their 
products. The influencing factors that were identified in this study include product quality, products 
features, cost of the product, brand reputation, advertisement and previous experience. Questionnaires 
were used as a method for data collection and a non-random sample of 60 respondents were considered. 
This study was utilized as an opportunity to determine whether gender had an impact on purchasing 
behavior.  Hypothesis testing was used as a method of analysis, wherein it was found that product quality, 
product features and cost price are the most common determinants of consumer buying behavior. The 
findings further indicated that gender has no significant effect on their buying behavior.  Manufacturers 
could utilize the outcomes of this study and translate them into better, improved products in order to stay 
competitive.

Introduction 
 
1.1 Consumer behavior 
Consumer behavior is the practice used when individuals, groups, or organizations select, use, or dispose of the 
product, service, ideas or experience to fulfil their needs and requirements (Solomon, 1993). Organizations study 
consumer behavior to obtain information on how customers make decisions and choose their products. Organizations 
should understand consumer behavior in order to attain industrial success.  The relationship between the consumer 
behavior and marketing strategy is stressed because successful marketing strategy is dependent on the managers’ 
understanding on consumers’ behavior (Furaiji et al, 2012 and Haghshenas et al, 2013). The focus of the marketing 
department is to understand the needs and demands of the consumer and translate those needs into superior quality 
products. The consumers buying decision serves as an indication of how well the organizations’ marketing suits the 
market demand. Therefore marketing starts and end with consumers. In this study, the consumer plays three 
distinctive roles such as the user, payer and buyer. Armstrong (2000) has emphasized the difficulties experienced in 
predicting consumer behavior.   Consumers are exposed to a diversity of durable products, which varies in price, 
quality, features, appearance and size (Gizaw, 2014). 
 
1.2    Factors influencing buying decision. 
The factors known to influence consumers buying decision includes cultural factors, social factors, personal and 
psychological factors and marketing mix.

Conclusion and Recommendation 
This study has proven that consumer preferences changes with a variety durable goods. The most important factors 
were founds to be features in television purchases, price in refrigerator purchases, quality in stove and other 
furniture purchases. For television purchases, 32% of the respondents considered features as their most inducing 
factor, 27% of the respondents want something that is durable and reliable (quality).  
 
There’s a bit of balance between cost price and quality as the considered factors when purchasing refrigerator. 32% 
of the respondents considered cost price whereas 30% considered quality. This makes both the variables equally 
important in this case. When making purchase on stove, 30% of the consumers considers quality as their most 
important factor. Consumers believe stove should always be in a functional state and last for longer period no matter 
the cost price. 
 
For other household furniture such as lounge suits, bedroom suits, etc. quality plays an important role in the eyes of 
radurability and reliability of the item. Quality is not only limited to durability and reliability, but also after sales 
service such as guarantee and warranty forms part of it.  Features, cost price and quality were found to be the most 
dominating factor that influence the consumer buying decision. Therefore manufactures should strongly consider 
these three elements in order to sustain their business, increase market share and gain market superiority.  Therefore 
consumer buying decision of durable goods is influenced by product quality, features, and cost price .The findings 
of this study have also statistically proven that female purchase decisions does not significantly differ from those of 
male at 95% confidence level. Therefore manufacturers don’t have to consider gender when designing their 
products.

Abstract 
Because we usually deal with real - world systems with real - world constraints (cost, computer resources, 
size, weight, power, heat dissipation, etc.), it is understood that the simplest method to accomplish a task 
is the one that should be used. Experts usually rely on common sense when they solve problems. They 
also use vague and ambiguous terms. Other experts have no difficulties with understanding and 
interpreting this statement because they have the background to hearing problems described like this. 
However, a knowledge engineer would have difficulties providing a computer with the same level of 
understanding. In a complex industrial process, how can we represent expert knowledge that uses vague 
and fuzzy terms in a computer to control it? In this work, the application is developed to control the 
pretreatment and pasteurization station of milk localized in Batna (Algeria) by adopting a control 
approach based on expert knowledge and fuzzy logic.

1. Introduction
The overall process control objectives, such as the quality and the quantity of product, have been left in the hands of 
human operators in the past. Nowadays, computational intelligence has been used to solve many complex problems 
by developing intelligent systems, extracting expert’s knowledge. Fuzzy logic has proved to be a powerful tool for 
decision-making systems, especially expert and pattern classification systems. Fuzzy set theory has been used in some 
chemical processes. In traditional rule-based approaches, knowledge is encoded in form of antecedent-consequent 
structure. When new data are encountered, it is matched to the antecedent's clause of each rule, and those rules where 
antecedents match a data exactly are fired, establishing the consequent clauses.  
This process continues until the desired conclusion is reached, or no new rule can be fired. In the past decade, fuzzy 
logic has proved to be useful for intelligent systems in chemical engineering. Most control situations are more 
complex than we can deal with mathematically. In this situation, fuzzy control can be developed, providing a body of 
knowledge about the existing control process, in the form of a number of fuzzy rules. Fuzzy logic is used for the early 
detection of hazardous states and for the implementation of logic decision-making.  
In this work, the expert’s knowledge was extracted and fuzzy logic was integrated in the SCADA system to control an 
industrial process, milk production, to resolve problems and replace the old supervision system by a new architecture. 
The advantages of this architecture is its flexibility in control, its ability to data process a lot of information in order to 
improve the productivity and to reduce maintenance costs. In Section 2, related works concerning fuzzy logic are 
presented. Section 3 is dedicated to the case study and the proposed approach. The implementation and the results of 
the developed system are discussed in Section 4. We conclude and discuss the results in a conclusion.

Conclusion 
Presently, companies often require innovative solutions to make their plant operating systems function at peak 
efficiency. Using latest in equipment technology, resources, and materials. However, complex industrial processes are 
difficult to control because of inadequate knowledge of their behavior. This lack of knowledge is principally a lack of 
structural detail and it is this, which prevents the use of conventional control theory. However, a human operator who 
makes decisions based on inexact and linguistic measures of the process state often controls these processes with 
great skill. Fuzzy logic is considered as a superset of standard logic, which is extended to deal with the partial truth. It 
has become one of the most successful technologies for developing complex control systems. Fuzzy logic is a logic 
that describes fuzziness. As fuzzy logic attempts to model humans’ sense of words, decision-making and common 
sense, it is leading to more human intelligent machines. Therefore, it reflects how people think and attempts to model 
the sense of words and decisions. As a result, it is leading to new, more human, intelligent systems. Therefore, to 
improve control system reliability and availability, we implemented all solutions by creating a supervisory system, 
and we applicate different steps to ensure a fuzzy control of the system. The main objective of these solutions is to 
improve the old system. The solutions given are divided into two types. The first is a material solution and we 
proposed a feedback circuit implemented in each section with solenoid valves to automate the system. In addition, we 
proposed some equipment needed to implement the application. The second one is a software solution in where fuzzy 
logic has been used as a technique to control the milk production process. The augmented productivity in the factory, 
minimum downtime, reduced costs of maintenance are improved the advantages of our solutions.

Abstract 
 
Nowadays, airline transportation takes the first place. It seems that competition has recently 
increased with the establishment of many new airline companies and the enrichment of existing 
airline fleets. That includes the number of pilots, the number of flight crew, the number of 
ground personnel, and so on, and consequently increases the costs. Redesigning and scheduling 
of aircraft fleet networks by firms is considered as a solution to reduce costs. Simulation studies 
are carried out by using advanced computer aided programs. As a result, flight scheduling 
problem which is also called flight punctuation problem, constitutes the most important basic 
problem to be solved. Route planning optimizes the most cost-effective route. In this study, fleet 
scheduling and crew scheduling concepts of the transit flight route of the airline company were 
examined with the help of simulation and the studies were focused on.

1. Introduction 
Route planning is a problem of finding the best route between two flight points on a map. Eligibility criteria are the 
length and time that affect cost. The weather conditions and the returning position of the world affect the time and 
distance between the two cities. Air traffic is also affects the flight route and its duration in a negative way. Most 
airlines have monthly flight schedules. Seasonal changes are taken into account in changing market requirements 
and flight schedule design, fleet designation, flight order selection, crew mapping, and ground personnel scheduling 
flight schedules. In large airline companies, this process is complicated. In order to facilitate this process, it is 
usually practiced to divide into several sub plans. The main purpose of flight scheduling is to reduce operating costs 
to the lowest under specific constraints. For this purpose, simulation methods (such as the Arena program) can be 
used. In this study, the flights of the airline company examined from İzmir to Antalya (connected via İstanbul) were 
examined. Simulation studies have been done for low (50 %) and high (75 %) capacity flights. The distance between 
the flight legs of the fleet and the flight module will perform with the process module is selected as Triangular in the 
Delay Type section.  The minimum time of 45 minutes, the average time of 60 minutes and the maximum time of 75 
minutes are determined as the time of departure from İzmir.

As can be seen from these results, serious waiting and losses exist on the route. Various attempts can be made in the 
simulation model to reduce lost and increase the number of flights with improvement studies to be made. 
 
6. Conclusions 
The data obtained from the iron was evaluated in the Arena program. It has been accepted that the flights are carried 
out with a transfer from İstanbul. Thus, the number of flights realized during the day was increased after the 
preliminary determination was made. With the increase in the number of flights, the profit will be increased in the 
right proportion and the airline company will be profitable. As a continuation of the study, it is aimed that the 
problem of locating is solved for more routes by using optimization methods by accepting certain constraints.

Abstract  
 
Obsolescence is highly complex problem due to the influence of many factors such as competitive market 
pressure, technological advancement and short life cycle of technological components. Basically, 
obsolescence problems are often sudden and not planned, causing delays and extra cost. To overcome this 
problem, forecasting appears to be one of the most efficient solutions. Indeed, many studies have been 
conducted to create models that can effectively forecast obsolescence. In addition, applying machine 
learning techniques have attracted many attentions and have been widely used to predict obsolescence 
risk and life cycle. Popular algorithms such as random forest, has been reporting satisfactory 
performance. To improve the accuracy of machine learning algorithms for obsolescence forecasting, this 
paper proposes a new optimization approach for obsolescence forecasting based on random forest (RF) 
and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In fact, parameters optimization and features selection of RF 
have an important effect on it is predictive accuracy and PSO presents one kind of effective method for 
RF parameters and features choosing. To examine the effectiveness of this approach, this paper presents a 
comparison between PSO-RF and GA-RF (random forest based on genetic algorithm). Experimental 
results show that PSO-RF outperformed GA-RF with 96% of accuracy.

1. Introduction 
 
Obsolescence issue occurs in systems that have a longer lifecycle than their components, such as in automotive, 
avionics, military, etc. The negative effects of obsolescence on the production performances have been studied in the 
literature and represent a major challenge in long term (Rojo, Roy, & Kelly, 2012; Rojo, Roy, & Shehab, 2010; 
Peter Sandborn, 2013; P. Sandborn, Prabhakar, & Ahmad, 2011). Rapid technological is one of the factors that 
increase the rate of obsolescence. The electronic industry has emerged as the fastest growing sector, and has spread 
widely around the world. As defined by Moore’s law, the rapid evolution of electronic components continues to 
grow, which stipulates that semiconductor density doubles approximately every 18 months (Voller & Porté-Agel, 
2002). This evolution creates new electronic components every year with short lifetimes. In the USA, the industry 
has grown at a rapid rate since the 1990s. New technologies are introduced in the market at increasing rates. Today, 
the short lifecycle and the lack of forecasting represent a challenge for several companies that need to take into 
account the risk of obsolescence. Moreover, obsolescence modeling is a complex problem that requires a good 
knowledge of parts. In the same way, it is necessary to know the lifetime of the components, their technological 
evolutions and, therefore, know all the factors that influence the obsolescence of components to understand how 
obsolescence may occur. These factors can include component criticality, technological watching, technological 
maturity, and the number of sources among others.

The result obtained from the PSO-RF model proves that the prediction through parameters optimization and 
choosing the best small features can improve significantly the classification accuracy of the RF. The experiments 
results were compared with RF-PSO and RF. PSO-RF approach yielded a higher classification accuracy rate 
compared to the other approaches. Thus, PSO-RF yielded more appropriate subset with few iteration. 
Figure 2 shows the Receiver Operator Characteristic curve, that presents the false positive rate vs. true positive rate. 
These curves present as follows: green, blue, orange for PSO-RF, RF and GA-RF respectively. 
 
Figure 2. ROC curve 
  
The use of feature selection and parameter optimization were found to improve the classification accuracy rate 
for random forest to improve the forecasting of obsolescence risk. Experimental results show that PSO-RF has better 
performance than that of GA-RF. 
 
5. Conclusion  
 
This paper presents an improved approach for obsolescence forecasting risk with a high degree of accuracy based on 
machine learning and meta-heuristic PSO. PSO search for the optimal parameter value for RF to obtain a subset of 
beneficial features. The optimal set features were adopted for the training and testing of RF model to improve the 
classification accuracy of the model. In order to validate this approach, PSO-RF was compared to RF and GA-RF. 
Experimental results show that PSO-RF outperformed GA-RF with 96% of accuracy. 
For future work, larger data with more features can give more accurate results. Other datasets and real-world 
problems for obsolescence forecasting can be tested using this approach.  
Other optimization algorithms can also be used, such as ant colony which is widely used for optimization, and 
compare it with the existing approach.

Abstract  
In oncology departments in hospitals, chemotherapy is one of the primary treatments besides 
radiotherapy and surgery. Depending on the care protocol, patients need to visit the hospital several 
times to get the drug infusion which could take from 30 minutes to 8 hours. During a hospital 
appointment, patients go through procedures that may involve various hospital resources. Due to the 
limited capacity of these resources as well as an increasing number of patients, long waiting times are 
quite common and cause a negative effect on the quality of care. In this study, we analyze the 
chemotherapy patient flows an oncology center in Lille (COL), France using Discrete Event 
Simulation (DES). This simulation study integrates numerous hospital resources as well as different 
sources of uncertainty to achieve a more practical model. The data for DES are obtained from three 
sources: electronic health records, expert opinions, and a time study. The simulation results allow us to 
assess the performance of the current system at COL based on two performance measures: average 
patient waiting time, and nurse utilization. This simulation work will also be used as a basis to 
evaluate scheduling algorithms proposed for COL to improve chemotherapy patient flow and better 
utilize hospital resources.

Conclusion and future works 
Patient waiting time in chemotherapy treatments is considerable in some cases and has a negative impact on the 
quality of care. This study uses DES to analyze the current system of an oncology center in Lille (France). The 
simulation model integrates various hospital resources and involved processes of chemotherapy patient flows. 
Simulation results show that the patient waiting time is mainly caused by two reasons: time for drug preparation 
and time for available chairs. Three policies are proposed to improve the performance of the current system: 
Simulation results show that Policy 3, which is a combination of Policy 1 and Policy 2, can reduce patient 
waiting time significantly. This simulation study is a baseline for future works of authors. In particular, the 
patient arrival rate can be solved optimally by combining simulation and a mathematical model to minimize the 
patient waiting time.

Abstract 
The decision of facility location selection for a manufacturing organization affects for a long term on 
business profitability. This decision is based on many conflicting factors of tangible and intangible nature. 
Location decision once taken is very difficult to be reversed for the organizations. Therefore, facility 
location selection is predominant strategic decision domain for the manufacturing organizations. Such 
complex decisions can be made by application of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. 
Various MCDM methods have previously been used to solve such problems. In this paper, a real time 
case study is presented for selection of the most suitable plant location site for a private sugar production 
unit using desirability function approach. This approach is based on a concept of determining global 
attractiveness of an alternative in the form of overall desirability. The estimated response models for 
different decision criteria are converted into individual desirability functions using exponential 
transformation process, that are further aggregated into a composite function. The results derived by using 
desirability function approach are then confirmed by application of utility concept method, which exactly 
corroborate with each other. Additionally, single dimensional weight sensitivity analysis proves 
robustness of the results generated using this approach. 
Keywords: Facility Location selection, Utility Concept, Desirability Approach 
1. Introduction
The present day global business environment enforces the manufacturing organizations to make accurate 
decisions on various managerial activities. Facility location selection is one of the most important strategic 
decisions, as it is concerned with very high investments, and cannot be reverted easily, once executed. Also, the 
facility location decision entails a long term commitment, and has a great impact on productivity, operating costs 
and profits of the organizations. The chosen location maintains a major influence on competitive performance of the 
manufacturing organizations for decades. Requirement for fulfillment of additional contemporary constraints, 
induced due to introduction of new production systems, like just-in-time manufacturing, supply chain management 
and lean manufacturing, has further boosted the significance of facility location selection decisions. Therefore, to 
make the manufacturing organizations perform in the most beneficial way over a long term period, facility location 
selection decisions need to be treated very accurately. 
Facility location selection is the determination of a geographical site on which to locate an organization’s 
operations (facilities), such as factories/plants, retail outlets, warehouses, distribution centers and storage yards. 
Organizations need such decisions to locate, relocate or expand their operations. Such types of geographical 
decisions are usually dealt by location theory, which addresses questions of what economic activities are located

The criteria weights obtained using entropy method are static, however, they depend upon the 
performances of alternatives with respect to the decision criteria. In this problem, since the performances with 
respect to five out of six decision criteria are chosen by DMs, it includes subjectivity and biasness with the DMs 
perceptions. Therefore, a weight sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effects of changes in criteria weights 
on the final rankings of the alternatives. Sensitivity analysis on weights shows the stability of the derived solutions 
with respect to changes in the criteria weights. In this research work, non-proportional weight sensitivity analysis is 
performed to investigate the effects of varied criteria weights on the final rankings of the alternatives.  
For this non-proportional additive single dimensional weight sensitivity analysis, the most important 
criterion is first identified as ‘PRM’ because of its highest priority weight, and the sensitivity analysis is then carried 
out while varying the weight of this criterion within a range of 0 ≤ wPRM ≤ 0.8257. Beyond the upper limit of wPRM, 
the weight of criterion ‘AL’ becomes negative. Therefore, the weight of criterion ‘PRM’ is varied between 0 and 
0.8257 in steps of 0.1, as shown in Table 8. While increasing or decreasing the weight of ‘PRM’ criterion, the same 
amount is equally apportioned among the weights of other criteria maintaining the weight additivity constraint. 
 
Figure 3 Weight sensitivity analysis 
Now, after computing the new sets of criteria weights, the ranking performances of the alternative facility 
locations are reevaluated, as displayed in Figures 3. From this figure, it is observed that the ranking of alternative 
PL2 is maintained over a range of 0 ≤ wPRM ≤ 0.6, but when wPRM ≥ 0.6, location PL3 becomes the top rank. The 
ranking performances of the other alternative facility locations also do not show much variation during weight 
variation. The obtained results for the facility location selection problem are therefore definite.  
 
7. Conclusions 
This paper presents a desirability function-based approach for facility location selection problem from a set 
of candidate alternatives in manufacturing environment. This method is based on the quality characteristic values of 
the considered location alternatives for arriving at the satisfactory results. The basic concept of desirability function 
is to convert a multi-objective problem into a single objective function with the consideration of overall desirability. 
This concept uses individual desirability and overall desirability. The higher value of overall desirability indicates 
the best alternative. One real time facility location selection example is considered to demonstrate the application 
competence and suitability of the proposed method. The result obtained using the desirability function-based method 
almost substantiate with those derived by utility theory method which signify that this method is an efficient 
approach as compared to other well established facility location selection methods like AHP, VIKOR, 
PROMETHEE, TOPSIS, ELECTRE etc in which most of these techniques either require very lengthy computations 
involving pair-wise comparisons or they need some preferential parameters to be defined which may be very 
complicated for the decision makers in practical situations. Also, a non-proportional weight sensitivity analysis is 
performed to examine the robustness of the proposed method.

The weighted desirability values and overall desirability scores for the alternative plant locations are given 
in Table 7. Based on the overall desirability scores, the ranking of the alternative locations is obtained as PL2-PL3-
PL1-PL4-PL5. Hence, PL2 is found as the best location for the proposed sugar plant employing the desirability 
function approach. In order to confirm validity of the results obtained using desirability function approach, the same 
problem is also attempted by utility concept method. It is derived that the ranking preferences of the alternative 
facility locations achieved by solving the same problem using utility concept method exactly corroborate with the 
results of desirability function approach.   
 
6. Sensitivity Analysis 
 
 
The scores obtained by application of desirability function approach are observed to be an opaque function 
of the criteria weights. The impact of variation in criteria weights on the output of desirability function approach can 
be analyzed by performing weight sensitivity analysis.

ABSTRACT 
Green public procurement (GPP) in South African local government is still at its infancy stage. The municipalities of 
City of Johannesburg (CoJ), Cape Town, eThekwini, Ekurhuleni, Nelson Mandela Bay and Tshwane (all members of 
International Council for Local Government Initiatives (ICLEI) committed in 2002 at the World Conference on 
Sustainable Development (WSSD) to pursue some form of GPP, however none of these municipalities has developed 
a fully-fledged policy on GPP.  
GPP is one of the new strategies that are being adopted globally to assist local governments in providing solutions for 
sustainable development and to embrace the green economy through the implementation of long-term sustainable 
policies and strategies. The incorporation of green procurement elements into current supply chain policies of 
municipalities can be the first and most inexpensive step in achieving a successful green procurement programs. 
Municipalities spend a large portion of their budget on procurement and if they use their purchasing power by choosing 
to procure environmentally friendly goods and services, they can make an important contribution to sustainable 
consumption and production. The integration of green criteria in local government procurement would provide 
opportunities for: improved efficiency, reduced resource use, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, cost savings and 
enhanced environmental and social outcomes. The aim of the research is to determine factors that affect 
implementation of GPP practices in local government and it concludes that there is a need to confront lack of 
knowledge and training as critical in driving the implementation of  GPP. 
Key words: Green Public Procurement, training and awareness, local government,  management practices, green 
procurement.

Abstract 
The purpose of this project is to realize the importance of plastic shredder for what they serve, realize that 
the work can get done faster and more efficient when plastics are crushed. The use of machinery is critical 
for business that is why this machine will be elaborated in order to have more efficient performance for the 
company and make plastic garbage more effective at the time of operation. The shredder blade is optimized 
for better grinding of the plastic waste into fine grained particles. It requires less labor work and there is no 
requirement skilled labor in industry. In recycling, process of plastic waste required low energy due to 
compact form of plastic waste. It reduces the process time in industry. The machine used in this project is 
less of cost and thus the project is a cost effective one.

1. Introduction
Plastics are synthetic organic materials produced by polymerization. They are typically of high molecular mass and
may contain other substances besides polymers to improve performance and or reduce costs. These polymers can be
moulded or extruded into desired shapes. Among the two types of plastics, Thermoplastics can repeatedly soften and
melt if enough heat is applied and hardened on cooling, so that they can be made into new plastics products.
Thermosetting plastics can melt and take shape only once. They are not suitable for repeated heat treatments, therefore
after they have solidified, they stay solid. Depending on their structures the pre-treatment equipment used for each
type of plastic (crushing or shredding) is often different. The recycling of a virgin plastic material can be done 2-3
times only, because, after every recycling, the strength of plastic material is reduced due to thermal degradation. In
India approximately 12 Million tonnes plastic products are consumed every year (2012) which is expected to raise 20
million tonnes by 2020. Since this consumption is rising higher and higher, the shredding is more upgraded to make
this process easier. Industrial shredding is a process used for reducing the size of all kinds of materials that area
considered to be scrap. The Industrial shredders come in many different design variations and many sizes based on
the requirements. Though the size of the blades and the machines varies, the shape of the blades remind unchanged.
The following is the new design of the shredder blade and analyses of the blade.
2. Methodology
This project is based on the idea to shred waste plastics for easy processing and disposal. Initially the shredding blade
is designed in CAD and then the manufacturing process is carried on. The blade design of the shredder is designed for
conventional cutting of the waste plastics and their easy disposal. Later the manufactured blade is being analysed in
the analyses software for the theoretical results of the characteristics of the shredder blade. The following block
diagram indicates the order of design and fabrication process that has been carried in the optimization of shredder
blade.

10. Shredding Process
The shredding process which is the type of cutting down the scrap by running the blade at a fixed speed which is being
run by the motor which is coupled with the reduction motor. But it is hard to cut down the plastic directly by the
shredder blades with small serrated edges. From the time of invention of the shredding process the scrap such as plastic
is being processed by some treatment to bring down the strength of the plastic to the level of being cut-down easily.
The following are the processes carried out before shredding process: Incineration, Autoclaving, Shredding. But the
process of incineration and autoclaving reduces the quality of the product that is to be shredded. In order to reduce the
variation in quality during the shredding process, the serrated edges made with increased surface area and hard tool
steel. The thickness of the blade is not more than 5mm. Thus, the shredded pieces that are obtained after shredding
are less than or equal to 5mm thickness.
Since these pieces are equal to or less than 5mm in size, there is no need to treat the products with heat, which do not 
reduce the quality of the material. Thus, these pieces can be directly fed into the injection moulding machine. This 
doesn’t use high temperature on the products, which result in a good quality product after the moulding process. This 
process enables to use the recycled product many times than before since the grade doesn’t very much.    
11. Conclusion
The plastic shredder machine is widely used in industries for the plastic waste management. By using this plastic
shredding machine, the overall costing of recycling process gets reduced. The new design of the blade that is shown
above increases the efficiency of the plastic shredding. The life time of this design of the blade is much higher than
the previous designs of blades that is being used currently. In recycling process of plastic, waste required low energy
due to compact form of plastic waste. This new design of blade reduces the process time considerably than the other
blades.  As this blade has more resistance against the deformation and principal stresses than the previous designs,
this serves as a better part in the shredder machine.

Abstract  
 
Productivity is well-known to be of a great importance to companies and researchers’ alike, 
possessing high levels of productivity is the key to long term prosperity. However, it is well 
established as an ongoing challenge facing the construction industry. Although many studies have 
examined factors affecting productivity, there is still no consensus among researchers on a clear 
solution to improve productivity, with the research implying that the productivity levels of the 
industry have not improved compared to other industries. Indeed, this has been seen in studies of the 
last few decades and suggested motivation as a key factor linked to labor productivity. Thus, this 
study provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature on the motivational factors affecting 
productivity globally. The factors presented in this study are discussed in terms of the current 
motivation models, worker management plans, work environment, and empowerment and incentives. 
This study concludes with recommendations to improve productivity of construction workers in terms 
of extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, communication between the management and workers, and the 
systematic flow of work.

Abstract 
 
Ergonomics is the science that studies the system integrated by the worker, the production means and the 
work environment, so that the work is efficient and appropriate to the psycho-physiological abilities of the 
worker, promoting their health and achieving their satisfaction (Viña, 1985). In Cuba there is an increase 
in the number of occupational accidents and diseases, and although there are no official data indicating a 
cause-effect relationship between these events and ergonomic risks, it is verified, in studies carried out, 
that these risks are not identified and have a high impact on the health and safety of workers. The 
ergonomic risk is the correlation between the probability of occurrence of adverse events and the severity 
of the effect on the worker, the organization and the environment, by the action of the hazards that limit 
the system worker-production means-labor environment (W-MP-E). Therefore, the objective of the paper 
is to design a procedure for the ergonomic risks management, with a process approach, in organizations. 
The procedure follows the logic of the management cycle, allows the detection, evaluation and control of 
risks in the system W-MP-E, and proposes techniques and methods for this.

Abstract 
The requirements for timely information on the reliability of product components and materials facilitate 
the use of accelerated degradation test (ADT). The ADT approach supports the experimenter in drawing 
quick inference on the lifetime distribution of testing units at normal use condition. This paper provides an 
Excel add-in program (called RExADT) for analysis of ADT data. RExADT is designed to support two 
popular ADT approaches: single-stage and two-stage approach. RExADT is implemented in Visual Basic 
for Applications (VBA) and R based on the R-EXCEL environment.  RExADT is expected to help the users 
with diverse backgrounds perform the ADT analysis conveniently with a familiar graphical user interface 
in Excel.

1. Introduction
Reliability test has been conducted to obtain product lifetime data in manufacturing industries. For some tests, 
covariate information, which is related to the wear on the product during the reliability test, is available. The wear 
measurement (or degradation) can be the physical parameters of the product (e.g., corrosion thickness on a metal plate 
(Bogdano and Kozin 1985)) or mere indicators of product performance (e.g., the luminosity of an organic light 
emitting diodes). As sufficient time-to-failure data cannot be secured for highly reliable products, degradation data 
have been widely used to provide inference on product lifetime distribution from the degradation data. General 
references for degradation models and their applications can be found in Nelson (1990) and Meeker and Escobar 
(1998). Recently, Ye and Xie (2015) reviewed two broad categories of degradation models; a stochastic process model 
and a general path model, and they comprehensively compared advantages and disadvantages of these two modeling 
approaches.  
Degradation test is closely tied with an accelerated life test (ALT) in that both methods have evolved to suit reliability 
tests for which product lifetimes are expected to last far beyond testing duration. ALT expedites product failures within 
a relatively short time by stressing testing units beyond their normal use condition. For modern highly reliable 
products, however, few failures are expected even at elevated testing conditions during the allotted testing time. For 
timely information on the reliability of product components and materials, the accelerated degradation test (ADT) can 
be used. The ADT approach combines degradation analysis and ALT by testing products in harsher environments and 
measuring the evidence of product degradation during the accelerated test. In general, the ADT model is built on the 
relationship between stresses and parameters of the presumed model for empirical or theoretical degradation paths.

The previous three sections include the preparation steps. This section provides the reliability analysis which is a 
major function in RExADT. As described in Section 2, RExADT uses single-stage and two-stage approach to analyze 
ADT data. In the spreadsheet ‘4. Reliability Analysis’, the user can choose “ADT Analysis (Single-stage approach)” 
or “Approximate ADT Analysis (Two-stage approach)”. After selecting one of them, the user needs to enter the 
percentile of the lifetime distribution of interest, and choose a reference measurement unit. Then, clicking the button, 
Reliability Analysis, creates a new window according to user's selection. Figure 5 shows the respective analysis 
windows for each approach. 
 
ADT analysis (Single-stage approach) 
As described in Section 2, approximate ADT analysis (two-stage approach) is required to estimate both lifetime of 
each sample according to acceleration levels and lifetime under an operating condition in two steps. However, ADT 
analysis allows the program to directly estimate lifetimes under a normal operating condition from degradation data, 
thus it provides accurate estimate for lifetime distribution. The program primarily provides the ADT analysis using 
the Arrhenius model. Clicking the button, Analysis allows the program to preprocess the degradation data, to check 
fitness of the ADT model, and then show quantitative results on the left side and plots on the right side of the window. 
 Similar to approximate ADT analysis, two tables on the top of the results provide the lifetime under the normal 
operating condition and its confidence interval with a significance level 5% according to a percentile the user specified. 
In ADT analysis, for example, the fifth percentile of the lifetime under the normal condition (i.e., 25 C) is 214.2107 
weeks, and upper and lower bounds of its confidence interval with a significance level 5% are 163.0223 and 265.3990 
weeks, respectively. The bottom part of the result also shows the fitness result of the ADT model based on the 
maximum likelihood method. As shown in Figure 4, a probability plot and a relation plot are provided to show 
reliability analysis.

Figure 4: Result windows: (a) ADT analysis and (b) Approximate ADT analysis 
 
Approximate ADT analysis (Two-stage approach) 
The current version of the program is allowed to use the Arrhenius model as an acceleration model and the Weibull 
distribution as a failure-time distribution. Pressing the button, Analysis, enables the program to process the followings 
in the order: (1) preprocessing data that is obtained from the spreadsheet, 3. Pseudo-failure data, (2) checking fitness 
of the Arrhenius model and the Weibull distribution, then (3) showing the results. 
Two tables on the top of the results show the lifetimes under the normal operating condition, and its confidence interval 
with a significance level 5%. For example, the fifth percentile of the lifetime under normal operating condition (i.e., 
25 C) is 230.2155 weeks and upper and lower bounds of its confidence interval with a significance level 5% are 
171.5633 and 288.8678 weeks, respectively. The bottom part of the result shows the fitness of pseudo ALT model 
based on the maximum likelihood method. As shown in Figure 5(b), a probability plot and a relation plot on the right 
side of the window enable the user to analyze product reliability easily.  
 
4. Conclusion 
Degradation data analysis can improve reliability analysis compared to traditional failure-time analysis (Lu, Meeker, 
and Escobar 1996) and also provide further information related to failure mechanisms for testing items. Despite its 
1737","overall advantage against the traditional failure-time analysis, ADT has been hardly expended to an application context 
due to the lack of appropriate tool supports. This paper provides an Excel add-in program, called RExADT, for analysis 
of accelerated degradation tests. RExADT is implemented in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and R based on 
the R-EXCEL environment, which provides a middleware between R and EXCEL and is developed by Baier and 
Neuwirth (2007). RExADT makes the users with diverse backgrounds to perform ADT analysis easier in a familiar 
working environment. Using RExADT, the users can enter, edit, and visualize ADT data in spreadsheets, as well as 
perform ADT analysis through Excel. 
Although RExADT presented in this paper mainly uses the linear-Arrhenius ADT model for the single-stage approach 
and the linear-Weibull model for the two-stage approach, it can be customized further to provide a tailored data 
analysis depending on degradation data and degradation models. In addition, as aforementioned in Section 3.4, ADT 
models are nonlinear in nature, an initial parameters of optimization solver within the program might be customized 
with domain-specific knowledge according to the degradation data types.

Abstract 
An analysis of modern approaches to knowledge management and risk management in project-oriented 
organizations is presented. An integrated knowledge loss risk management model is proposed that 
combines the main elements of the Fraunhofer IPK knowledge management model and project risk 
management model in accordance with the PMBOK methodology. The proposed model for project 
knowledge management is implemented through the identification, prioritization of the risk of loss of 
knowledge for the purpose of the project and its prevention.

1. Introduction
At the stage of the transition from the industrial to the post-industrial (informational) phase of the world economy, 
traditional management approaches based on predictability, standardization and streamlining of production 
processes are shifting to instruments that are consistent with the uniqueness and dynamics of the modern 
information society. Under the new conditions, the focus is shifted from management of material flows and 
inventories to intangibles, that is, information management, corporate culture, mental models of employees, and 
others.  
The high intensity of obtaining new knowledge by the employees of project organizations requires the creation of 
such system (Ajmal, 2010), which will remove, store and disseminate the knowledge gained as a result of project 
implementation, preventing the loss of knowledge associated with staff turnover. Project risk management (RM) is 
impossible without taking into account the importance of organizational knowledge: Identifying and responding to 
risk factors in each organization depends on its intellectual capital, that is, on the knowledge and experience of the 
staff. Past experience of employees gained in certain situations can help predict potential events, so decision-making 
requires the removal and storage of knowledge that affects the speed of risk identification and response. 
The uniqueness of the project and its limited time are the main barriers to organizational learning in the 
implementation of the project approach. In addition, projects by their nature are not interconnected, unlike 
operational processes, which can lead to fragmentation of organizational knowledge and experience 
(Koskinen, 2010). Due to the barriers listed, processes related to the preservation of project knowledge are necessary 
for project-oriented organizations. The author of the paper (Jugdev, 2014) argues that project management and 
knowledge management (KM) should complement each other and create new competitive advantages for the 
organization.  
Thus, the features of the combination of knowledge management and risk management tools in the project 
environment, including to prevent the risk of loss of organizational knowledge, remain insufficiently studied.  
Based on the analysis of the literature and taking into account previous developments in this area, it is necessary to 
create a comprehensive model that combines the approaches of knowledge management and risk management in the 
project management process. 
The Statement of the Problem. The relevant scientific problem is the development and implementation of a model 
that allows managing the risk of loss of knowledge in project-oriented organizations.  The purpose of this article is 
to analyze approaches to designing knowledge management and risk management models in the project environment 
and to develop a model that allows analyzing and preventing the risk of loss of organizational knowledge.

Paris, France, July 26-27, 2018","8. Conclusions 
 
The paper has proposed a model that prevents the loss of critical knowledge of employees who, due to a number of 
reasons, can leave the organization (retirement, planned internal mobility, etc.). The integrated risk management 
model for loss of knowledge in the project environment combines knowledge and risk management components in 
the project, which allows identifying and preventing the risk of loss of knowledge in the project and thus reducing 
the negative impact on such key project indicators as cost, durability and quality.  
The model is used as a tool to support management decision making, a tool for planning and assessing the loss of 
knowledge in projects. In addition, the model allows to solve key issues regarding large volumes of newly created 
knowledge, access to informal knowledge of experts, and exchange of knowledge and best practices within the 
project and within the organization.   
The direction of further research is the development of tools for the preservation and dissemination of knowledge of 
those project participants who have high knowledge loss risk factors.

Abstract 
Control is essential for the hospital to achieve its objectives and goals, otherwise it would be impossible to define the 
measures that must be taken to achieve them. Objective: to control the activities as a component of internal control in a Cuban 
hospital entity, showing the best direction to follow when making decisions, with a low level of uncertainties in the results. 
Method: a model was designed through the Compensatory Fuzzy Logic, composed by the fundamental elements of the 
control activities norm. Result: the control activities in the hospital are in a deficient category of something true, negatively 
influencing staff turnover and performance indicators. Conclusions: the control management index was obtained, evidencing 
that there are notable deficiencies in its implementation, allowing the hospital to establish an improvement strategy based on 
an action plan. 
 
Keywords: internal control, control activities, diffuse compensatory logic, Cuban hospital entity 
Introduction 
It is an undoubted truth that the Cuban health system has reached a relevant importance on the world stage since the triumph of the 
Revolution, and that it represents a very important sector in the current Cuban economy. That is why our country graduates large numbers 
of doctors and health specialists every year, to meet their growing demand internationally.  
Although it is true that the fundamental limitation of the Cuban health system to meet its challenges and perspective is the complex 
economic situation that the country is going through, which is notoriously aggravated by the economic and social blockade imposed for 
several decades. Cuba's achievements in the field of public health, accumulated in more than fifty years, are compared with those achieved 
by many developed countries. Given its obvious growth, it is vitally important to have institutions that function well, comparable with the 
quality of our professionals. To achieve this, adequate internal control is needed; parallel to this, innovative tools are both effective and 
flexible, that allow for their evaluation, are also needed. 1.2  
The controls fulfill a fundamental role to carry out that goal, since these means of control do not exist, it is very probable that the budgets 
are never met in hospital entities 3, 4. Currently, Resolution 60 of 2011 5 is in force issued by the Comptroller General of the Republic of 
Cuba, which is a standard model of internal control, and approves the rules according to current circumstances. This control is composed 
of five components: control environment, management and risk prevention, control activities, information and communication, and 
supervision and monitoring, each structured in standards.  
The control activities as a key component of internal control are implemented in Cuban hospital entities through a self - control guide 
adapted to the public health system. However, it is a bit subjective the compliance or not of the elements of the guide that affects the 
process of hospital decision-making in hospitals where the effective direction is still a pending chapter. Aspect, which is closely related to 
fuzzy logic 6-9 Bearing in mind that this logic can take any value of truth within a set of values that oscillate between two extremes, 
absolute truth and total falsehood. This tool allows us to represent a management model through a non-linear mathematical model, for 
which the author of this research considers that it is of great importance for the evaluation of control activities in hospitals because both, 
its components and the norms that compose it, when evaluated will not always be located at the extremes. This is where the diffuse 
compensatory logic will give us more reliable results.  
The objective of this article is to evaluate the control activities through the diffuse compensatory logic that allows an accurate decision 
making in a Cuban hospital entity. That is why; multicriteria modeling with a diffuse approach was used, allowing the entity to establish 
improvement strategies.

Discussion 
In recent times the activities of control of internal control in hospitals is carried out in Cuba through the Self-Control Guide issued by the 
Comptroller General of the Republic, which, although it is a good control mechanism, becomes a bit subjective when marking compliance 
with the requirement or not by internal or external auditors1,2 The control in hospitals has been demonstrated in these from other edges 
such as the quality, effectiveness in students and human resources, leaving the gaps from the point of view of internal control.This 
research reduces these deficiencies by using multicriteria modeling through Fuzzy Compensatory Logic, providing a greater contribution 
to decision making in the hospital management. 
The study carried out has an important impact on the entity.Regarding the social part, it provides top management with an instrument that 
gives a global view of the behavior of control activities.It makes it possible to achieve a superior management and operational status by 
helping the decision-making process.In addition, with application of Compensatory Fuzzy Logic, it contributes to defining critical 
elements of this component in the organization, while the action plan constitutes a guide to carry out the improvement of these 
unfavorable elements.The applied tool is based on the Cuban legislation in force for internal control (Resolution 60/2011) and does not 
contradict the opinions that govern the organic life of the sector. 
The economic componentis favored from the perspective that links it to improve control activities, which allows properly use the material 
and financial resources, from planning, organizing and controlling them.Finally, in relation to the environment or the work done, or the 
proposed improvement actions cause negative impacts on the environment, but they do help to prevent and limit risks in this regard. 
Conclusions 
Architecture of a mode for the evaluation of control activities through the compound compensatory diffuse logic was designed. The 
proposed model was applied in a hospital entity, which allowed contributing to the improvement of its evaluation, allowing to identify the 
incidence in the implementation of the control activities in this hospital with a category of something true and where to direct a greater 
control according to the most unfavorable results, emphasizing in the rotation of the care personnel and the indicators of performance and 
performance.

Abstract 
 
This study uncovers the knowledge gaps regarding the capability management of research centers in the UK 
manufacturing sector. The paper presents some key findings from systematic literature review and introduces a 
novel framework that will improve the decision making process related to capability development and strategy 
building which are the two main challenges for the UK manufacturing research centers. The findings presented in 
this paper highlight the need for and the key elements of such a framework and the benefits that it will bring to a 
research center’s capability management, e.g. more effective evaluation of capabilities and comprehensive 
understanding of development of those capabilities. It also identified knowledge gap related to management of 
technology capability from a research centre perspective. At the moment there is a lack of standardized framework 
(or approach) that is easy to use and applicable to research centres in the manufacturing sector. The paper presents 
findings from systematic literature review and introduces a novel framework that will improve the decision making 
process related to capability development and strategy building in the manufacturing research centers.

1. Introduction 
For the purposes of this study, research centers are considered to be buildings, facilities, and coordinated teams 
focused on a particular area of development. They are distinct from research institutes in that they are a target a 
specific area of work, which is typically somewhat applied.  The main focus of this paper is on independent (i.e. 
separate form any single company) translational research centers (ITRCs), i.e. those which are focused on 
addressing the gap between proof of concept (typically the end point for mainstream academic research), and

4. Conclusions and Future Work  
This study focused on a research gap presented by a literature in relation to capability management by innovation 
providers. The systematic literature review provided evidence confirming that existing capability management 
approaches are not suitable for modern innovations providers applicable due to their complexity and time that is 
required to fill in all the information. Hence, this research gap introduced an opportunity to create a novel 
framework that will shorten the decision making process as well as provide reliable justifications to explain at which 
stage of development a capability is at. SLR also presented the distinction between tangible and intangible 
capabilities that are key for different aspects of work. By using information from SLR, it was possible to identify the 
gap and create a conceptual framework for the use of innovation providers in the manufacturing sector in the UK.  
Future work will focus on validation of the framework and the evaluation process. The scorecards will be presented 
to the decision makers of seven manufacturing research centers in the UK. After gathering valuable feedback, the 
scorecards will be modified. Afterwards, the framework will be tested on a short-term projects (at one research 
center at a time) in order to validate the framework further. This process will highlight which capabilities are used 
most frequently (or least frequently) at different research centers and also, what are the reasons behind it. Therefore, 
the validation process will bring an insight into which aspects all seven research centers share, and what should be 
modified further in order to make the framework applicable (and user friendly) for innovation providers in the 
manufacturing sector.

Abstract  
In recent decades the organizational culture of human capital has grown as a valuable resource within 
organizations. That is why continuous training becomes the fundamental tool to achieve high levels of 
individual performance and compliance with business objectives. More and more resources are allocated 
to this process, and that is why it is overriding for companies to measure the effectiveness levels of 
training provided through the evaluation modalities and techniques. Numerous authors have studied the 
subject, among which we can mention Kirkpatrick (1976), Tamkin (2002), Garín Sallan (1991, 1996, 
1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2006 and 2010), Pineda Herrero (2000) and Veredas (2005); others have 
proposed models and methodologies that include actions aimed at evaluating the training impact. In the 
Cuban business world there is not an organizational culture focused on the evaluation of training impact. 
The incursions on this subject are limited and in many organizations the evaluation of training is not 
considered as a fundamental element to determine the profitability and effectiveness of it. This article 
proposes a brief overview of the current trends on the human resources training and their evaluation in 
organizations, the models analysis and methodologies on the subject and finally their panorama in Cuba.

Abstract  
 
Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, E-Learning methods, Semantic Web technologies, all have as a 
purpose the satisfaction of user’s needs.  Nowadays, the user profile is considered as one of the most 
important constraint to take into account to perform the accuracy of the results returned by applications 
and computer systems (personalization and recommendation systems). A user profile is a knowledge 
related to a specific user, it may be extracted from several sources having different format and, most of 
time, geographically distributed, this is why, this knowledge need to be collected, predicted, managed, 
filtered and represented in such away to be exploited. In this paper, we present a survey about the most 
important works done in this area, by dividing the profiling process into three major steps: modeling, 
constructing and management user profiles. We’ll present the different techniques and methods used in: 
web, ubiquitous and cloud environment and we’ll discuss some of the challenges and the future trends in 
the user profiling field.

1. Introduction 
 
« Scientia potentia est » is a Latin aphorism claimed to mean «Knowledge is power », commonly attributed to 
Francis Bacon. Knowledge is the common relevant keyword we find in all computer systems. But “What is 
Knowledge?”,“What is the difference between Knowledge and Information?” and “How can we get this 
Knowledge?”. We know that data consists of facts, numbers (temperatures), texts, images and sound. When data is 
combined with interpretation and meaning, information emerges. Knowledge can be as simple as knowing who is 
the president of the United States, or it can be as complex as mathematical formula relating process variables to 
finish product dimensions. To distinguish between information and knowledge is not always straightforward (Jusoh 
et al, 2009). (McCallum, 2005) defined knowledge as “a fluid mixed of framed experience, values, contextual 
information, but until people use it, it isn’t knowledge”. While (Alfawareh et al, 2008) use knowledge definition 
taken from (Redfearn, 2006), considering the primary elements of knowledge are concepts and relationships 
between concepts.

Abstracts 
The evolution of outsourcing activities has changed the way firms compete across diverse 
industries. It has also enabled organisations to achieve both short and long term benefits. 
Although there are advances in global logistics and information technology to increase the 
outsourcing of non-core operations, yet empirical testing of an association between technology 
and outsourcing in relation to long-term performance of organisations are less well researched. 
There is a general assumption in literature that employing outsourcing without proper 
consideration of long- term performance jeopardises competitiveness.  This paper examines 
outsourcing in the oil and gas industry both from a long-term performance perspective, and 
from the viewpoint of technology deployment. The results indicate a strong correlation between 
technology adoption and effectiveness of outsourcing operations. In addition, the results 
demonstrate that the relationship between technology and outsourcing performance can be 
moderated through appropriate infrastructure, quality management and level of expertise 
across the organisation.

Abstract  
 
Maintenance human error factors (MHF) are the conditions that can lead to a human error in 
maintenance, and have been widely acknowledged as major contributors to maintenance quality. 
These factors can have a significant effect on operating costs in industrial settings. However, 
there seems to be a scarcity of papers that aim to estimate the effect of improving these factors 
on both the maintenance quality and the total cost. The objective of this research is to provide a 
comprehensive framework to estimate this effect. The proposed framework utilizes a simulation 
model to establish the total cost associated with a preventive maintenance interval. Our 
simulation case model consists of three systems in a series, each system consisting of two or 
three major components operating in parallel where one or two components must be operational 
at all times. A key feature of our simulation model is that we estimate the probability of 
component failure based on real failure data, integrated with MHF survey results. By using this 
simulation model the effect of modifying the MHF on total cost can be estimated. We believe

Abstract 
In recent years, many researchers have analysed the vulnerability of Water Distribution Networks 
(WDNs) from the hydraulic perspective. However, few works in literature have addressed the 
vulnerability problem from the topological point of view. This work adopts the information entropy 
to evaluate the topological vulnerability of a WDN from the character of its heterogeneity. The 
proposed method is based on the principle that a network with uniformly distributed centrality 
values exhibits a lower drop in performance in the case of partial failure of its components and 
therefore is less vulnerable. In order to demonstrate the proposed method, the paper presents two 
case studies, a real-world WDN of an Australian town and a network from the literature. 
Comparative analysis confirmed that a network with more homogeneous distribution of the nodal 
betweennes centrality values is less vulnerable against the random failure of its components than 
that of the one with heterogeneous distribution of these values.          
Keywords 
Betweenness centrality, Information entropy, Vulnerability analysis, Water distribution networks. 
1. Introduction 
Water Distribution Networks (WDNs) incorporate multiple interconnected interacting components, in which 
failure of any these components may lead to the system failure. The reliability of these networks are therefore 
major concerns for the water sector researchers and practitioners in ensuring public health, safety and societal 
welfare. The complexity of WDNs along with the extensive societal dependence on these networks emphasize 
the importance of studying and managing vulnerabilities (Johansson et al., 2013). 
Vulnerability analysis of WDNs has been an active area of past research. Shuang et al. (2014) evaluated the 
nodal vulnerability of WDNs under cascading failure by monitoring pressure in nodes and flows in pipes during 
the cascading process. Fragiadakis and Christodoulou (2014) and Fragiadakis et al. (2016) performed a seismic 
hydraulic vulnerability assessment of urban water networks using survival analysis. Shuang et al. (2015) 
suggested different recovery strategies of WDNs, focusing on the vulnerability of nodes due to exceeding their 
hydraulic (pressure) capacity. Laucelli and Giustolisi (2015) evaluated the vulnerability of WDNs under 
seismic actions using a hydraulic modelling paradigm taking into account unsupplied demand to customers. 
Such studies approach the vulnerability analysis of WDNs from a hydraulic perspective, which is concerned 
with satisfying flow and pressure requirements taking into consideration failures due to demand variation, 
undersized pipes, storage capacity, insufficient pressure, or combination of these conditions (Zhuang et al., 
2013). However, due to the complex interactions among large number of subsystems and components, the 
exclusive hydraulic analysis of WDNs just partially describes the network performance (Gunawan et al., 2017). 
In the light of this, the topological vulnerability analysis, as a complementary approach, provides a robust 
model, thereby more accurate assessment of WDNs (Yazdani et al., 2011).    
There is a small body of literature, which analyzes the vulnerability of WDNs from the topological point of 
view. The topological vulnerability analysis refers to analyzing the configuration of the network based on the 
graph theory techniques (Di Nardo and Di Natale, 2011). Perelman and Ostfeld (2011) constructed a 
topological connectivity matrix aimed at clustering the nodes in WDNs based on their connectivity, thereafter 
identifying weakly and strongly connected clusters. Yazdani and Jeffrey (2011 & 2012) examined the

5. Conclusions 
The present paper attempts to fill the gap surrounding the topological vulnerability analysis of WDNs. In doing 
so, we introduce a two-step procedure for quantifying the vulnerability by integrating the centrality analysis 
and the entropy theory.  
In the first step, the paper evaluates the degree of influence of a node by employing a graph theory quantity 
known as the betweenness centrality. In the second step, this work has drawn attention to the information 
entropy as a tool to measure the homogeneity and heterogeneity of the betweenness centrality values, computed 
in the first step. 
This article generates a new vulnerability index as a measure of the global vulnerability of WDNs. The new 
vulnerability index is developed from the information entropy based on the distribution of the normalized 
betweenness centrality values. The new index measures the severity of the consequences of the random nodal 
failures. The vulnerability analysis results showed that the failure of a highly central node leads to a significant 
loss of the performance in the network.     
Using two case studies, a tree-shaped WDN and a looped network from the literature, this paper has 
demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. As the previous discussion attests, the proposed 
vulnerability analysis method is in consistent with the intuitive notion of vulnerability.  
As part of the first practical implication, the maintenance strategy based on the vulnerability analysis proposed 
herein will provide an expert facilitator that helps water utilities to identify and prioritize the vulnerabilities. 
The second practical implication is especially valuable for designing an effective risk management framework, 
which allows for least cost decisions to be made for the protection of the WDNs.    
This article contributes to the vulnerability analysis of water distribution network by coupling the centrality 
analysis and the entropy theory. However, the conventional centrality measures rely only on the topological 
information. As such, these measures only partially describe a network structure and therefore cannot entirely 
characterize its properties. Further research might seek to develop a domain specific centrality metrics taking 
into account the topological along with the hydraulic attributes of the nodes in the network.

Abstract 
 
Supply chain integration divided into two dimensions, namely internal integration, and external integration. 
Internal integration refers to cross-functional intra-firm collaborative processes. External integration 
consists of supplier integration, customer integration, and logistics service providers integration. 
Empirically, supply chain integration is more dominant in investigating the relationship between internal, 
supplier, customer integration, and operational performance. The studies that investigate the relationship 
between logistics service providers integration and operational performance is still limited in number. 
Therefore, this paper aims to examine the relationship between internal, supplier, customer and logistics 
service providers integration and operational performance of the organization in the form of propositions. 
This paper is a conceptual framework. Supplier integration positively associated with inventory control 
processes and new product development. Customer integration increases the accuracy of forecasting. The 
logistics service providers integration positively associated with logistics activities. The dimensions of 
operational performance can be measured based on variable cost, quality, flexibility, delivery. The 
organization's operational performance proves to be a positive consequence of internal integration and 
external integration of supply chain. This paper proposes the proposition that there is a positive relationship 
between internal and external integration with the operational performance of the organization.

Abstract 
 
Customer demand is a constantly changing variable that suppliers must be able to accommodate to stay in 
business.  Being able to properly assess the output of a process is key to determining capability.  The focus 
of this paper is to determine and improve the quality level of a headliner manufacturing line using statistical 
quality control tools. It will analyze observational data to determine whether the process is in control and 
measure the capability of the process to meet an increased demand.  QC tools such as control charts, analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) and Pareto analysis will be used as the means for collecting and analyzing data, 
measuring the results and then identifying root causes. These tools will then be used to identify how to 
improve the process to meet the demand.

1. Introduction 
 
Statistical quality control (SQC) tools were originally developed to evaluate process performance in manufacturing 
environments.  These techniques have since been expanded to measure more atypical subject matter such as advanced 
warning systems in vehicles (Liu and Ho, 2017).  Other divergent uses include evaluating the performance of Precise 
Point Positioning used for GPS navigation systems (Cheng, et. al., 2017).  SQC is being implemented in the health 
profession as well.  Oncology researchers have utilized SQC tools as a method to quantify quality of life in cancer 
trials (Hamel, et. al., 2017).  It has also been used to improve neonatal care in hospitals (Gupta and Kaplan, 2017).   
Quality control (QC) refers to the practice of monitoring a process to ensure the product is meeting requirements as 
well as detect and reduce any variance in the product or process.  QC utilizes many tools designed to help gather and 
analyze data with the goal of improving operational efficiency in a system.  Variance is a value that is studied closely 
in QC because variance is a good indicator of poor quality.  To measure variance in a process, statistical tools are 
applied frequently for quality control purposes (Montgomery, 2013). 
A headliner for a vehicle line (Fig. 1) is built using both a batch and sequence process.  The side facing down in Fig. 
1 is called the A surface.  This is the side that can be seen when you look up inside a vehicle.  The other side is referred 
to as the C surface.  This is the side that connects to the roof of the car and contains all the wire harnesses and 
connections.  Stiffeners and head impact countermeasures (HIC) are installed on the C surface by robots or automatic 
machines in batch.  Customer use items such as grab handles, overhead consoles and dome lamps are applied by 
manual glue process along with wire harnesses and other unseen items.

6. Cost Savings 
 
The cost of scrapping just 1 headliner can cost as much as $493.01.  Extrapolating the year-to-date scrap data, the 
current defect rate is costing the company on average $958,647.80 per year.  The alcantera substrate material alone 
costs $438.76 to scrap.  In a worse-case scenario analysis, the company could be losing over $1 million a year in scrap.  
By increasing our sigma level from 2.436 to the necessary 2.912, we could save at minimum $526,024 per year.  This 
is savings is further explained in Table 5 below.

As stated, Table 5 above shows the cost savings associated with improving this process to our goal scrap rate.  The 
lyric headliner is 70% of the take rate for the total yearly build.  It also cost $340 less to scrap.  The cost for alcantera 
vs. lyric headliner scrap is broken out due to the significant difference in cost.  Reducing the scrap rate the goal of 
0.789 would save an average of $538,800.67 a year based on the average take rates of lyric and alcantera and the 
current build volume of 48 parts per shift. 
 
7. Conclusion 
 
Using the statistical analysis tools, we were able to determine that the headliner process is highly out of control. More 
importantly, it is incapable of meeting the newly increased demand at its current scrap rate.  The increased demand 
requires a sigma performance level of 2.912.  The current process misses this performance by about 10 parts per shift.  
In manufacturing, you must above all be able to meet the demand of the customer.  It is also necessary keep the scrap 
rate low enough so that costs are not paid out of pocket.  Currently, this process is unable to do either.  The company 
is losing an average of more than $950,000 a year due to scrap.  To improve the line’s yield, we made modifications 
to the process to achieve significant improvements to the process in multiple areas as identified in the Pareto analysis.  
However, there will still need to be changes made to reach the necessary quality level.  It is unlikely that we will 
eliminate 100% of the defects mentioned even with error-proofing so further analysis into the defect causes will need 
to be done to decrease scrap to a reasonable level for the line.

Abstract 
 
Because pharmaceutical companies have failed to develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cure and treatment 
as of today, AD early detection and intervention becomes increasingly clear to be the best choice of 
improving quality of life for persons with AD at least in the near future. Thus, developing patient-centric 
predictive models and enabling self-diagnosis services are of great potential. This paper presents how 
recurrent neuron neatwork (RNN) models can be adopted in the AD early diagnosis modeling (AD-
EDM). In particular, we show that the improved prediction accuracy of RNN AD-EDM can contribute to 
the delivery of self-diagnosis services for preclinical/early AD patients. By leveraging the fast 
development of big data technologies and machine learning methods, our AD-EDM tools will make a 
difference in discovering non-pharmacologic therapy solutions to slow AD progression.

1. Introduction 
About 5.5 million Americans currently live with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is the only top ten 
cause of death that cannot be prevented, cured, or slowed. AD is the most common form of dementia and 
the sixth leading cause of death in the US (Alzheimer’s Association, 2017). On January 8, 2018, Pfizer 
announced to halt research into AD and Parkinson’s treatments after high-profile disappointment in years 
of research. In fact, pharmaceutical companies worldwide have failed to develop any new drug since the 
last new drug that treats only the symptoms of AD was approved by the FDA 14 years ago (Johnson, 
2018). The high-profile failures of developing AD treatments thus propel the idea of seeking alternative 
solutions for persons with AD and their caregivers in the near future (Crous-Bou et al., 2017; 
Loewenstein et al., 2017; Qiu et al., 2017; Qiu et al., 2018). 
AD early prediction and intervention have been studied, aimed at postponing AD onset or slowing 
down its progression (Oaklander, 2016; Park, 2016). Studies have shown that appropriate and positive 
interventions, such as providing AD patients with the effective levels of lifestyle changes and brain 
training, surely contribute to slowing AD progression. However, preclinical AD patients are often 
reluctant to take diagnostic tests. Most of them usually lack motivation to take diagnostic tests due to 
believing that ongoing cognition declines are a result of a natural aging process. In addition, AD tests are 
expensive and time-consuming (Bradford et al., 2009). In fact, completing these tests at an AD center is 
expensive and time-consuming, which typically includes brain scans such as magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans and neuropsychological tests such as the Clinical 
Dementia Rating (CDR), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE).

4. Final Remarks  
This short paper showed that the LSTM RNN approach to AD-EDS seems very promising. It 
becomes clear that we can utilize the developed deep learning model by well incorporating it into a 
mobile-friendly website. As a result, self-diagnosis tools can be made available to the public, which 
surely promote and support patient-centered approaches in the field of AD. By leveraging the technology 
advances in “speech-to-text” and deep learning, we can enhance the method of acquiring inputs 
substantially to make the prototype easy to use by end users.

Abstract: Renewable energy is most preferable method in the world to produce electrical power 
because of its low cost and eco-friendly characteristics. Wind and solar are the most significant source of 
renewable energy.  By using those renewable energy in train, fuel consumption and carbon dioxide 
emission will be reduced. The amount of power which will be produced from those two types of 
renewable energies in train is shown by theoretical analysis. In this paper, rate of producing energy, 
economic benefits are shown. 
Keywords: wind power, solar power, Train, Carbon dioxide, air drag, fuel. 
1. INTRODUCTION
As days pass, due to the massive growth in world population and the demand for energy growing relentlessly. To keep 
up with the increasing demand for energy the fossil fuels are being used vastly which are pretty costly, limited and 
most importantly harmful for the environment. Global warming, a major threat, leading the world to be doomed 
according to the governments as well as the researchers is being caused by the burning of these fossil fuels. One of 
the eye catching fact about the fossil fuels is they are being exhausted at a faster rate which is threating about their 
availability. So, the conservation of these energy sources and producing energy from eco-friendly sources are 
considered as a much needed step all over the world. 
People all over the globe are also considering these facts seriously. That’s why bio fueled, electricity driven and hybrid 
vehicles can be seen in a greater number now than the past few years. In addition, these options give the consumers a 
chance to decrease their dependency over the fossil fuels. By producing renewable energy like wind and solar from 
the train, dependency on fossil fuels in train can be reduced and carbon dioxide emission can be mitigated. 
Wind and solar energy are the two most recognized renewable energy. Velocity of a train can be used for producing 
energy by using wind turbine, but its main drawbacks is air drags. [1] But in a high speed train the net energy from 
wind turbines is mostly satisfying. On the other end, solar panel can give an amount of energy by setting it on the roof 
of the train. But the output from the solar panel depends on solar radiation period and weather. [2] If the wind and 
solar energy producing system can be combined together in a train, the output is most significant. It will be possible 
to get more energy if mechanical strength of wind blade can be increased so that the blade can survive in high velocity 
of the train and also increase efficiency of solar panel. 
The rest of the paper is categorized as follows. In section II basic theory of Wind and solar power and their formula. 
Proposed model is shown in section III and the power of wind and solar of the train is calculated in section IV. In 
Section V, discussion about the economic benefits and amount of CO2 mitigation are presented. 
2. THEORY
Wind Power: One of the most eco-friendly method of conversion of energy is to convert the air into energy. But 
most of the energy of air remain uncaptured by the turbine. Conversion of the energy follows the Betz law. The Betz 
law provides power co-efficient, which is called the Betz limit. It shows that how much energy a turbine can absorb 
from air. Theoretically the maximum value of Betz limit is 0.593. And practically the value range is 0.35 to 0.45. The 
available wind power of a turbine is equated by,

5. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND IMPACT ON ENVIROMENT 
The proposal design has some economic and environmental profit   from the proposed design. It will reduce the fuel 
consumption and co2 emission. Fossil fuels has a bad effect on environment for some reasons. When fossil fuels are 
burn, some gases are released like carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfur dioxide. This gases causes climate change, 
Green House effect and air pollution. So many researchers are doing research to find ways of mitigating the use of 
fuel energy. 
Table 3. It has been shown the economic benefit of the system. Per liter diesel can give 10KW power and price of 
per liter diesel is 1.07 $. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further, 3.78541 liter is equal to 1 gallon diesel [13]. And 10.15kg CO2 are emitted from 1 gallon diesel [14]. 
Table 4. It has been shown the amount of carbon di oxide is mitigates by minimizing the use of diesel in train. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. CONCLUSION 
Producing green energy has become one of the major source of energy. Train consume huge fuel or electricity to 
generate energy. So, by establishing the proposal, it will possible to mitigate the demand of fuel in train. So, emitting 
CO2 from train will also mitigate. The amount of power is very encouraging to be used in utility services of train. The 
system has some limitations that are harse can be a threat for wind turbine and sunlight does not present all time, 
statical analysis on the system is future work.

Abstract 
 
To maintain a competitive edge in the market, it is important for a company to track and manage its 
performance. Performance management is the next vital step after measuring and monitoring 
performance. Maintaining an acceptable level of performance is a result of performance management. A 
company can achieve this goal by focusing and improving on those Key performance Indicators (KPIs) 
which are of utmost importance to the company; In other words, focusing on the KPIs which are mostly 
aligned with the company’s long term strategies. Accordingly, this paper proposes a model to aim the 
decision making process in identifying such KPIs. The model is developed as an Influence Diagram (ID). 
Two IDs are proposed. One for a company based on a single strategy and the other for the use of 
companies seeking to fulfil multi-strategies within their operations. The IDs proposed in this paper will 
aim decision makers to choose the right strategy or a portfolio of strategies for their company which 
returns the maximum expected utility (MEU). The framework is based on capturing the Key Performance 
Indicators and selecting the KPI or a portfolio of KPIs which returns the MEU to the company.

1. Introduction 
   The necessity to perform performance measurement through a combined, integrated network (i.e. a Bayesian 
Network) and not to consider each KPI in silos has been discussed by (Abolbashari et al., 2018). In performance 
measurement, whilst dealing with the KPIs, if they’re observed and measured individually, the output will be 
different to the case where the KPIs are combined and modelled through in a network, capable of capturing the 
causal relationships among the KPIs. This integrated model can then be used for performance measurement. In fact, 
the relationship between the KPIs are in a way that if they’re approached through a naive way, characteristics are not 
explicitly derived, nor is their complex relationship captured, in comparison to the situation where we combine them 
in a network. 
   Performance measurement is the task of measuring KPIs. KPIs are specific to each company and differ from a 
company to another. Once the relevant KPIs are identified, they are measured and used to specify the company’s 
overall performance (Chakraborty et al., 2016). Performance measurement aims to measure something which has 
happened in the past. However, it is important too to manage performance, which is the successor of performance 
measurement. Performance management is vital to maintain an acceptable level of performance in day to day 
operations and to make sure the current tasks are done in such a way (i.e. the best way) so that the company secures 
a competitive edge in the market. This fact is important not only for a company who wishes to excel, but also for a 
company who wishes to maintain an acceptable level performance. In todays’ vibrate business environment where 
some businesses excel and some fall behind, it is still an achievement to remain in the competitive market by 
managing the current operations within a company. Consequently, it is not essential only for an emerging company 
to manage its current performance to improve, but also a company wishing to remain in the market and not be driven

other KPIs. If the total amount of available resources is equal to C, then C can be distributed among a portfolio of 
KPIs to achieve a certain amount of performance in each KPI. This allocation is Pareto-efficient (Ghodsi et al., 
2011) meaning that more allocation to a KPI (i.e. further improvement in that KPI), will result in less allocation to 
another KPI. According to (Shachter, 1986) and (Kjaerulff and Madsen, 2008), an ID can include a series of 
sequential decisions. If a second decision node appears after another decision node, than information of the first 
decision node and all of its predecessors are available at the time of making the second decision. In other words, the 
alternatives left for a latter decision depend on a former decision which has already been made.

4. Conclusion and discussion  
In this paper, a novel method is proposed to manage performance in an organization. The proposed methodology is 
based on capturing the most important Key Performance Indicators and building an Influence Diagram as a tool for 
managing performance. The Influence Diagram considers the state of each KPI and based on that, calculates the 
expected utility for each decision alternative. The alternatives include the decision on whether to invest on 
improving a KPI or not. Based on the designed Influence Diagram and the output of the model, we showed that the 
organization can chose the best KPI to invest on, which is also expected to return the maximum utility to the 
organization, when compared to the expected utility of other KPIs. Alternatively, based on the same results, the 
organization is able to conduct a fair resource allocation among a portfolio of KPIs. For future research, a Dynamic 
Bayesian Network may be proposed for managing performance in different time slots based on the Influence 
Diagram designed in this paper.

Abstract  
 
This paper considers the problem of managing inventory and routing problems in a two-stage 
supply chain system under a Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) policy. VMI policy is an 
integrating decisions between a supplier and the customers in which the supplier assumes the 
responsibility of maintaining the inventory at the customers while ensuring that they will not run 
out of stock. The delivery times to the customers are no longer agreed in response to customers' 
orders; instead the supplier indicates when each delivery takes place. Under the VMI policy, the 
planning is proactive as it is based on the available information rather than reactive to retailers' 
orders. Thus, in this research, we assumed that the demand at each customer is stationary and the 
warehouse is implementing a VMI. The focus of this research is to optimize the inventory and 
the transportation costs of the customers for a two-stage supply chain system in construction 
industry. The problem is to identify the delivery quantities, delivery times and routes to the 
customers for the single-period deterministic inventory routing problem (SP-DIRP) system in 
construction sector. As a result, a linear mixed-integer program is established for the solutions of 
the SP-DIRP problem. Some sample tests have indicated that the good integrated approach for 
the SP-DIRP problem.

Abstract 
Procurement as one of the activities in Supply Chain Management has recently received great attention from researchers due to it not just 
being a support function, but a key strategic tool for organizations to build their competitive advantage. Although the different stages that 
come under the purchasing process (such as initiation, planning and monitoring) have been studied in the literature extensively, they are 
done in isolation and not by taking the overall purchasing goal into consideration. This drawback and the inefficacy and ineffectiveness of the 
current purchasing practices are highlighted in the literature by several reports and research publications and they stress on the need to 
have better procurement practices to achieve savings of millions of dollars per year. Considering the inefficiency of the current fragmented 
approaches towards improving purchasing practices, this research aims to take a defragmented approach towards this strategic activity by 
including all of the key variables that affect the quality of purchasing into one single mathematical model. Using such an approach, the 
objective is to enlighten a buyer with the required information by which informed procurement decisions can be taken and transform him/her 
to a smart buyer. This mathematical approach towards purchasing will enable us to understand the key variables that affect purchasing, as 
well as their interdependencies and how they affect the level of a buyer’s smartness. The research will provide a smart buyer enabler 
framework towards improving purchasing practices in supply chains. 
Research Issues 
•
Lack of a comprehensive model that includes all variables at the same time. 
•
No evidence of a measurable metric for procurement performance. 
•
The interdependencies between KPIs have not been considered. 
•
The effect of any step towards improvement could not be expressed. 
•
No framework for trade-off analysis exists when objectives are contradictory.   
Objectives 
Providing a mathematical model to measure procurement performance 
Capturing a comprehensive set of KPIs for procurement performance 
Broadening the Smart Buyer concept by providing a measurable definition 
Providing a pathway to transform a buyer into a smart buyer 
Enabling procurement decision making when objectives are contradictory 
Method 
My research method includes the three following stages which have also been described in Fig 4. 
 
Stage 1: Quantifying the current level of smartness 
Stage 2: Adjusting the KPIs to achieve an optimum level of smartness given the current resources 
Stage 3: Recommendations and scenario planning towards achieving procurement excellence 
Model 
In the first stage of the methodology, the relevant KPIs and the interdependencies between them 
have been mapped as follows: 
Results 
Conclusions 
•
Procurement KPIs have different levels of impact in achieving procurement excellence. Some KPIs 
are more effective and critical while others have a smoother impact on the overall outcome. 
•
Procurement excellence doesn’t necessarily require excellency in all KPIs. A proper combination of 
excellent, competent and good KPIs will result into a satisfactory level of procurement performance.

Procurement Performance Characteristics 
Bad 
 
Not only no efficiency could be sought for procurement practices, but also there 
is no sign that the primary objective of procurement which is fulfilling 
effectiveness is being met. Effectiveness and efficiency levels are indicating an 
unacceptable level of procurement performance and at this stage, the final 
product or service is not delivered to the end user. 
Acceptable 
Effectiveness of procurement practices are almost half way met, therefore 
efficiency could not be achieved for an acceptable level. The KPIs that are used 
for measuring effectiveness are showing just an acceptable level of effectiveness 
and since effectiveness is a pre-requisite for efficiency, the efficiency level is low. 
Good 
KPIs are showing a reasonable performance. However, they have not been 
adjusted nor analysed for a better outcome. The cause and effects that are 
caused by the interdependencies between the KPIs are not considered for 
further improvements.  
Competent 
 
Procurement practices are successful and almost efficient. However, further/final 
improvements towards procurement excellence could be made. Effectiveness of 
procurement practices has been thoroughly met; however efficiency could still be 
improved. Given a fixed amount of resources available, different KPIs are 
adjusted and aligned with each other so that the maximum achievable level of 
performance is obtained.  
Excellent 
 
At this stage, not only effectiveness of the procurement practices is at the 
highest achievable level, but also efficiency of the procurement operations is at 
the highest achievable level. Performance measures and their interdependencies 
are monitored every day and are analysed for further improvements. 
In the next section, this network is simulated in Bayes Server software and the Level of 
smartness is eventually calculated. Given the level of smartness, we then have to refer to our 
Procurement Performance Matrix to interpret our results. 
By inserting the current values of the KPIs 
into 
the 
model, 
the 
current 
level 
of 
smartness is obtained and results are then 
interpreted through our performance matrix. 
The current performance is not good. 
The required values for the KPIs To achieve 
procurement excellence are as follows. The 
results provide insights for managers and 
decision 
makers 
towards 
achieving

Abstract 
 
Manufacturing processes can be optimized with many different methods. However, the effectiveness and 
interaction of methods are often difficult to estimate. To date, shop floor improvement methods in series 
production are not scientifically analyzed by using a business simulation and the selected methods 5S, 
Poka Yoke, Kanban and Standard Work Sheet. The academic study aims to close the research gap with a 
business simulation and the generated data using design of experiments. This depicts a new combination 
for research. The lead time is selected as KPI. First results and interactions were found.

1. Introduction and Motivation 
Shop floor processes can be optimized by a lot of different tools and methods (Schmitt/Pfeiffer, 2015). Included in 
these tools are for example Poka Yoke, 5S, Lean Management and Kanban. An efficient transfer of these methods to 
their own manufacturing challenges many companies. Not only the choice of the right method is difficult, but also 
the effectiveness of the respective method is difficult to estimate (Dombrowski/Crespo, 2008). Companies are often 
not able to evaluate whether process efficiency and effectivity increased or not, after the implementation of these 
methods (Suzaki, 1993). Even experts on this subject are only able to assess based on their experience. Current 
research states, that a vast number of different methods for manufacturing optimization are available (Baumgärtner, 
2006). To date, shop floor optimization methods in series production are not scientifically analyzed by using a 
business simulation and the selected methods. A business simulation presents an academically recognized method 
(Duke, 1996). Nonetheless, experiments like this have not been conducted yet. The following challenges are based 
on the choice of the right tools and methods and the setup of the experiment, including the collection of data and the 
human factor. The academic study aims to close the research gap by systematically analyzing series manufacturing. 
The following hypothesis is given:

optimization method should be used. The combination 5S/Poka Yoke proves to be more effective than the sole 
application of 5S.  
5. Summary and Future need for Research 
In this research project the following hypothesis were formulated: 
 
 “The effectiveness of selected manufacturing optimization methods can be demonstrated via a developed model in 
form of a business simulation in a model factory”.  
To test this hypothesis the chosen methods in the business simulation were analyzed and a simulation model was 
developed for testing the effects of using those methods. The business simulation model with the chosen methods 
was tested in 48 rounds with new test persons in every round and with different combinations of the four methods. 
To compare the effectiveness of the four methods it could be demonstrated that Poka Yoke had the highest influence 
on the key performance indicator lead times in an assembly. This result cannot be generalized to other types of 
production processes. Further studies should be realized. Also other types of products can be manufactured. Maybe a 
product with a higher complexity will have an impact of the results. 
In order to get more scientific valid results, the business simulation should be further developed and played more 
often with new different test persons. Furthermore, other KPIs, like the output, or the adherence to delivery dates 
should be analyzed. The target size optimization in the software Minitab® can also be used for further analyzes.

Abstract 
New engineered materials with unique properties are essential for space technologies, structural and bio-
engineering. The need for sustainability and high strength and stiffness on a weight basis on reinforced 
composites orients the research efforts towards natural fibers. Coconut, Areca nut and Pandanus fibers are 
available in impressive quantities in all islands of the South Pacific and are traditionally used in textile 
and construction applications. The authors focus their research on composite materials with such natural 
fibers and their behaviour under stress. Finite Element Methods are employed in the evaluation of the 
behaviour of composites with natural fibers under various stress conditions. Elastic properties of newly 
created composites are evaluated on computer- controlled environments and they validate the simulations.

Figure 8. Torsion Stress Simulation on Composites with Pandanus Fibers 
 
Both tensile and torsion simulations are validated by experiments – see figures 3 and 6 – and bring confidence in 
simulations on more complex components under combined loads with the newly created composite material [19], 
[20], [21], [22].. 
 
 
 
Conclusions 
 
The mechanical strength of a newly created composite material on resin matrix and fibers from the aerial roots of 
Pandanus Utilis was subject of experimental and simulation research. The plants growing along seashores are 
abundant and the thick aerial roots can withstand salt spray, drought and strong winds. The paper and related 
experimental research show the advantages of resin polymers as matrixes for composite materials and discuss the 
technological challenges encountered during the preparation. Emphasis is placed on thermal and chemical treatment 
of fibers in order to reduce the water content and the necessity of curing in dry boxes for preparing isotropic 
composite materials. 
 
Laboratory-scale tensile and torsion testing machines were employed during the experimental research in order to 
establish allow the experimental establishment of yield strength, Young modulus E  and shear modulus G  with 
remarkable precision. 
 
The strength properties of the newly created composite material were used to create a new material entry into the 
database of materials of the 3D CAD platform used for simulations. Finite Element Modeling under SolidWorks 
allowed the investigation of the stresses and displacements developed under tensile and torsion static loads. The 
results are validated by experiments.

Abstract 
Essential variations in water flow combined with erosion affect most small Francis Water Turbines 
installed by small communities across Papua New Guinea. The authors evaluate the effects of 
harmonically excited vibrations under variable flow conditions and propose design optimization of shafts. 
The stiffness depreciation of shafts under erosion is also considered and its effects are evaluated by Finite 
Element Methods.

Conclusions 
 
The design, development and maintenance of Francis turbines are site related. Water flow variations and erosion due 
to the sediment impact influence the vibrational behaviour of the system rotor – stator. The waterfalls at Busama 
community are fed by fluids crossing mountain ranges rich in quartz particles, due to the vicinity of gold fields. The 
variations in flow at the waterfalls are related to seasonal variations of the rainfalls and the flow rates in summer 
months can go down to 60% of flow rates in winter time. Such variations are important for a cast turbine affected by 
erosion because the vibrational amplitudes reach magnitudes potentially able to annihilate the geometrical clearance 
between the rotor and the stator and bring failure. 
 
The investigations of the authors of this paper also noted the failure of the trust bearings supporting the rotor. It can 
be safely concluded that Francis turbines cannot be recommended as micro-hydro plants for small communities due 
to the high cost of equipment, site-related design complexities, lack of qualified service and long waiting time for 
spare parts.

Abstract  
 
In a competitive environment, the most successful companies are those that well manage their projects 
defining the right map to achieve their goals and optimizing the triptych “cost-quality-time limit”. 
Considering preventive maintenance as a lean project, we propose managing its steps through a lean 
model integrating a useful decisional algorithm to select the appropriate NDT (non-destructive testing) 
techniques in the step “Method” under the “optimisation” phase of our model. 
The implantation of our proposed model allows the early prediction and prevention of equipment 
breakdowns and so the redaction of unnecessary costs.

1. Introduction 
 
Industrial maintenance, having as the main objective ensuring the proper functioning and availability of 
industrial equipment, is a strategic function in companies. Closely linked to the continuous development 
of technology, to the emergence of new forms of management and the need to reduce production costs.

4. Conclusion  
The majority of production systems are often penalized by the maintenance costs related to 
equipment failures and sudden breakdowns; this derives from the maintenance management strategies that 
are more oriented towards the curative strategies than the preventive ones. In order to deal with this issue 
and we have developed a generic Lean maintenance optimization model. In our approach, we discuss the 
deployment of a decision algorithm on NDT techniques in the ""methods"" step, which could reduce the 
number of unforeseen failures.

Abstract 
 
In order to avoid the problems that could be slow down and even stop the production, the company must 
adopt a strategy of maintenance of all equipment throughout their life cycle, which aims are: better 
management, organization, equipment control and anomaly detection as well as accurate diagnosis of 
malfunctions. Besides, a bad the nasty maintenance program could be prevented in increased production 
rates and poor business development, where the maintenance program must move towards predictive 
maintenance, which contains many NDT (non-destructive testing) techniques such as vibratory analysis, 
thermography, ultrasonic, radiography, penetrant testing and magnetoscopy. Therefore, the choice of an 
NDT technique among others on the nature of the physical parameter has to be monitored and according 
to the criteria of speed, cost, reliability, ease, and safety of each technique. Moreover, some components, 
have seen that several NDTs can be used, in order to optimize the use and the costs related to these NDTs. 
Thus; the present work consists of proposing a new methodology for ranking NDT techniques based on 
priorities. Nevertheless, the proposed methodology has proven its robustness in the study case part of one 
of the workshops of a phosphoric office.

1. Introduction 
In the current context of opening a competitive market to competition, companies must improve their 
competitiveness and even their productivity, to produce more with lower cost, in order to have a better availability 
of the means of production while spending less. Therefore, the use of increasingly complex systems to face the 
challenges of sustainability, competitiveness, safety and security bring up maintenance problems which is one of the 
keys to the optimization of technological and industrial systems [1] [2]. Thus, the Maintenance costs are often the 
major part of the operating costs in many production units where these costs can be significantly reduced by 
predictive maintenance. This is not the case for traditional maintenance methods [3]. Therefore, the recent studies on 
the effectiveness of maintenance management have shown that more than a third of maintenance costs come from 
unnecessary or poorly performed operations [4] [5].Nevertheless; a bad maintenance policy has disastrous 
consequences on the quality of the products, to remedy it, the maintenance program must move towards a predictive 
maintenance, which contains many NDT techniques such as vibratory analysis, thermography, radiography, 
penetrant testing, magnetoscopy and ultrasonic [3] [6]. 
These NDT techniques have become essential to increase the reliability, safety and service life of installations [3]. 
They make it possible to characterize the state of integrity of the equipment, without destroying and without 
disturbing the production lines [7] [8]. Nevertheless, the choice of one technique among others lies in the nature of 
the physical parameter to be monitored [9] and according to the criteria of speed, cost, reliability, ease, and safety of 
each technique [10] [11]. In this context, it seemed appropriate to propose an approach that allows to choose the 
most suitable NDT technique to use where our approach is divided into four complementary phases as shown in 
(Figure 1): identify all the NDTs to be classified, establish a list of priority criteria, evaluate the performance of each 
NDT technique according to the different criteria selected and evaluate the performance of each NDT technique 
according to their overall scores. Therefore, the present work consists in providing a global description of each 
phase of our methodology as well as their deployment within one of the workshops of a phosphoric office.

4. Conclusion 
In this work we have developed a new methodology of optimization of the use NDT techniques in predictive 
maintenance where our recommended methodology is based on four complementary phases, namely as follow: 
Identify all the NDTs to be classified, establish a list of priority criteria, evaluate the performance of each NDT 
technique and classify NDTs according to their overall scores. Therefore; a precise description of each phase of our 
methodology has been provided in this paper. Moreover, we have recommended the use of this methodology in 
addition to the principles and tools of improvement and planning of a preventive maintenance policy. In order to 
exploit and validate our proposed approach, a case study was conducted in one of the workshops of a phosphoric 
office. Thereby, this case study has highlighted the importance of the use of techniques. Although, the vibration 
analysis is the most widely used since the majority of equipment consists of mechanical systems, but the use of other 
techniques NDT sometimes completes the latter, hence the need for an approach allowing the choice of the most 
appropriate technique based on the indicators and physical quantities by a thorough analysis and operating 
conditions of the process studied.

Abstract  
Globalization has caused many organizations to adapt themselves to the ever-changing business 
environment in order to sustain in this competitive market condition. Malaysian automotive part suppliers 
SMEs are also affected by the globalization. To remain competitive in this challenging business 
environments, the SMEs need to ensure continuous improvement are being implemented as part of their 
business strategy. This paper presents findings from a larger study on Kaizen implementation among 
automotive part supplier SMEs in Malaysia. Nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with four 
automotive part supplier SMEs located in Selangor and Pahang. The data during the interview were 
recorded, transcribed and coded before being divided according to relevant themes. Top management 
commitment, training, kaizen champion, supportive organization culture, communication, recognition and 
reward and employee empowerment are found to be among the determinants for successful continuous 
improvement. The findings from this study are useful to help companies to embark or sustain their kaizen 
activities. Furthermore, it is useful information to respective government agencies to develop policies that 
can help Malaysian automotive industry especially the SMEs to sustain their business.

1. Introduction 
 
The advancement of globalization, increased competition and diminishing resources have forced many 
manufacturing companies to improve their processes and eliminate waste in order to sustain in this competitive 
market (Duran et al, 2015). As a result of globalization, many organizations need to adapt themselves to the ever-
changing business environment in order to sustain in this challenging market. However, globalization has also 
brought along many new business opportunities as well as challenges to the business community. Among those 
opportunities is the access to new and freer market between countries, thus, creating wider business opportunity. On 
the other hand, globalization also introduces new challenges such as the need to develop new technologies, products 
and services. Industries are forced to apply lean principles as a way to improve their processing efficiencies to 
produce more with less resources (Radnor et al, 2008). By applying the lean principles, they can increase their 
productivity by eliminating all the existing non-value added activities (waste) which can directly lead to higher

Abstract  
The main reason for the microfinance industry is to reduce poverty. However, recent research suggests that 
this objective was not always respected; the Microfinance institutions (MFIs) focus more on their financial 
sustainability and profitability rather than on customer, which is a mission drift from their original objective. 
Several processes are designed within the MFIs to allow the production of the services and its distribution 
to the beneficiaries, managing these processes effectively and efficiently may improve the social and 
economic conditions of the borrowers and enhance the MFIs sustainability and competitiveness.  This study 
aims to rank and prioritize the MFIs according to the performance of their lending process. Such study may 
allow MFIs to understand their position compared to their market rivals and then to seek differential 
advantages for retaining their customers and attracting new ones. Measuring the microfinance lending 
process (MLP) performance is a precondition for its analysis and subsequently its improvement. However, 
collecting data on lending process within an MFI is not always easy. Therefore, we managed to develop an 
Intuitionistic fuzzy TOPSIS approach. It is a complex decision making (DM) tool that is highly 
recommended to deal with uncertainty and vagueness in comparative analysis.

Abstract 
Big Data security is a critical mission which aims to keep the data and the various treatments made, safe 
from any attack attempt, especially in front of the number of attacks and vulnerabilities which increases 
exponentially. Several algorithmic solutions are put in place in order to reinforce the security of this massive 
data (in all these states), such as encryption, authorization, intrusion detection, and other techniques inspired 
by genetics. Indeed, an evolutionary method such as genetic algorithms is set up to increase the level of 
robustness and variation of the processed data. This paper gives an overview of some modern cryptography 
security algorithms, and other evolutionary genetic algorithms paramount in data security. He presents 
comparative and analytical studies of these algorithms in order to proof the effectiveness of one compared 
to others. To finally present as a proposal an evolutionary model inspired by the immune system of the 
human body, given its ability to defend against viruses and any unexpected attack, which will be intended 
for big data during their parallel processing in real time in the MapReduce part of the management system, 
Hadoop.

1. Introduction
Several solutions and technologies have been introduced and / or have evolved in parallel with the exponential 
evolution of the use of big data, as traditional data management systems are no longer applicable to these huge amounts 
of data. Indeed, Big Data invites us to meet many challenges, including storage capacity, analysis, purification and 
processing. Specifically, the challenges regarding the security of the processed data. For all these reasons, this 
document highlights some algorithmic solutions, which aims improving Big Data Security and propose another 
solution that can help increase the level of security of this data. So, this document is organized as follows: the second 
part aims to present the needs of Big Data in terms of security, in order to reveal the increased importance of putting 
in place solutions that aims to improve the security level of these big quantities of data. The third section is for

How the architecture works? 
 
   The functioning of this new architecture is ensured by five daemons: 
 
1. Name Node; 
2. Data Node; 
3. Mapper; 
4. The integrated algorithm; 
5. Reducer. 
 
    When a user solicits Hadoop to recover files: 
The services requested will be retrieved via the name Node. This Name Node will tell the user which Data nodes 
contain the blocks.   The Name Node regularly receives a ""heartbeat"" and a Block report of all the Data Nodes in the 
cluster to ensure that the data nodes are working properly. A Bloc report contains a list of all blocks in a Data Node. 
In the case of a data Node failure, the Name Node selects new data Nodes for new data block replications, balances 
the disk usage load and manages the data traffic of the data Nodes. 
 
   When the drive retrieves the data from the storage system, it must convert the data into <key, value> pair to continue 
the execution (this process is called data analysis). The analysis consists in decoding the data from their native storage 
format in order to transform them into a format that can be used by a programming language. During this 
transformation, the data will pass in addition by the new integrated algorithm whose purpose is to eliminate any 
intrusions or parasite encountered. The resulting data from this transformation will then go through the reducer of the 
goal to stand out from the value.  
 
6. Conclusion 
 
Although Big Data is the new digital revolution in the field of data, that presents a good number of benefits to the 
users, but in return, it faces a lot of security challenges. This paper aims to shed light on the security problems 
encountered, and especially on those that hinder the proper functioning of big data processing systems during their 
work. For these reasons, we tried to present through this paper as a solution to the problems mentioned, the application 
of an algorithm in the Map reduce, part of the Hadoop ecosystem, which is responsible for parallel processing in real 
time. Whose operation (of the algorithm), is analogeous to the work of the immune system of the human body.

Abstract 
During last decade, there has been a significant interest to integrate maintenance management with 
Statistical Process Control (SPC). The research on integrating SPC with maintenance is not adequately 
discussed in literature. In this paper, a brief overview of the existing literature on the integration of the SPC 
charts with maintenance has been discussed. Based on the literature review, few research gaps have been 
identified, and possible future research opportunities have been addressed.

1. Introduction
The planning and implementation of preventive maintenance programs plays a critical role in maintaining the desired 
reliability and availability of engineering assets. The ultimate goal of any maintenance program is to reduce or 
eliminate system breakdowns which in returns will improve and ensure effective system reliability. Reliability 
monitoring of engineering assets is an important tool to monitor maintenance effectiveness. The integration of 
maintenance management and assets’ reliability monitoring may provide more benefits to organizations (see Alsyouf 
et al., 2016). 
In recent years, there has been a significant interest to integrate maintenance management with SPC. More and more 
practitioners and academicians recognize that there is strong relationship between product quality, process quality and 
equipment maintenance (Zhou, et. al., 2007), the growing interrelationship between quality control and maintenance 
planning forces organizations to develop integrated management systems, which requires an increased level of 
coordination among management practices (Xiang, 2013).  
Control charts are the most commonly used SPC tools. Many researchers have addressed the integration of control 
charts with maintenance management. However, the research on integrating SPC and maintenance is not adequately 
discussed in the literature.  The purpose of this paper is to provide a brief review of existing literature on the integration 
of control charts with maintenance management, and to suggest some possible future research directions. 
2. Control charts and maintenance
It is commonly argued that preventive maintenance (PM) policies can contribute significantly in increasing equipment
reliability, as well as in reducing the maintenance-related costs (Panagiotidou et al., 2009). Models and policies of
maintenance can be found in (Sharma et al., 2011; Garg & Deshmukh, 2006; Chien, Sheu & Zhang, 2012;
Moghaddam, 2008; Henry, et al., 2012; Liu, Xie and Kuo, 2016; Endrenyl et al., 1998; Taghicpour and Banjevic,
2011; Mckone & Weiss, 1998; Wang, 2002; Afefy, 2010). During the last decade, practitioners and academicians
recognized that there is a strong relationship between product quality and equipment maintenance (Amal et al., 2016).
For a deteriorating single-machine manufacturing system, preventive maintenance (PM) is an effective way to
improve the machine reliability and product quality. In conventional PM models, however, quality improvement has
seldom been considered, which may lead to loss of economic benefits (Lu et al., 2016).  The close relationship between

Abstract  
 
Optimization techniques are becoming essential in the field of power systems. In this paper, two Dynamic 
Programming (DP) optimization methods were used to solve a large-scale problem which is known as the 
unit commitment problem (UCP). A sample of ten generating units that forms one power station in 
Kuwait was chosen to be tested. This paper aims to have a schedule with the least possible electricity 
production cost while meeting the hourly demand in addition to other system constraints and this is what 
is known as UCP. A MATLAB code was used to generate solutions for the ten-unit system. The results 
showed that the conventional DP method reduced the cost by 36.1% while priority DP method reduced 
the cost by 35%. Since the future NEWKUWAIT vision is introducing renewable energy resources to the 
power system, solving the UCP will be the first step towards reaching the vision.

1. Introduction 
The electricity consumption worldwide is increasing with the continuous increase of the population. This huge 
consumption creates threats on the power systems. Speaking locally, Kuwait’s electrical systems are under risk in 
terms of electricity shortages and blackouts (Ansari, 2013). A new investment of buying more generators to supply 
the current demand would be expensive. Consequently, we need to search what problems the current grid is facing 
and how these problems can be solved. When studying an electrical grid, the first component is the generator. The 
most studied problem related to generators is the unit commitment problem (UCP) (Hobbs, Rothkopf, O'eill, & 
Chao, 2002). Therefore, the problem addressed in this paper is the UCP which is the scheduling of generators to 
produce enough electricity to meet the increasing power demands with the least possible production operating cost. 
The current system will be modeled and solved by knowing the inputs and the costs of the generation, and by adding 
the amount of consumption over time to balance the input and output. There are many techniques that can be used to 
solve the UCP. One of the disadvantages of the methods of solution is that the optimum solution is not guaranteed 
100 percent; however, the optimality percentage varies from one method to the other (Tung, Bhadoria, Kaur, 
Bhadauria & Pg, 2012). Dynamic programming (DP) approach was considered in this paper. The advantage behind 
using DP is the easy implementation of the problem. DP includes various features that deal with controlling the size 
of the problem effectively (Alshareef & Saber, 2012). It was proven to be a successful technique in solving a 
medium size power plant. Solving unit commitment problem is an important issue which is targeted by most 
electrical companies and ministries. Solving such problem will help in reducing the total operating cost, as well as 
the emissions that are given off by fuel combustion (Taha, 2010). The main objectives of this paper are to formulate 
and optimize the problem, create a 24 hour schedule for ten generators that are located in Sabiya- Kuwait power 
system, and finally specifying when to turn them on/off to reduce the generating cost while meeting the daily 
demand and the operational constraints. Reaching the objectives will show the impact of this paper towards 
engineering solution economically in Kuwait as well as meet future environmental needs.

an average of 1.45 seconds to generate the schedule which is much less than the conventional method. The detailed 
production cost of each hour was listed in Table 7. 
 
Figure 5: Schedule using Priority DP method 
After testing the system and comparing the results, it was found that the best method to implement for scheduling 
the problem is the Conventional Dynamic Programming, since it can generate a final hourly schedule with the least 
possible cost compared to the baseline cost. On the other hand, this method took much longer time than the priority 
dynamic programming method when testing the system. This might cause some inconvenience, but since the main 
focus was to minimize the total cost, the time is not a big issue if there was no big time variation between the two 
methods. Comparing the three scenarios together, we can get the following results:

As noticed from Table 8, conventional method reduces the operating cost of the generations by 36.1% which is a 
very high percentage. Putting into consideration that when the problem is solved as large scale problem (the whole 
power system), the cost reduction would be critical. The disadvantage of the conventional DP method is that it might 
consume a huge amount of time to solve such a large problem (Souroudi, 2017). For instance, 12 units were solved 
using conventional DP in it took more than 45 minutes to get the final schedule. In this case, the other alternative 
solution can be considered since the number of combinations is low. It would generate schedules fast but with higher 
costs than the conventional. Since the ministry of electricity and water at the current time do not pay attention that 
much on the costs, they might go to the priority method. However, with the continuous increase in the fuel costs, 
they might go to the conventional method regardless time elapsed. Finally, both methods are applicable and 
depending on the need of the customer (Matousek & Gärtner, 2007). 
6. Conclusion  
The aim of this paper is to apply optimization methods to a real-life problem which is the power system in this case. 
The focus was based on optimizing the generators by reducing the total production cost. Different methods were 
explained with their advantages and disadvantages; the discussion part of the paper included both theoretical and 
numerical considerations to optimize the problem. The results were translated into tables and graphs to compare the 
applied methods and reach the optimum solution. These tables and graphs were then explained in detail in the 
discussion section where economic goals were satisfied through minimizing the total production operating cost. 
Dynamic programming was proven to be an efficient way to solve the unit commitment problem and such a method 
will make a huge difference when implementing it in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in general and in Kuwait 
in specific. It was verified that solving the unit commitment problem is an effective, innovative and creative way in 
the power systems field and this paper is concluded to be successful and is able to be implemented.

Abstract  
 
In this study, we perform Market Basket Analysis in a supermarket, and find associations between 
different product categories by using Apriori and Éclat algorithms, and represent the findings by using 
Tableau program was used to represent the data graphically data visualization tool. We first analyzed the 
point of sales data (POS) data to see which SKUs are purchased together, and we categorize the SKUs 
into main product categories to find the associations between products. After finding the associations 
among product categories, we redesign the store layout based on these findings, and calculated the 
distance traveled by a typical customer to choose the best store layout.  It turns out that the first layout 
alternative tends to improve the walking distance by an average of 13.3%, for a typical customer, the 
second one will improve the distance traveled by 8% on average.

1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique that is used widely to find the associations among products. 
Market Basket Analysis provides the retailer useful information on products are brought together by its customers. 
This information may be used to influence customers’ purchases, to re-organize the current layout of the retail shop, 
allocating the products on the shelves, etc. Market Basket Analysis results allows companies make easier decisions 
on how to bundle products and how to reorganize stores in a better way to increase sales and increase customer 
satisfaction. Whenever a customer enters a retail store she walks around with the intention of buying the items in 
mind. During grocery shopping, some unlisted items might grab the customer's attention, and she will most probably 
get the item, which is most likely not directly related to any of the other items in the basket. There's a high 
probability that amongst various customers we will find similar associations between items. When checking out at 
the counter the items bought look unrelated to each other, but that may not be the case. The items bought may be 
highly dependent on each other, where if a customer buys item “A” there is a high chance she would buy item “B”. 
Market Basket Analysis is done for decision making in choosing the appropriate allocation of products in the retail’s 
layout. This is done by finding how the items are dependent on each other. 
 
There are many hidden and interesting relationships between the products in the supermarkets that cannot be spotted 
easily. These relationships are represented in the form of association rules by having a left and right hand side. The 
association rule consists of two parts, the antecedent, A and the consequent, B. Association rules are considered 
interesting if they satisfy a minimum support threshold. Given A is the antecedent and B is the consequent, the 
support is the probability that a transaction contains both A and B. The confidence on the other hand is a conditional 
probability, where the probability of having both A and B is divided by the probability of having A.   
There are also various algorithms that are available for performing Market Basket Analysis. Some of the many 
known algorithms include the Apriori, Éclat, FP Growth, Decision tree algorithm and the Apriori prefix tree

6. CONCLUSION 
In this project, we addressed the technique of Market Basket Analysis, which is used in retailing to find relationships 
between products. The strength of the associations between products can be measured by the three measures: 
support, confidence and lift. Our literature review evaluates the several approaches that can be applied to perform 
Market Basket Analysis. The implementation of theses algorithms can help retailers in decision making. The steps in 
our methodology are to obtain point of sales data, clean data, categorize data, implement different algorithms, 
extract useful associations, and then make new layout recommendations to the supermarket. 
 
7. RECOMMENDATIONS 
We recommend to Al-Shuhada supermarket to change their current layout based on either of the alternative layouts, 
since the study was done on the customers in Al-Shuhada. In future references the project can be further analyzed 
were the support threshold can be decreased and more rules can be obtained. Additionally, more transactions can be 
inputted in order to increase the range of customers.

Abstract 
  
Disruptions may occur in supply chains because of internal or external factors. Internal factors and 
especially paths disruptions between supply chain elements are considered in this paper. For employing 
resiliency and mitigation of disruption risks in a supply chain, three policies including backup capacity at 
suppliers, safety stock for each path, and using several suppliers are considered. A nonlinear two stage 
stochastic programming model is presented with adopting resilient strategies. Various scenarios were 
generated by considering disruptions in different paths. Considering all scenarios during solving the 
model will increase the computational time. To decrease the computational time efficiently, a sampling 
method can be used. In this paper different methods of sampling strategies were analyzed and compared 
for a three echelon supply chain problem. The best method was determined based on the ability of the 
method to lead us to accurate estimation with less computational time. Also the results confirm necessity 
of resilient stochastic consideration of the problem. Adopting resilient strategies reveal increasing profit 
versus non-resilient supply chain when disruptions occur. The scenario reduction schemes can improve 
the applicability of network designs in an uncertain environment.

1. Introduction 
A supply chain consists of three main echelons supply, process and distribution among customers. All of these 
echelons may face disruption by different causes such as earthquake, fire, flood, war, labor strikes, etc. Confronting 
disruptions without preset strategies can reduce the profit of supply chain. Adopting resilient strategies in considered 
supply chain cause a quick return to normal statue. Utilizing resilient strategies is a competitive advantage between 
supply chain rivals, due to the fact that it causes dramatic decrease in system fluctuations. Resiliency is the 
advantage of system that can mitigate risks with different policies.   
When disruptions are considered, several conditions that is called scenarios can occur in the supply chain. With 
considering scenarios, a two stage stochastic programming model is presented that determines the best decisions for 
obtaining optimum profit. Increasing scenarios take more computational time that it can be decreased by reducing 
selected scenarios. With sampling schemes, several scenarios are selected and it's crucial that samples are a good 
indicators form population. Due to this importance, six sampling schemes are analyzed that can be an approximate 
of the population. In this paper, the best scheme has been determined for each instance. It means that the proposed 
model chooses the sampling method which lead us to reach the near to optimum profit with less CPU time.

6.5. Setup preferences in model C 
In previous sections, equal importance is considered for difference of objective values and CPU time. For ingoing 
unequal preferences in model C, firstly, the parameters of model C must be standardized. After standardizing the 
model, the unequal preferences are entered in the form of coefficients. Results of standardized model C in simulated 
instances specify if CPU time is more important third sampling scheme most of the time is selected for sixty-four 
and one hundred twenty-eight scenarios that can be observed in table 13, 14.

7. Conclusion  
In this paper, the considered supply chain confronts with disruptions that occurs in linking paths. For restoring to 
normal condition, resilient strategies are analyzed and the computational results present when disruptions occur the 
profit of supply chain with resilient strategies is more than non-resilient one egregiously. The differences of profit 
between resilient and non-resilient supply chain is growing when the probability of disruptions are increased.  
Disruptions in supply chain causes different scenarios, by growth in number of scenarios the computational effort 
increases dramatically. To deal with this complexity that faces the problem by increasing in number of scenarios, we 
present sampling schemes that calculates approximation of objective function value with reduced number of 
scenarios. In this paper, model C is proposed that selects the best scheme in each simulated instance. By using 
model C, the scheme with less approximate error and CPU time is determined. The computational results indicate 
the importance of selecting the best schemes by illustrating profit differences between proper scheme and improper 
one. If preferences enter in the problem the results represent that the third scheme is the most proper when CPU time 
is more important. 
Disruptions of supply chain facilities as well as disruptions in other echelons can be considered as a direction for 
future research. Adopting other resilient strategies such as storing semi-manufactured products in manufacturer can 
be considered as another direction for the future works.

Abstract  
 
Hub location problem seeks to find the optimal location of hub facilities and allocate demand points to 
them for transferring of demands between origin and destination points. This paper is aimed to model the 
uncapacitated multiple allocation hub location problem in an uncertain environment. First, a deterministic 
model of uncapacitated multiple allocation hub location is introduced, then a robust optimization 
approach is used for dealing with uncertain parameters. The mathematical formulation of the considered 
problem is developed with uncertainty in demands, hub establishment fixed cost and inter hub flow 
discount factor (α). By means of an uncertainty budget, the level of conservatism is controlled. The 
counterpart models are compared with each other using well known CAB and AP data sets with different 
levels of uncertainty. The results show that with increasing of the uncertainty, more hubs will be 
established with presence of demands uncertainty, while it is decreased when establishment cost or inter 
hub flow discount factor has uncertainty nature.

1. Introduction  
 
   Hub location is an important problem in the location literature and widely used in transportation, 
telecommunications and other applications. When the origin and destination points intend to send commodity to 
each other, direct path between origin and destination point is chosen for transfer commodity. In transportation 
problem when number of origin and destination nodes increase as a results a very large of arcs are created that 
complexity of the model. In hub location problem, one or two intermediate nodes are used to transfer commodity 
between origins and destinations, that reduces the number of arcs. This may decrease total transportation costs 
because of existing of the economy of scale property.  
   The first model in hub location problem was proposed by O’kelly (1987) that introduced the first quadratic 
mathematical model for hub location problem. In this model, only one hub used in each pathway. While, in the 
model proposed by Campbell (1994)  the number of hubs between each origin and destination are determined based 
on hub establishment and routing costs. Contreras et al. (2011) proposed a two-stage stochastic programming model 
for multiple allocation hub location problem by considering uncertain demand and transportation cost. Makui et al. 
(2012) propesed robust optimization for multi-objective capaciteted p-hub location problem when demand and time 
required for process of commudity are uncertain. Alumur et al. (2012) considered a hub location problem with 
uncertain demand and hub establishment fixed cost and robust-stochastic model presented to deal with uncetainty

Figure 5. importance of considering uncertainty for 20 AP nodes and uncertainty in inter hub flow discount factor  
Figure 4 shows the results for 20 AP nodes with uncertain demand. Until  is equal to 0.28 the cost of fixed 
deterministic is lower than fixed robust model. It means that deterministic decision is better than robust decision 
when  is smaller than 0.28, but when  increases, the fixed robust model have lower cost in comparison with 
fixed deterministic model. Figure 5 shows the results for 20 AP nodes with considering uncertainty in α. Until  is 
equal to 0.12 the cost of fixed deterministic is lower than fixed robust model. Figure 6 shows results for 20 AP 
nodes with hub establishment fixed cost uncertainty. Until  is equal to 0.44 the cost of fixed deterministic is 
lower than fixed robust model. By comparing between Figures 4, 5 and 6, the results show that considering the 
nature of robust for uncertain fixed cost is more important and more effective than others like demand and discount 
factor. It means that in case of uncertainty of fixed costs, the robust model should be definitely considered instead of 
deterministic form.

4. Conclusion 
 
   In this paper, three robust multiple allocation hub location models are introduced. Demands, hub establishment fixed 
costs and inter hub flow discount factor (α) are considered as uncertain parameters. These models are solved by 
considering different levels of uncertainties and different uncertainty budgets. Results show that more hubs are needed 
in the presence of uncertain demands, while it is decreased when establishment cost or inter hub flow discount factor 
has an uncertain nature. Decision maker can set the level of uncertainty budget and can increase or decrease the level 
of risk. Level of risk is increased when uncertainty budget has value close to zero and conversely. If uncertainty is not 
considered in the model and later this appear at the model have a lot cost because of wrong decision at the first. It is 
interesting for future research to consider combination of uncertain parameter in the model instead of considering 
individual uncertain parameters. Using decomposition based algorithms to solve medium scale problems can be 
another direction for future studies.

 Abstract: A deterministic inventory model with constant demand and return on the base of economic order 
quantity (EOQ) is considered. We consider a firm that can manufacture new products and recover the value of 
a used product through remanufacturing with dismantling for components. The firm provides product at a 
constant demand rate. Product consists of two components. Each part is manufactured separately and placed 
in inventory, then two components are assembled. The dismantling operation yields two spare components. 
Products are returned according to the return rate, other products are disposed of. The returned product is 
dismantled for components, any part is inspected whether it is usable or not and then is placed in inventory. 
Both components are usable at the different rate. The usable components are then remanufactured or directly 
reused, other components are disposed of.

1 Introduction 
In recent years reverse logistics is receiving increasing attention from both academia and 
industry. There is increasing recognition that careful management can bring both environmental 
protection and lower costs: environmental and economic considerations have led to manufacturers 
taking their products back at the end of their lifetime. As a result reverse logistics process is now 
considered as a basis for generating real economic value, as well as support of environmental 
concerns. 
Rogers and Tibben-Lembke [27] defined Reverse logistics as the process of planning, 
implementing, and controlling the efficient, cost effective flow of raw materials, in-process inventory, 
finished goods and related information from the point of consumption to the point of origin for the 
purpose of recapturing value or proper disposal. Integration of forward and reverse supply chain 
resulted in origination of the concept of a closed-loop supply chain. The whole chain can be designed 
in such a way that it can service both forward and reverse processes efficiently. 
One of the last most full review of quantitative modeling for inventory and production 
planning in closed-loop supply chain was made by Akcaly and Cetinkaya [1].  
As an example of closed-loop supply chain Souza [32] considers Cummins, the original 
equipment manufacturer (OEM) of diesel engines based in Columbus, Indiana. Forward flows consist 
of new engines and/or engine components (such as a water pump or a turbocharger), and reverse flows 
consist of used products, and remanufactured products. For a diesel engine or part, remanufacturing 
consists of six different steps: full disassembly, thorough cleaning of each part, making a disposition 
decision for each part (remanufacture it or recycle it for materials recovery), refurbishing components 
to restore their functionality to that of a new part, reassembly, and testing. Remanufactured engines or 
components sell at a 35% discount relative to the corresponding new engine or module. Upon 
purchasing a Cummins product, customers receive a discount if they return their old product. Used 
products (also known as cores, or returns) are shipped from dealers to Cummins’ depot for used

5  Summary and conclusions 
 Inventory policies for joint remanufacturing and manufacturing have recently received much 
attention. Most efforts,though, were related to (optimal) policy structures and numerical optimization, 
rather than closed form expressions for calculating near optimal policy parameters. The focus of this 
paper is on the latter. We consider a case of a firm that can manufacture new products and recover the 
value of a used product through remanufacturing with dismantling for components. The cost structure 
consists of setup costs, switching cost, holding costs and eoq non related costs. Theorem from the 
section 3 presents simple, closed form formulae for approximating the optimal policy parameters 
under a cost minimization objective.  
The numerical examples were considered, which demonstrated the alteration of the optimal 
policy under different values of the initial parameter ceteris paribus. It also demostrates that the 
dependency of total average cost from other parameters of the model can be rather complex, which is 
the consequence of integer optimal numbers of optimal policy.

Abstract 
Six Sigma DMAIC is a methodology used by business organizations to improve their processes by controlling and reducing 
variation. In this project, an attempt is made to apply and implement Six Sigma to increase teacher’s awareness regarding 
diabetic children in primary schools. At first, a pilot test was conducted to identify and prove the existence of problem. The 
results revealed that 45% of teachers did not know the symptoms of hypoglycemia where 20% of them faced more than 6 cases 
of diabetic pupils in the schools. Voice of the Customer (VOC) was then gained through a parent survey. The Critical to Quality 
(CTQ) was then identified as well as the Define Phase was then completed. Moreover, the teacher’s current performance level 
was measured by distributing a knowledge test and the results discovered that the performance level is 57.7%. Therefore, the 
team decided to focus on increasing teacher’s awareness by at least 30%. Several tools such as Quality Function Deployment 
(QFD) and Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) were implemented in both the Analyze and Measure phases, then the most 
effective improvements were identified. An educational awareness program was then conducted to introduce teachers to the 
most important information required to handle a diabetic child. Subsequently, another knowledge test was distributed to identify 
the improvements in the scores of the teachers. The results, revealed that the awareness level increased from 57.7% to 89.9%, 
and DPMO reduced from 476190 to 238095. Finally, the Control Phase was completed through introducing an action plan that 
would maintain the improvements made for more years to come.

1. Introduction  
Our job as engineers is to ensure the safety of the children by implementing our knowledge learned in the past few years 
studying engineering into the project like Probability and Statistics in Engineering, Work Analysis and Design II, Quality 
Control, and Six Sigma and Quality Management). The methodology of six-sigma is contributed greatly to our project as we 
aim to increase teacher’s knowledge regarding the diabetic children. Children's parents were the voice of customer that will be 
gained throughout the project by using the survey and a knowledge test for teachers. Finally, going through the five phases of 
DMAIC; the group members were able to find the most appropriate solution in order to maintain a well-oriented school 
atmosphere. As the school atmosphere supports the children's condition the rest of the project goals will fall into place. 
 
2. Background  
         Six-sigma is a well-known approach used to reduce the variations in the Voice of customer and the voice of Process. Six 
Sigma aims to eliminate the defects in a certain process to successfully reach the customers’ expectations. By the time a six-
sigma project is developed there will exist approximately zero defects 0.0000008. Bill Smith, at 1984, a Motorola engineer 
created and developed six sigma management systems to decrease the variation in the company’s electronic manufacturing 
processes for him to be able to eliminate or decrease the number of defects that occur in their products. Since then six-sigma 
became one of the best approaches any company would seek to in order for it to improve its system or products (Rouse& 
McLaughlin, 2007).

6. Results  
The achievements made were discussed with the stakeholders to be able to implement the improvements in away the school 
and the hospital will approve it. The project team was aiming to achieve 30% increase of awareness level but instead 32.2% of 
teacher’s awareness level increased due to the improvements and effort the project team introduced throughout the project.  Table 
3, shows the summary of the results of the project. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7. Conclusion  
Six Sigma with DMAIC was successfully implemented in the study to increase teacher’s awareness regarding diabetic 
children in primary schools. All the solutions implemented are resulted in increasing the awareness level of teacher from 57% 
to 89%. Where sigma level is increased from 1.55 to reached 2.21, therefore the DPMO changed from 476190 to 238095. The 
same effort can be applied through all the primary schools in Kuwait to achieve higher and improved sigma levels.

Abstract 
The primary purpose of this research was to develop Thai and English Braille Fonts by using 
FontForge program. The Critical issues is the identity of Thai language. Because Thai characters consist 
of consonants, tones and vowels unlike native language of Braille. In addition, Thai language has added 
special characters, acronym include and reduce vowels. Including the use of tone marks to determine the 
high and low sound in each word. So the sound level is low or high in Thai makes the meaning change. 
Therefore, the project has been set up by development of script. The main function of Braille is to use, 
control and set the properties of the Braille’s fonts to the correct principles written in Thai and Braille. 
After that we typed the developed and printed it with Braille visual equipment called Slate and Stylus. 
Then we took it to the expert to verify the accuracy and we found that it can be read 100% correctly in 
Braille fonts. Finally we implemented it in bold fonts. We wrote stories in both Thai and English to test 
with blind users in PATTAYA REDEMPTORIST SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND.25 samples read it, we 
found the overall satisfaction were at the highest level by average of 4.50

Abstract 
Since the processes in the health-care domain deal with humans' life, the slightest deviation from the normal state 
can lead to irreparable damages to individuals and society. Therefore, monitoring the quality of the processes in this 
area has attracted many researchers’ attention. On the other hand, the introduction of new therapies for various 
diseases has made process monitoring difficult due to the lack of historical data. In this paper, the effect of 
heterogeneity of patient conditions (including gender, age, etc.) and treatment in different conditions (such as 
treatment with different therapist groups) has been considered using the accelerated failure time (AFT) regression 
model and the risk of each patient has been adjusted accordingly. Then, survival times of patients are monitored 
using a control chart based on the residual values of the AFT regression. Performance of the proposed control chart 
is evaluated using the average run length (ARL) criterion. The results indicate that the proposed method has a 
proper performance in identifying out-of-control status in processes in the health-care domain. The results 
showed that taking into account the therapist groups as well as increasing the number of in-control observations, 
increase the ability of the proposed control chart to detect shifts in the process.

1. Introduction
Due to the competitive environment and efforts to maximize profits, quality plays a crucial role in the success of 
today's organizations. Therefore, organizations need to improve the quality of their products and services by 
minimizing errors, and they use different quality control tools to do so, including control charts. In organizations 
related to the health-care field, issues beyond the profit should be considered. Because of the high cost of therapy 
mistakes, the use of quality tools in this area has been increased, and hospitals and health-care centers have 
consistently sought ways to identify system errors and to remove their effects.
The first and most important step in monitoring processes in SPC is to identify the appropriate quality characteristics 
for monitoring by using the control chart. Various factors such as the rate of infection in the surgery department, the 
mortality rate after treatment, the survival time after treatment, the duration of admission and the waiting time in the 
admission can be considered as quality characteristics in health-care systems (Benneyan, 1998a, 1998b).
The survival time of patients after treatment is one of the most important criterion which is studied in this paper. 
This measure defines as the time to especial event such as death, infection, tumor growth and recovery in 
medical applications.
In survival analysis, not considering the difference between the health conditions of patients referring to the 
organization can lead to an incorrect interpretation of the process. to tackle this problem, risk-adjusted (RA) control 
charts are used to consider this factor (Grigg and Farewell, 2004; Iezzoni, 2013). RA models have been developed

Results indicate that by increasing the size of the shift in the regression coefficients, the 𝐴𝑅𝐿< decreases, which is 
reasonable because by increasing the size of the shift, the control chart will require few observations until receiving 
out-of-control alarm. Furthermore, the 𝐴𝑅𝐿< will decrease when the regression coefficients have been estimated with 
more in-control data. Considering the effect of therapist groups in the AFT regression model leads to decreasing in 
the 𝐴𝑅𝐿< values, which suggests that considering the effect of therapists in the proposed risk-adjusted model leads to 
better performance of the proposed control chart. 
4. Conclusion and suggestion for future research 
In this paper, considering the residuals of the AFT risk-adjusted model as a statistic, a self-starting control chart was 
proposed to monitor the process in the field of health-care. The results show that the proposed method has an 
acceptable performance in identifying shifts in the process especially when the regression coefficients have been 
estimated with more in-control data. More researches should be done on the monitoring of self-starting control charts 
especially with continuous survival data. For example, investigating the other distributions rather than Weibull or 
developing a self-starting control based on likelihood ratio test can be fruitful area for future research.

Abstract  
This study aims to determine the effect of inflation, disaster risk, per capita GDP and global import export 
of world gasoline prices in 2017. The research is a kind of explanatory research with quantitative 
approach. The data used are nominal data with 5 independent variables namely inflation, GDP per capita, 
disaster risk, export and import in 2016 with the dependent variable of world gasoline price in 2017. The 
data used as many as 100 countries in the world are used as samples. With the method of spatial 
regression and weighted regression of geography the researcher wanted to know the influence of the five 
independent variables to the world gas price in 2017. The results of this study indicate that simultaneously 
(t test) using GWR analysis on GDP per capita variables and disaster risk significantly influence the 
world gasoline prices in 2017, while in the variable of inflation, exports, and imports do not have a 
significant effect on the world gas price in 2017. Based on the results of research, it is expected that 
decision makers and the authorities as a policy regulator can take the decision to control macroeconomic 
conditions in the country so that gasoline prices do not go affected and worsening economic conditions in 
a country. Similarly, existing disaster risk factors can be considered to make alternatives and other 
policies to save gasoline prices to keep them stable. Thus, the results of this study can also be used to gain 
attention in maintaining the stability of petrol and macroeconomic prices remain controlled.

1. PRELIMINARY 
 
1.1 Background 
 
Fuel oil is a basic necessity in industries around the world, but fuel oil is a non-renewable natural resource. The need 
for fuel oil both in the field of industry and transportation is increasing every day because these machines require 
fuel oil. Because of that, the development of the world oil prices experienced many changes. 
 
 
Oil and price fluctuations have a vital influence on almost all macroeconomic activity, because oil is one of 
the major energies used both directly and indirectly in producing goods and services. Oil becomes the top energy 
source in its use to sustain the production process compared to other energy sources, so that fluctuations in oil prices 
are very sensitive to economic conditions or economic growth in each country. And no one country is not dependent 
on oil and is able to instantly reduce its consumption due to price increases. The need for energy in the form of oil is 
very large, which is a problem that not all countries in the world have oil resources. In another sense the spread of 
the world's oil reserves is not evenly distributed. 
 
World oil prices are difficult to predict because the factors are numerous, not just technical factors such as 
demand and supply but also non-technical factors such as war, disaster risk, inflation, GDP of each country, exports, 
imports and so on. Researching the price of oil is very interesting to discuss because the ups and downs of oil prices 
will also affect the condition of the internal economy of the Indonesian nation. 
 
Based on the background of the above issues the authors are interested to conduct research entitled 
“Application of Geographically Weighted Regression Analysis on World’s Gasoline Prices Model”.

From the graph it is known that state with the highest gasoline prices in Georgia and the lowest in Saudi Arabia. 
Furthermore, to see the comparison graph of the three variables, the researcher uses 3-dimensional graphs on Geoda, 
following the output: 
 
Figure 11. XY Side Graph 3 Dimensions Based on Variable X (Gasoline) Y (GDP) Z (risk) 
 
From 3-dimensional graph above, it can be seen the relationship pattern of gasoline price data (X) with GDP per 
capita (Y), where the pattern spread following pattern which tend to positive correlation, where the higher the GDP 
then the price of gasoline tends to be high also. But the correlation value is not strong enough, because masi many 
spread of data that is not controlled (outlier). 
 
Figure 12. XZ Side Graph 3 Dimensions Based on Variable X(gasoline) Y(GDP) Z(risk) 
 
While the figure 12 shows the variable side of the price of gasoline (X) to disaster risk (Z) which from the graph 
shows that the data pattern tends not to correlate, because many are assembled flat upwards. However, if seen the 
spread of data, there is a tenuous pattern that follows the pattern of negative correlation, where the lower the price of 
gasoline risks higher disaster. 
 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
Based on the results of the analysis that has been done in this study, obtained some conclusions to answer 
the problem formulation as follows: 
1. From five independent variables, namely Inflation, disaster risk, GDP, exports, and imports, there 
are 2 variables that significantly influence the world price of gasoline that is disaster risk variable 
and GDP per capita. Of the two variables also obtained spatial effects that are evidenced by the 
results of geographical variability test using GWR.

2.
From the results of mapping based on 2 variables that have a significant effect, known
macroeconomic distribution of countries in the world. Mecroeconomic conditions tend to be high
in the continent of Australia, North America and parts of Europe. While that is dominant in the
south american and asia region, except in Africa and northern part of africa have low GDP level.
3.
Viewed from the mapping results based on GDP and gasoline prices, the tendency of the high
level is the same low, ie the dominant high is found in the European continent, while the
moderate, the dominant in southern america, Australia and parts of North America. In Asia and
most of Africa have low gasoline prices and low GDP.

Abstract 
The crime rate in Indonesia is increasing every year. One of the causes is the indonesian population who 
tend to lack of education received so doing all the ways to commit crime is one of the shortcuts. This 
makes most people in Indonesia feel insecure, lowering the level of trust to the government that ensures 
the security of the community. In this study will find out what factors affect the level of crime that 
occurred in 2015. See the extent of the spread of crime in Indonesia in 2015 by using thematic maps. The 
analysis and modeling used are Moran Index Method, Spatial Lag Model (Spatial Auto-Regressive/SAR) 
and Spatial Error Model (SEM).

1. PRELIMINARY
1.1 Background 
In the era of globalization accompanied by the dynamics of cultural growth and the rapidity of science 
and technology has spawned competition in various things, whether in the field of ideology, economy, 
and society. The very basic issue lies in the invasion of culture, at least the values contained in it, such as, 
matrealism, hedonism and so on, which in some way affect the values prevailing in society. The 
prevailing values will result in changing human behavior and changes that have a negative impact seen 
from the emergence of behaviors that cause unrest in society, such as the desire of the fulfillment of 
abundant material needs without balanced ability to achieve in a natural way, so that humans take all 
means to realize the desired such as through crime (Kartono 1992)  
There are two factors that can cause crime, namely internal factors that include the special nature and 
general nature in the individual, and external factors (Abdulsyani, 1987) in Astuti (2014). The special 
nature in the individual among others; mental illness, emotional power, low mental, and anatomy, while 
the general nature in the individual among others; age, physical strength, individual position in society, 
individual education, and individual entertainment. External factors may include economic factors (price 
changes, unemployment, urbanization), religious factors, reading factors and film factors. 
Crime is a problem that seems familiar to people living in any area. A diverse community environment 
can affect a person in committing a crime. As well as a busy and busy environment with a variety of 
activities provide a great opportunity for a non-crime. Crime becomes a complex issue that has become a 
consequence for society, government and law enforcement officers in an area. A crime case 
happens in today's society is increasingly diverse. Conventional crime cases that disturb security and 
order in society include murder, theft by violence, theft with theft, theft of motor vehicles, fire, rape, drug 
abuse, juvenile delinquency, and many others. Generally conventional crime can be classified into several 
groups by their nature. And most often heard is a type of property rights crime or commonly called

Figure 4. Spatial Lag Model 
 
From figure 4, in the variable section it is found that only the variable number of forces that work in 2015 
affects the crime rate occurring in each province. Then get the  R-Squared value and spatial lag model is 
0.53. Its Aic value is 711.585. Then for Spatial eror model produce the following output. 
 
 
Figure 5. Spatial Error Model 
 
Look at figure 5 in probabality column LAMBDA value is 0.876 . The LAMBDA value is less than 0.05 
which means the LAMBDA variable has no significant effect to the model. R-squared regression Spatial 
Error is 0.53386 and the AIC value regression Spatial Error is 709 . PROB value in Diagnostic for 
heteroskedasticit is 0.00733 . The PROB value is greater than 0.05, meaning there is no effect of spatial 
heterogeneity in this spatial error model.  
 
5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  
5.1. Conclusions  
Based on the results of the analysis that has been done, then got the following conclusion:

2042","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Paris, France, July 26-27, 2018 
a. The level of crime in Indonesia year 2015 is mostly more in areas with more population such 
as Jakarta and around Java island. 
b. Provinces with high crime rates have influence to the neighbours, so that crime rates can 
affect the surrounding area 
c. R-squared from regression Spatial Error is smaller than R-squared regression Spatial Lag and 
the AIC value regression SEM greater than SAR. Judging from these two values, it can be 
concluded that a better model used is SAR. 
 
 
5.2. Recomendations 
The government needs to maximize their efforts to find solutions to reduce crime rates, this can be done 
by increasing the number of jobs and increasing the level of education so as to reduce the crime rate in 
each province.

Abstract 
This project aims to develop “An Alerting Device to Prevent Death Risk in Dental Treatment” 
to reduce the risk of death during dental treatment. Our alerting device is a device that can analyze the 
stress. Stress can cause to be shocked by increasing each heart rate and GSR value. GSR value 
shows sweat secretion plays a major role for thermoregulation and sensory discrimination. It can 
change skin conductance in hand and foot ; the higher the arousal, the higher the skin conductance. It 
can mean being in stress. Only each Heart Rate value or GSR value cannot exactly show the levels of 
stress, can cause by congenital disease so both of them are necessary to analyze the stress value. The 
process is receiving GSR value and Heart Rate sensor then we can analyze the values by using 
microcontroller and coding to program the values and show by buzzer to present the levels of the risk of 
death and an effect to be shocked. Each value is arranged by each age because of the Heart Rate 
value’s differences between each age, so the values are separated into 2 levels by each age’s Heart Rate.  
We have already studied in 50 representative samples to use the “Alerting device for prevention of 
death risk in dental treatment” while the samples are treated by a stress that can effect to be shock and has 
death risk. The program is written by an analysis equation between 2 values to stress value so the dentist 
could solve the problems as fast as they could. It can reduce the risk of death causes by the stress 
because of the alert in the moment they have too much stress.

Abstract 
Considering that contractors are one of the main pillars of construction projects and also an important factor in 
converting resources into the final product, it is important to evaluate and select contractors and suppliers. The 
selection of a contractor for construction projects is primarily based on the lowest price, but many other 
factors, quantitatively or qualitatively, have great importance in choosing a contractor or supplier. In this 
paper, taking into account the construction companies of EPC, factors affecting to the selection of contractors 
and suppliers and their impact on each other are considered. This review is based on the DEMATEL method 
and by applying this approach, affected or effected factors are used to evaluate and rank the indicators in the 
selection of suppliers or subcontractors. Therefore, using this method, the main contractors in construction 
projects do not select suppliers or subcontractors in an intellectual way, and this choice will be based 
on indicators.

Abstract 
 
Big and highly populated cities face traffic congestion problems in almost every country. There are four 
standard driving modes which are acceleration, cruising, deceleration and idling. Vehicle fuel 
consumption is being used unnecessarily during idling and acceleration modes instead of steady-speed 
driving. To minimize the fuel consumption, it will be helpful to reorganize traffic lights with the help of 
green-wave strategy. In this paper, the traffic light signalization in a crowded city is studied by the help of 
simulation. The timing of signalization is obtained by using production order quantity model and 
compared to other signalization techniques through simulation. The results show that production order

ABSTRACT 
The environmental impact of leather processing is an area of increasing interest for 
consumers and legislators. The popular chromium salt tanning, which holds the lion share of 
total world leather production, is under pressure for environmental concern. The new so -called 
cleaner tanning agents such as aluminium, titanium, zirconium, and aldehydes set out to avoid 
the use of chromium salts. Various alternative systems have been developed but not yet 
assessed in terms of quantitative environmental impact assessment. We selected tanning 
process using agents such as chrome (conventional), aluminium and aldehydes and attempted 
to understand corresponding environmental impacts from a life cycle perspective. One (1) m2 
of leather was chosen as the functional unit. The direct input profile consists of pickled pelt as 
raw material for all three processes, chemicals, water, and energy. The main outputs are tanned 
leather (chrome/alum or aldehyde), wastewater and solid wastes. Also, a comparative analysis 
was done to show whether there are significant variations in the mechanical properties such as 
tensile strength, tear strength, and softness; hydrothermal properties such as shrinkage 
temperature. Moreover, an analysis of the physical and chemical properties of wastewater 
emissions from the tanning processes was performed. The wastewater samples were analysed 
for chloride, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia 
(NH3-N), nitrite (NO2-N),nitrate (NO3-N), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), phosphate (PO 4), 
sulphate (SO4), total chromium (total Cr), chromium (as Cr 6+), total solids (TS), and total
dissolved solids (TDS). IMPACT 2002+ method has been used under the framework of the 
SimaPro software to measure the environmental burden of the studied systems. The 
comparative results show that aluminium tanning process has more than 13 times the higher 
impact on aquatic ecotoxicity, 4.43 times higher on aquatic acidification than chrome tanning 
process. Also, aluminium tanning has terrestrial ecotoxicity. In contrast, chrome tanning has a 
marginally higher value of non-carcinogens. Besides, aldehyde tanning had a significantly 
higher impact on aquatic ecotoxicity. The mechanical properties of aluminium and aldehyde 
tanned leathers were found to exhibit no significant differences from the leather tanned using 
traditional method (chrome tanned). However, the softness and hydrothermal stability of 
chrome tanned leather are much higher than that of aldehyde and aluminium tanned leather. 
These findings will pave the way for setting up priorities in abatement measures and will 
ultimately aid in achieving sustainability leather production in Bangladesh.

Abstract 
 
We study an integrated supplier chain consisting of a vendor and multiple buyers. We assume that, in order 
to coordinate the supply chain and achieve high efficiency, the vendor adapts Vendor Managed Inventory 
(VMI) policy. Demand is modeled as a deterministic linear demand function where buyers’ markets are 
non-identical. We consider the supply chain problem where the lengths of buyers ordering periods are the 
decision variables in the optimization model. In our setting the vendor produces multiple items. To facilitate 
the production planning, the vendor imposes the joint replenishment policy for its buyers. In this paper we 
present a model of two-echelon single-vendor multiple-buyers supply chain model with multiple items and 
under joint ordering policy. We analyze the model carried out with a numerical study. To validate the 
model, we solve some numerical sample problems by GAMS optimization software. Then, we study the 
sensitive of the model with respect to model’s parameters.

1. Introduction 
The term “supply chain” refers to an integrated view and approach to planning and the control of material and 
information flows among vendors and buyers. This concept, bridges the inventory management focus in operations 
management and the analysis of relationships from industrial organization (Lau and Lau, 2003). A vendor usually is 
the producer of products or items and sells those items to buyers who in turn sells them on their local markets. During 
the last decade we observed an increasing emphasis on the methods to integrate the decentralized decisions by buyers 
and vendors. One example of policies designed to integrate the supply chain is Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) in 
which the vendor assumes responsibility for maintaining inventory levels and determining order quantities for its 
buyers, often distributors or retailers (Dong and Xu, 2007). A proper modeling of supply chain can address many 
issues and inefficiencies in supply chain and can help supply chain managers to enhance their understanding of supply 
chain. Vendor managed inventory (VMI) is a proven concept for successful collaborative and cooperative agreements 
in supply chain which efficiently enables a proper information sharing, communication and coordination between the 
stages of supply chain. 
 
This paper presents an integrated inventory model of VMI system in a two echelon supply chain comprising if multiple 
buyers who purchase multiple items from a single vendor. The vendor applies joint replenishment policy in which he 
gets the order for all items at once. Although most of the supply chains in the real-world applications have multiple 
products, majority of the existing studies only consider a single item. In this paper we focus on concept of VMI and 
develop a mathematical model for multi-item and multi-buyer supply chain operating under both VMI and joint 
replenishment policies. The main contribution of this paper is to model the supply chain mentioned under linear 
demand model and represent the convex mathematical program associated to this supply chain system. We believe 
this setting is a realistic setup which can capture many of nowadays supply chains. 
 
Our paper relates to three main bodies of literature. First, we contribute to the literature on the coordination methods 
in supply chain with emphasis on VMI and joint replenishment. Second, our study extensively uses the methods of

Proof of Theorem 2. Given the derivations in the section 3, the profit that supply chain earns from the jth channel is 
𝑃𝑠𝑗= ∑
(𝑃(𝑦𝑖𝑗) 𝑦𝑖𝑗−𝑇𝑅𝐶𝑗

Now plug back the value of 𝑃(𝑦𝑖𝑗) from Equation (1) and simplify the equations which give us the Equation (14) in 
the Theorem 2.

Abstract 
 
The value methodology that is commonly known as “Value Engineering” is a systematic group problem-
solving method that has been used for more than fifty years. In a brief review of its application process, 
consisting of three steps of pre-study, value study and post-study, it is inferred from its structure that 
various types of knowledge are created during the cycle of its implementation. Due to the different nature 
of the process of a value study and the resultant production of various types of knowledge with a different 
structure, we need to use strategies that help us to discover and extract a variety of knowledge. Data 
mining is one of the strongest knowledge management techniques that contributes to this matter. In other 
words, it is possible to create a system for discovering, extracting, storing and retrieving a variety of 
knowledge in value studies by using the concepts of data mining.  
This research tries to find methods for discovery, extraction, storage and retrieval of all kinds of 
repeatable knowledge of value studies that are known as the outcomes of value studies with the data 
mining approach and using its concepts and one of the most powerful tools of this technique i.e. neural 
networks.

1. Introduction 
More than half a century has passed from the first use of value methodology (including value study, value 
engineering, value management and value planning) to raise the value of projects and so far thousands of value 
studies have been done in the world. Because of the nature of this approach throughout any value study, information, 
innovative strategies and valuable knowledge- which are called the outcomes of a study in this article - are produced 
by a team of experts. Nevertheless, any new value study or planning, designing and implementing a new project is 
carried out without regard to the repeated outcomes of prior value studies and only the experiences and tacit 
knowledge of some of the team members present in the previous studies who participate in new project or value 
study can be used. Therefore, the problem-solving processes in value studies heavily depend on the experiences and 
attitudes of team members that can be influenced by various factors. 
 In this paper, it attempts to take steps to improve the value studies and develop the user domain by data mining 
concepts and the application of the neural networks. In this regard, first, the outcomes produced in a value study that 
can be used in the future for a variety of purposes are introduced by phase-to-phase analysis and value engineering 
steps. Then the uniqueness of the value study is discussed and solutions are provided to overcome the problem of 
using the outcomes of the study. Then a simple database is designed for classifying and categorizing the extracted

14. Conclusions 
We attempt to design and use a systematic model for the management of value studies’ knowledge using data 
mining concepts. Using this systematic and purposeful model can remove the value studies from their traditional 
state and increase their efficiency either in terms of raising the value of each project or in terms of creating the 
ability to extract, record and retrieve the experts’ experience, skills and opinions as the team member of any value 
study. Accordingly, some effective results are as follows: 
 The most important result is meeting the main research problem i.e. “the lack of strategies to use the 
generated outcomes in previous value studies to use them in future applications”.  
 Contributing to implement value studies and increasing their efficiency: Using the results of this paper it is 
possible to overcome the difficulties and limitations mentioned above by using the outcomes of previous 
value studies that have a connection and overlap with the new project. Accordingly, in each of the 
mentioned phases the information and necessary elements of that phase are provided as a primary feed for 
the team members leading the effective use of time in a value study. 
 The transformation of tacit knowledge of experts and elites in multidisciplinary team (that provide this tacit 
and experimental knowledge in different phases of a value study) into applied and objective knowledge.  
 Expansion and development of value engineering for smaller projects where best specialists are absent it is 
possible to use their respective views and experiences. 
 Creating an intelligent system for organizations and ministries where the employers have large projects as 
well as the design consultant firms so that they can estimate the prior value studies that are relevant to their 
project based on the designed database.

Abstract  
 
 
The new Balanced Scorecard (BSC) model is an effective tool for the evaluation and monitoring of the 
financial and non financial companies performance. To improve its efficiency, we have added two new 
perspectives: health and safety at work and the environment. In order to define the cause-and-effect 
relationship between the six perspectives of the new BSC model, we have selected a case study of a 
Moroccan medical analysis laboratory. Indeed, this laboratory is working to consolidate its leadership in 
its field or sector of activity at regional and national scales through its commitment to the ISO 9001 
quality management system and a steady improvement of its performance and efficiency. In this context, 
it implemented a system of performance indicators. Accordingly, we classified these indicators according 
to the six axes of the new BSC model. Then, we studied the cause and effect relationship between the six 
perspectives using the DEMATEL method (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory).

Abstract  
 
The objective of this work is the optimization of the passenger treatment chain at Fez-Sais airport. Our 
approach is articulated around a systematic analysis of the passenger treatment process in order to detect 
its constraints, illuminate the possible improvements and develop a method to improve the process. For 
that reason we have used the flow and process diagram as well as the queuing theory.  
The discounted result is the enhancement of the passenger’s service quality, while decreasing the time of 
waiting and eliminating bottlenecks, via the improvement of the forecasting, scheduling and resources 
affectation processes at the level of different modules of the chain.

Introduction 
 
Passengers at the airport expect a smooth and personalized treatment, but the multitude of actors and occupations 
with divergent interests, different constraints and priorities, and consequently divergent and autonomous processes, 
make the fast service expected, sometimes perceived as unpleasant and this due to the multiplicity of controls, the 
cumbersome registration procedures and queues that passengers confront. 
The speed and fluidity of treatment with a better quality of service constitute strong demands from passengers. So 
how can we reconcile the fluidity expected by passengers and the divergency of airport processes?  
The systematic analysis of the passenger treatment process will be our approach to detect the constraints, to 
enlighten the possible improvements and to develop a method in order to enhance the process. To this end we use 
the flow diagram and the queuing theory. 
Our goal is to improve the quality of passenger service by reducing waiting times and eliminating bottlenecks 
through improving forecasting, planning and resource allocation in the various components of the system. 
 
1. Service Quality at Airports (Passenger Terminal) 
 
1.1. Service quality dimensions 
 
Airports have become more than just a port that people travel through on their way to their destination, with many 
now operating as hubs that send passengers around the world. These Hubs work to create economies of scale by 
pooling demand for destinations and regular flights.  
Airport customers are considerably varied and involve passengers, airlines, employees, concessionaires, tenants and 
others. Despite their differences, however, all these customers are at the airport for the sole purpose of transferring 
from ground based to air modes of transportation (Fodness and Murray, 2007). In this study, we chose to focus on

Our main entry data is the number of passengers planned for a flight or given flights. The output data are the 
resources to implement. For a departure flight the resources will be: 
 The number of registration counters to open at the first hour and the number of counters to open the next 20 
minutes; 
 The number of checkpoints for hand luggage and the number of emigration counters; 
 The number of PIF (Inspection /Filtering posts); 
 The average number of passengers waiting in queues and system and the average waiting time in queues and 
system. 
For a flight or several flights on arrival, the output data will be: 
 The number of immigration counters to be set up; 
  The average number of passengers waiting in queue and system; 
  The average waiting time in queue and system. 
As a result (screenshots below) we can simulate the resources to be implemented in such a way as to reduce the 
waiting time to the maximum. 
Analysis of the results of this tool shows that at the level of: 
 The registration module, we do not need to retain the same human resources after the first hour of treatment. 
They can be redeployed in boarding module for control of boarding passes and the preparation of passengers for 
flight. 
 The emigration module, the minimum number of resources to be used is 4 counters (i.e. 4 agents) given the 
passenger flow from the baggage checkpoint. 
 The immigration module, with a passenger number exceeding 120, we have to use all the resources (the 10 
counters) because all the passengers show up at the arrival room within 10 minutes after the arrival of the flights. 
 The luggage delivery module, the flow from the immigration counters is very large, so luggage delivery must be 
very fast to avoid congestion and excessive waiting time especially in the case of simultaneous flights. 
 The RMP (Reduced Mobility) counters must be used for more performance considering the limited percentage of 
RMP passing through the airport. If a PMR is present, it must have priority in terms of formalities. 
 
Conclusion  
 
The tool we have proposed provides help in making decisions on resources to implement at each module, in order to 
reduce passenger waiting time. However, it remains inadequate without close cooperation between all actors in the 
airport chain. 
To attend this co-ordination, it is necessary to give each actor a vision of his / her role in the achieving of the overall 
performance, bringing the different actors together in a working group or a think-tank to share information, make 
decisions and solve problems related to each flight

Abstract 
In this paper, a multi-objective and comprehensive mathematical model is presented to address a course 
timetabling problem. The purpose of the model is to allocate the courses to timeslots, so that the following 
constraints are observed: availability times of instructors, the number of available classrooms in faculties, 
the eligibility of classes and timeslots for the courses, overlap prevention for teaching hours of each 
instructor, the maximum working times allocated to each instructor in day, overlap prevention for courses 
within course groups. Also, this paper aims to increase satisfaction degree of instructors by maximizing 
their preferences to teach in their desired day and timeslot, as well as providing more times to do researches. 
The proposed model is coded in GAMS and solved by the augmented epsilon-constraint method for a real 
case study. Finally, TOPSIS method is employed in order to select the most favorable solution among the 
Pareto solution. The results were approved and welcomed by the faculty.

1. Introduction
Problem-solving of educational timetabling for large institutions is greatly difficult; since these institutions include a
large number of students, instructors, courses, and classes which are most of the time contradictive in terms of their
conditions and objectives. Therefore, each solution must take into account various decision variables and constraints.
Due to numerous constraints and the complexity of their relationships, this problem is classified into a group of NP-

7. Conclusion and future work 
In this paper, a multi objective 0-1 programming model was presented. To make the model more real, different 
constraints were took into account in our study. These constraints were related to the availability and eligibility of 
instructors and classes, legal constraints, not overlapping the courses of instructors in a day, not overlapping the 
primary courses related to the students who enter the university in the same semester, and competency between the 
timeslots and the courses assigned them. The objectives were to maximize the preference level of instructors and 
minimize the working days of ones to teach. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, a real case study 
was provided. The model was coded in GAMS software and solved by AECM for the case study. Then the TOPSIS 
method was used to select the most favorable solution among the non_d0minated solutions. For future research, 
considering other challenges (e.g. disruption and uncertainty) in designing the course timetable, and developing 
efficient meta-heuristics to address these challenges are suggested.

Abstract  
 
The aim of this work is to provide better sales forecasting in the context of a supply chain, by using 
S&OP model and integrating the time series. We have supposed that difficulties encountered by 
partners in the forecasts come on one hand from the adaptation of existing statistical models and the 
other hand from the absence of collaboration and information sharing between partners. Our approach 
consist in a first step to present the role of forecasts in the relationship between supply chain partner’s 
and in a second step to recast the process of forecasting relying on a collaborative approach and to 
develop a scientific model for a monthly sales forecasting. 
 
Keywords  
Statistical model, Collaborative approach, Forecasting process, Supply chain. 
 
Introduction 
 
Sales forecasts have a significant impact on the effectiveness of a supply chain, they even have an influence on 
firms whose final product is ""made on request"" (Yelland, 2006).  
Therefore, we proceed, first, with the presentation of the forecasts status in a supply chain, specifically at the 
level of the relationship between partners, to show their interest as well as all the problems plaguing these 
forecasts. We have assumed that the difficulties encountered by the partners in forecasting stem from the 
adoption of existing statistical models and the lack of collaboration and information sharing between partners. 
Second, and to verify this hypothesis, we have established a forecasting processes diagnosis at the level of a 
beverage company. Thus, it have been proved necessary, on one hand, to retake the process of forecasts 
establishing and make it evolve towards greater collaboration and agility by using a collaborative method such as 
the ""Sales and operations planning"" and on other hand to establish a good visibility on the future demand by the 
development of a statistical model of forecast sales. A reliability and analysis of the data history was essential to 
detect the adequate forecasting method. The nature of the data guided the choice to the Decomposing in time 
series method. After establishing the forecasting model, an analysis of its effectiveness was necessary. So, we 
tested its results on the learning data with which it was constructed and we introduced indicators that give an 
idea on the accuracy of forecasts 
 
1. Forecasts at the supply chain level 
 
1.1. Role and difficulty of establishing forecasts in the supply chain 
 
The Supply Chain is a set of companies connected by customer-supplier relationships. (Chopra and Meindl, 
2007) defined the supply chain as all the parties involved in executing a customer order. Each agent in the chain 
concerned must make decisions regarding the product to be purchased, the time of purchase and quantities to be 
purchased using the request of its respective customers. These decisions cannot be made without forecasting. 
Therefore, the obligation to foresee is linked to the response time, so a large majority of companies have delivery 
times of a few days or even hours (pharmaceutical distributor); the storage of finished products is then 
imperative on pain of being in rupture. To optimize the stock level, the obligation to forecast demand is required.

Abstract  
 
The main objective of this paper is to design a dentists’ workspace for optimal performance using JACK, 
developed by Siemens Corporation (Siemens PLM Software Inc.,) is a Digital Human Modeling (DHM) 
software package capable of simulating human involved in any number of tasks and performing 
ergonomic analysis. Dentists all over the world are suffering from Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) 
that are resulted by improper work postures, repetitive tasks, and forced positions for longer time. Thus, 
to reduce the effects of MSDs among dentists, ergonomic assessments have been implemented to evaluate 
their work postures and determine the risks at their workspaces. JACK provides some design tools such as 
Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) and Ovako Working Analysis System (OWAS) for performing 
ergonomic analysis of virtual products and work environments. OWAS and RULA are the ergonomic 
assessments that are used to examine the work postures and the MSDs for dentists resulted by the 
improper postures by simulating their postures on JACK. By using the results of OWAS and RULA, 
workspaces of the dentists are redesigned and their postural angles and positions are modified. The final 
analysis of OWAS and RULA showed that improvements were significant to reduce MSDs while the 
dentists perform their tasks.

Abstract 
 
Purpose– Worldwide, Quality Management (QM) in healthcare services has become an 
important focus. This paper aims to develop a conceptual framework that will be used to improve 
the existing QM in Oman’s Healthcare.  
 
Design/methodology/approach– In May 2014, Ministry of Health in Oman has published the 
first edition of its Health Vision: 2050. It was developed through a number of well-planned 
scientific activities. Few studies have built on this vision in different aspects. This paper has 
studied this vision and other literatures that have been published in the last Four years to design a 
framework for Oman’s healthcare QM.  
 
Findings– The proposed conceptual framework consists of four pillars; building a quality and 
patient safety culture among employees, top management commitments toward quality and 
patient safety, identifying a monitoring system to track input and output, and involving patients 
and their families in creating new services and improving the current ones. Each pillar is 
consisting of different dimensions which are measured by Key Performance Indicators.  
 
Originality/value– To the best of author’s knowledge, no conceptual framework has been 
developed to improve Oman’s Healthcare QM. This framework assists decision makers to reach 
performance improvement against a best practice benchmark.

fit of maintenance activities with the overall business objectives. Many times there is a misfit between the 
maintenance objectives and the business objectives, and this creates fissured priorities at the operational 
level, which mostly suffocates and derails the maintenance or reliability improvement initiatives in many 
businesses. The overall impact derived from the strategic misfit is not only limited to the viability of 
maintenance operations, but this is translated to the entire business, with oftentimes detrimental effects to 
the entire business’ performance. Therefore, the strategic significance of maintenance activities need to be 
considered at business level, and be linked to the overall business strategy to eliminate any conflicting 
priorities in the operation of the business as a whole. This study was undertaken to examine the ways in 
which maintenance strategies are formulated and interlinked to the overall business context, and the 
means that can be established to eliminate any hurdles that may impede the strategic translation process.

Introduction  
 
Today’s competitive business arena calls for businesses to compete on various dynamics that include time, pricing, 
technological superiority, innovational leadership, quality, service-reliability, and data control, in the midst of all 
these factors, asset care and assets availability are vital strategic considerations that  affect the business' capability to 
strive in the market effectively. (Madu, 2000:937). Asset maintenance strategies are essential in the competitive 
running of business establishments nowadays, and with the escalating reliance on technological facets for the 
majority of operational facades, it is imperative that befitting maintenance and reliability strategies are developed to 
safeguard that these businesses are able to deliver suitable quality and appropriate service to their clients (Madu, 
2000:938). The industrial maintenance scenario is characterized by the strategic significance of ensuring

To further confirm whether there was a complete link between the maintenance objectives and the business 
objectives, the engineering department’s balanced scorecard was also assessed to identify if there was any point of 
departure from the business scorecard. All the business objectives were found to be addressed in the departmental 
business objectives as per the table shown below.

Discussion of Results and Conclusion 
 
The link between the business objectives as per the business balanced scorecard and the maintenance objectives as 
per the maintenance department’s balanced scorecard showed that in order to gain alignment of strategic intents, the 
functional objectives need to relate to the business objectives. This scenario removes the ambiguity of understanding 
the maintenance plans that need to be carried out in order to attain the business objectives. This further removes the 
hurdles in acquiring resources required by the maintenance function for them to meet their own objectives which are 
in alignment to the business objectives. The alignment of strategies and objectives removes the counterproductive 
debates and justification for maintenance expenditures in the absence of concrete plans. The budgetary processes 
also need to follow the strategic derivatives which are generated from the maintenance plan that is put in place with 
the objectivity to meet the business goals.

Abstract 
 
Thermal transfer phenomena are ubiquitous in many industrial applications. A good knowledge of these 
processes makes it possible to ensure the conformity of the thermal equipments, to keep them in good 
working order, in order to increase the service life of these equipments and to improve their availability 
and their performances. Thermography among the best monitoring and diagnostic tools used in predictive 
maintenance. 
 
The principle of this technique is to monitor through temperature sensors the thermal profile of structures 
and industrial systems. These sensors allow detecting abnormal temperature changes, indicating a 
potential malfunction: hotspot, leaks.... It measures the intensity of infrared (i.e. heat) emissions to 
determine the operating conditions of the equipment. By detecting thermal anomalies, some areas are 
warmer or colder than they should be, we can locate and identify incidents since their births. 
 
The use of thermography in a predictive maintenance program makes it possible, in particular, to control 
the thermal efficiency of processes based on transfers or heat preservation, the operation of electrical 
equipment and various parameters involved in both reliability and reliability system performance. 
Infrared techniques can therefore be applied to many types of industrial equipment. 
 
The study of the thermal signature of a system or its components makes it possible to determine the 
heating zones which are often characteristic of the degradation of the system. 
 
The present work consists of giving the principle, advantages, disadvantages and application of 
thermography in industries.

Abstract 
 
Food waste is a growing problem in our modern society. Approximately one third of the food produced for 
human consumption is disposed. Food losses and wastes occur along the entire food supply chain from 
harvesting to consumption. Tackling the problem of food waste will lead to a more sustainable life. Another 
problem facing our society is the drastic increase in energy consumption due to the continuous growth in 
the world population and the rise in standard of living. This increase stresses on the amount of fossil fuels 
being used to meet current demand, and eventually fossil fuel alone will not be able to meet the amount of 
energy needed by the world. This paper addresses the design of a food waste to bioethanol supply chain to 
tackle both problems of food wastes and energy. Three key decisions are addressed for the optimal design 
of the supply chain: (1) the number, sizes and location of the bio-refineries; (2) the sites and amount of food 
wastes collected; (3) the transportation plans of bioethanol to demand points. A multi objective (Economic, 
Environmental, social) model is proposed. A case study in Egypt is introduced and is proposed for future 
implementation.

1. Introduction 
Energy consumption has been increasing drastically over the last 200 years and is expected to increase by 28% from 
2015 to 2040 (U.S. energy information administration). The major source of energy comes from fossil fuels, with 
the most used today being oil, coal and natural gas (Riddle et al., no date). The use of renewable resources aims at 
solving the problem of the limited fossil fuels. This led to an increase in research towards the production of 
bioenergy from biomass for a more sustainable living. Biomass refers to non-fossilized and biodegradable elements 
of the products, byproducts, residues and waste from agriculture, forestry and related industries which are used as 
the feedstock for producing biofuels and generating heat and power (Demirbas, 2009). The biomass feedstock, 
biofuels, can be classified into three generations. The first generation biofuel are produced directly from food crops. 
The biofuel is derived from the starch, sugar or vegetable oils present in the crop. Second generation biofuels are 
produced from non-food crops such as wood, organic wastes, food crop waste and specific biomass crops. Third 
generation biofuels use specially engineered crops such as algae as the energy source. The major disadvantage of 
first generation biofuel is that it threatens the food chain, since the feedstock used in this process can be used as 
food. Therefore, second and third generation biofuels have been developed to overcome the limitations of first 
generation biofuels (Mullan and Walker, 2009).  
 
Food waste, which is one of the sources for second generation biofuel, is also creating serious environmental and 
social problems, and according to the UN food and Agriculture organization (FAO 2011) annual food losses have 
been estimated at about 1.3 billion tones. The food wastes produced includes rotten fruits, vegetables, vegetable 
peelings etc. these food wastes are mostly disposed in landfills and are known to cause hazardous effects on people, 
animals, and the environment. Landfills are unsustainable as they produce methane which is a common greenhouse 
gas and also generate large amount of harmful leachate when rainwater falls on the garbage, which can contaminate 
water and soil (Karmee and Lin, 2014).

5.3 Oil Refineries 
Egypt is the biggest oil refiner in Africa with a total of ten refining companies operating 12 refineries. These include: 
 
1. Middle east oil refinery (MIDOR) - is located in the Ameryia specialized free zone in Alexandria with a 
maximum refining capacity of 215,000 barrels/ day 
2. Cairo oil refining company (CORC) - CORC has two refineries. One is in Mostorod with a maximum 
production capacity of 142,000 barrels a day. The other is in Tanta whose production capacity is 35,000 
barrels a day 
3. Egyptian refining company (ERC) - is located in Mostorod and its current maximum refining capacity is 
around 28 million tons a year. 
4. Alexandria Petroleum company (APC) - The refinery’s main facility is El Mex Refinery whose maximum 
refining capacity is around 117,000 barrels per day. 
5. Alexandria minerals and oil company (AMOC) – Is located in El Mex  
6. Alexandria National Refining and Petrochemicals Company (ANRPC) -  
7. Nasr Petroleum Company (NPC)- Capacity 146,000 barrels /day  
8. Amreya Petroleum Refining Company (ARPC) - Its current maximum production capacity is 81,000 barrels 
a day  
9. Suez Oil Processing Company (SOPC) - SOPC has a maximum capacity of 70,000 barrels a day as of 2016 
10. Assuit Oil Refining Company (AORC) - Its current maximum production capacity is five million tons. 
 
The location of these oil refineries are shown in Figure 4 along with the locations of GECO’s farms. As mentioned 
earlier, candidate location of bio refineries is still under investigation; once known, all the distances between the 
suppliers, collection centers, bio-refineries, oil-refineries and gas stations will be calculated by using the aid of Google 
Maps. The recommended tool that is considered for solving the MILP (once the remaining data are available) is 
LINGO as it can handle of problem with such complexity in terms of the number of variables and constraints. 
6. Conclusion and Future Work 
To conclude this work, a mixed integer linear programming mathematical model was constructed to help in the design 
of a potato waste biomass supply chain. To the best of our knowledge this paper is the first to address the design of a 
potato waste to ethanol supply chain. Also in this paper, the standard aggregate planning problem (which determines 
the production levels, inventory levels along the supply chain, hiring and laying off employees, backorders and 
demand satisfaction levels; while, maximizing the profit) is extended to include the environmental and social benefits 
with the purpose of incorporating sustainability.  
 
The future work intended is to apply this model to the case study mentioned in the previous section to determine the 
optimal design of the potato waste supply chain under deterministic assumptions. Then the model will be extended to 
address the uncertainties present in the supply chain, such as, supply, demand, and price of potato waste and ethanol, 
by incorporating different scenarios to the deterministic model, in order to mimic real life and reach the optimum 
sustainable objective. An economic objective that maximizes the total profit earned throughout the network. An 
environmental objective that aims at minimizing the total greenhouse gas emitted from the transportation of wastes, 
bioethanol and fuel blend, and from the production process. And finally two social objectives; one that maximizes the 
total number of jobs created, from the installation of the collection centers and bio-refineries, and their operation, and 
the other aims at minimizing the total amount of potato wastes uncollected from the supply sources in order to help 
improve the public health.

Abstract  
 
With the increasing challenges in energy storage, the importance of lithium-ion batteries reliability cannot 
be understated. The prediction of the battery exact time of failure can provide a cost-efficient maintenance 
plan. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven approach based on deep long-short-term-memory 
neural networks LSTM for battery's remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. The suggested method uses 
the past battery capacity, the time to discharge and the operating temperature to directly predict the RUL. 
To validate the proposed model, we conduct experiments using the NASA lithium-ion battery dataset. 
The results show that our method produces exceptional performances for RUL prediction under different 
loading and operating conditions.

1. Introduction 
 
Lithium-ion batteries are a core component in electric cars, unmanned aerial vehicles, power tools and personal 
devices (Walker, Rayman, and White 2015).  Their increasingly widespread use is credited to their high energy 
density, their long cycle life, the absence of the memory effect, along with their lighter weight compared to other 
rechargeable batteries (Lu et al. 2013). 
Recent studies suggest that lithium-ion batteries are prone to different failure modes from shelf discharge and 
thermal runaway to power and capacity fade (Arachchige, Perinpanayagam, and Jaras 2017). These issues are 
attributed to high operational temperature during usage or storage, overcharging, over-discharging, or an increasing 
number of charges/discharge cycles. Moreover, battery failure could lead to loss of operations, reduced 
performances, and even disasters (Widodo et al. 2011) (D. Zhou et al. 2017). Consequently, the reliability, 
availability, and safety of lithium-ion battery is of prominent importance. 
A current approach to cope with the mentioned challenges is battery's prognostics and health management (PHM). 
Recent works intend to monitor the battery degradation process, assess its condition and predict the remaining useful 
life (RUL).This prediction can lead to an optimal mission or replacement interval planning. 
There are mainly two approaches for lithium-ion battery PHM: physics of failure models and data-driven models. 
Complete knowledge of the non-linear dynamic electrochemical process governing the degradation is necessary for 
the physics of failure approach. This process is intractable, and the model parameters estimation may need 
complicated experiments and costly devices which reduce the use in practice (Liu et al. 2017). 
On the other hand, by using run-to-failure sensors information combined with the corresponding operational and 
environmental conditions, artificial intelligence and statistical methods can capture the inherent relationship and 
trends between sensors values and the degradation state.  This simplicity combined with the rising availability of 
sensors data sparked recent interests from the research community for data-driven lithium-ion batteries RUL 
estimation:(Wu, Fu, and Guan 2016) reviewed the data-driven approaches for vehicle lithium-ion batteries 
prognostics up until 2016,these works use methods ranging from relevance vector machine (RVM)(J. Zhou et al. 
2013) ,and support vector regression (SVR)(Wang et al. 2014), to artificial neural networks(ANN)(Dong et al. 2012). 
Later works propose a gray model GM (1,1) (D. Zhou et al. 2017), a multi-kernel support vector machine (SVM) 
(Gao and Huang 2017), and a long-short-term-memory neural network (LSTM)(Zhang et al. 2017).

3. Conclusion    
 
In this work, we introduce an original deep neural network for lithium-ion battery prognostics based on LSTM  
layers. The proposed architecture demonstrates a clear performance advantage compared to the benchmark. 
Furthermore, the end-to-end nature eases the modelling process as no expert knowledge is involved. 
However, in online applications, the capacity is difficult to measure.Moreover, in risk-sensitive applications 
uncertainty estimation is essential. Future works must extract features from the discharge voltage and the current 
directly without using the capacity and must provide calibrated uncertainty estimations.

Abstract 
 
Although there are several shapes and colors of road hump markings used around the world, there is no 
unified international standard for road hump markings. Road humps are causing a huge number of 
accidents and severe damage to cars in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This paper evaluates road humps in Riyadh 
in terms of detectability of road hump markings. The paper describes two experiments; the first 
experiment involves selecting the most three detectable shapes of road hump markings among six 
different shapes based on preferences of participants. The second experiment involves selecting the best 
combination of colors (White or Yellow) for the selected road hump marking shapes based on response 
time. The result of the second experiment was that the yellow colored road hump showed a faster 
response time compared to the white colored one. Regarding the shapes of road hump markings, the three 
shapes showed a similar response time as well as similar accuracies. These results suggest that color is a 
more important consideration than the type of shape when designing a road hump.

1. Introduction 
 
Traffic accidents are among the most serious problems in the world, resulting in serious injuries, deaths and 
disabilities for millions of people. One of the causes of traffic accidents in Saudi Arabia is road defects. The most 
common road defect is that related to the improper installation of road humps. Speed humps have gained acceptance 
as a traffic calming device by North American and international jurisdictions if they are installed properly [1]. A 
retroreflective road hump marking is used as a warning sign to attract driver attention to the hump. Increasing the 
detectability of road humps results in faster response times, which decreases accident rates and damage to cars.

5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
In conclusion, road hump marking color has a statistically significant effect on the response time, hence it should 
have an effect on the detectability of road humps. The white color has a slower response time than the yellow color, 
so the white color shouldn’t be used for road hump markings. On the other hand, the yellow color is more detectable 
than the white color based on the response time. The road hump marking shape and the interaction between the 
shape and color do not have any statistically significant effect on the response time. Shape 6 (which consists of 
several bars) has the fastest mean response time compared to the other shapes of road hump markings. Moreover, 
the bar shapes are easy to install and maintain which will save a lot of time and cost.  
 
The recommended design (shape and color) of road hump marking is shape 6 with a yellow color. Shape 6 
consists of several bars, where each bar has a width of 30 cm and a length extending to the edge of the road hump. 
The distance between each two bars should be 40 cm. Moreover, we recommend that this paper be the base for more 
investigation regarding the road hump markings especially for the colors of road hump markings. In addition, we 
recommend that the white color should be no longer be used for road hump markings.

Abstract 
The software research has an objective to develop “Open Source Electrocardiogram” for applied with 
microcontroller, studied pulse rate and Electrocardiogram. Then we can used data to studied standard 
heartbeat rate in sanitation or sub-district health promoting hospital by trial with people with heart 
disease. Electrocardiogram monitor uses cardiac operating process when cardiac cells have metathesis 
until electric charge is unequal, then there is electric potential and electric current moves. Electric current 
moves through the atrium chamber of the heart to the ventricle chamber of the heart makes the heart 
pump. Vector of electric current moves from the origin to the end, the right artrium to left ventricle so we 
can find that the electric potential follows the way electric current moves. We received value by 
electrodes that are connected to wires and board circuit connected with filter and potentiometer amplifier 
for increasing accuracy. The value will be sent to a Microcontroller that controls transducing the electric 
signals to electrocardiogram graph and the graph is showed on the monitor. We use Arduino board as 
Microcontroller and program in C language. From the way electric current moves then we can analyst the 
value by 3 points: right chest, left chest and fourth ribs. The right chest is positive electric charges, the left 
chest is negative electric charges, the fourth ribs is ground point to show as a graph that have the way 
electric current moves. Board circuit connected with filter and potentiometer amplifier. Both of them are 
integrated circuit (IC) until OPA2604 and INA2126PA. The OPA2604 can decrease noise from electronic 
devices. Because electrocardiogram has a value nearby 0 then we use INA2326PA as a amplifier to 
amplify electrocardiogram to be more accuracy and moves to resistor and capacitor to take 
electrocardiogram  to be more stable. We decided circuit by calculating electric current’s direction and 
control by different resisters, capacitor, filter and potentiometer amplifier that has to use mathematic 
calculation and to get the needed magnification to Arduino board and to use result testing the circuit. The 
graph’s scale is controlled by us so we can transfer the graph to a number for easy to study. When “Open 
source 
Electrocardiogram” 
completed 
and 
trialed 
with 
patient 
show 
that 
“Open 
source 
Electrocardiogram” can show graph similar standard electrocardiogram graph compared with other 
various scale then the accuracy changed but it could be used with standard electrocardiogram.

ABSTRACT  
 
Biogas has an immense potential of energy, power and heat that can be used in places where 
energy is in high demand. However, the presence of contaminants such as carbon dioxide (CO2) 
and hydrogen sulphide (H2S) constitute hindering factors to its wide utilization. In this study, site 
visit was the first step employed. The purpose of the visit was to ensure that waste collected is 
viable for prospective experiments. After collection, waste was sorted in poultry, cattle, food and 
vegetation categories for preliminary analysis. Proximate and ultimate analysis, as well as X-ray 
fluorescence (XRF) analysis were conducted to identify the elemental composition of each 
substrate used particularly trace elements which are often inhibitory to biogas production 
processes. Raw biogas was purified through chemical absorption using monoethanolamine 
(MEA) at 1 M. MEA was used as organic solvent in three chemical absorption processes during 
each Bio-Methane Potential (BMP) test. Upon biogas upgrading, the generated biomethane was 
measured in the gas measuring device for 15 days. This investigation was conducted in accordance 
with the method described by APHA (2005) by means of the automatic methane potential test 
system II (AMPTS II). The AMPTS II enabled the measurement of accumulated volumes of 
biomethane of a 100 % purity in real-time during anaerobic co-digestion. This study aimed at 
assessing the behavioral patterns of MEA using different substrates under mesophilic conditions 
at the exact temperature of 37°C.

Abstract  
 
The work is focused on the study and analysis of the management of maintenance in the industry in general and in 
particular the transformation of polymeric materials in Cuba, focusing attention on the analysis of the deficiencies that 
occur in maintenance operations and in the inexistence of a procedure to execute it. The objective was to develop a 
procedure for the management of maintenance in the industry of transformation of plastic materials in our country. The 
results include the preparation of the procedure consisting of eight stages that must be progressively developed 
according to the current scenario of the organization, emphasizing the management and sustained optimization over 
time of processes associated with planning, programming, execution and maintenance control, aligned with the 
strategic objectives of the company and taking into account health and safety at work as well as the standards 
established for environmental protection.

1. Introduction 
The decade of the 80's of the last century, marks the beginning of the upswing and development of plastic materials in our country. 
Since its inception, production has been characterized by rapid growth, replacing metal, wood and ceramics, among others, thanks 
to its excellent properties and the low costs involved in its transformation (Pérez Rodríguez, 2005). The plastic industry in Cuba, 
although it does not have a development that places it in a top place in Latin America and the Caribbean, is not exempt of last 
generation machinery, exhibiting results that can be considered acceptable for our environment. 
The increase of the demand in our country of objects, pieces and plastic components, originates the growing need to create 
companies for the transformation of polymeric materials. This is how plastics transformation factories such as Cajimaya, in 
Holguín Province and Cienfuegos, which extrude polyethylene (PE) hosepipes and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipelines that are 
widely used by agriculture and by the Company of Telecommunications (ETECSA by its acronym in Spanish) as well as factories 
for plastic pipelines up to 900 mm in diameter in Holguín, La Habana and Ciego de Ávila. The growing development of these 
processes requires the implementation of actions that contribute to maintenance management as a first-rate task in this industry. 
The present work is focused on the study and analysis of maintenance management in the industry in general and in particular the 
transformation of plastic in Cuba. The present work focuses on the study and analysis of maintenance management in the industry 
in general and, in particular, the transformation of plastic in Cuba. 
The function of maintenance in the companies is one of the impacting elements in their results, due to the direct influence of the 
management of the same on the downtimes for the production area, the timely delivery and with quality to the clients and the costs 
associated to the works and inventories of spare parts (Pérez Rodríguez, 2005). As of February 2013, a chronogram was drawn up 
in our country that included the development of a process to diagnose the technical state of the facilities and maintenance 
management, implemented in 91 selected companies of 8 organizations. The main problems identified, according to the study

4. CONCLUSIONS 
1. The basic functions of maintenance management were identified: plan, organize and control and their operation, as indispensable 
requisites to achieve the optimum in this process. 
2. A procedure for the management of maintenance structured in 8 stages is proposed, which allows to guide the execution of this 
process in the plastics companies in general. 
3. The purpose of the proposed procedure is not only to maintain the machines but also the installations of: lighting, computer 
networks, electric power systems, compressed air, water, air conditioning, internal streets, floors, warehouses, etc. It must also 
coordinate with human resources a plan for the continuous training of personnel 
4. The partial application of the methodology allowed to verify its feasibility for the increase of efficiency in the companies of 
transformation of plastic materials in Cuba, demonstrating its logical consistency, flexibility, transcendence, perspective and 
relevance in the research framework.

INTRODUCTION 
The 21st century also known as a customer friendly environment in which customers have a 
plethora of options to choose purchase any product is characterised by fierce competition. 
This competition demands industries not only to provide more customised products with 
competitive prices but also deliver them on time. Unfortunately, manufacturing customised 
products requests for additional cost and investment from manufacturers. Today's global 
market is characterised by the facts that customer needs and wants are more uncertain, with 
product lifecycle becoming shorter, demand for a service level of delivery and lead time of 
product much improved. To better serve the market and these increasing customer needs, 
companies segment the market much more detailed, competition among companies is 
switched toward customer-based competition. 
The strategy of postponement is a vital element in any agile strategy and a powerful strategy 
to reduce and control demand variability (Christopher, 2000); it enhances the ability of the 
company to compete on time while remaining cost competitive. ""Postponement increases the 
company’s flexibility responding to changes in the mix of demands from different market 
segments. The company can improve its responsiveness to orders or reduce its investment in 
inventory (Lee and Bollington, 1993).” Companies have improved their performances by 
applying postponement strategy. Mass customisation and highly configured products are 
increasingly becoming the new normal in manufacturing. While meeting customer demands 
for highly configured products is essential to remain competitive, the operational demands 
can stretch resources and severely impact profitability. Manufacturers in the automobile 
industry must adapt processes to retain efficiency and quality control, while also producing 
products that meet customer specifications for style, colour, accessories, special features, and 
add-on components. Even the warehouse and logistical challenges of maintaining multiple

such products would be determined after demand information from the pre-launch orders has 
been assessed (Granot and Yin, 2008). 
 CONCLUSION 
This study aimed to review the postponement strategy with the South African automobile 
industry from the literature perspective. This research was conducted through ISI web of 
knowledge and google scholar database. The finding reveals that a postponement strategy is a 
powerful tool that can help to manage   the complexity of the market from the automotive and 
South African industry and yet increase competitiveness.

Abstract  
 
The requisite technology to sustain the prevalent maintenance strategies need to be deployed as a vital 
step towards enhancing competitive efficacy. Technological management as a strategic inclination should 
be applied as a measured and organized process of identifying novel technologies to replace or augment 
the existing technological apparatuses within the business, and more so, the strategic significance of the 
technology management need to be clearly specified. The prominence should be on technological 
management and innovation management within the field of physical assets reliability management. The 
objective of pursuing technology management under the auspices of reliability management is to 
capitalize on the heightened performance levels of the contemporary technological offerings to progress 
on the efficacy and swiftness of reliability enhancement activities. This study was undertaken to explore 
the facets of technology management that can be capitalized by maintenance practitioners on up surging 
the reliability of physical assets.

Introduction 
 
Various industrial concerns are faced with unrestrained, international markets which compel organizations to be in 
possession of attributes for swift reaction and minimal costs structures (Garrido-Vega, et al., 2015:201). Considering 
the crucial role that technology possesses in organizational competitiveness, appropriate technological management 
in conjunction with good operational strategies, is important to curtail the prevailing challenges (Garrido-Vega, et 
al., 2015:201).It is now commonplace, that numerous organizations nowadays are technologically-dependent and 
they fail to effectively deliver dependable and top notch services if their technology bound operations are not 
functional, which may even culminate in total shutdown (Madu, 2000:938).  
When an organization is faced with the daunting task of selecting and up-taking some technological management 
tools, challenges always spring up with regards to the right tools and the organizational readiness, and this is even 
compounded by the unavailability of sound toolkits that provide a fitting jigsaw that suits their situation (Kerr, et al., 
2013:1050). The thrust is on developing industrially relevant strategic technology management toolkits (Kerr, et al., 
2013:1050).

2. A total of 76.8% of respondents considered the use of technology management to increase assets reliability 
as poor, while 17.8% were undecided, and only 5.4% of the respondents considered the use of technology 
management to increase assets reliability by their organizations as good. 63.1% of the respondents 
considered the use of technology management to increase assets reliability as influential to their 
maintenance performance and only 14.3% of the participants considered the use of technology management 
to increase assets reliability as not influential to their maintenance performance. This signifies that the use 
of technology management to increase assets reliability is regarded as essential for physical assets 
reliability improvement for manufacturing firms. 
3. A total of 73.9% of respondents considered the application of Technology Management to support the 
Maintenance Strategy as poor, while 16.7% were undecided, and only 9.5% of the respondents considered 
the application of Technology Management to support the Maintenance Strategy by their organizations as 
good. 62.5% of the respondents considered the application of Technology Management to support the 
Maintenance Strategy as influential to their maintenance performance and only 20.8% of the participants 
considered the application of Technology Management to support the Maintenance Strategy as not 
influential to their maintenance performance. Despite the poor application of Technology Management to 
support the Maintenance Strategy, it is regarded as a crucial aspect for maintenance performance increase 
and physical assets reliability improvement for manufacturing firms. 
4. A total of 76.7% of respondents considered the Correlation between Technology Management and 
Business Strategy as poor, while 11.3% were undecided, and only 11.9% of the respondents considered the 
Correlation between Technology Management and Business Strategy by their organizations as good. 66.1% 
of the respondents considered the Correlation between Technology Management and Business Strategy as 
influential to their maintenance performance and only 13.7% of the participants considered the Correlation 
between Technology Management and Business Strategy as not influential to their maintenance 
performance. Although there was generally poor Correlation between Technology Management and 
Business Strategy, it is regarded as significant for maintenance performance increase and physical assets 
reliability improvement for manufacturing firms. 
5. A total of 59.5% of respondents considered the Capability of the organization to change according to 
contemporary technology as poor, while 25% were undecided, and only 15.5% of the respondents 
considered the Capability of the organization to change according to contemporary technology by their 
organizations as good. 74.4% of the respondents considered the Capability of the organization to change 
according to contemporary technology as influential to their maintenance performance and only 11.3% of 
the participants considered the Capability of the organization to change according to contemporary 
technology as not influential to their maintenance performance. This signifies that the Capability of the 
organization to change according to contemporary technology is regarded as vital for physical assets 
reliability improvement for manufacturing firms and the general maintenance performance heightening. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Technology Management has a pivotal role in gratifying the promise of physical assets reliability in a socially 
responsible and sustainable manner. The survey that was carried out confirmed the significance of technology 
management as a maintenance improvement and physical asset reliability improvement factor. Despite technology 
management’s low application by manufacturing firms in South Africa, it is highly influential in the maintenance 
and physical assets reliability improvement endeavours of organizations, and its strategic management is imperative.   
The application of technology management translates into competitiveness of the business in its markets, but only if 
technology management is appropriately strategically handled.  
 
In some instances, legislative regulations impose technological requirements upon businesses especially with 
regards to the preservation of ecological systems, and in such instances technology management is enforced upon 
the businesses. Technology management requires the framework of engineering management to be imposed upon it, 
as it forms part of the engineering management discipline.

Abstract  
 
 
Nowadays, companies are more and more confronted with changes that are external 
(competition, competitiveness, technological innovation, market fluctuations, legal changes, etc.) or 
internal (change of concept, implementation of new systems, change of direction, moving, etc.). These 
changes can destabilize and disrupt employees, which generates behavioral transformations such as 
blockage, fear, reluctance. The latter can generate resistance, or outright a rejection of change, hence the 
need to inform employees on the how and why of change? And support them in order to reduce these 
behaviors and encourage employee buy-in. 
 
In this article, we will try to identify the sources of resistance to change, to define the key steps 
to manage the resistance that employees may have to change management projects. And finally, we will 
explain how to drive organizational change within a small and medium-sized enterprise to achieve 
operational excellence.

Abstract 
 
We propose a new method for group decision making by using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers to describe 
decisions. Optimality is achieved by minimizing the sum of weighed incoherencies between individual 
opinions and the consensus. When the experts’ opinions are not equally important, the method is adapted 
to the heterogeneous situation. In order to promote coherence or hierarchical weights, a parametrization is 
proposed. 
 
Keywords 
Fuzzy number, fuzzy consensus, decision making.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
In a group decision making context, the main challenge is to attribute the correct weighting for each decision in 
order to achieve the group consensus. To overcome the subjectivity of the human reasoning, we use trapezoidal 
fuzzy numbers to model the experts’ opinions. Several methods have been proposed [1-3] to obtain consensus from 
fuzzy opinions. Hsu [1] presented the similarity aggregation method (SAM) in which fuzzy opinions are aggregated 
depending on their similarities. Since SAM needs an intersection between the supports of each pair of fuzzy 
numbers representing the fuzzy opinions, Lu et al. [2] presented the coherence aggregation method (CAM). They 
specified that in addition to similarity, the opinions should be aggregated in function of both dissimilarity and 
similarity. The combination of the two is called coherence. 
Lee presented the optimal aggregated method (OAM) [3] in which he aimed to achieve consensus by minimizing the 
dissimilarity between the fuzzy opinions and the aggregated consensus. We note that both the distances used by 
CAM and OAM are depending on the aggregated decisions. In other words, in a situation with 3 Decision Makers 
(DMs) the distance between good and fair is not the same if the third opinion is very good or bad, because of the 
normalizing term employed in each method. The distance presented in our work, unlike the distances proposed in 
OAM or CAM, does not need to recalculate the distances between each couple of DMs opinions when adding, 
deleting or modifying one opinion. 
Herrera et al. [4] classified group decision making problems into a homogenous group and a heterogeneous group. 
For the first group, the opinions are treated equally while for the second group the importance of each DM is taken 
into consideration. In this work, we replace the similarity given in [3] by the one used in [5], to achieve consensus 
by minimizing the incoherence between each decision and the aggregated consensus. In a second approach, we treat 
how to include hierarchical weights into the process of decision making, and finally we introduce two parameters to 
promote one aspect over the other, that are hierarchical weights and coherence. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 defines the mathematical background needed and the 
similarity/coherence used. Section 3 introduces the proposed method for homogeneous group case while Section 4 
considers the method to heterogeneous group and it treats the proposed parameterization. Finally, a conclusion is 
presented at Section 5.

The previous table shows the impact of the parameters on the aggregation result. The parameter  emphasizes the 
effect of coherence when taken greater than 1, while  reduces the effect of hierarchical importance when taken 
smaller than 1. However the last line of Tab. 4 shows that there is an optimum to not out pass.    
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In this work, we presented an approach to decision making by introducing new distance, consistency/similarity. The 
general idea is that the more a DM opinion is consistent, the larger its weight will be, taking into account the 
hierarchical weights. The homogenous situation compared to OAM, permits distinguishing consistent opinions with 
inconsistent ones, but needs more iterations. In the heterogeneous situation, we introduced two parameters in order 
to promote the desired aspect: coherence or DMs importance.

Abstract  
 
The way an organization is resourced for delivering projected maintenance performance is driven by 
various factors which vary from organization to organization. But strategic drivers are key to determining 
the maintenance organizational selections that an organization will pursue in order to fulfill its mandate of 
maintaining equipment reliably. The crux of engrossing on a specific maintenance organizational 
structure has a lot to do with managing the logistical aspects of maintenance. Having a functional 
structure is one thing, and having a structure that optimizes maintenance logistics according to defined 
parameters is something that is worthy researching on. Combinations of organizational forms are also 
acceptable as long as the basic objectives are met within the business context, and ensuring high 
efficiency and effectiveness of the maintenance function as a whole. The maintenance structure has to be 
determined and reviewed periodically for relevance as the technological advances can render some 
structural orientations irrelevant. The major thrust of forming maintenance crews around physical assets 
reliability will drive the decisions of the form and sizes that organizations adopt in order to meet their 
functional mandate.

Introduction 
 
The key focus of establishing maintenance teams for heightening physical assets reliability will climax in the 
resolution of whether to elect for an operator-based or non-operator based, centralized or non centralized 
maintenance teams (Wiegand, et al., 2007:109). In some industries, the maintenance logistics expenditure institutes 
a significant component of the operations and maintenance expenditures (Shafiee, 2015:183).  Maintenance logistics 
need to be addressed through a three stratum approach, which embraces the strategic, tactical and operational tiers 
(Shafiee, 2015:183). The tactical stratum of maintenance logistics engrosses inventory management of spares, 
maintenance support organizational structure, and the resolutions concerning procurement, outsourcing or leasing of 
maintenance resources (Shafiee, 2015:186). Maintenance logistics’ prominence emanate from the usually massive 
investments allied with capital-intensive assets, which call for a high operational availability, and whereby any 
unforeseen failure maybe highly catastrophic (Rahimi-Ghahroodi et al., 2017:712).

 A list of approved contractors was kept by the maintenance planning officer according to their critical skills to the 
organization. These contractors formed part of the approved vendors list for the organization and they could be 
contacted through speed dials on a breakdown basis or a planned basis. The list of approved contractors was also 
available to the maintenance manager, maintenance foreman and the procurement officer.  
 
Discussion of findings 
 
The manufacturing firm was geared to react to breakdowns swiftly as it had skilled manpower available to deal with 
breakdowns promptly in the form of shift millwrights. The maintenance function’s organizational structure was 
formulated around the need to respond to equipment failures swiftly, and to strategically manage maintenance spares 
to prevent catastrophic failures in the process plant.  Critical spares were managed through the critical spares list that 
was derived through a structured criticality ranking methodology meant to minimize the overall risk on the business. 
The critical contractor resources were carefully chosen and listed for urgent access and availability in case of 
emergency situations that required their assistance. Maintenance logistics determine the structural arrangements of 
the maintenance function, and if the maintenance team structure is not aligned to the maintenance logistics of the 
organization, then inefficiencies and lack of cost-effectiveness in the maintenance system is introduced. Thus the 
assessment and consideration of maintenance logistics optimization is imperative for organizations, and this is the 
role of the strategic formulation of the maintenance resources organization for many businesses. The strategic 
requirements of organizing maintenance resources need to be done in full consideration of maintenance logistics 
aspects. 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
Various traits of the maintenance logistics have been researched on, with modelling techniques being applied to 
understand the rationale for inventory levels, logistics, labor force sizing, and labor force skill-sets (Iwata and 
Mavris, 2013:188). Maintenance logistics targets to optimize the maintenance system by rationalization of the 
human, material, financial and informational resources linked with the actions of maintenance and monitoring the 
operations of the physical assets by applying specified implements and exploration of data provided by them (Nour , 
2017:130). 
 
Flexibility is recommended with regards to maintenance logistical organizational choice centered on assessed cost-
effectiveness and the maintenance system strategic intents. Other relatable structural situations like legislative 
controls, skills matrix, training availability, skilled manpower, machine spares suppliers proximity, contractor skills 
and availability, need to be assessed before the final strategic maintenance logistics organization is derived. 
Amalgamation of organizational types is tenable, and this holds as long as the strategic intents are satisfied, and high 
physical assets reliability and availability are maintained. A strategic approach need to be arrayed to assess 
organizational efficacy and relevance to the maintenance logistics factors in full consideration of all input attributes 
like manpower, skill-sets, machine spares and maintenance information control. The maintenance logistical structure 
need to be reviewed continuously and in light of changing operational dynamics.

Abstract  
 
 
Lean six sigma is a powerful business initiative that improves the effectiveness and performance 
of organizations. It started as a useful improvement strategy in manufacturing and then was 
transferred to other sectors. Although popular in many industries, its implementation in higher 
education is still limited and to date has not yet achieved its potential as a tool that enhances the 
effectiveness and efficiency of institutions which operate in highly competitive environments 
with pressure respond to their stakeholders’ expectations and to attract more students and funds. 
 
Academic institutions seem to resist the implementation of lean six sigma despite its widespread 
success in achieving processes improvement and minimizing variations and defects. Therefore, it 
would be important to shed light on the challenges hindering its implementation. Some of these 
obstacles might originate from the nature of higher education and others from the approach’s 
concept or misunderstanding perceptions. 
 
This research aims to identify the main obstacles of six sigma in higher education with hope to 
create more awareness regarding these challenges for those seeking to implement six sigma in 
higher education. It is hoped that this research will support future research that aim to enable a 
better fit of lean six sigma with higher education.

Abstract 
Iran’s energy supply system is highly dependent on fossil fuels due to excessive cheap fuel 
consumption used in transportation and power generation, as well as the lack of fuel economy 
standards for the appropriate amount of consumption. In addition, import of fuel derivatives such 
as gasoline makes fossil fuel usage a path-dependent process. Such increasing energy demand 
which has led to high energy intensity, is a serious threat to Iran’s energy security. 
Understanding the systematic structure of this dependency is the main interest of this study. 
System dynamics approach is applied to model energy dependency and test four different 
scenarios. Comparison of the results infers that there will be increasing energy dependence on 
fossil fuels. In an increasing fossil fuel supply scenario, the energy dependency index decreases 
and on the other hand, the energy security weakens due to the excessive consumption of fossil 
fuels resources. Nevertheless, if the energy supply increases via consumption of renewable 
energy resources, as in the second scenario, the energy dependency index decreases while there 
are no significant changes in the energy security index. In the last scenario, the demand-side 
management and energy demand reduction gained attraction in order to reduce the energy 
dependency index. However, this policy should be accompanied by increasing the renewable 
energy capacities to be able to reduce the energy efficiency and increase the energy security.

Given that the energy dependency index is considered as the ratio of energy demand to energy 
supply, the least amount of energy dependency is provided in the case of energy supply from 
fossil fuels. Increasing the use of fossil fuels can cover the gap between supply and demand over 
the research time period, but with long-term resource availability, this policy cannot be 
considered as a sustainable solution for high security energy supply. In other scenarios, the third 
scenario shows that increased energy supply from renewable energy sources can reduce the 
energy dependency in the long term in comparison with other policies. 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
From the comparison of the four scenarios tested on the model, it could be said that by 
continuing the current state, dependence on energy would increase. By implementing the second 
scenario and increasing the supply of energy through fossil fuels, the energy dependency index 
decreases due to increased supply, but considering the more intense fossil fuel reduction, the 
country's energy security will be weakened.  
In the third scenario, by increasing supply via renewable energies, the rate of energy dependency 
index decreases and the energy security index does not change. Finally, in the last scenario, with 
demand-side management and energy demand reduction, the energy dependency index would 
decrease, and this rate is higher than renewable energy capacity development, and in terms of 
energy dependency index, it is a more efficient policy, but given that the majority of energy 
supply in this scenario is also achieved through fossil fuels and their resources are coming to an 
end, this policy does not have a long-term sustainability and it is recommended that the demand-
side management policy and the development of renewable energy capacities be implemented 
simultaneously in order to decrease energy dependency and increase energy security.

Abstract 
Proactive maintenance is one highly effective but overshadowed generic maintenance strategy, which 
when effectively implemented, is significant in improving equipment reliability. Proactive maintenance 
aims to eliminate, reduce, automate or simplify maintenance without compromising reliability or safety. 
Proactive maintenance concerns empowering individuals to solve problems and in its simplest form, it 
encompasses three core concepts: Maintenance elimination, Maintenance prevention and Maintenance 
improvement. Proactive maintenance involves moving beyond standard task lists and reactive repairs to 
an analysis about why a component failed in the first place. It may mean finding a process, product, or 
procedure that extends the life of a component and requires less frequent inspections. It can be as simple 
as standardizing screws, improving access to hard-to-reach inspection points, or showing internal 
customers how to fill out a work order correctly. This study was carried out to unveil the aspects of 
proactive maintenance that makes it superior to other generic maintenance strategies which have been 
popularized over the years at its expense. 
Keywords 
Proactive maintenance, reliability, strategic application, root cause. 
Introduction 
Operational conditions like cold or corrosive atmospheres and any other adversative conditions render physical 
assets to deleterious exposure and their accelerated degradation, thus adversely affecting their reliability and 
availability for operational requirements (Jungwirth et al., 2016:1). Without the provision of a proactive 
maintenance antidote, frequent equipment failures in such deleterious conditions are a common experience, and this 
ultimately impacts on the overall business performance, but these proactive maintenance solutions should consider 
the equipment design, materials of construction and maintenance actions (Jungwirth et al., 2016:1). 
Proactive Maintenance encompasses diverse approaches and technologies for utmost reduction of reactive 
maintenance in reality, and it is an innovation in relative to predictive maintenance (Papic et al., 2009:537). The 
dominant trait of proactive maintenance is the contrivances of failure origins exploration, and to sum it up, proactive 
maintenance is represented as:

Figure 12: Comparative cost structures under various maintenance models (Papic et al., 2009:534). 
 
Overall cost leadership and high reliability are obtainable under the auspices of a proactive maintenance strategic 
application, but its successful application need to be done in a structured way, otherwise the bad implementation will 
scupper the immense benefits inherent in this noble maintenance strategic intent. An optimized maintenance system 
will however comprise of a mix of maintenance strategies that contain applicable corrective, preventive, predictive 
and proactive maintenance activities, therefore an integrative approach will in reality produce the optimum results, 
as the benefits of each strategic concept is capitalized on (Papic et al., 2009:534). 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
The literature research is explicit about the benefits derived from the application of the proactive maintenance 
strategy and its superiority with regards to equipment failure elimination, asset reliability improvement and 
lessening overall maintenance costs. However, like any other strategy, any lack of a structured approach to 
implementing proactive maintenance will result in no reliability performance improvement realized, and a failure to 
reap any benefits allied to proactive maintenance. 
The benefits derived from the application of proactive maintenance strategy include the following: 
 
Optimization of the overall performance of the plant manufacturing assets 
 
Increased useful life of physical assets  
 
Freeing up the maintenance function to concentrate on value adding activities rather than on reactive 
maintenance 
 
Reduction of the maintenance cost structure 
 
Improved Equipment performance, resources utilization, environmental & safety performance. 
 
Sustainable maintenance policy deployment 
Further research efforts need to be focused on approaches for effectively implementing proactive maintenance 
strategy in various business set-ups.

Abstract 
Big data” has recently become the focus of academic and corporate research. The literature identifies ‘big 
data’ as the ‘next big thing in innovation. Drawing on a systematic review and a case study findings, this 
paper presents an interpretive framework that analyses the definitional perspectives and the applications 
of big data. We used the Hace theorem to understand the concept and a specific classification framework 
to have a better understanding of its role in capturing business value. This was further confirmed through 
a case study in the debt collection field where big data was used to find insolvent debtors.

Introduction 
Every day 3 billion kilobytes of data are produced. Today 90 percent of the data in the web where created 
within the last two years. (Tamhane, sayyade, 2015), Big data has the potential to revolutionize the art of 
management (wamba, 2013), Due to its high operational and strategic potential, notably in generating 
business value, “big data” has recently become the focus of academic and corporate investigation. The 
extant literature identifies ‘big data’ as the ‘next big thing in innovation’ (Gobble, 2013);  “the fourth 
paradigm of science” (p. 34) Strawn (2012); ‘’the next frontier for innovation, competition, and 
productivity’’(p. 1) (Manyika et al., 2011); the next “management revolution” (p. 3)(McAfee & 
Brynjolfsson, 2012); and a revolution in science and technology"" (p. 4) (Ann Keller, Koonin, & Shipp, 
2012), etc. In addition, ‘big data’ has the capability of transforming the decision making process by 
allowing enhanced visibility of firm operations and improved performance measurement mechanisms 
(McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012). The aim of this work is to presents an interpretive framework that 
analyses the definitional perspectives and the applications of big data then to introduce a case study of N 
Square Group where Big Data where used to find debt collector in Morocco.

Abstract  
 
Agri-food supply chain (ASC) topic has attracted a lot of academics and practitioners in the last decade due 
to the globally increasing concern of public health and food safety and quality. Fresh produce has special 
characteristics, which includes perishability, uncertainty of supply and demand, and carbon dioxide 
equivalent emissions produced throughout the supply chain due to cooling, transportation, and disposal of 
fresh produce. These factors impose an additional complexity while managing this type of supply chains. 
This work concentrates on developing a simulation model of a two-echelon real life supply chain. The 
objective is to study the effect of changing order quantity under uncertain demand and lead time on a set of 
economic, social and environmental performance measures. Although, in a business environment economic 
dimension continues to be a top priority, simulation results showed that there is no contradiction between 
all three dimensions of sustainability. It minimized food wastage, offering higher quality fresh produce, 
lower emissions; while maintaining highest profit and an acceptable service level.

1. Introduction 
Globalization, rapid demographic changes and increased concern of public health dictates the increasing demand for 
high quality agri-food products. According to (FAOSTAT 2017), the production of agri-food has increased globally 
by more than 20% between 2003 and 2014. Thus, resulting in a striking increase in trading activity during the same 
period, almost doubling the import transactions between countries. Agricultural produce plays an important role in the 
world economy and is the raw material for many industries. Among the agricultural produce, agri-food have got the 
minimum attention in the last decades (Shukla & Jharkharia 2013). The supply chain management of agri-food 
constitutes the processes from production to delivery of the fresh produce, i.e. from farmer to table. ASC is complex 
compared to ordinary supply chains due to the perishable nature of the produce, high uncertainty in demand and price, 
dependence on climate conditions, seasonality in production, meeting the international regulations related to food 
safety and environment, and maintaining the quality needs dictated by the customer. 
A sustainable supply chain can be understood as a supply chain focusing on maintaining environmental, economic, 
and social stability for long-term sustainable growth; where, the environmental pillar in an ASC can be reflected in 
the amount of CO2eq emissions produced due to the usage of fertilizers, the energy use in production, transportation, 
and inventory, add to that the food wastes generated throughout the supply chain due to perishable characteristics 
(Galal & El-Kilany 2016). However, maintaining high levels of profit while efficiently using the resources achieve 
the economic pillar of sustainability. Social pillar of sustainability is shown in how ASC affects the consumers and 
the workers that work within the process. Therefore, planning decisions have to be made while considering the three 
pillars of sustainability (Prima Dania et al. 2016). 
Inventory management is a critical driver in managing ASC operations. Holding inventory levels lower than required 
will lead to economic losses due to unsatisfied demand. On the contrary, holding excessive inventory levels will 
increase the holding costs, leading to additional costs due to food losses.  
Models for planning ASC needs development, as it mainly ignores the stochastic nature of the supply, demand and 
lead-time and assume that they are deterministic values (Ahumada & Villalobos 2009). Therefore, simulation is 
considered a vital tool due to its ability to imitate the real life system while considering stochastic nature of the 
variables. It further allows for a detailed analysis of system performance, thus giving insights to managerial decisions.

7. Conclusions  
This work studied the management of inventory in a sustainable agri-food supply chain with stochastic demand and 
lead time. It also introduced a real-life case based on data from Company X, which was used to drive a discrete event 
simulation model and to study the effect of changing the order size on the selected performance measures addressing 
economic, environmental and social pillars of sustainability. Simulation was used as mathematical models sometimes 
fail to handle the complexity of real-life situations and due to stochastic nature of the data mentioned. Also due to its 
ability to replicate and analyse the performance of the real system, as well as suggesting alternatives to improve the 
overall system efficiency. The suggested inventory model represents a pull system, in which supply depends on 
demand; it is different from the currently push supply chain model adopted by Company X. The model also considers 
some of the important features of ASC: product limited life time, product quality, in addition to the stochastic nature 
of the demand and lead time. Three sources of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions were considered; transportation, 
cooling, and disposal emissions.  
The model has been run for different order quantities and the selected performance measures have been investigated. 
Based on the results analysis, it was concluded that using a (𝛾) value of 51% could help in improving overall 
sustainability of the system when compared with current management practices. Thus, setting adequate order quantity 
has a considerable effect on the various supply chain performance measures. It was proved that varying order 
quantities by, as small as, 15% could double food wastage. Furthermore, it may also be concluded that there is no 
contradiction among the different pillars of sustainability as the present study succeeded in generating a solution which 
satisfies economic, environmental and social aspects. 
Areas to be considered for future research include the study of effect of different transportation modes, whether water, 
truck, air or multimodal on the sustainability of the supply chain. Furthermore, the effect of different water 
transportation types whether container shipment or reefer shipment on performance may be investigated.

Abstract 
The purpose of this STEM project is to determine which Starbucks drinks among all coffee and 
tea options are best for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. In order to do this, a health 
index was constructed considering different variables, including: saturated fat, cholesterol, 
sodium, carbohydrates, dietary fiber, sugars, protein, and caffeine. Each variable was assigned a 
weighting coefficient, with lower coefficients assigned to the factors that are more harmful and 
higher ones to those that are more beneficial. Therefore, drinks with the highest health index are 
determined to be the most beneficial to preventing CVD. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) 
was used to explore all factors in the analysis and to inform on the utility of the health index in 
relation to its link to CVD prevention.  PCA was successfully able to decompose the dominant 
sources of variability in relation to the Health Index, where  66.4% and 12.6% of variation were 
attributable to Principal Components 1 (Prin 1) and 2 (Prin 2), respectively.  Therefore, 79% of 
the total variation was explained on the basis of the first two Principal Components. Prin 1 did a 
good job grouping the data, separating Frappuccino Blended and Espresso beverages in one 
cluster, and mainly Cold Brew, Freshly Brewed, and Tea in another. Prin 2 largely grouped data 
based on cholesterol and fat content, and held less explanatory power than Principal Component 
1. The health index originally derived on the basis of the scientific research, largely corroborated 
the results of PCA 1 vs. Drink/ Drink Category.  Hierarchical Clustering was used to form 3 
clusters across drink categories, and results were taken together with the Health Index/ PCA to 
investigate which combined set of factors contributed most to CVD prevention. This project 
sheds light on smarter ordering at Starbucks, making people more aware of how diet ultimately 
affects health and more specifically, how smart drink choices can promote CVD prevention.

1. Introduction and Literature Research 
Studies show that a moderate intake of coffee, from 3-5 cups per day, shows an inverse relationship with 
cardiovascular disease. Regular consumption of tea has also been associated with a diminished risk of CVD. 
Conditions that lead to heart disease include high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and other chronic health 
problems including diabetes. A heart-healthy diet is typically low in cholesterol, trans fats, sodium, and saturated fat. 
Coffee and tea are rich in polyphenols with antioxidative properties in the form of flavonoids. Drinking coffee has 
also been proven to reduce the chance of type 2 diabetes, which often accompanies CVD. Antioxidant activity of 
flavonoids reduce free radical formation and scavenge free radicals, which are highly reactive with important 
cellular components and cause cells to function poorly or die. Excess free radicals are thought to initiate 
atherosclerosis by damaging blood vessel walls, thus contributing to CVD progression.  LDL cholesterol has also

The results demonstrate that, on average, drinks in Cluster #3 are grouped into the highest health index ratings, those 
in Cluster # 1 are grouped into moderate to lower health index ratings, and those grouped into Cluster #2 have the 
lowest ratings.  What we observe makes sense practically, since Drinks in Cluster #1 have generally lower sugar, fat, 
and cholesterol levels, and moderate/high caffeine levels. We know based on scientific research that caffeine present 
in prepared coffee beverages is associated heart disease prevention4, and we also know that diets high in cholesterol, 
fat, and sugar are associated with higher risk of heart disease7, therefore the results of scientific research corroborate 
the computational results yielded by the clustering approach – where drinks in drink categories within Cluster #3 are 
the most likely to facilitate heart disease prevention, where those in Cluster #1 are less likely, and those in Cluster 
#2 are less likely still or may even be detrimental to heart health.  
 
5. Conclusion 
Overall, the results of all three analyses corroborate one other and point to the following drink categories at 
Starbucks as the best choices for heart disease prevention: Cold & Ice Brewed Coffees, Freshly Brewed Coffees, and 
Starbucks Refreshers and Teas. Espressos are also a good choice only if they are lower in sugar, cholesterol, etc.  
 
Next steps for research include a more granular assessment by specific drinks within each category, and a more 
precisely weighted (in terms of relative magnitude and mathematical structure of the coefficients) health index 
model. Also, we can plan to include additional factors in the analysis which science has suggested are correlated 
with heart disease prevention, such as antioxidants, flavonoids, and other substances present in coffee beverages.

1. Introduction 
 
Seemingly, airport baggage loss is a universal problem that costs airline companies billions of dollars annually, even 
though the air transport industry (ATI) has cut the rate of mishandled bags by 61.3% globally since 2007, creating 
US $18 billion in total estimated cost savings. This improvement is largely a result of strong technology investment 
and innovation in baggage systems automation and processes. Despite the obtained results, air companies are still 
implementing new technologies, and researches carry on the purpose of minimizing that baggage loss percentage, 
aiming for the passenger’s satisfaction. One of the highly considered technologies for tracking airport luggage is 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). Its importance and efficiency are expressed by the vast amount of medical, 
military and commercial applications using this approach Worldwide. Billions of the RFID systems are operated in 
transportation (automotive vehicle identification, automatic toll system, electronic license plate, electronic manifest, 
vehicle routing, vehicle performance monitoring), banking (electronic checkbook, electronic credit card), security 
(personnel identification, automatic gates, surveillance) and medical (identification, patient history). Radio 
frequency identification technology, originally designed for product tracking, now promises to help people live and 
work in a cleaner and healthier environment. An array of test projects and field deployments are beginning to show 
that RFID can benefit business operations—by creating efficiencies, improving quality control and strengthening 
security—while simultaneously helping the environment—by cutting materials waste, reducing vehicle exhaust and 
boosting recycling. Other projects are even using the technology in a green way, such as harnessing solar power to 
operate RFID systems.  
 
2. RFID Technology 
 
2.1 components  
 
RFID systems are basically composed of three elements: a tag, a reader and a middleware deployed at a host 
computer. The RFID tag is a data carrier part of the RFID system, which is placed on the objects to be uniquely 
identified. The RFID reader is a device that transmits and receives data through radio waves using the connected

6.2 RFID application Impact on environment 
 
RFID has shown its efficiency when applied to airports luggage tracking systems. However, we also see an 
environmental dimension to this effort. Predicting that in helping to tracking passenger’s luggage more accurately, 
RFID will improve sustainability by reducing unnecessary luggage truck deliveries, as well as passenger’s trips to 
the airport for lost items, and therefore reducing air pollution in the area. Moreover, indirect impacts of RFID 
application can be more significant if analyzed properly. Lost luggage or baggage arrival delay, means more waiting 
time for passengers, therefore a delay for all their planned activities ( postponed meetings, multiple transportations, 
canceled duties… ), and its impact on time, place and energy consummation, touching not only the concerned 
person, but all the little network around him. On a bigger scale network, these situations deteriorative impacts on the 
environment can be more remarkable. 
 
7. Conclusion  
 
Our proposed middleware UIR architecture offered a solution to many issues discussed in earlier Sections, starting 
by resolving the multiple hardware support issue on the reader abstraction layer that provides a common interface 
for accessing RFID hardware devices, with different characteristics. It also optimized synchronization and 
scheduling in the middleware on the EDML, which manages data flow between the other layers, handling various 
reader-level operations, servicing multiple applications and offering a device neutral interface to the applications.  
In addition to that, the Application Abstraction Layer (AAL) provides various applications with an independent 
interface to RFID hardware, resolving scalability problems on the Hardware Abstraction Layer that allows access to 
devices and tags in an independent manner of their various characteristics, through layers of tag and reader 
abstraction. While regulating access by using RBAC Mechanism to make sure only authorized users (applications) 
access the needed data, depending on the permissions allowed and the role assigned. 
The environmental impact was cited in a brief qualitative manner, but further work will be invested in a way to get 
concrete quantitative results and data.

Abstract 
 
Supply chain integration plays a major role in the success of any organisation. As a result in last over a decade it has 
drawn a significant interest from the research community and practitioners alike. Though researchers have aimed to 
address various aspects of supply chain integration, research addressing its linkage with overall performance of 
organisation is limited. The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship between supply chain 
integration and supply chain performance as well as the relationship between logistics systems and supply chain 
performance. A survey was developed and sent to 40 manufacturing companies operating in Jordan. The results 
show that supply chain integration has a positive impact on the performance of the supply chain as a whole. 
Moreover, when a high degree of supply chain integration takes place, it reduces inbound, outbound, warehousing 
and inventory holding costs. The study also investigates the impact of implementing logistics systems to act as an 
intermediate between supply chain partners. The result of the investigation shows a positive correlation between 
logistics management and supply chain performance. The study provides valuable contribution to theory and 
practice by adding to our limited understanding of supply chain integration in developing country context.

1. Introduction 
 
Over the past decade, there has been large emphasis on implementing supply chain practices to act as a vehicle in 
gaining organisation and supply chain competitive advantage (Ngo et al. 2016). A large number of examples show 
how companies invested in SCM in the late 1990s to differentiate their companies by reorganizing and integrating 
their supply chain activities in order to increase customer satisfaction and internal productivity (Christopher, 1998). 
As a result of this integration, it is not individual organisations that are competing against each other but the rival 
supply chains. The goal for this integration is to offer customer’s the greatest satisfaction by adding the most value 
to their product or service with minimal cost (Christopher, 2000).

Sensitivity: Internal 
resulting in an increased competitive advantage. Moreover, the use of information systems can also increase 
competitive advantage by improving inventory management and decreasing the practice of forward buying. 
Information system’s use has been eased lately after the emergence of e-mails and XML format applications. 
 
Partnerships and alliances have proved to attain competitive advantage for the whole supply chain, as partners are 
meeting to share information, technology and planning efforts thus increasing control and reducing uncertainty. 
Moreover, partnerships can enable solving mutual problems thus improving their organisations and sharing success. 
Not only inventory management can maximise profits, but it also enables the customisation of products and allows 
the fast movement of goods thus reducing cycle times. Customer integration can lead to lowering labour costs thus 
increasing profits. Moreover, when customers integrate in the processes, it becomes easier for organisations to have 
adequate information on the demands of customers by implementing feedback schemes. Forming partnerships and 
alliances with customers can enables the sharing of information, technology and planning efforts thus decreasing 
uncertainty and increasing control. 
 
The management of logistics between supply chain partners can play an important role in the integration, as 
transport and warehousing acts as the intermediate between supply chain partners. The use of logistics systems for 
the coordination of the supply chain enables major cost reductions thus increases competitive advantage; this 
coordination can happen by focusing on making transparent data communication between partners and applying set 
of rules to which each member of the supply chain subscribes. 
. 
The study provides valuable contribution towards the understanding of supply chain integration and performance 
relationship in a developing country context. The findings of the study are valuable for organisations and supply 
chain practitioners operating in developing countries seeking to improve the performance of their organisation. As is 
the case with most studies this research also has some limitation. The findings are based on a very limited set of 
survey responses, the generalisability could be improved with a larger sample size. The sample selection may also 
have some faults, as not all participants may have understood the actual meaning of phrases used in the research as 
they are used more by academics rather than practitioners. The findings are based on quantitative analysis hence it 
doesn’t provide participants the opportunity to discuss their opinion in the matter. A large amount of data can be lost 
in that manner, as participants attain the knowledge needed through experience and cannot share due to the way data 
was collected. Hence future research studies should aim to adopt a combination of qualitative and quantitative 
methods, i.e., mixed methods. Supply chain integration is an area that has emerged in the last decade however 
studies so far fail to address all of its attributes. Therefore, further studies on the impact of supply chain integration 
on other attributes like quality of products, costs of products, innovation, competitive advantage and organizational 
performance can be investigated. Furthermore, future research can be done on individual supply chains before and 
after attaining integration practices. This will open a door to realising more benefits, obstacles or disadvantages.

Abstract 
 
Motivation, Opportunity, and Ability (MOA) are three factors that influence employees’ performance and 
have been accepted widely in the literature, but there is no agreement on the interactions between these 
three factors in shaping the performance. Therefore, proposing a model for connecting these factors to 
performance is interesting. All of the previous models are designed based on the regression analysis. This 
paper aims to apply mathematical programming in this issue for the first time. Knowledge sharing as a 
proper area and bi-level programming as an extendable framework selected for developing such a model. 
We implemented our model in General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) with randomly generated 
data for 100 employees. Outputs of optimization model analyzed by SPSS regression analysis. Based on 
the results obtained in the statistical analysis, predicted performance by the proposed bi-level 
programming model has a behavior close to the results reported by the previous empirical research. 
Future research can test the proposed model using empirical data in comparison to currently available 
regression models.

1. Introduction  
The combination of motivation, opportunity, and ability (MOA) is an accepted framework for analyzing the 
employee performance. Based on this framework, employee performance is a function of ability, motivation, and 
opportunity (Boselie et al., 2005; Boxall & Purcell, 2008). However, the relationship between these factors in 
shaping the employee performance is under discussion (Collings & Mellahi, 2009; Siemsen et al., 2008; Jiang et al., 
2012). This paper aims to propose a new mathematical model based on bi-level programming and game theory to 
shed lights on the interactions between these three factors. 
Bi-level programming allows us to model the autonomous behavior of employee that is common in nowadays 
organizations where improvement in employees’ performance could not be mandatory because of its complex and 
vague nature. People decide to share knowledge on their own utilities. Therefore, knowledge sharing is an example 
of duty that cannot be forced by managers (Huysman & Wit, 2004). Some studies have been done on MOA factors 
affecting the knowledge sharing behavior of employees (Afrazeh et al., 2003; Minbaeva, 2013; Foss et al., 2015).  
We also developed our model in this context. 
Game theory not only is applicable for modeling the interaction of employees in knowledge sharing but also has 
been used for analyzing the interaction between the organization and its’ employees. While the knowledge sharing 
game between employees usually considered as a simultaneous game and the problem is finding Nash equilibrium, 
the knowledge sharing game between the organization and its’ employees is a sequential game and has a Stackelberg 
equilibrium. Bi-level Programming can model both of these games simultaneously under well conditions (Dutang, 
2013). 
In section 2 theoretical foundations and recent progress in the literature of three subjects including MOA framework, 
Bi-level programming, and contributions of game theory in knowledge sharing have been explored. Then, in section 
3, a mathematical representation of MOA framework using bi-level programming and in section 4, numerical results

6. Conclusion 
MOA framework is an accepted but challenging model for explaining the performance of employees. Several 
competing models exist in the literature for defining the inter-relationships between three popular drivers of 
performance. All of these models are designed based on regression. This research proposes a novel mathematical 
model based on the bi-level programming for predicting the performance of employee’s based on MOA framework 
in the context of knowledge sharing.  
After developing the bi-level programming model, random data used to compare the predicted performance by the 
proposed model in three various regression models. Results showed that the generated data by the proposed model 
has a behavior close to those reported in the empirical research by Siemsen et al. (2008). Therefore, this model could 
explain the reality with more precision according to its flexibility in parameters.  
However, it should be tested by empirical research before proposing arguments. So, one direction of future research 
is testing the proposed model with empirical data for various setting parameters.    
Another limitation of this research is some assumptions regarding the formulation and parameters that should be 
examined and compared in different situations. So, analyzing various structures in the model both analytically and 
numerically could be interesting.  
By approving the benefits of bi-level programming in predicting the behavior of employees, future research can 
focus on extending the model to multiple behaviors such as including tacit knowledge sharing decision in addition to 
explicit knowledge sharing decision, and also, on including managerial decisions in the upper-level problem to 
develop a decision support system.

Abstract  
 
We present a three-stage stochastic programming approach for semiconductor manufacturing planning 
under demand and production yield uncertainty. The production processes are considered to follow a push 
policy in the Front-End, and a pull policy in the Back-End; with the Die Bank being the decoupling point. 
Outsourcing of production and process for each processing stage (e.g., fabrication, sort, assembly, and 
test) are explicitly modeled in our proposed optimization model. The decisions of the model include the 
amount of production start and whether or not to subcontract. We apply our model to a test case from a 
large US-based microelectronic manufacturer. The computational results reveal that the proposed 
stochastic programming model produces solutions that are significantly better than the solutions provided 
by the deterministic-equivalent expected value approach.

Abstract 
The paper presents the new quantitative framework to optimise Leagile Supply Chain (LASC) design. 
The first step utilises Lean tools to identify the optimal architecture for product families through the so-
called Leagile bills-of-material in product design. This step intends to reduce the storage keeping unit of 
the component set (Lean), while increasing the ability of combining them to create new products (Agile). 
Meantime, the second stage focuses on outlining the preliminary configuration of LASC with pre-defined 
decoupling and risk-pooling points. From then, the product architecture is matched with a supplier 
network before the supply side is refined. Afterwards, step four implements Lean philosophy to leanize 
the upstream site up to decoupling point. Finally, LASC's cost structure, which comprises from two 
different product types, is analysed. Based on minimising the total cost at a certain service level, the best 
configuration of LASC is optimised.The whole framework is illustrated in one specific case study.

1. Introduction
The pressure of fierce competition in the business market forces enterprises to relentlessly pursue proper ways to 
survive and thrive. After an era of mass production, Lean Manufacturing (LM) is considered as an effective solution 
which can create competitive advantages through eliminating waste thereby cutting cost. Yet, it proves very hard for 
Lean model to satisfy the diversity in customer demand as this model is only suitable for standard products. To scope 
with this issue, Agile was introduced and evaluated by Iacocca Institute (1991) as 21st-century Manufacturing 
Enterprise Strategy. Nonetheless, the model does suffer from significant operating cost.  
To take advantages of the two models, Naylor, Naim, and Berry (1999) coined the term “leagility”, which integrates 
both leanness and agility into one hybrid model. This advanced paradigm implements Lean in producing products and 
switches to Agile in marketing through one decoupling point. As a result, this approach can greatly reduce the 
production complexity, improve production efficiency and satisfy the various demands of end customers (Zhang, 
Wang, & Wu, 2012). From then, there are numerous models developed to explore and engineering LASC. Most of 
previous studies focused on integrating Lean and Agile strategy around the decoupling points. According to  
Christopher and Towill (2001), it is heated disagreement that Lean methodologies can be powerful contributor for 
Agile, yet authors Basu and Wright (2010) address the opposite point of view. Moreover, product design (PD) is 
“argued to support a leaner and more Agile supply chain (ASC) by postponing the point of differentiation” (Lee & 
Sasser, 1995) or in other words, PD affects directly LASC.  
Today, LASC is not an option, but a necessity (Myerson, 2014). Yet, to the best of our knowledge, there are two 
research gaps in this domain: 1. issues related to PD has yet to be taken into account in designing LASC; 2. the design 
of LASC has not conducted in quantitative method. Inspired from these factors, we propose one novel quantitative 
framework to design LASC based on Lean methodology while considering product design (PD). Particularly, the next 
section will review related studies before the novel framework is introduced. The proposed approach is then 
demonstrated in one numerical study. At last, the final section discusses the management implications, draw the 
necessary conclusions and make recommendations for future research.

Solutions: Candidate DC2 is excluded. The optimal configuration of LA SC is obtained as depicted in Fig 5 with TC 
LA SC cost stays at: $853.265,00. It is noted that the costs generated by Aglie products are small because their 
quantities account for a small proportion of the product family.

5. Discussion and Conclusion 
 
This article presents a new framework to optimise the design of LASC. Opposite to the idea from (Christopher and 
Towill (2001)), findings from this research show that Lean strategy can be a very good foundation for LASC 
development. The key factor for that success lies at generating the conformation between product family design and 
LASC design. This framework has fulfilled two research gaps identified before by taking into account the design of 
the product architecture into a LASC quantitative design. The article also presented the new concept of LA BOM 
and the procedure to create it. It may be very useful for designers in reality.   
However, there are some other obstacles that need careful attention when designing and pursuing LA SC:  
- The problem of quality homogeneity of products from different suppliers 
- The problem of optimising assembly stations for dynamic schedule 
- Optimal inventory levels at decoupling points.  
- The necessary of flexible transportation system to support the logistics postponement  
- The problem of enhancing the forecasting ability   
- The information of customer demand must be updated continuously to timely reflect the quantity of agile 
inventory at the decoupling point. 
 
There are still plenty of rooms for future studies in this field. For instance, scholars could conduct their research on 
LA SCD for multi-families product or on designing LASC, while considering reliability and resilience in the risk 
environment. Researchers also would try to use multi-decoupling points to amplify the agility of LASC.

A New formulation of Capacitated Plant Location Problem

Abstract 
The capacitated plant location problem (CPLP) is a very well studied problem in literature. In this paper we give a 
new formulation of the same. We first give an intuitive justification for the addition of new constraints. We consider 
the extreme case when transportation costs are very high, compared to location cost then in that situation we will 
tend to locate many plants that will reduce the transportation costs. And on other hand, when transportation costs are 
very low compared to location cost, then may locate very few plants. We introduce a new formulation of CPLP that 
addresses the above mentioned situations.  
Key Words: CPLP, SPLP, New Formulation. 
 
1. Problem Description  
Plant/ facility location is a key decision in supply chain network planning and a well studied problem in literature, 
where its variations are brought by considering the capacity of the plant to be located as un-capacitated/ capacitated 
in nature thus to fulfill the demands originated at market points. The installed capacity of a production unit is often 
constrained by various factors like land and construction cost, labor cost, raw material availability and other 
regulations applicable at that location. The monthly fixed costs (location costs) of the different locations and also the 
transportation costs have to be well estimated by the cross functional team comprising of Finance, Production and 
Supply Chain personnel. These problems are referred to as simple plant location problem (SPLP) and capacitated 
plant location problem (CPLP) in literature for which a variety of heuristic based approaches and exact solution 
methodology are available.  
2. Problem Formulation  
The important strategic decision in plant location problem is to set up the plants that minimize total cost (location 
plus transportation). Traditional capacitated facility location and transportation problem formulation is given below. 
The set of notations used in the models are: 
 I: denotes the set of possible sites where the plants can be located.  
i:  represents the element belonging to set I.  
fi: represents the fixed cost of installing a plant at the location i.  
Si: represents the production capacity of the plant at the location i.

Abstract  
 
In the humanitarian relief operations due to the damaged infrastructure the flow of relief 
inventories usually experiences delay. For instance roads are often damaged or jammed, and 
the information about demand and inventory are usually disturbed or unable to be obtained. 
Such circumstance imposes a considerable amount of uncertainty on the demand and supply 
side in the disaster relief chain. Delays hinder the optimal and timely provision of aid to the 
beneficiaries. The mechanism of how such delays influence the flow of material and 
information in the humanitarian supply chain is less studied. In this research we focus on 
post-disaster inventory management. We consider inventory ordering decisions which are 
decisions related to the post-disaster/warning stage once some information about a disaster 
become available. In this study we aim to understand the effect of delays on the various 
inventory control policies and investigate effective strategies that help to reduce the impact 
of delays in the disaster relief operations. We use system dynamics modeling to present a 
two echelon disaster supply chain model consisting of a downstream and upstream agent 
under a dynamic transport/lead time delay.

Abstract  
 
BORA (Barrier and Operational Risk Analysis) is relatively new approach developed for qualitative 
and quantitative risk and safety barriers analysis. It includes a barrier block diagrams, fault trees (FT), and 
risk influence diagrams combined for analyzing accident scenarios that may occur on oil and gas 
industries and assessing safety barriers performance. This recent approach has been chosen because of its 
analysis of operational factors (human, technical and organizational factors) that contributed in these 
accidents. Furthermore, a close attention that is given to safety barriers analysis. In fact, it allows 
analyzing the major accident scenarios and the performance of all safety barriers existing and opposing 
the occurrence of these scenarios. For this reason, the qualitative and quantitative analysis using barrier 
block diagrams and fault tree analysis (FTA) are applied, followed by influence diagram analysis, the 
effects of risk influencing factors (RIFs) on the initiating and basic events in the fault trees.   
 
In the context of BORA, expert judgment plays an important role in quantifying the revised 
probabilities of failure on demand of safety barriers considering average probabilities of failure on 
demand Pave (E) by aggregating weights (Wi) and scores (Qi) for each RIF. When the judgments of 
multiple experts are elicited, mathematical aggregation methods can then be used to combine these 
individual judgments into a single judgment for calculating the PFDrev. Using these methods, the risk 
analysts are able to combine these judgments in order to make better evaluation/decision about 
performance of safety barriers on terms of reliability, availability, effectiveness, response time and 
confidence level...etc.  
 
As known, three categories of aggregation methods are evoked by researchers and scientists and 
carried out in different fields. Namely, conjunctive methods, compromise methods and disjunctive 
methods. Notes that, each method is selected taking into account the nature of opinions and data 
dissemination given by experts. These methods will be introduced and compared through following 
sections.   
 
In the extant literature, many works were developed in the context BORA approach. A whole series of 
papers were submitted by Skelt et al, where they have proposed this approach then applied it as ""BORA-
Release"" which was intended for qualitative and quantitative risk analysis of hydrocarbon releases to 
prevent releases on offshore oil and gas production platforms. In these papers, the expert judgment is 
made using one expert who is considered as reliable while it is not sufficient to account on one expert to 
judge these situations.

Abstract  
 
The safety instrumented systems (SISs) are used in the oil and gas industry to  detect  the  onset  of  
hazardous  events  and/or  to  mitigate  their consequences  to  humans,  assets  and  environment.  A 
relevant problem concerning these systems is failure diagnosis and maintenance.  In this paper, a hybrid 
approach based on Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) and Bayesian Network (BN) that has been developed to 
satisfy the requirements of fault diagnosis, repair and maintenance of SIS. The proposed methodology 
offers significant advantages such as systematical determination of the sequence of fault diagnosis and 
repair action, especially FTA is used to identify all potential sources of SIS failure and generate a 
Marginal Importance Factor (MIF) for all basic events. Finally, we add influencing factors by mapping 
fault tree into equivalent Bayesian Network in order to see the influence of maintenance on the 
probability of failure on demand (PFD) of SIS.

Abstract  
 
Kanban is a scheduling system for lean and just in time manufacturing industries or services 
firms. It is a very effective tool for running a production system as a whole, in this system 
problem areas are highlighted by measuring lead time and cycle time of the full process the other 
benefits of the Kanban  system is to establish an upper limit to work in process inventory to 
avoid over capacity. The objective of this case study is to implement a standard Kanban System for 
a Electrical manufacturing MNC company. With this system, the firm implemented use of just in 
time to reduce the inventory cost stocked during the process. This case study also shows that the 
Kanban implementation is not only bounded to the company but to their vendor also, from where, 
some of the components are been assembled. A replenishment strategy was also developed, tested 
and improved at the company location. A complete instruction manual is also developed as a 
reference

1. Introduction 
Lean manufacturing or simply ‘lean’ is a systematic method for waste reduction within a 
manufacturing system without affecting productivity. Lean also takes into consideration when waste 
created through unevenness in workloads and due to overburden. Lean thinking is now spread to every 
country in the world; leaders are also adapting these lean tools and principles beyond manufacturing, 
logistics and distribution, services, retail, maintenance etc.  
Kanban, a technique for work and inventory release, is a major component of Just-in-Time (JIT) and 
Lean Manufacturing philosophy. Kanban was originally developed at Toyota in the1950’s as a way to 
manage material flow on the assembly line. Over the last three decades, the Kanban process a highly 
efficient and effective factory production system has become a widely used tool in the manufacturing 
environment and global competition. Kanban stands for Kan- card, Ban- signal. The essence of the 
Kanban concept is that a supplier, the warehouse or the manufacturer should deliver components only 
when they are needed so that there is no excess inventory

CONCLUSION 
According to the lean manufacturing principles particularly in this case study, the case study results 
have been evaluated using waste reduction metric parameter. Three waste metrics had been identified 
inventory, transportation (from vendor to company) and over production (un-planned stock). All these 
parameters were identified in the values stream mapping and were able to reduce with the help of kanban 
system.  
FSN analysis for making the super market area (keeping in view of safety stock to reduce 
transportation cost from vendor to company) more over the replenishment strategy for the spider to 
replenish materials at each station to reduce the motion of the spider. The result can be verified in the 
future state map i.e. reducing the inventory storage (both inventory level and over production) from 13 
days to 5.5 day which means reduction of around 58% in non-value added activities.

Abstract 
Large projects are designed to change the shape of society by bringing economic values for a wide range 
of stakeholders. They are however, prone to influence cultural and societal values of society and 
therefore, project organizations need to have a better understanding of demands and values of the society 
in which the project is deployed.  Considering local communities, this research tries to deduct a theory for 
perceptions of local communities from activities and behavior of project organization. The method of this 
research is case study and it uses documents from companies as well as interviews from three groups of 
stakeholders: project organization, local communities and local government. The role of local government 
is considered as the communicator standing between local communities and project organizations. The 
results of this research show that transparency, social and environmental sustainability and the 
organization background highly influences local community’s perception of the behavior of project
organization activities. This research makes contributions to theory, by building the model from the local 
community’s view point and to practice, by giving a more clear view of the benefits of communications
with local communities. 
Keywords 
Stakeholder Management, Local Community, Transparency, Sustainability, Project Governance 
Introduction 
Stakeholder theory emphesizes on spreading project’s value with a broader range of stakeholders, which
Freeman, (1984) calls management-for-stakeholders. These benefits can go beyond financial achivements of the 
projects and project managements should be attuned to the cultural, organizational and social environments 
surrounding projects. Sharing values with stakeholders has two sides, creating and ccapturing values.  
Reviewed researches show that while value creation is one of the most recognized topics of research, value 
realization has been over looked. From the view point of an important group of stakeholders, local communities, this 
research aims at understanding how local communities decide to capture the value or not. The results of this research 
will contribute to literature by development of the model which introduces the variables influencing local 
community’s perception and to practice by introducing a new aspect in stakeholder management: managing local
communities through understanding their point of view.  
Literature Review 
This research is directed to explore and identify how to enhance success of complex projects using the 
amounts of value realized in the whole lifecycle of the project by three different selected stakeholders. According to 
2351
Proceedings of the 2nd European Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IEOM) 
Paris, France, July 26-27, 2018","“There is this mall built by project organization, we never use it, this is not compatible with our life style. 
It was also not even made for us. They built it for their own workers and they are those who use it. Not us.” (Local 
community, case 2) 
The last emerged area, is project governance. The governance mechanism of the organization influences 
the decision made at the project level and organization level (project management or context) and decisions made 
about communications with local communities, transparancy and resource allocations. This newly emerged area still 
needs further investigations to see exactly which parts of project governance can influence the causalities.  
The modified model (till the date now) is illustrated in figure 3.

Conclusion 
 
 
 
Local communities are being influenced by complex projects while the majority of their perceptions about 
the changes brought to their life is influenced by project organization’s behavior. Consequently, these perceptions 
can be mediated and controlled by selection of proper governance mechanism, transparency, being socially, 
environmentally and economically sustainable. Additionally, the results of this qualitative theory building research 
revealed that activities and behaviors of project organization can make a history profile for them which can 
influence their legitimacy and reputation in long term.  
 
Decision makers of organizations should be aware that they can influence stakeholders’ perceptions by the 
management style they adopt and academics are suggested to have a shift from focusing on project organization’s 
view point to stakeholder’s.  
 
There was a model built in this research with case study method, in Iran and within Oil & Gas sector. This 
model can be tested in other sectors, within communities with different characteristics and as a comparison with the 
current research.

Abstract 
The subject of Big Data has been studied more and more in all areas, particularly in the health services 
sector. Big data technology can eventually change the medical practice by setting up very advanced tools 
to store, manage, analyze and secure the information collected at a very high level. The goal is to use this 
data from various sources to improve the management and effectiveness of care, also to monitor the 
health status of the population. In Morocco, the health field is one of the most important concerns of the 
government. Access to health data in Morocco is very limited, and in another side this sector encounters 
several problems in the digital management of these data. For all these reasons, we must think of creative 
and innovative solutions. Transforming clinical data into knowledge to improve patient care has been the 
goal of this article, for which we propose a new model called the Moroccan Electronic Health Record 
System. This last will be common between all health services in Morocco such as hospitals, clinics and 
medical offices. The system will be national and based on the context of Big Data in order to improve and 
develop the health sector in Morocco.

1. Introduction
Health systems are looking for effective ways to care for more patients in a shorter time, and to increase the quality 
of care through better coordination. Health organizations strive to improve the patient experience through rapid, 
accurate and non-invasive diagnostics. To reduce costs, they try to avoid unnecessary procedures and readmissions. 
The use of the Electronic Health Record (EHR) is critical to achieving these goals as well as the digital shift in 
hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, medical practices, etc. The EHR system is also important to the overall health 
economy in the areas of public health, health information exchange, and focused care management on the patient 
(Thurston, 2014). 
Big Data represented as a set of technologies, that allow large-scale of information management, processing, and 
storage. The term applies to many fields, including telecommunication, finance, industry, public sector, marketing, 
and healthcare (Ross et al., 2014). The EHR system would be considered as a Big Data environment and we can 
make better exploitation of the data stored in this framework. Big Data platforms like Hadoop, Spark, Flink, and 
others, provide opportunities to analyze and process complex medical data in ways traditional relational techniques 
could not perform (Peters & Buntrock, 2014).  
The aim of this work, is to propose the Moroccan Electronic Health Record System (MEHRS). This project is a 
suggest of a new national system of information technology in the health sector in Morocco, based on the Big Data 
approach. The MEHRS will help patients to consult their medical situations, doctors make a better analysis, and 
health stakeholders share the information collected by keeping the notion of anonymity profiles for patients. The 
deployment of the MEHRS will help the health sector to develop and improve all services associated with this area.

governments have given to this national initiative a paramount importance, and this project was the latest in 
a series of Australian government initiatives in health care IT. With the PCEHR, patients have the ability to 
post information stored on all information systems of their different health care providers (Morrison et all., 
2011). Recently, the Commonwealth Department of Health has announced that the name of the PCEHR has 
changed to My Health Record. 
 
Currently, the Kingdom of Morocco does not have a National Health Information System. All Countries that have 
deployed the EHR system was achieved remarkable, important, positive and satisfying results. Moroccan Electronic 
Health Record System is the proposal of a new dedicated national system for the health sector that will solve the 
problems accumulated in this field. The MEHR system will be based on the very advanced technologies of Big Data 
that will help health sector in Morocco to achieve concrete results in a short time. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
To conclude, the Moroccan Electronic Health Record System article is a new proposed national system for the 
health sector in Morocco. This project will be developed on the power of Big Data technologies, using well-defined 
and well-chosen storage, management, and analysis tools and platforms. The goal is to create a common platform 
for all providers, pharmacies, hospitals, clinics, doctors, etc., to share patient information, maintain medical 
traceability of health services, ensure effective analysis, and more things. The Moroccan patient should be placed at 
the center of this national system and their medical data must be secured, controlled and supervised. In order to 
deploy this system in Morocco, several steps have been proposed, and the most important point is to sensitize 
Moroccan citizens for encouraging them to participate in the collection of personal medical information. The MEHR 
system is a platform which will facilitate the analysis of patient data, help improve the quality of health services, and 
provide a powerful work environment.

Abstract 
 
The np control chart is used to monitor the number of nonconforming items in a sample. A new np 
control chart was introduced recently by utilizing the information on the past subgroups via the idea of 
multiple dependent state sampling. Unlike traditional control charts, this chart is known with two pairs of 
control limits. This paper proposes an economic model with statistical constraints based on Lorenzen & 
Vance cost function in order to determine best design parameters of the new np chart. Moreover, the 
model is extended under linear, quadratic, exponential, and inverted normal loss functions. Accordingly, 
the same magnitude of deviations from the target results in different quality costs. A solution procedure is 
presented for optimally specification of five design parameters. Based on numerical studies, the algorithm 
procedure is illustrated and some comparisons are made to evaluate the performances of economic design 
(ED) versus economic-statistical design (ESD). The sensitivity of the optimal cost and the chart 
parameters for different loss functions and input parameters is investigated. The results have indication of 
significant improvement in statistical performance for ESD despite a small increase in cost due to the 
statistical constraints added to ED.

PackageCargo - Open Source Tool based on 
Optimization and Simulation for the Container Loading 
Problem with Dynamic Stability

Abstract 
 
Traditional considerations related to dynamic stability constraint in the Container Loading Problem 
(CLP), such as boxes with insufficient lateral support, have proven to be inaccurate when compared with 
the results of dynamic simulations where the boxes are subjected to real world conditions. In response to 
this, two indicators for dynamic stability were introduced; the number of fallen boxes and the number of 
boxes likely to be damaged in case of acceleration. These indicators, however, have not yet been 
estimated using a mechanical approach. An open source application (PackageCargo) was developed to 
calculate, visualize, and save efficient packing patterns to instances of the CLP, and has been enhanced 
with a dynamic simulation environment to obtain performance indicators related the dynamic stability of 
such patterns. The physics engine used in the application is capable of trading accuracy for simulation 
speed and is in most cases non-deterministic. Through PackageCargo we evaluated the accuracy of new 
dynamic stability metrics. A mechanical model that measures dynamic stability without the need to 
subject the packing pattern to a physics simulation was developed, based on a dynamic analysis of the 
forces and accelerations acting upon the boxes and using the kinetic parameters of the load such as mass 
distribution, coefficient of friction, and rigidity.

1. Introduction  
 
The Container Loading Problem (CLP) is one of the most relevant among cutting and packing problems. The CLP 
has been proven to be NP-Hard (Pisinger, 2002), which in addition to its large spectrum of applicability, has allowed 
researchers and industry alike to maintain interest on the problem. The CLP seeks to pack a set of small rectangular 
items into a single rectangular container of bigger size, aiming to maximize the utilization of space within the 
container. 
Real CLP applications require the modelling and consideration of practical constraints of significant complexity. 
The authors in (Bortfeldt & Wascher, 2013) present a compilation of constraints related to the container loading 
problem. Among several types of constraints, this work focuses on the cargo stability. The cargo stability constraint 
seeks to preserve the integrity of the items (customer satisfaction) and the safety of operators carrying out 
loading/unloading operations. Previous works that address cargo stability have defined two types of stability: static 
and dynamic. Static stability refers to the equilibrium of the box (maintaining the position of the cargo) during 
loading and unloading operations, whereas dynamic stability refers to the equilibrium during transportation and is 
the least studied type of stability in literature. (Ramos et al., 2015) proposed a set of dynamic stability metrics for the 
CLP, which reflect dynamic stability based on the crucial factors of integrity and safety. The contributions of this 
work arise from these metrics. 
In this work, dynamic stability metrics found in the literature were reviewed and reformulated, since some of 
these did not contemplate the total number of boxes found in the packing pattern, which would not allow a

To measure the M3 indicator for each instance it was necessary to report the mean value corresponding to each 
class. Due to non-deterministic nature of the physics engine, every instance was run 30 times, reporting the average 
(column M3(Ph)) for each class. 
On the other hand, PhysX allows to measure M4 for each instance. For this indicator it is necessary to include 
the fragility of the boxes. For this study we have used two values that according to (Mitchell, 1998), correspond to 
the interval of maximum values of acceleration (3g-20g) that products classified as “fragile” may withstand. For 
future comparisons M4 was calculated using the extreme values of acceleration (3g and 20g), the mean value was 
reported running 30 iterations per instance for each class (columns M4(3g) and M4(20g), respectively). 
The results obtained from PhysX follow the trend of lower M3 and M4 values for higher percentages of volume 
utilization, and, as suggested by (Ramos et al., 2015), the dynamic stability metrics show a much weaker relation 
with M1 and M2. When the items are defined to have a lower fragility or maximum allowable acceleration (20g vs 
3g), M4 decreases drastically. M3 however, doesn’t vary appreciably; after all the fragility of an item has no effect 
on its kinematic properties. 
The values for M3 calculated follow the trend of higher values for better utilization of space within the container.

5. Conclusions 
PhysX is accurate according to the performed benchmark test. Additionally, the results show acceptable 
repeatability for the dynamic simulations, allowing it to be taken as an accurate baseline for comparison with the 
mathematical model. 
PhysX produces results for M3 and M4 with satisfactory accuracy. This is of significance, since PhysX produces 
such results in a short amount of time, without presenting any variance in its results. This makes it attractive for 
integration with an optimization algorithm considering the dynamic stability constraint.  
The open source nature of PackageCargo makes the software readily accessible for contributions seeking to 
enhance its capabilities beyond the scope of this work (i.e. simulating marine and air transportation). It also makes 
the offered optimization and simulation tools available to the scientific and academic communities to allow the 
evaluation of simulation models and optimization algorithms.

Abstract 
The field of Analytics is a new area of research, and management scholars are looking at this 
area closely. We make a small attempt to make a contribution in this area. Typically we relate 
descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive analytics to strategy types, some 
dimensions of culture; and present few testable hypotheses.  
Key Words: Analytics, Strategy, Culture and Personality Types 
1. Introduction:
Here we give types of strategies (2 and 4) and analytics (5 and 6) and relate them to
culture and personalities involved in decision making. Below we give these.
Data analytics is the process of examining data to reveal patterns, trends & associations. The 
purpose of this analysis, for business entities, can be divided into four categories. 
(a) Descriptive Analytics: The purpose of this type of analysis is to find out ‘what is
happening in a business entity’. Common examples of Descriptive Analytics are
company reports that simply provide a historic review of an organization’s operations,
sales, financials, customers, and stakeholders. Respondents to APQC’s survey
indicate that descriptive analytics is the most commonly used form across all areas of
supply chain, including quality management, procurement, process management,
logistics, supply chain planning and manufacturing.
(b) Diagnostic Analytics: The purpose of this type of analysis is to find out ‘why
something is happening’ or ‘why something has happened in the past’. It is
characterized by techniques such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining and
correlations. It starts at the beginning of descriptive analytics and extends to
predictive analytics.. Usually, the outcome of this analytics is a dashboard.
(c) Predictive Analytics: The purpose of this type of analysis is to give a probabilistic
estimate of ‘what will happen’ if the things keep happening in the same way. The goal
is to go beyond knowing what has happened to providing a best assessment of what
will happen in the future. Predictive analytics brings together advanced analytics
capabilities spanning ad-hoc statistical analysis, predictive modeling, data mining,
text analytics, optimization, real-time scoring and machine learning. These tools help
organizations discover patterns in data and go beyond knowing what has happened to
anticipating what is likely to happen next.
(d) Prescriptive Analytics- The purpose of this type of analysis is to find out ‘what should
be done’. Prescriptive analytics can also suggest decision options for how to take
advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk, and illustrate the
implications of each decision option. In practice, prescriptive analytics can

3322","Krittika (2) have argued that decision makers using ANALYTICS need to be Perceptive (as 
opposed to Judgemental). But we argue that in cost leader strategy type, decision makers 
need not be too much perceptive as it is a case of low uncertainty, and vice versa in the case 
of differentiators and innovators.  
 
So we propose the following.  
 
H6. Decision making unit (DMU) in a cost leader organization should be composed of 
predominantly Judgemental type of personalities.  
 
H7. Decision making unit (DMU) in a differentiation and innovation type of organization 
should be composed of predominantly Perceptive type of personalities.  
 
3. Conclusions:  
 
In this paper we gave interesting hypotheses relating analytics, strategy, culture and 
personality. We are in the process of carrying an empirical investigation; and we will get 
back with empirical results as soon as possible.

Abstract 
 
The aim of this research is to identify factors promoting motivation and to ultimately improve productivity 
levels in the laboratories of a water treatment and supply company in Johannesburg, South Africa. A review 
of the literature spanning for a period of 10 years was performed to determine the causes of motivation and 
demotivation from well-known theories. Two theories, closely investigated in the laboratory, were the 
McGregor Y Theory, Maslow Hierarchy. The researchers attempted to investigate what causes chemistry 
staff to be demotivated and perform poorly in the laboratory although there was an on-going continuous 
improvement drive based on lean thinking. This was achieved through a quantitative study by interpreting 
the data gathered during survey questioning with the laboratory staff. The sample chosen was based on a 
quota sampling selection. Results obtained from the analysis of data gathered through the questionnaires 
provide a clear indication of where the company’s drive for continuous improvement is and where it should 
be. The research was successful in showing the influence of motivational factors on productivity in the 
laboratory and recognizing any techniques to improve motivation amongst chemistry staff.

1. Introduction 
 
1.1 Background of the study 
 
Motivation in routine analysing laboratories is a challenge due to the fast-growing service industry. Employee’s lack 
of motivation is believed to influence negatively on productivity levels and thus creating low morale in employees, 
declining productivity, high employee turnover, and increased absenteeism rate in laboratories. Notwithstanding, 
Dartey-Baah and Amoako (2011) show that there are various motivation theories that have affected the way firms 
oversee workers to achieve a driven workforce. Cerasoli, Nicklin and Ford (2014) through their study on intrinsic 
motivation which was a 40-year meta-analysis, stated critical insights on motivation. Cerasoli et al (2014) noted that 
as stated by Maier (1965), Champbell and Pritchard (1976) and later by Pinder (2011) it is evident that motivation is 
a central element of any dependable model of human performance, and that it has been a core emphasis of engineering 
and organizational psychology for countless years (Steers, Mowday, & Shapiro, 2004). Literature studies such as that 
from Abbasi and Hollman (2000) suggest that high staff turnover leads to poor staff development and a decline in 
productivity. Ramlall (2004) defines worker motivation or drive as ""the inclination to employ high levels of 
determination to deal with business goals, inured by the effort's aptitude to gratify some individual want"". This study 
attempts to identify factors promoting motivation and the influence of continuous improvement efforts on employees’ 
motivation and productivity levels in the laboratory of a water treatment and supply company, South Africa. 
 
The company studied in this paper, referred to as RW, was established in May 1903 to treat and supply water to 
Johannesburg and in 1904 RW was required to take over the undertakings of the companies at that time supplying or 
potentially capable of supplying water to the Witwatersrand, Gauteng, South Africa. It was expected to supply water 
in bulk only. Today it is one of the best water boards from the 12 available in South Africa. Water quality management 
is one of its expertise apart from its core competence being water purification. RW has adopted the South African

As shown in Table 6 above, the results from the ANOVA analysis performed against Question 1 and the productivity 
results show that the F-crit 4.03 and the F-cal (F) to be at 10.90. This would mean that the researcher will be rejecting 
the Null hypotheses that with better leadership and effective communication in the laboratory, the employee 
productivity will improve. Another look at Table 6 reveals that the ANOVA analysis performed against Question 2 
and the productivity results show that the F-crit 4.03 and the F-cal (F) to be at 2.28. This would mean that the 
researcher will be rejecting the Null hypotheses that with better leadership and effective communication in the 
laboratory, the employee productivity will improve. The Calculated P-value is 0.14 indicating a positive correlation 
between working conditions and productivity. A further scrutiny of Table 6 shows that the results from the ANOVA 
analysis performed against Question 3 and the productivity results indicate that the F-crit 4.03 and the F-cal to be at 
3.51, which means that the researcher will not be rejecting the Null hypotheses that with better leadership and effective 
communication in the laboratory, the employee productivity will improve. The calculated P-value of 0.06 indicates 
that giving employees authority and responsibility over their work will improve productivity as there is positive 
correlation between the variables. The results from the ANOVA analysis performed against the question 4 and the 
productivity results show that the F-crit 4.03 and the F-cal to be at 2.08 this would mean that the researcher will not 
be rejecting the Null hypotheses rewards and promotions motivate employees to study further and perform more at 
work. The P value of 0.16 indicates that there is a positive correlation between the two variables, showing that rewards 
and promotions impact productivity in the labs and that there is significant relationship between the two. 
. 
5. Conclusion 
 
The results found from the ANOVA showed that formulated hypothesis would not be rejected with the second, third, 
fourth questions giving critical values of 2.28, 3.51, 2.08 respectively against the critical value of 4.03. The first 
questions answer from the ANOVA (Table 6) gave a result which wouldn't reject the tested hypothesis. From this the 
researcher can conclude that Working conditions of the laboratory, the trust from management given to employee's 
opinions and ideas, and Promotions (opportunities) and rewards do affect and have an impact on the productivity of 
the laboratory. 
 
The theories used in this study are evident that their importance is significant for a laboratory to obtain increased levels 
of productivity, absenteeism, and lower turnover rates. The findings of this study indicate that there is a correlation 
that exists between motivation factors and productivity. 
 
The research successfully showed the influence of Communication between the superiors and subordinates, working 
conditions, trust, and promotions and rewards greatly impact the productivity of the laboratory and hence Maslow 
suggestion that management needs to satisfy the higher-level factors first for them to ensure that their employees stay 
satisfied with their current jobs and the productivity of the lab is not affected. It can be seen from the results that the 
more years of service the employees had influenced their response to the questionnaire and that the older employees 
were more mature to the questions. They have had a lot of experience in avoiding or resolving and coping with the 
factors which affected their motivation towards the type of work they performed. 
 
Management need to incorporate motivational techniques in the laboratory which can assist them to motivate their 
employees so that their laboratory productivity levels aren't affected. 
 
6. Recommendations and the Way Forward 
 
Future studies should focus on the effectiveness of motivators being applied from the perspective of the laboratory 
staff. Management can employ the following strategies to motivate their employees using salaries, wages, and 
conditions of service to improve their employee's morale, as well as to ensure that employees are developed through 
training and being awarded opportunities within the organization. Another way managers can stimulate motivation is 
by ensuring that information is available to the employees, transparency in the department helps subordinates compete 
with each other fairly. A study conducted by Brown and Sheppard (1997) examined the characteristics of the work of 
teacher in a four category being, knowledge based, technical skills, values, and beliefs. He reported that they will 
succeed in meeting the challenge only if they are motivated by deeply-held values and beliefs regarding the 
development of a shared vision. Colvin (1998) noted that he believed that financial incentives increase productivity. 
Additionally, Nzuve (1999) stressed that it is important that managers practice general supervision rather than close 
detailed supervision of employees so that managers devote their time on supervisory activities, rather than close 
detailed special tasks.

Abstract  
Construction activities have been established to be posing a great danger to the environment. In a bid to 
curtail these negative happenings the call for sustainability in construction has become popular. 
Construction industries around the world are advised to build in a manner in which no harm is done to the 
environment, and the future generation can have enough to cater for their own needs. However, 
sustainable construction (SC) practices adoption, has been observed to be low in most developing 
countries. It is based on this knowing that this study assessed the barriers to SC practices within the 
Zambian Construction Industry (ZCI). The study adopted a survey approach and construction 
professionals within the ZCI were sampled using the questionnaire as a research instrument. Descriptive 
statistics tools were employed in analyzing the gathered data. Findings revealed that the major barriers to 
SC practices in ZCI are; fear of higher investment costs, no local green certification available, lack of 
government policies or support, and lack of financial incentives. Therefore educating construction clients 
and other stakeholders on the overall life-cycle cost benefit of SC is deemed necessary.

Introduction 
Construction projects in most developing countries have been characterized with poor performance in terms of 
sustainability. This is in contrast to the clamor for a more sustainable environment; one that is achieved through 
sustainable construction (SC); a construction that satisfies the present needs with jeopardizing the ability of future 
generations to satisfy their own needs. Ametepey and Aigbavboa (2014) observed that scientists and scholars are 
now increasingly aware of the fact that the earth’s resources are being overly consumed and this most like will erode 
the earth’s support system. This consumption is traceable largely to the activities of the construction industry. Baloi 
(2003) observed that although the construction industry is crucial in the social and economic growth of any country, 
it has come to be known for its heavy contribution towards unsustainable development, and its impact on both the 
economy and the environment is tremendous. The processes and products used in the traditional construction 
approach have a negative environmental and social impact. The activities consume massive quantities of natural 
resources including numerous energy sources and water. Extraction of raw materials, manufacturing, and 
transportation tend to lead to a reduction of resources and losses of biological diversity whilst acid rain and global 
warming is the result of high energy consumption.  
In response to the unhealthy situation, SC was proposed as a way of making the construction processes, activities 
and practices more economically, socially and environmentally responsive (Abidin, 2010). This was motivated by

1. Process management in internal control in the Cuban context
Management as a discipline arises from the very development of society and the transformations that have occurred in the business sector, 
due to the increase in competition and the constant changes in the environment. That is why it has gradually evolved and enriched with 
innovative tools, extending its radius of action beyond the business sector, currently recognized by various authors at the national and 
international level to universities as an object of management (Ortiz Pérez, 2014). Cuban universities are involved in constant 
transformations to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their management. In the Guidelines of the Economic and Social Policy of 
the Party and the Revolution, emanating from the VI Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba, are the bases for the improvement of 
Cuban higher education, which advocate continuing advancing in the elevation of the quality in the higher education. In correspondence 
with the guidelines, since the national preparation seminar for the 2011-2012 academic year of the Ministry of Higher Education (MHE),

Abstract 
The principle of proven suitability contributes, together with management by competencies, to achieving 
effectiveness in Human Capital Management. In public health entities, it is essential to correctly develop 
competency-based management to enhance the quality of services. However, studies conducted by the 
Ministry of Public Health show dissatisfaction of the population with medical care received, demonstrated 
by the increase in complaints and claims in recent years, especially directed at hospital services. In this 
study we propose a procedure to manage suitability in public health entities. It is in line with Cuban 
legislation and contributes to improving the systems of internal control of organizations. The application 
was developed in a hospital, and allowed the elaboration of proficiency and suitability profiles, evaluation 
of these profiles and calculation and analysis of indicators for the key processes of human capital. 
Keywords: demonstrated suitability, labor competencies  
 1. Introduction 
Cuba is not alien to the world economic reality; affected by the economic, political and financial blockade imposed 
by the United States it is more difficult to proceed to achieve satisfactory results. According to the guidelines 43 of 
the VI Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba, it achieves a progressive reduction of the levels of support by the 
State. To achieve these results, guideline 15 refers to the essential thing that is to elevate the responsibility and the 
faculty of companies to strengthen their Internal Control System. 
In 2011, the General Comptroller of the Republic of Cuba enforces Resolution No. 60 on internal control a standard 
that serves as a guide for the Cuban business system and the implementation of internal control. The aforementioned 
resolution proposes five components that make up the Internal Control System and that are consistent with the most 
generalized criteria: Control, risk management and prevention environment, control activities, supervision and 
monitoring, and information and communication.

Abstract 
This paper considers the bicriteria scheduling problem of minimizing the average flowtime and maximum 
earliness on a single machine with zero release dates. The problem is NP hard, though the Minimum 
Slack Time (MST) and Shortest Processing Time (SPT) rules yield optimal solutions for the maximum 
earliness (Emax) and average flowtime (Favg) problems, respectively if each criterion were to be applied 
singly. Thus, in evaluating two proposed heuristics (SAE and EAO), the values of each of the criteria for 
the two proposed heuristics were compared against the optimal solution of the sub problems. 
Computational experimental results with job sizes varying from 5 to 200 jobs show that SAE is not 
significantly different from the optimal Favg. The results also show that for problem sizes, 5 
n 
 30, 
SAE is not significantly different from the optimal Emax. However, the results of EAO heuristic is 
significantly different from the optimal for the two criteria except for Favg for problem sizes, 40 n  200. 
Therefore, the SAE heuristic is recommended for simultaneously minimizing average flowtime and 
maximum earliness on a single machine with zero release dates.

The t-tests results show that for the average flowtime, the SAE heuristic result is not significantly different from the 
optimal for all the considered problem sizes. For the maximum earliness, the SAE result is not significantly different 
from the optimal for problem sizes, 5 n  30 while for 40 n  200, the result is significantly different from the 
optimal. The EAO heuristic is significantly different from the optimal for the two criteria except for Favg for problem 
sizes, 40 n  200. 
 
7. Conclusion and Recommendation 
This paper proposed two direct heuristics for minimizing the average flowtime and maximum earliness on a single 
machine with zero release dates. Results of the simulation in terms of effectiveness shows that the SAE heuristic 
yielded results that are not significantly different from the optimal solution (SPT) for the average flowtime for all 
the considered problem sizes (5 
n 
 200). Also for problem sizes, 5 
n 
 30, the SAE heuristic is not 
significantly different from the optimal (obtained from the MST heuristic) for maximum earliness. Thus, the SAE 
heuristic is recommended for simultaneously minimizing average flowtime and maximum earliness on a single 
machine with zero release date especially for job sizes not greater than 30.

Abstract 
The purpose of this work is a bibliometric analysis of the evolution of knowledge management (KM) 
and intellectual capital (IC) as scientific fields in time.  The used data was all articles having 
“intellectual capital” or “knowledge management” in their title from SCOPUS database exported in 
Excel and R language is used to compute the indexes. The analysis is using the indexes (H index, N 
index, G index, I index, lotka’s law), which are most related to references and citations of the articles. 
We find that KM and IC fields are heterogeneous in cases and homogeneous in other cases vis à vis the 
applied indexes.  This analysis is usefull to researchers in the two areas to find the pionners and the 
most productive authors to potentially collaborate with them and,  the most read articles to use them in 
literature review. In databases of researches, only H index is offered but to all articles of area defined by 
the database and not for a set of requested articles. This paper is filling this gap,  as the first study 
of KM and IC using relative bibliometric indexes.
Keywords: Relative bibliometric indexes; H index; N index; G index; I index; Lotka’s law;
intellectual capital; knowledge management. 
1. Introduction
The beginning of scientific research is to conduct a methodical study in order to prove a hypothesis or to answer a 
specific question. Finding a definitive answer is the central goal of any experimental approach. One can also say that 
it is a dynamic process or a rational approach that allows us to examine phenomena, problems to be solved, and to 
obtain precise answers from investigation. 
Intellectual capital is a non-monetary element with no physical substance, constituted by information and knowledge 
held, and having a positive value, by an organization 
Three types of IC can be distinguished: 
- Automated information (software and databases),
- Property rights to innovations (patents, copyrights, trademarks, etc.)
- Economic skills (human capital, organizational know-how...
We call KM software methods and tools to identify and capitalize knowledge in order to organize and disseminate
knowledge. Knowledge can be individual (attached to a person) or collective (shared by a group of people). They
may be based on studies (training) or practice (experience or tacit know-how). In all cases, they are based on the
individuals who make up the company.
Bibliometrics are the application of mathematical and statistical methods to books, articles and other averages of
communication (Ingwersen et al., 2007). It is based on classifications, pre-established schedules, and consists in
counting the number of publications (articles or patents) having a particular characteristic, belonging to such a
category of classification. It also measures the productivity of an author, country, institution, and the impact of a
journal, a theme, an author (using counts references that received some work for a period).
Section 2 presents related works in bibliometrics. Section 3 is devoted to illustrate used data and relative 
bibliometric Indexes. Section 4 is an application of bibliometric Indexes to IC and KM. Section 5 is a comparison of 
IC and KM using relative bibliometric Indexes. We conclude our work in section 6.

6 Conclusion 
In global view, in this work it was found that intellectual capital is emerging field and scientific researchers are more 
productive and have immediate impact than those of knowledge management field, despite its novelty.  
This study could be extended to other databases (WOS, INSPEC…etc.), to have more representative dataset of a 
field and with adaptation of computing programs.  
The impact of research is analyzed and measured using relative bibliometric indexes. Currently, bibliometry finds its 
most important application in evaluating the performance of scientific research. More recently, bibliometric methods 
have been used to assess the effectiveness and productivity of research. 
After the global bibliometric analyses of authors of articles, and the application of the few indexes that have 
presented beforehand on the programming language R, the results obtained have been compared, the aim of which is 
to highlight the best destination that contains the information. 
It is believed that this work was very beneficial for us. We are now able to easily program any other index and find 
the desired information and using the R language that is now in hand, it is now a rewarding professional experience 
and encouraging for our future. 
Finally, and as an outlook for this work, these indexes can be applied to other research areas or other specific queries 
and propose a complete and user-friendly application for bibliometry.

5 Comparison of IC and KM in Generic Bibliometric Indexes 
Tab. 13 shows a summary and averages of applied indexes to IC and KM. Despite the sample of KM (1998 articles) 
is larger than the sample of IC (1504 articles), we find that the average number of references par article IC (44,12) is 
larger than KM (33,65); this is explained by the power contents of documents of IC relatively. Contrary to H and G 
indexes which are greater in KM (8; 10) compared to IC (3,7; 4) thanks the reputation and notoriety of KM. I and N 
indexes in IC (436; 14) are greater than KM (107; 0,88) ones; ie the articles of IC are cited more immediately than 
articles in KM and also over time. 
In KM the number of articles cited at least 10 times for the top ten productive authors is 5,6 and lower than IC (8,33) 
one; we understand that in IC there is low number of authors but they are more productive and cited than KM 
authors. 
Lotka’s law in IC is almost valid and less valid in KM; it is related to the representativeness of their samples.

Abstract 
Providing proper healthcare to the growing population in Bangladesh has become major concern because 
of the increasing threats of infectious diseases and their rate of mortality. It has been challenging for the 
healthcare providers to provide optimal treatment of emerging infectious diseases. In recent years, 
mathematical models have become important tools in analyzing and describing the changing dynamics of 
healthcare and biomedical systems. The processes in biology and medicine can be, in general, described by 
mathematical models where the nonlinear ordinary differential equations are the key ingredients. Optimal 
control technique fuels on such analysis in obtaining the optimal control strategies. This technique provides 
new results by applying the old theories. In this paper, we address some recent developments of modeling 
the nonlinear behavior of immunotherapeutic treatment of leukemia using Adoptive T cell. Optimal control 
technique can be of advantageous to obtain the better strategy as a special feature in some cases. Numerical 
treatment is performed to illustrate the results. 
Keywords: Optimal control, Mathematical modeling, Healthcare systems, Numerical simulations. 
1. Introduction
Bangladesh has been the most risky geographic distribution for several chronic and infectious diseases like cancer and
other fatal diseases. Cancer is a group of disease complications which are mainly characterized by the uncontrolled
growth and proliferation of cells in the human body. Leukemia is a horrible type of cancer. It is a malignant cancer of
the blood. It is a most common type of cancer in children. Basically, leukemia disease occurs for the uncontrolled
growth of abnormal and immature white blood cells (or immune cells) in the human body. In 2009-2013, leukemia
was the fifth most common cause of cancer deaths in men and the sixth most common in women. In 2015,
approximately 2.3 million people were affected by leukemia and about 353,500 people died from it globally. Leukemia
is one of the top most cancers in the world and a very serious blood cancer. Because the symptoms of leukemia often
go unexplored and this makes the disease even deadlier. Actually, leukemia is a worldwide curse. There is no such
country where leukemia disease does not exist. The first case of leukemia was detected in the 19th century by the
European physician and named by a German politician in 1847. Since then, it has been enhanced considerably. It has
become a common phenomenon today that to have a cancer patient in every family in Bangladesh. A graphical
representation of leukemia related death of Bangladesh from 1990 to 2017 [25] is shown in Figure 1. From Figure 1
we see that in 1990, the number of leukemia related death was 241630. However, the number of leukemia related
death is increasing day by day. Here we show a graphical representation of leukemia related death of Bangladesh from
1990 to 2017. It shows that in the 21th century leukemia related death rate has considerably increased worldwide.
Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. The immune system is known to play an
important role in the dynamics of leukemia which is the motivation for the work in this paper.

6. Conclusions 
Bangladesh is the most densely populated (75% in rural areas) country in the world and the total population is its 
manpower.  So the ultimate demand is to take immediate necessary steps/treatment so that the leukemia infections can 
be cured completely. This paper focuses on the fundamental scenarios of leukemia and the nonlinear behavior of 
immunotherapeutic treatment by using adoptive T cell. A four compartmental model for leukemia has been formulated 
mathematically and then analyzed numerically. The analysis of the mathematical model and the simulation predictions 
clarify the mechanisms of the disease propagations and cancer cell interactions in the human body and thus suggest 
treatment strategies that could be implemented to defend the disease. Since proper medications as well as effective 
vaccine are still not available for the treatments, this study may help the doctors and biologists for determining and 
obtaining preventive strategies from this deadly disease leukemia.

Abstract 
 
Connected vehicle technologies aim to tackle some of the biggest challenges in the surface transportation 
industry. Connected vehicles feature safety warnings that alert drivers of potentially dangerous conditions 
- impending collisions, real-time information about traffic conditions and dangerous curves - before the 
driver is aware of them. The technology is anticipated to reduce unimpaired vehicle crashes by 80 percent. 
This paper presents the Named Data Networking (NDN) approach that seems to be the best suited to mobile 
environments, especially for connected vehicle. This work will describe the NDN along with its 
components, we will include some details of NDN in Vehicular Ad hoc NETwork (VANET) and finally, 
we will discuss the open issues and future research directions.

Connected Vehicle; V2V; V2I; NDN; ICN; CCN; ITS. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
In 2013, 5.6 million vehicle crashes and 32,719 deaths have been accounted, according to the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration (NHSTA). Motorists and onboard telematics solutions providers are concerned about 
automotive safety devices. With great support from the drivers, technological devices and systems related to 
automotive safety are being evolved: fatigue warning system, night vision assist system, reversing sensor, lane 
departure warning, … etc. 
 
The technology of connected vehicle aims to remarkably decrease the number of lives lost each year, by 
giving to the drivers necessary tools to forecast possible crashes. A connected vehicle can predict, learn and analyze. 
While increasing the driver’s comfort and safety, it collects information from its neighboring and enhance its 
performance. For example, it provides passengers with Wi-Fi access and allow them to download software updates 
and retrieve media content. Thanks to connectivity, the vehicle is now able to put together valuable data that changes 
the way of driving. It can communicate with its environment and obtain information about obstacles, speed, traffic 
conditions, location, and acceleration, in order to reduce the accident rate. 
 
The development of new vehicular applications is essential for improving the safety of transportation 
systems, generally known as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). According to (J.A. Guerrero-Ibáñez et al., 
2013), there is no single definition of ITS. Depending on the intention behind the implementation of the ITS, each 
country has its own definition. In the United States for example, the ITS refers to various technologies that address 
many of existed transportation problems, and aim to save lives, time and money (ITSA, 2011). Japan describes ITS 
as a significant solution to deal with transportation systems problems, including traffic congestion, environmental 
pollution and traffic accidents (ITS, 2010). Finally, Europe represents ITS as a new application used in urban transport 
by information and communication technologies (ERTICO, 1998).

information (like traffic jam advertisements of one day before) and data out of the spatial scope (like alerts of an 
accident out of the selected zone). 
 
4. Open Issues 
 
Despite the achieved efforts so far, a variety of open issues and research challenges still remain: 
• 
Naming Resolution and Naming Schemes: this is the most important challenge in NDN, since all 
functionalities are based on this feature (M. Amadeo et al., 2014). Routing is performed based on naming 
and may need a name resolution, which cannot be achieved with the current Domain Name System (DNS). 
Thus, a new resolution system is needed for vehicular communications via NDN. As for naming schemes, 
different ones have been proposed (e.g., human-readable, hash-based, flat, attribute-based, hierarchical and 
hybrid) but still don’t know exactly the best one for vehicular communications. 
• 
CS, PIT and FIB: NDN routers keep track of receiving Data packets, by caching them in their CS. However, 
CS memory space needs management strategies to efficiently and timely make available content to the 
consumers. PIT and FIB also need management since they receive any packet transmitted via any interface. 
Therefore, a lot of entries are passed by PIT and FIB structures and need rapid and effective searching 
strategies. 
• 
Routing: Routing strategies are in charge of forwarding Interest and Data between consumers and producers. 
Thus, efficient routing schemes are required to have a good Quality of Service (QoS) in high speed topologies 
like vehicular environments. 
• 
Security: Communication in vehicular networks is performed through wireless medium, and the wireless 
security framework needs management to face attacks, such as Interest flooding and cache poisoning. The 
definition and the development of signature schemes and key management methodology still an open 
challenge. 
We summarized the discussed issues in Figure 7.

5. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we have presented an overview of the research field NDN for Connected Vehicles. The overview 
introduced the Named Data Networking approach along with its details, as well as the use of this architecture in 
connected vehicles. From the research that has been carried out, we highlighted the open issues in vehicular 
communications over NDN. The discussed challenges include naming, routing, node structures management and 
finally security. Our future works will address these challenges, in order to enable vehicular communications and 
enhance road safety.

Abstract  
 
The study assessed the ability of Value Management (VM) to deliver sustainability in construction using 
a mini case study of two private constructions wherein VM was adopted. Interview with key participants 
in the VM exercise was conducted in order to get a view of the activities carried out during the exercise 
and to also ascertain the sustainability implication of these activities. The study revealed that although 
VM exercise carried out were done in a semi-formal manner, the outcome shows that the use of VM helps 
in achieving sustainability within the bottom line of economic, environmental and social sustainability. 
This it does through identifying and eliminating unnecessary areas that will affect the sustainability of the 
project. Also, new ideas that will help promote sustainability in the project can be harnessed from 
participants during the exercise. The study also revealed that the inability of professionals to work 
together and see problems from a common stand, and client’s unwillingness to fund separate gathering for 
VM exercise are major factors affecting VM. The study, therefore, recommends VM as a beneficial and 
sustainable project exercise, and advocates for its adoption as an integral part of sustainable construction 
within the country.

Introduction 
The call for sustainability in construction; a construction that satisfies the present needs without risking the ability to 
satisfy the needs of future generations, has necessitated the need for the use of innovative processes in the delivering 
construction works. One of such processes is Value Management (VM) which of recent is beginning to gain 
popularity among construction participants in developed and developing countries around the world.  VM was born 
in the late 1940s out of the fact that there was a shortage of products component as a result of the World War II. 
During this period, alternative components were sort for production, but as a result of the war, these sort alternatives 
were scarce. Thus, alternative methods were sort, in a bid to fulfill the function of the required components. The 
result of this was a reduction in cost of productions which did not jeopardize quality. It was observed that this 
system produced low-cost products without reducing quality. After the war, maintaining this approach seemed 
reasonable as it helped eliminate unnecessary cost and also improves the design. This was the beginning of value 
engineering (as it was called at the time), a process based on analysis of function (Palmer et al., 1996; Zimmerman 
and Hart, 1982). 
Studies have defined VM from different approach. The Office of Government Commerce (2007) defined VM as “a 
well-established methodology for defining and maximizing value for money”.  Construction Industry Board (1997) 
described it as a structured method designed to determine in specific terms what a client considers as value, in a bid 
to meet his needs by agreeing on the project objectives and establishing how best to achieve them. Oke and 
Ogunsemi (2013) defined “VM as a systematic and multi-disciplinary process directed towards analyzing the 
2442","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

a sustainable construction project is adopted from the onset of the VM exercise as suggested by Al-Saleh and Taleb 
(2010), then it can be assumed that higher sustainability criteria could be achieved. Findings of this research show 
that the application of VM exercise on a project has the tendency of achieving the core values of sustainability for 
such project. This is in tandem with Abidin and Pasquire (2005), Noor et al., (2015) and Oke et al., (2015). 
From the study, it is evident that normal VM workshop practice was not fully adopted as a semi-formal system was 
used in both cases. Reason for this was attributed to client’s unwillingness to fund a separate gathering for the 
exercise.  This further corroborates Ellis et al. (2003) assertion that there appears to be a trend towards reducing the 
duration of the VM workshop and reason for this includes reducing the cost for the client and limited amount of time 
busy professionals are able to dedicate to the process.

Conclusion 
This study set out to assess the ability of VM to deliver sustainable construction projects in Nigeria. Through the 
assessment of VM exercise conducted on two proposed construction projects, the study concludes that the use of 
VM in the delivery of construction projects will help in achieving the core values of sustainability for such project. 
Achieving economic, environmental and social sustainability can be possible through the use of VM practice as 
unnecessary areas that will affect the sustainability of the project can be identified early and eliminated accordingly. 
Also, new ideas that will help promote sustainability in the project can be harnessed from participants during the 
course of the exercise. However, the ability of professionals to work together and see problems from a common 
stand and client’s unwillingness to fund separate gathering for VM exercise was discovered to be the major factors 
affecting VM exercise. The study, therefore, recommends VM as a truly beneficial exercise in providing 
sustainability in any project, which is worth investing some time and effort in by both the government and private 
investors. Adopting VM as an integral part of construction projects (either small or large) will go a long way in 
achieving sustainability in such projects, thus achieving a sustainable environment.

Abstract 
 
Customer demands fulfillment is most important issue in supply chain management due to its long term 
effect on corporation performance. In most recent researches, it is assumed that prominent parameters 
such as customer demands are deterministic while supply chain design is a strategic decision and its effect 
last for long terms. Furthermore, an efficient supply chain must be designed to response uncertainties. 
One of the most important interruptions in supply chain is disruption during transportation among 
different layers. In this study, a three echelon supply chain consists of manufacturer, distribution centers 
and customers are considered so that disruption may occur in distribution layers while satisfying 
customers with fuzzy demand. The main objective of this model is to minimize the total cost of supply 
chain network. Here, a fuzzy mathematical model is developed and solved by GAMS software. The 
results show that the proposed model is able to cover this problem properly and finding optimal solution.

Abstract 
This paper tries to develop a closed-loop multi-period and multi-echelon supply chain model with the 
goal of maximizing profits and reducing the impact of environmental hazards. In this model, demand is 
considered stochastic. A model has been developed considering green supply chain network, to meet the 
potential customer demands by supplying them at different time. The proposed model includes forward 
and reverse direction. It consists of suppliers, facilities, distributors and first customers in the forward 
direction and disassembly, disposal, recycling, redistribution centers and second customers in the reverse 
one. A mixed integer nonlinear mathematical model is proposed and solved by exact method. In order to 
validate the proposed mathematical model, several samples are generated and solved using the GAMS 
software. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis has done on crucial parameters to assess model performance.

Abstract  
 
The aim of this research is to evaluate the operation of ceiling-based distribution (CBAD) systems and 
underfloor air-distribution (UFAD) systems and determine their effect on thermal comfort based on 
ceiling height. This research will help in understanding how the type of air conditioning system affects 
thermal comfort. The data, which are thermal comfort values, collected using a simulation program called 
FloVENT. Other tools such as predicted mean vote PMV tool and predicted percentage of dissatisfied 
PPD tool are used to collect the data. The main expected result of this research is that CBAD and UFAD 
systems improve thermal comfort of a building and lower its energy consumption. The findings from this 
research can be used by designers, engineers, manufacturers, contractors and home owners to design, 
develop and select the most appropriate heating and air-conditioning system to satisfy occupants 
throughout a building’s lifecycle. This not only benefits home developers, owners, and occupants but also 
contributes positively to the environment by saving energy and reducing the carbon footprint of housing.

6.2 Comfort condition with Ceiling Air Distribution System at (8ft) Ceiling Height 
The model shows the air temperature (68-69
) is not within the acceptable level of thermal comfort, as specified by 
the ASHRAE standard 55-2013 which is between 70
 and 80
. It can be clearly seen that at any given point, the 
air temperature is well outside the acceptable limit of the thermal comfort according to ASHRAE 55-2013. The 
Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), the PMV value is between (-1.8 & -3) which is outside the recommended range 
between (+0.5) and (-0.5) according to ASHRAE thermal sensation scale Table (4).  PMV variable can predict the 
percentage of occupants in the room who will be comfortable at a thermal condition. The Predicted Percentage of 
Dissatisfied (PPD) value is (30-40%) which is well outside the recommended acceptable PPD range for thermal 
comfort from ASHRAE 55 which is less than 10% occupants dissatisfied for an interior thermal space condition 
 
6.3 Comfort condition with Underfloor Air Distribution System at (10ft) Ceiling Height 
The variation of air temperature within the office space, when the air is supplied from an underfloor air distribution 
system is little above the limit. The acceptable level of thermal comfort, as specified by the ASHRAE standard 55-
2013 is between 70
 and 80
 It is seen here that the air temperature in the space is little above the limit of thermal 
comfort close to the ceiling and lighting fixtures, whereas the air temperature in the occupied space is (68-68.8
) 
which appear to be below the comfort level limit. The PMV value results between (-0.6 & -1.8), also the model 
shows that the office space is outside the recommended acceptable level specified by the ASHRAE thermal 
sensation scale table (4).  The PPD result is between (20-30%) show that more than 10% of the occupants are 
dissatisfied with the interior thermal space condition, which is doesn’t comply with the ASHRAE standards 55-
2103.  
 
6.4 Comfort condition with Ceiling Air Distribution System at (10ft) Ceiling Height 
The variation of air temperature within the office space, when the air is supplied form an underfloor air distribution 
system is shown in figure (28). The acceptable level of thermal comfort, as specified by the ASHRAE standard 55-
2013 is between 70
 and 80
 It is seen here that the air temperature in the space is (69
) outside the boundary 
of thermal comfort. The air temperature in the occupied space is below the comfort level boundary. The PMV value 
is between (-0.7& -3), and that the office space is outside the recommended satisfactory level specified by the 
ASHRAE thermal sensation scale table (4).  The PPD result is between (35-45%) also that more 10% of the 
occupants are dissatisfied with the interior thermal space condition, which is doesn’t comply with the ASHRAE 
standards 55-2103. 
 
 
7. Conclusion and Future Directions 
 
A thermal comfort study in an office space was presented, by conducting FloVent computational fluid dynamics 
(CFD) software method to model and simulate the thermal comfort conditions in the office space. In order to 
investigate the temperature distribution at each point across the room, air flow behavior, PMV and PPD values. 
Furthermore, thermal condition cases within the office space when it was underfloor air distribution system or when 
it was ceiling air distribution system. The thermal conditions (6.2), (6.3), and (6.4) is well outside the recommended 
limits that is specified by the ASHRAE 55-2013, and ASHRAE thermal sensation scale table (4). Nevertheless, in 
thermal condition (6.1) the temperature distribution is more uniform virtually throughout the office space, the level 
of thermal comfort falls within the acceptable recommended range according to ASHRAE standard. Moreover, the 
FloVent analysis show that altering ceiling height (lower ceiling 8ft) has significant impact when it comes to 
temperature distribution, and the level of thermal comfort in an office space by utilizing underfloor air distribution 
system. The table (5) below show the summary of the final results.

Abstract 
Reviewing of numerous studies on waste management suggests that it is affected by a wide variety of 
economic, social and environmental factors which are themselves the source of the complexity of existing 
issues and a systemic look in this direction. For this purpose, existing researches has been investigated 
which here some are classified and enclosed in three areas of life cycle assessment models, multi-criteria 
optimization models and decision making. Additionally, reviewed articles in this areas are referred to the 
benefits and limitations of each. The results of current paper shows that in the reviewed models, there is no 
model that considers all three dimensions of environmental, economic, and social sustainability for waste 
management simultaneously, as well as combining and integrating two or more models and applying them 
simultaneously to a problem. It is possible that the shortcomings and limitations of each method alone will 
be eliminated by complementary methods and will usually be more accurate in judgments.

Introduction 
Literature Classification System 
By reviewing the literature, the similarities and differences and the strengths and weaknesses of the various researches 
have been identified and the dominant research trend is revealed. Research gaps have also been revealed, and the 
problem can be defined with clear vision. Initially, as proposed by Chang et al. [1], we will consider two categories 
of decision-making techniques and decision making tools in this area: 
(1) System engineering models; and (2) systems assessment systems;

technique. The results show that the option of material recovery and burial of residues in land is an optimal method. 
Production of compost, RDF production, landfill, and burning without extraction of energy are the next priorities, 
respectively. According to the results of this study, as well as the benefits of recycling of materials, including access 
to raw materials, reduction of waste volume, less environmental impact, compensation of waste management costs 
with the sale of recycled materials, employment in the operator sector, sales and marketing of products, etc., it is 
suggested that urban managers focus and pay more attention to recycling. Table 2-3 summarizes multi-criteria decision 
making models in urban waste management. 
 
Conclusion 
This article examines some existing studies in the field of waste management, and researches in literature have been 
investigated according to the type of problem modeling. Examined articles are categorized in four areas of LCA 
models, optimization models, and MCDM models. Studies conducted in the LCA area can be categorized into several 
categories. In some studies, the researcher developed new models based on the LCA framework. Another category of 
studies in the literature of researchers is merely to evaluate and compare some of the different models in the LCA field 
of waste. Using LCA as a comparative environmental tool is another class of studies that is sometimes used to compare 
different waste processing technologies. In this research, just a review of these LCA models has been made. A review 
of optimization studies showed that comprehensive research in this field, both in terms of sustainability and in terms 
of technology, has not been carried out. Therefore, the research vacuum that is considered in the sustainable 
development environment while simultaneously considering all three dimensions of the economic, environmental, and 
social aspects of designing, modeling and optimizing waste recycling systems is felt. In addition to the comprehensive 
proposal vacuum, the lack of appropriate research for deciding on the optimal and sustainable use of solid urban waste 
in Iran is another significant point of this section. Studies in the framework of multi-criteria decision-making 
techniques have contributed to prioritizing and evaluating different waste processing technologies, as well as 
prioritizing and evaluating waste disposal sites for decision makers, as well as combining and combining AHP and 
fuzzy techniques and applying them together in the context of the AHP shortcomings and limitations, the fuzzy 
complement method is eliminated and usually results in more accuracy in judgments.

Abstract 
 
This article investigates the moderating effect of the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies on the 
relationship between Lean Supply Chain Management (LSCM) practices and supply chain performance 
improvement in the Brazilian industry. The study is based on a survey with manufacturing companies to 
capture the improvement of four supply chain performance indicators considering implementation level of 
seventeen LSCM practices, and ten digital technologies related to Industry 4.0. Data were analyzed 
through multivariate data analysis. Results indicate that the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies does 
moderate the relationship between LSCM practices and supply chain performance in Brazilian industry. 
However, this moderating effect does not occur at the same extent as expected. The investigation on the 
effect of the concurrent adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies with already established practices, such as 
LSCM ones, in manufacturing companies of emerging countries provides a deeper comprehension of the 
benefits and challenges to entail greater supply chain performance.

1. Introduction 
 
According to Frohlich and Westbrook (2001) and Krajewski et al. (2015), firms that present the highest likelihood of 
success are the ones that effectively link their internal processes with external customers and suppliers. The benefit 
obtained from linking internal processes with customer and suppliers reinforces the importance of a proper 
integration with suppliers and customers as a central element to improve competitiveness beyond the organizational 
boundaries (Flynn et al., 2010; Frazzon et al., 2015). In this sense, the establishment of an efficient Supply Chain 
Management (SCM), which comprises the flow of goods from supplier through manufacturing and distribution until 
the end user (Power, 2005), has been the focus of strategic discussion of several companies. 
The need for systemic improvement of SCM has been motivating the incorporation of Lean Production (LP) 
principles and practices (Tortorella et al., 2017a), which mainly aims at reducing waste and increasing quality 
according to customers’ perspective. Such actions called Lean Supply Chain Management (LSCM) are defined as a 
set of organizations that are directly linked by upstream and downstream flows of products, services, finances and 
information. The former ones work collaboratively aiming at the reduction of costs and waste, demonstrating in an 
efficient way what is necessary for customer's individual needs (Anand and Kodali, 2008; Vitasek et al., 2005).

illusion of achieving higher performance levels through the simple acquisition of technology and not by actually 
changing managerial habits and practices.  
Second, with regards to practical implications, our findings indicate that manufacturing companies in Brazil may 
still lack a systemic continuous improvement approach that integrates the whole value system, which is claimed to 
be the new frontier of LP (Hines et al., 2004). In other words, companies’ improvement initiatives tend to be 
myopic, providing changes on shop floor processes regardless their effect on supply chain, and vice-versa. 
Therefore, our research indicates the need for a holistic approach for implementing both Industry 4.0 and LSCM. In 
this sense, managers must find the right balance for change in order to successfully compete under this paradoxical 
scenario where technology and human-based simplicity must concurrently exist. With the support from advanced 
ICT on manufacturing, product development and service innovation processes along with a properly established 
LSCM, manufacturing companies can indeed move into new performance standards at a supply chain level. 
This research presents some drawbacks that must be highlighted. First, respondents were located in Brazil; their 
answers might thus be linked to geographical and cultural issues. That may be relevant since lean implementation 
has been claimed to be highly dependent on cultural characteristics. Thus, as this limitation restricts the results to 
this cultural condition, it also increases the certainty that they apply to those companies and to others in regions with 
similar characteristics. However, it is noteworthy the need for expanding the sample to other emerging countries 
with cultural similarities in order to provide a more robust findings that could be compared to developed economies’ 
context. Second, the data were collected from delegates of a specific Lean conference using a perceptual research 
instrument, which offers some limitations. Although the proper procedures have been carefully addressed to avoid 
possible sample biases, future work should consider the sample restriction and maybe conduct similar studies in a 
broader population. Regarding the perceptual research instrument, another limitation relies specifically on the supply 
chain performance indicators. Therefore, future studies could benefit from collecting actual supply chain data for 
this metrics.

Abstract 
Quality is a key element that can not be ignored in the competition and is one of the critical 
issues for the success of the company, including in the construction industry. On the other hand, 
if the quality management policy is not implemented or limited participation will both 
negatively affect the management of the project and competitiveness of the firms. This will also 
decrease the survival potential of construction firms within the industry. Achievement of 
performance can be better if the implementation of integrated quality management is supported 
by the company. Quality Control Circles (QCC) have been found to be a simple and productive 
technique of Total Quality Management (TQM) and proposed implementable in construction 
industry. This paper aims to influence of quality control circle implementation on company 
performance in construction industry. Regression is used to analyze the collaborative effect of 
the quality control circle on firm performance. Based on the analysis of the data obtained from 
the survey it was concluded that the quality control circle is an important and effective tool used 
to solve problems in the organization and can improve company’s performance.

1. Introduction
The development of industry in quality management during the 1980s further led to the principles of
business internationally through integrated quality management (Robin et all, 1993). Improved quality in 
product, service and management aspects can bring the organization to survive in the global business 
environment (Tjiptono et all, 2001). Basic principle behind quality control circle are to contribute for 
improvement & development of organization, to exercise human capability fully & explore hidden 
capabilities and to respect humanity & build a worth while to live in happy positive environment (Rajesh & 
Lalit, 2012). The impact of quality control circle on employees and organizations has become very 
important to improve the company's capability to achieve conformity and maintain competitiveness 
(Chitra, 2013). Quality control circle is also way of retaining the workforce & enhances their motivation, 
morale & desire to work for the organization but also increases the satisfaction level of the employee by 
which employer can gain trust & commitment from the employees (Poonam, 2014). One of the successes 
of industrialization in Japan is the effective application of quality control circle. Because of this, a number 
of developed and emerging industrial countries including Indonesia are implementing quality control circle 
in industrial companies to improve quality, productivity and competitiveness (Directorate General of Small

Abstract 
Air cargo in African countries plays a relevant role in developing intra-African trade and enhancing 
economic prosperity. Unlike its great potential and expansion in foreign countries, Africa remains the 
weakest region worldwide. In 2016, according to ICAO’s forecast, scheduled air traffic Compound 
Average Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) in Africa will reach 2.2 percent Freight Tonne Kilometre (FTK) 
by 2042 while world air cargo will grow over the next years by 4.2 percent per year.  Despite of several 
researches related to airfreight industry little have analysed the factors influencing the growth of African 
air cargo market. This paper aims to fill a gap of literature by identifying the factors leading the 
development of African air traffic. Moreover, an insight is provided into the actual five cities 
concentrating the intra-African network namely, Cairo, Johannesburg, Nairobi, Addis Ababa, and Lagos. 
The results and interpretations have a significant importance for aviation stakeholders who aim to 
enhance airfreight’s flow in African markets.

1. Introduction 
There is a close statistical correlation between the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and growth in world air 
cargo (Boeing, 2017). In 2015, global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) slowed to around 3 percent and consequently 
dragged down all mode of freight transport, particularly air cargo transportation. Since the global economic 
recession of 2009, airfreight has struggled to ensure a positive’s growth rate. However, according to recent forecasts 
from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
positive outlook is expected through 2035 at a rate of 4.2 percent annually (Djibo, B., 2017). Hence, world air cargo 
will more than double over the next 20 years. Despite of the low cost prices offered by maritime sector, air transport 
remains the reliable and speed solution to transport a high value goods (Boeing, 2017), as it accounts less than 1 
percent of world trade tonnage which represents around 35 percent of world trade value. In spite of the on-going 
challenges related to air cargo, fundamental growth factors remain in place in order to increase markets’ 
connectivity across the continents (ICAO, 2015). Boeing has reported in 2017, that markets linked to Asia will lead 
the growth of all other regions, especially African ones. Even if Europe is Africa’s principal air trade partner, 
because of its proximity, Asia air trade with Africa will reach 14.4 percent, as the region especially China has built 
strong commercial ties with intraregional Africa at a rate of 12.9 percent. 
In 2017, Vladimir Zubkov as a secretary general of The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA) argued that 
“once the air cargo traffic in a country increases by one per cent, then trade grows by 6.3 percent”. To enhance air 
cargo traffic in Africa, the continent is implementing free trade agreements in order to liberalize market access 
(Boeing, 2017). However, according to African Airlines Association, in 2017 the countries have not fully 
implemented the Yamoussoukro Decision (YD) which has aimed to open skies across the continent. Coupled with 
2450","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

The aviation in African market is a vigorously growing sector of the global regions, as the continent is home of 
15.96 percent of the world’s population across 54 countries  with a large land mass, almost 60 percent of world’s 
uncultivated land. As argued by Dr. Elijah Chingosho, AFRAA Secretary General, airline industry has grown after a 
huge recession during the 2008-2009 and owed to enhance air cargo demand. However, African airfreight’s share 
stills the weakest in the world. The major barrier impeding its growth is the incomplete implementation of 
Yamoussoukro liberalization. The skies have not been fully opened to improve connectivity, sustain accessibility, 
and facilitate airlines’ consolidation. On the one hand, full deregulation of African Market should be complemented 
for instance by high security and facilitation standards as the use of single window, sufficient infrastructure by 
relying on PIDA program. It can be also complemented by adopting several programs for safety oversight 
assessments and coming up with new policies as Bali agreement on trade facilitation aiming to boost e- commerce 
and clearance of goods, or Cape Town Convention consisting on facilitating financing and acquisition of assets. In 
addition, implementation of drones can be more effective than airplanes to reinvent trade. One the other hand, the 
factors affecting adversely air market as argued by Dr. Elijah Chingosho are terrorist attacks within African 
countries, high taxes and fees, and high fuel price. Furthermore, protectionism, lack of cooperation between African 
airlines, and low implementation of e- freight hindered significantly cargo growth. 
 
5. Conclusion 
African aviation has experienced several policies leading to liberalise intra-African air transport market. The partial 
implementation of Yamoussoukro Decision (YD) has impacted adversely Aviation industry among the continent. As 
a result, although air traffic flows have grown significantly, numerous challenges have hampered industry’s 
development, such as regulatory restrictions, high fares, inadequate infrastructure, lack of safety and facilitation, and 
poor security. Adds to these constraints, African Airlines’ behaviour has been affected: while intra-African routes 
have been widely consolidated, small aircraft routes have been abandoned and some African carriers have built new 
hubs such as Egypt Air, Royal Air Maroc, South African Airways (SAA), Ethiopian Airlines and Kenya Airways. 
The development of hubs has been successful in Eastern and Southern Africa, than in Central and Western the 
continent. Hence, regional traffic distribution has been characterized by a notable imbalance. Beyond those serving 
the market , namely Cairo and Johannesburg, strengthening , development of further competing hubs especially of 
cargo activity within the continent will play a vital role in enhancing air cargo industry and creating a stronger 
market at regional and international level.

Abstract   
 
This study was inspired by an organization that has been experiencing delays coupled with cost 
constraints and quality management issues in the execution of its projects. A research was therefore 
conducted to investigate the efficiency and effectiveness of project execution in the organization using a 
qualitative research approach. The research targeted population were all stakeholders in management 
involved in execution of projects. The study sample was nine participants selected using non-probability 
purposive sampling and data was collected using semi-structured interviews. The research results showed 
that correct project management processes were being followed during project execution, however 
processes implementation was not efficient, communication channels were ineffective, stakeholders were 
not engaged, resource distribution was ineffectively done leaving other projects with shortages of 
material. The study revealed that there was lack of skills and training programs resulting in costly 
corrective measures, lack of monitoring and controlling, risk management is not done effectively, 
contractors are not well managed, while leadership is experienced differently in various sections. Right 
processes are needed to ensure right governance in the organisation’s execution of projects.

1. Introduction  
The implementation of project management helps in creating strategic value chains that enable an organisation to 
have competitive advantage in high-risk sectors and international markets. The ability to execute projects on time 
within a specific budget, often determines if a company will be able to get other business opportunities. Efficiency 
and effectiveness are concepts frequently used in the evaluation of different processes. Project Execution is a 
department responsible for the execution of the case study organisation’s new expansion projects, refurbishment and 
betterment programmes.  Its primary functions include project management and contracts management. There are 
various support service departments such as Project Services and Contracts management that support Project 
Execution. Based on the analysis of the organisation’s rolling plan there is an indication that the Asset Under 
Construction (AUC) balance for the 2017 financial year is higher than that of 2016 which means there are more 
projects that were incomplete and past their completion date and need to be carried over to the next financial year. 
This will subsequently result in an increase in costs on the projects that will in turn affect the overall execution of 
the projects and delivery of customer service. The objective of this study was to explore the factors contributing to

experience in the field. As a result the project leader will lead a project that is beyond his capability. Participant I 
also mentioned job rotation, if everything has been done according to the processes, a project handover shouldn’t be 
a problem because everything would have been documented. When the manager of a company is unable to provide 
direction, training, motivation, coaching for staff, the organizational culture and moral suffer. Poor leadership can 
produce negative effects on the company and employees (Kokemuller, 2017). According to Selnes (2015) effective 
project management is about achieving objectives successfully by planning and organising resources.  
 
4.5 Research Question 2: What recommendations can be made to the case study organisation to ensure that 
efficiency and effectiveness is achieved in project execution 
 
Stakeholder engagement: The case study organisation needs to involve all relevant stakeholders and 
prioritise them accordingly. Stakeholder analyses need to be done before the project can commence.  
 
Distribution and utilisation of resources: Resource distribution becomes cardinal when there are limited 
resources. For project management to achieve efficiency all contributors should collaborate.  
 
Skills development programmes: Employees need to attend refresher courses so that they are inclined with 
the evolving technologies and competent when executing their work.  
 
Change management on projects: There should be continuous monitoring, progress reports and forecasting 
that must take place during all the phases of the project to ensure risk mitigation is done effectively.   
 
Open regular communication channels: Honest and clear communication channels must be created for 
internal and external stakeholders during all the phases of the project. 
 
Code of conduct: Strong ethical inductions and systems that address staff on ethics and code of conduct 
need to be implemented to ensure that the company is safe guarded against unethical behaviour and culture. 
This will address the shortcomings of the culture of lack of accountability that exists within job roles.  
 
4.6 Conclusion 
Several factors have been identified that influence the efficiency and effectiveness of project execution in the case 
study organisation.  Some of these contributing factors are related to planning and others to the execution of 
projects:  
 
Inadequate and inefficient communication within project teams and the organizational environment.  
 
Lack of relevant stakeholder’s involvement and management.  
 
Improper allocation and usage of resources.  
 
Shortage of skills, training and development of project team.  
 
Organisational culture not supportive of completing projects on time.  
 
Poor leadership within the project management unit. 
In conclusion, the point of departure is that projects that do not learn the lessons from previous failures could be 
destined to failure in repeating the same errors. The case study organisation must ensure that project post-mortems 
form part of the key elements in the project methodology to avoid the same pitfalls.

Abstract  
 
In order to balance an assembly line one has to deal with different concerns as to the way to distribute 
operations to achieve takt times. Nowadays the complexity of assembly operations don’t allow the 
company to maintain a work balance, which affects the inequity of the workstations’ time and also 
generates non value added activities that is reflected in the total cycle time. The manufacturing plant of 
this study manually produces bus chassis, and has two assembly lines: urban chassis (UC) and foreign 
chassis (FC). The purpose of this research paper is to decrease the operator headcount 20% and to 
increase de value added to 59% in the assembly line. In order to achieve this paper’s main objective, the 
research team used a Lean Six Sigma approach and DMAIC methodology. The activities completed were 
generating a balance proposal with the reduction or elimination of non value added activities through 
Kaizens. This paper is relevant for operations management professionals since it represents one of the 
most studied issues in manufacturing assembly lines, and provides an integrated approach combining 
different tools to solve this problem in a multinational company. 
 
Keywords  
Chassis, value added, line balancing, DMAIC, Lean Six Sigma.  
 
1. Introduction  
 
A value added activity is considered any activity which changes the physical form of the chassis and the non-value 
added activities are the ones that include any activity that presents itself in the form of a waste within the production 
process. Most of the non-value added activities are a part of the unbalanced utilization of the operators, in order to 
solve this problem, the investigation team worked with Kaizens, Six Sigma and projects and the line balancing. This 
particular methodology has been used in manufacturing enterprises, which have the same issue under different 
circumstances, for example having a high variability of the product. An unbalanced assembly line is a very common 
issue in manufacturing enterprises and it has been studied from different perspectives, but the common ground that 
each of them have is that they have is that they approach this issue through the elimination/reduction of the non-
value added activities to then proceed to balancing the line. This project consists in the assembly of the crossbar of 
the chassis all the way through the assembly of the various harness and combustion lines, taking in consideration the 
first four work teams. Which will be named Team 1, Team 2, Team 3 and Team 4. And 11 work stations and 5 sub-
assembly workstations. 
 
2. Methodology  
 
DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control) is part of the Six Sigma approach. This process is very 
important in six sigma process because it is what helps bring a diverse team together. This is what helps them 
complete a process or model so that they can share their work and get the job done. (Patel Rumana &, Darshak A. 
Desai, 2014). Therefore, the research team used this methodology to develop an improvement in the process.

4.1 Objectives Compliance  
The general objective of this project is to increase the percentage of the Value Added activities from the 43% to 
58% and reduce the headcount by 20%. Which would be fulfilled by means of the fulfillment of the particular 
objectives that are the balancing activities in the production of the models: MBO, OF, OH and IBC and determine 
the necessary headcount for the production of 20 chassis per shift. Both particular objectives are shown in the 
balancing proposal for each model. In addition to the balancing of the activities and the reduction of the headcount, 
the improvements made of Kaizens, are a factor that helped to increase the added value, increasing from 43% to 
48% with the implementation of the improvements and the balancing of activities for the OH pilot model, achieving 
a 59% value added when implementing the improvements in the remaining models. In the same way, when carrying 
out the balancing for the OH model, it was possible to reduce the headcount of the company by 20%, from 41 
workers to 32.  
 
5. Control 
5.1 Control Tools  
 
Standard Work Instruction  (SWI) 
As part of the activities documentation about the activities involved into the process, the research team used the 
control tool named for the company as Standard Work Instruction (SWI)  
 
Internal Audit 
As a part of the compliance implementation of the new process, the research team implemented a new control 
process named internal audit. This audit must be taken one time during the month with the objective to ensure that 
the improvements implemented are taking a correct way and do not need to be moved in the four workstation 
studied. The people included in the audit process will be the responsibilities of the compliance of the process 
control, these people are: The team leader, Continuous Improvement Coordinator,  and the Process Owner; taking as 
a consideration the next points: Takt Time Compliance, Operator template compliance for each workstation (based 
on the balancing proposal), Process compliance, based on the balancing proposal, Revision of the operator walking 
into their workstation.  
6. Conclusions 
 
The line balancing is fundamental for a manufacturing company because by equalizing the work times in all the 
stations, different benefits can be obtained. During this project, different tools of the Lean Six Sigma methodology 
were carried out that helped to reduce or eliminate the waste founded in the line and then achieve the balancing of 
all the activities. By implementing Kaizens for each of the teams, the reduction of 28.06% of the activities that were 
not adding value within the line was achieved, in the same way, with the software of TimerPro, a comparison was 
made with the previous analysis established, where the Yamazumi for the OH pilot model showed favorable results, 
as the reduction of times in jobs that were outside the Takt Time from 16 to 6, a decrease in Lead Time to 5.7 hours, 
increase of added value and a reduction of the headcount in a 20%. For the missing models, a balancing proposal 
was made. After implementing the improvements for the models and making the implementation of the balancing 
proposal for the pilot model, the general objective was completed, reaching a percentage of value added of 59% and 
a headcount reduction of 20%.

Abstract 
 
In this research, a practical approach to estimating demand function for pricing optimization and seat 
inventory allocation of intercity passenger railway services was developed. Willingness-to-pay approach 
was used for estimating demand. Demand for the service was estimated from choice-based conjoint data 
using hierarchical Bayes estimation method. The proportion of customers willing to buy a certain service 
was estimated using market simulation. Monotonic cubic spline interpolation was used to estimate the 
price-response function. The size of maximum demand achievable was estimated from sales data. The 
approach was implemented to the largest intercity passenger train service in Indonesia. Two customer 
segments were assumed, i.e. business and leisure passengers, with four fare classes. Our first optimization 
problem sought to determine optimal capacity allocation for the existing fare classes. The second 
optimization problem aimed to determine optimal fare and the corresponding optimal capacity allocation 
for each fare class. Solution to the nonlinear pricing optimization problem was obtained using 
enumeration. Subsequently, the popular Expected Marginal Seat Revenue-a (EMSR-a) heuristic was used 
for the seat allocation inventory problem.

1. Backgrounds 
Research on the implementation of revenue management (RM) in intercity passenger railway services is not as much 
as those in airlines industry. Ciancimino et al. (1999) developed a multi-leg single-fare RM model to determine 
optimal booking limits for passenger train services. The optimization problem was modeled using probabilistic 
nonlinear programming to incorporate demand uncertainty. Terabe and Ongprasert (2006) developed linear 
programming models to show that seat allocation can improve revenue while at the same time improve load factor 
and rejected request. You (2008) developed a railway seat allocation model using nonlinear programming. Bharill 
and Rangaraj (2008) developed a revenue maximization model for a premium segment of passenger train services 
which accommodate cancellation and overbooking. The model used information about demand elasticity and 
cancellation fraction from past data to come up with proposed cancellation fee that will maximize revenue. Qian and 
Shuai (2014) developed a dynamic programming model to solve seat allocation problem in a dedicated passenger 
line by considering passenger’s preference order. In all of the above research, demand functions were assumed such 
that they fitted the optimization model, instead of being developed based on a robust consumer demand theory. 
Ciancimino et al. (1999) and You (2008) asummed probabilistic demand with known means and variances, while 
Terabe and Ongprasert (2006), and Bharill and Rangaraj (2008) assumed deterministic demand using historical past. 
Qian and Shuai (2014) used a different approach for demand by assuming it follows a Poisson process.

Motivated by this observation, another optimization was run to seek optimal fares without an upper bound on tariff. 
Using Equations 13, 14, 15, and 17, the optimization resulted in optimal fares of Rp225,000, Rp200,000, 
Rp120,000, and Rp85,000 with total revenue of Rp21,365,000. This was a 20% increase compared to the revenue 
with upper-bounded optimal fares. Table 4 shows the protection levels and booking limits for these unbounded 
optimal fares.

In March 2018, in addition to the existing four, the company launched a fare class of Rp200,000 with luxurious 
coach for Argo Parahyangan train. There are two trains in a day that have this new fare class, each of which has two 
coaches of this type. These coaches are always sold out. This confirmed the results of the optimization models in 
this research. 
 
4. Conclusions and Future Works 
This research developed optimization models for pricing and seat allocation of intercity passenger train services. An 
approach to estimating one of the most important component of the model, the demand function, based on consumer 
demand theory was proposed. The HB estimation method, which provides utility estimates at individual level, 
coupled with market simulation have been a practical and flexible yet accurate way for deriving demand functions. 
The practicality is due to the availability of software for designing the questionnaire, administering the online 
survey, estimating the utilities, simulating the market scenario, and estimating the demand function. The flexibility 
comes from the market simulation which can imitate any competitive scenario and estimate how the market will 
react accordingly. It is also claimed to be more accurate since the utilities are estimated at individual level and the 
demand function is interpolated straightforward as the simulation output suggests without assuming any a priori 
demand function. The disadvantage of using the approach proposed in this paper is when it comes to the pricing 
optimization. Since the approach does not result in an explicit demand function, analytical solution is impossible. To 
some extent, enumeration is possible, but for larger problem, this will be cumbersome. 
 
The implementation of the approach in a case study of intercity passenger train service has shown the efficacy of the 
approach. From the protection levels and booking limits implied by the current fares, it could be inferred that the 
current fares were too low. The pricing optimization with imposing upper bound on tariff resulted in an increase in 
average fare, but the corresponding protection levels and booking limits suggested that the fares were still too low. 
Optimization without upper bound on tariff resulted in an estimated 20% increase in revenue.  
 
Despite its efficacy, a few details on the implementation are still worth noting i.e. determining the appropriate 
satiating price, assumption regarding the probability distribution of price, and the size of the problem when the 
number of segment becomes a decision variable. This research assumed that the demand function was deterministic. 
In fact, the shares of preference from the market simulation were probabilistic. Hence, a more realistic approach to 
the pricing optimization problem would be assuming probabilistic demand. The research also assumed that there 
was no cancellation. Modeling approach to relaxations regarding these assumptions would be the future research 
agenda.

Abstract  
 
Mobile production in India has already crossed the 100-million-units mark, and is set to touch 500 million 
in the next two years. Reverse supply chain logistics, means mobility of goods from end consumers 
towards core manufacturer in the channel of product distribution. In the turbulent business environment, 
the companies must promote alternative uses of resources that may be cost-effective and ecology friendly 
by extending products’ routine life cycles. Reveres logistics activities i.e. storing, transporting and 
handling of used products poses a great challenge to reverse logistics managers as there is always chances 
of uncertainty in terms of quantity, quality and timing of return of EOL products in case of reverse supply 
chains. In the present work problem related to recovery of used cell phones is formulated by various 
MCDM approaches namely MOORA (multi-objective optimization by ratio analysis), SWARA (step-
wise weight assessment ratio) and WASPAS (weighted aggregated sum product assessment). SWARA 
method is used to find the criterion weight of alternative and the other methods such as MOORA and 
WASPAS is used to give the rankings of alternatives and chooses the best alternative from the rest. All 
known multi-attribute methods cannot value the attribute weights as one weight of attribute is higher or 
lower significant than the other attribute, SWARA allows expert opinion about significance ratio of the 
attributes in the process of rational decision determination. In WASPAS method, we combine the 
subjective weight expressed by decision makers with objective weights to obtain more realistic weights 
which help to increase the stability of the proposed approach. This approach is efficient and well 
consistent with other methods. MOORA method is a general method and can consider any number of 
quantitative and qualitative attributes simultaneously and offer a more objective and simple decision 
making-approach. The present approach links the financial and nonfinancial, tangible and intangible, 
internal and external factors, thus providing a holistic framework for the selection of an alternative for the 
reverse logistics operations for EOL cell phones. Many criteria, sub-criteria, determinants, etc. for the 
selection of reverse manufacturing options are interrelated. Thus, MCDM methods proposed in this paper 
provides a more realistic and accurate representation of the problem for conducting remanufacturing 
logistics operations for EOL cell phones in Indian business environment.

Step 2: Starting from the second criterion, the respondent expresses the relative importance of criterion j in relation 
to the previous (j-1) criterion, for each particular criterion. According to Kersuliene et al. (2010), this ratio is called 
the Comparative importance of average value, Sj.

7. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Ranking of alternatives was performed applying WSM, WPM methods, a joint criterion of weighted aggregation of 
the latter methods such as WASPAS, also the ratio system and the reference point approach as a part of MOORA. 
Nine series of ranks were calculated, respectively. It has been proved that the most preferable alternative depended 
on λ value when applying a joint weighted method WASPAS. Alternative C was ranked as the best and alternative 
G remained in the second place when λ=0.5. Alternative D was ranked as worst alternative for conducting reverse 
logistics operation in the integrated supply chain. MOORA method consisting of the ratio system and the reference 
point approach has also applied in the selection of 3PRLSP in the present study. The best ranked alternative

decisions coincided in the current case as alternative C was ranked as best and alternative A was ranked as second 
and alternative D was considered as worst for conducting reverse logistics operation for the mobile phone company. 
 
Reliability of the joint criterion was tested and verification of results was performed when comparing it to MOORA. 
It was proved that WASPAS results coincided with the ratio system MOORA. The SWARA method has a powerful 
and logical perspective for decision and policy-making because priorities have different dimensions, such as politics, 
culture, and so on. In this study SWARA is applied in the process of decision-making for evaluating the weights and 
priorities of criteria. SWARA result can be verified as the summation of criteria weights comes out to be one.

Abstract 
 
Inventory is the products which are stocked for to fulfill the demand in the future. Here the problem may occurrs if 
the demand of the item is intermittent, since the inventory policy is difficult to be determined due to the uncertain 
demand of the item that has high error rate in the prediction. This problem is occurred in the spare part needs of 
Company X. Therefore, a joint replenishment method, can-order policy that has multiple can-order level (si, cij, Sij), 
can be implemented to coordinate the order of some different items. A non-linear integer programming model, 
which can be categorized as NP-hard problem, is used to handle the problem. The contribution of this paper is on the 
use of the approach on the real case which never done before. A metaheuristic approach, simulated annealing, is 
applied to find a satisfied solution with a fast computation time. Global criterion method is also used to reach the 
multi-objective function, which are to minimize total inventory cost and number of carriers shipped by supplier. 
According to experiment done with 3 suppliers and 157 items, the result obtained is better than the existing 
condition in Company X with number of carrier reduction of 2.6% and cost saving of 14.43% or equal to $ 
81,570.79.

1. Introduction 
An effective inventory control, which includes the activity of deciding what to order, how much to order, and when 
to order, can give an important role related to the supply chain management of the company. Generally, inventory 
control is implemented to reduce the cost of investment, such as holding cost, order cost, and purchasing cost, and 
also to increase the customer service level by avoiding shortage. 
The strategy to determine the inventory control policy is based on the demand classification, which can be 
categorized as smooth, erratic, intermittent, or lumpy [1]. Problem that occurred in item with intermittent demand is 
the difficulty in determining the right inventory control policy, since it has uncertain demand pattern that is difficult 
to be predicted. 
 
This problem also arises in the spare part needs of Company X. Company X is known as one of the aluminum 
smelter company in Indonesia. To maintain the reliability of the production machine, the company needs to 
implement a maintenance strategy. One of the action done regarding to the maintenance strategy is to do preventive 
maintenance, which needs spare part as the supporting components of the machines. When the stock of spare part is 
not available, the maintenance activity cannot be done until there is a sufficient stock of spare part available. This 
condition can lead to the delay in production process, which can make the customer demand cannot be fulfilled. This 
indicates the importance of spare part inventory control in Company X, which currently has the responsibility to 
control 14,000 types of item. 
 
It is found from the fact that 61% of mechanical parts needed in 2018 are classified into intermittent demand, in

Abstract 
This study investigated the potential to harvest biogas from tea waste as a resource recovery and 
waste management initiative. The tea waste was shredded to a particle size of less than 2.5 mm 
and anaerobically digested over a period of 30 days in 10-L digesters. The composition of biogas 
obtained was 60% to 65% methane with a yield of 0.2 L/g of tea waste feedstock. A reduction in 
the tea waste chemical oxygen demand and volatile solids composition by more than 50% 
indicated that optimal tea waste digestion had occurred. The tea waste digestate was rich in 
nitrogen (4.5%), phosphorous (0.6%), and potassium (4.6%) and could potentially be adopted as a 
biofertilizer. Biogas and biosolids can be generated from tea waste as a waste to resource 
initiative.

1. Introduction
Agriculture and food bio wastes present an opportunity for conversion into biogas, a source of renewable 
energy, through anaerobic digestion (Sau et al., 2014; Jauke et al., 2015; Kader et al., 2015; Maile et al., 
2017; Manyuchi et al., 2017; Wannapokin et al., 2017). Biogas is an odorless and colorless gas that has an 
ignition temperature of 650 °C to 750 °C, a calorific value of 20 MJ/m3, and burns at approximately 60% 
efficiency (Ziauddin and Rajesh, 2015). Biogas presents an opportunity as an alternative fuel for heating 
and cooking purposes as well as combined power generation and has been increasingly been recommended 
for adoption as a renewable source of energy. Figure 1 shows the biogas production process as well as the 
potential energy generation and uses. Biogas production is mainly conducted under mesophilic conditions

3.6.3 Effect on K 
As the tea waste digestion period increased to 30 days, the potassium content increased by about 24.2% 
(Figure 7). As the wet digestion period increases, there is potential for extraction of the water soluble and 
exchangeable potassium to the digestate hence the increase in the potassium composition.  
Figure. 7. Effect of anaerobic digestion on potassium content 
3.7 Tea Waste Digestate (Bio solids) Composition 
The final digestate (bio solids) from the tea waste was rich in nitrogen (4.12% to 4.79%), phosphorous 
(0.56% to 0.73%), and potassium (3.65% to 4.62%) content with potential to be used as a bio fertilizer. 
Nearly similar results were reported by Davis et al. (2012) when they quantified the potential of harnessing 
bio solids from sewage sludge digestate. The NPK results for the digestate were also in line with results 
reported by Makadi et al. (2012) who reported that the NPK composition for anaerobic digestate was 
4.27%, 0.66% and 4.71% respectively. 
The COD and VS in the tea waste was reduced 53% and 57%, respectively, which indicated that the 
efficient digestion of the tea waste to biogas and biosolids occurred. The physicochemical characteristics of 
the final digestate are given in Table 3. Biosolids from anaerobic digestion have also been reported to be a 
potential fertilizer by several authors (Sau et al., 2014; Jauke et al, 2015).

Abstract 
The potential to produce biogas and bio hydrogen from corn residue was investigated. A sample of 
10g initially hydrothermally treated to liberate the cellulose and hemicellulose rich hydrolysate. Three 
steps for treatment at 80 ◦C for 15 min; 180 ◦C for 40 min and 190 ◦C and 10 min were investigated 
for corn residue conversion to soluble sugars. The highest cellulose yield was 0.356g per gram of corn 
residues through fermentation and 0.312g of bio hydrogen per gram of corn residues. An industrial 
process for the co-generation of biogas and bio-hydrogen from corn stover was then proposed from 
the experimental work.

1. Introduction 
The demand of hydrogen and biogas as a source of energy is increasing daily and this has led to various studies 
on their generation from lignocellulosic material like waste corn stover (Kaparaju et al., 2009; Mtui, 2009; 
Bensha and Mensah, 2013). Considering the issue of waste management into bioenergy necessitated this study 
whereby a process that produces bio-hydrogen and biogas from corn stover was designed through the 
identification of optimal operating conditions (Mussatto and Teixeira, 2010; Toscana et al., 2013; Singh et al., 
2015). Bio enery is any energy derived from biomass and potential products include biogas, bio briquettes, bio 
hydrogen and biogas.

hydrolysate was the main focus for bio-hydrogen production and cellulose was the main focus for the biogas 
production. A centrifugation technique was applied for the separation of the hydrolysate and the cellulose. 
 
Bio-hydrogen production 
The hydrolysate was then fed into a fermenter where it went through dark fermentation whereby the organic 
substrate was converted to bio -hydrogen after bacteria (Clostridium Thermocellum) was added. The 
temperature was maintained below 60 °C for the bacteria to not be affected and for dark fermentation to work 
effectively. The gas was then collected using a gas syringe. The effluent was then added into the bio-digester for 
more biogas production. 
 
Biogas production 
For the biogas production, there were two streams that were fed into the bio-digester. The main stream contained the 
cellulose that was hydrolyzed using sodium bicarbonate then went through fermentation, and was then later fed into 
the bio-digester where the bacteria (methanogens) was added for the production of biogas. The other stream that was 
fed into the bio-digester was from the bio-hydrogen effluent stream. The gas was then collected using the gas 
syringe equipment. The effluent from the bio-digester was de-watered then burnt or used as fertilizer. The water was 
then chlorinated for treatment to be recycled back into the system or disposed of into main streams. 
  
4. Conclusion 
Lignocellulosic biomass, such as corn stover, can be used as a raw material for bio-hydrogen and biogas. 
Enzymatic hydrolysis and subsequent fermentation of cellulose should yield biogas, while the dark fermentation 
of hydrolysate to produce bio-hydrogen from sugars. Temperatures of around 180 °C resutlsts in biogas yield of 
70% aand bio-hydrogen yield of 47%

Abstract 
Currently, many developing countries are facing fuel challenges while corn stover waste remains 
unutilized. This study utilized excess corn Stover to make bioethanol a value added product by 
designing a plant that manufactures 150 tons per day of 99.5% pure cellulosic bioethanol 
operating over a 10-year period. The process that converted crude corn Stover to cellulosic 
bioethanol was evaluated for conversion via hydrolysis of lignocelluloses in the corn Stover then 
the cofermentation of the Carbon 5 and Carbon 6 monosaccharides obtained from the hydrolysis 
process. The hydrolysis process is a route to the bioethanol through 86% co-fermentation of 
Carbon 5 and Carbon 6 sugars obtained from the 75% saccharification of corn Stover to 
fermentable sugars to produce 99.5% pure cellulosic bioethanol that can be used to blend petrol. 
The economic analyses indicated a payback period of 1.5 years, a rate of return on investment of 
86%, and a selling price of $1.10/liter for the bioethanol that indicated the feasibility of the 
project. Waste corn Stover to bioethanol technology can be applied as a waste management tool 
to meet energy demands in agro-based industries.

The NPV for this project was $13,746,931.76, since the net present value is positive it means that the 
present value of cash inflows is greater than the present value of cash outflows, thus the investment 
proposal is acceptable. 
 
5.14 Rate of return 
The rate of return refers to the annual income from an investment expressed as a proportion (usually a 
percentage) of the original investment, shown in Eq. 2, 
𝑅ܽݐ݁ ݋݂ ݎ݁ݐݑݎ݊= ܥݑ݉ݑ݈ܽݐ݅ݒ݁ ݊݁ݐ ܿܽݏℎ ݂݈݋ݓ ܽݐ ݐℎ݁ ݁݊݀ ݋݂ ݌ݎ݋݆݁ܿݐ

… … . . ሺʹሻ 
and the internal rate of return (IRR) was calculated by Eq. 3, 
𝐼݊ݐ݁ݎ݈݊ܽ ݎܽݐ݁ ݋݂ ݎ݁ݐݑݎ݊ ሺ𝐼𝑅𝑅ሻ=
ሺܥܽݏℎ ݂݈݋ݓ − 𝐼݊݅ݐ݈݅ܽ ܿ݋ݏݐሻ
𝐼݊݅ݐ݈݅ܽ ܿ݋ݏݐ
… … … … … … ሺ͵ሻ 
Where the cash flow was $1,346,931 and the initial cost was $10,975,717.72. The IRR of this project was 
25.2%, which is a value greater than the cost of capital (discount rate of 10%). Therefore, the decision is to 
go ahead with the project. 
5.15 Breakeven analysis 
The breakeven point is the point at which the income from sale of a product or service equals the invested 
costs, resulting in neither profit nor loss. It is the stage at which income equals expenditure, shown in Eq. 4, 
ܤݎ݁ܽ݇݁ݒ݁݊ ݌݋݅݊ݐ=

Where the contribution margin is the selling price minus the variable costs. Based on this, the contribution 
margin for this project was 15,000 tons.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The production of 150 tons per day of cellulosic bioethanol from corn stover is technically and 
economically feasible as a waste management technology while meeting energy needs. The designed plant 
will be innovative because it optimizes the process by allowing the co-fermentation of C5 and C6 sugars to 
obtain a substantial yield of cellulosic bioethanol from corn stover selling at $1.1/L.

Abstract  
 
The common definition used in the literature for the term ""risk"" is the probability of occurrence of an 
unwanted event/incident within a certain period of time. A comprehensive risk analysis is necessary for 
the identification of these unwanted events/occurrences, calculation of the severity degree of the 
concerned risk and determination of whether the risk is tolerable or not. While risk analysis is a must for 
all organizations, irrespective of the scale of organizations, the type of the enterprise is the determinant of 
the type of the risk analysis to be performed and accordingly the methodology to be used and 
development of the solutions for risks. In the case of healthcare organizations, risk analysis practices 
require special diligence, as it is very important for the health and safety of both patients and employees. 
For this reason, selection of the right methodology to be applied, correct identification of foreseen risks 
and correct categorization of these risks on the basis of their criticality degree are of paramount 
importance for hospital management. Under the scope of the present study, a risk assessment is conducted 
on the Emergency Room's (ER's) employee in a University Hospital of a University Hospital, in the 
guidance of Risk Assessment Matrix (L-Type Matrix) approach in the study seeking to serve to the 
above-mentioned purposes.

Resumen: El propósito de este trabajo es formular y describir un método de pronóstico 
para productos con ciclo de vida corto. La ecuación logística y la curva-S son el punto 
de partida para modelar el comportamiento de la demanda de un producto con esta 
propiedad, por ejemplo videojuegos o teléfonos móviles y en general tecnologías de 
base electrónica. El mercado actual favorece con creces la variedad, la novedad y el 
status quo que brinda los artefactos electrónicos, en consecuencia la gestión de la cadena 
de abastecimiento debe responder con flexibilidad y prontitud, modificando las 
condiciones de planeación del aprovisionamiento, el sistema de producción y la 
logística de distribución, siempre y cuando el método de pronóstico reduzca 
sustancialmente la incertidumbre, estimando la duración posible del ciclo de vida y el 
máximo volumen de ventas que podrá ser descrito por un modelo de difusión. 
 
Palabras clave: Logística, pronóstico, cadena de abastecimiento, ciclo de vida. 
 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to formulate and describe a forecasting method 
for products with a short life cycle. The logistic equation and the S-curve are the starting 
point for modeling the demand behavior of a product with this property, for example 
videogames or mobile phones and in general technologies based on electronics. The 
current market is more conducive to the variety, novelty and status quo of electronic 
devices, so supply chain management must respond flexibly and promptly, by 
modifying the conditions of supply planning, the production system and distribution 
logistics, provided that the forecasting method substantially reduces uncertainty, 
estimating the possible life-cycle duration and the maximum sales volume that can be 
described by a diffusion model. 
 
Key words: Logistics, forecasting, supply chain, life cycle.

should not release purchase orders until a credible estimate of the possible sale is guaranteed. So, for 
SLC products, monitoring must be real in time to activate supply chain management and make it 
effective, minimizing the costs of maintaining inventory and the risks of obsolescence. 
 
The models explored in this essay need to be complemented with methodologies such as; 
Collaborative forecasting, CFAR and CPFR technology, coordinating the planning and forecasting 
efforts among the external partners of the supply chain, reducing uncertainty. It is likely that the 
forecast function evolves to intelligent and deterministic certainty levels, pulling the operations 
eliminating the need to push. The role of the forecaster will be to coordinate and manage the 
information in the supply chain in such a way that ""zero forecast"" is achieved. 
 
Managing information, cooperation and relationships along the entire supply chain require 
changes in traditional behaviors and ways of thinking about the forecasting process, and also requires 
a spirit of partnership between customers, suppliers and manufacturers, leading to a credible, timely 
and accurate exchange of information. 
 
It is possible to design a model tailored to the needs of a company to solve particular problems. 
Today products have a very short life cycle, which is not contemplated by most of the planning, 
forecasting or inventory models, but it is increasingly common to find sales structures for SLC 
products. 
 
The techniques proposed here reduce uncertainty, reduce excess merchandise and therefore 
minimize the risk of obsolescence and inventory costs, as was demonstrated in this article.

Abstract  
 
Risk Management is one of the most relevant approaches and systematic applications of strategies, 
procedures and practices management that have been introduced in literatures for identifying and 
analysing risks which exist through the whole life of a product ,a process  or services. Therefore, the aim 
of this paper is to propose a risk assessment model that will be implemented to the energy sector, 
particularly to power plants. This model combines the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique with 
a new enhanced Balance Score Card (BSC). AHP is constructed to determine the weights and the 
priorities for all perspectives and risk indicators that involved in the BSC. The novelty in this paper is not 
only in using the BSC for risk assessment, but also, in developing a new BSC with six perspectives, 
which are sustainability perspective; economic; learning and growth; internal and operational business 
process; supply chain and customer/demand perspective. Another three contributions of this paper are 
firstly, including the sustainability dimension in BSC, and covering nine risk categories, which comprise 
84 risk indicators that have been distributed across the six risk BSC perspectives. Secondly, assessing the 
non-technical risks in power plants and finally, this research will concentrate on the strategic level instead 
of the operational level where the majority of researches focus on latter but the former is far less 
researched. The created model will provide an effective measurement for the risks particularly, in the 
power plants sector. The results of this study demonstrate that the supply chain risks perspective is the 
keystone for the decision making process. Furthermore, these risk indicators with the new structure of 
BSC with six perspectives, help in achieving the organisation mission and vision in addition to affording 
a robust risk assessment model. The inputs of this model are composed from a previous stage using a 
modified Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) (which has been used the Exponential Weighted 
Geometric Mean (EWGM)) to understand and analyse all risks, after which, the results of the developed 
FMEA which are the Risk Priority Numbers (RPN’s), have been used to build the AHP-BSC risk model. 
These risks are collected with difficulty from various literatures. This study will be validated in the next 
stage in power plants in the Middle East.

This BSC-AHP risk model will be validated in the next stage of building the System Dynamic Model (SD), a 
questionnaire will be distributed to experts from different departments at power plants in the Middle East and then a 
comparison will be executed between the results of the questionnaire and the results of the model. 
 
VII. 
Conclusions: 
The developed FMEA methodology that has been used in this research can boost effective decision-making 
about risks, improve power plants towards risk management, and assist the top management to have an acceptable 
and preferable understanding of the organisation than lower level managers do who are close more to the day-to-day 
(tactical plan) organisational operations. Additionally, the results of EWGM-RPN help in developing the AHP 
model by assigning the comparison importance across each risk indicator. Furthermore, the improved method 
overcomes some drawbacks in the traditional FMEA in simple way where this will provide more accurate, practical 
and reasonable results. The results of this study demonstrate that the supply chain risks perspective 
(production risks, disruption risks) is the keystone for the decision making process followed by internal 
and operational business process perspective. 
The developed risk scorecard framework with six perspectives could be an effective tool for risk assessment, 
where the BSC help in understanding all the selected risk in the appropriate perspective while the AHP provides 
weights for each perspective and for each risk indicator.  
As a whole, these results will be changed depending on power plant and the policy of the country. For 
example, some of these risks particularly, the economics risks are limited (ex. the power plants transactions in U.S. 
Dollar have negligible exchange risk since the currency is fixed compared with the U.S. Dollar). Similarly, the 
generating companies have not been exposed to credit risk because the only client of the company is the National 
Company in that country, as it is wholly owned by the government. Moreover, the supply risk has a high RPN value 
comparing with other risk categories and this is because the country depends on the imported fossil fuel to generate 
electricity (Central Electricity Generating Company/Jordan, 2016).

Abstract 
Nowadays, world dynamics and the competition between companies are becoming more aggressive, such 
as the automotive industry, so their industrial and business models need to be transformed as well to 
compete. More products with high complexity lead to an End to End Logistics model design, but the 
implementation becomes tough and difficult. The main purpose of this project was to elevate the 
performance execution of the materials storage strategy, designing and simulating the operation flow of a 
centralized warehouse, in order to reduce missing critical materials and controlling the supply of the 
materials at the assembly lines. The designed model is supported by lean techniques and warehouse design 
and management techniques, integrating different tools to identify non-value adding activities and, 
therefore, to design a lean material flow, distribution, and operation of the new flexible and integrated 
storage center facility. The supply chain also become redesigned improving the KPI’s performance at the 
assembly lines. Previous lean manufacturing studies and its effects were mostly applied to production 
systems, whereas lean studies in warehouse are scarce. This document provides a substantial contribution 
for the design of material supply systems using lean principles improving performance of the centralized 
storage operations and the supply to the shop floor according to the simulation results.

The pilot test was divided as follows, the first 3 days for part by part material and the last 2 days for CKD material. 
Each of the processes that were designed in the previous stage were run, some of these processes were modified to 
see the improvements while the process was running. In addition to the processes that were piloted, improvements 
were also made regarding the ergonomics of the process.  
 
6. 
Results 
 
The daily results of the pilot test were monitored through the shop floor management, which includes the indicators 
of the project. 
 
OTIF 
The results were observed day by day and a gradual increase could be noted, reaching the proposed objectives in each 
of the branches of the indicator. In general, there was an increase of 14 percentage points. In the physical inventory 
the increase was 26 percentage points, in the no damage it remained 100%, and on time increased by 10 percentage 
points 
and 
the 
documentation 
needed 
was 
an 
increase 
of 
32 
percentage 
points. 
 
Inventory Record Accuracy 
Once the implementation phase was completed, in which the pilot test was carried out to run the designed processes, 
we were able to perceive an increase of 3 percentage points was achieved in the Inventory Record Accuracy, reaching 
98%. 
 
Stock out 
In the case of material shortages, the 10% reduction of critical material on the line was proposed as an objective. 
However, the previous results show that 32 percentage points exceeded the objective, since it was reduced by 42%. 
In October, at the beginning of the implementation, the measurement of shortages was 180; while, in November, at 
the end of the test, the missing measurement was 105 part numbers. 
 
The realization of the piloting was very important because the model designed in the previous stage could be put to 
the test, obtaining as a result the correct execution of the processes, with the estimated times and planned resources. 
There was the opportunity to observe the system functioning prior to the full implementation, this was helpful to 
evaluate the possible risks and to make improvements to the system according to the results obtained. 
 
On the other hand, the objectives of the project were defined from the beginning and as noted in the results section 
mentioned above, the percentages were met in addition to exceeding the objectives proposed by the team making this 
a successful intervention.

Conclusions 
 
One of the transcendental logistical decisions in an organization is the way in which inventories are handled. During 
the project, methodologies served as support during the planning and construction of the logistics and storage strategy. 
With this, ""the allocation of inventories to the storage points against the exit to the storage points by inventory supply 
rules, represent two strategies"" (Ballou, 2004, p. 40). The selective location of different items in the centralized 
warehouse and the management of inventory levels through the use of different methods of inventory control, are 
other strategies. 
 
Taking this into account, the intervention of the team was of utmost importance for the organization, because the 
proposed strategic objectives of service improvement were met, and even exceeded. In general, the main objective of 
the project is a guide that will serve as a reference in the new warehouse to monitor and control the level of service of 
warehouse to the production line, where the inventory reliability is assured and leads to a minimum reduction of 
shortages of material on the line. 
 
According to this, it is stated that ""distribution, when it provides the adequate levels of service to meet the client's 
needs, can lead directly to an increase in sales, greater market share and, finally, to a higher contribution and growth 
of profits"" (Krenn and Harvey, 1983, p. 593), with which it can be concluded that some of the most important elements 
of customer service are logistical in nature (Sterling and Lambert, 1989, p.17).

Abstract 
 
Transportation of hazardous materials (Hazmat for short) has always raised authorities’ concerns about 
the potential risks to humans and environment. But Hazmat transportation plays an important role to the 
economy in both developed and developing countries. In addition to the selection of routes from the 
origin to destination, Hazmat transportation often includes facilities that may also known as the sources of 
potential risks for environment. Thus, it is necessary to address the integration of locating and routing 
decisions from both economic and safety aspects. The mail purpose of the present paper is to develop a 
mathematical model to find optimum sites for the construction of fuel distribution centers as well as to 
determine different states of lifetime for the construction of those during the operating period to reduce 
the total costs of the project. Both construction and transportation costs are given based on the time value 
of money which is the contribution of the present research work. The objective function is defined at two 
levels in which the first level specifies the total network risk and the second level aims to find the 
construction sites with their respective lifetime considering the value of the establishing and operating 
costs. The proposed model has been validated using experimental data in the selected case study of the 
northwest region of Iran. The results revealed that considering time value of money in Hazmat transport 
planning plays a significant role over locating the optimum sites as fuel distribution centers, so local or 
national authorities who are dealing with Hazmat transportation can utilize the proposed model to find the 
best locations of fuel distribution centers.

1. Introduction 
 
1.1 Hazmat Transportation  
Developing the urbanization and industries, especially the logistics industry, increasingly complicates the movement 
of people and commodities while urban development entails the increased level of demand and the increased 
number of distribution firms in the transportation industry (Ho et al., 2008). One of the most important materials 
carried over the world is known as hazardous material (abbreviated as Hazmat). Every day, millions of tons of goods 
are transported in the transit routes of different countries whilst some of them contain hazardous materials. United 
Nation classifies Hazmat into nine categories: explosives, gases, flammable liquids, oxidizing materials, toxic and

4. Summary and Conclusion 
Since, Hazmat transport is a main concern in transport planning a bi-level objective model has been developed for 
solving locating and routing problem. The first level of objective function determines the risk of the network and its 
value is included in the second level as a constraint. The second level solves the model to specify the extent of 
Hazmat transportation from each distribution center to the destinations and to locate the distribution centers among 
the candidate sites. For validating the proposed model, the northwest part of Iran has been selected as case study and 
results have been analyzed. Results revealed that while risk tolerance is increased, the proposed model is capable to 
find better routes over the network. For the future studies, it is recommended to work more on considering time 
value of money during different combinations of periods while they are assumed as variables.

Abstract 
Improving productivity by eliminating the unnecessary activities have always been the vital prospects 
in an automobile service parts station. This paper is a case study in the service station of a reputed 
organization where rejections were monitored on the daily basis starting from finding root cause of 
rejection followed by action plans. Productivity of the service station is improved using PDCA tool of 
lean manufacturing. During the study, it was observed that the services offered by the service station 
was not sometimes well received by the customers and there are still areas for amendments. By using 
the PDCA tool the productivity was improved significantly by reducing the overall time that was 
previously consumed in unnecessary activities i.e. changing daily rejections monitoring process to 
weekly monitoring process. The time saved could thus be used in other productive activities of service 
station and the rejections got maintained in each quality gate thereby boosting the employee morale 
and customer satisfaction. 
Keywords: Lean manufacturing, productivity, PDCA, auto service station, Kaizen, process mapping. 
1. Introduction 
Application of the lean philosophy in any organization might result in a system which is leaner from the 
beginning and needs less improvement during its lifetime. Lean targets to make the work simple enough to 
understand, do and manage. To accomplish these three goals at once there is a belief held by some that Toyota's 
mentoring process, (loosely called Senpai and Kohai, which is Japanese for senior and junior), is one of the best 
ways to foster lean thinking up and down the firm’s structure. This is the process undertaken by Toyota as it 
helps its suppliers improve their own production. The closest equivalent to Toyota's mentoring process is the 
concept of ‘lean sensei’, which encourages companies, organizations, and teams to seek outside, third-party 
experts, who can provide unbiased advice and coaching. Application of the lean theory has confirmed to be an 
effective way of improving manufacturing systems. Lean is often mentioned to as a philosophy, as a way of 
thinking. Nonetheless, it also embraces methods and tools to support its execution (Mor et al., 2016)a. 
Determining when to apply which tool in the improvement processes is not bounded by any formal standard. 
Indeed, a huge Lean implementation experience has been gained by industry on this topic. This has contributed 
to the development of an empiric, and yet solidly proven, body of knowledge on the sequential application of 
methods and tools for achieving a lean system. Reduced costs, eradication of waste and process integration are 
the basics for success of industries who have adopted lean tools (Rahul and Kaler, 2013). 
Lean manufacturing utilizes a wide range of tools and methods; the choice of tools is based on the 
requirement. Many parameters contribute success of lean. Organizations which implemented lean manufacturing 
have higher level of litheness and competitiveness. Lean is applicable for all the type of the organization 
regardless of their size, lot of work has been carried out in manufacturing sector that to in different functional 
areas. Waste elimination, inventory control and productivity improvement are the key benefits across the lean 
implemented enterprises in Indian context as well as globally. Mor et al. (2016)b revealed that green-lean 
methodology can improve the process flow and employee morale, and it also lowers down the ecological 
regulatory non-compliance risk. However, lean manufacturing provides an atmosphere that is highly conducive 
to waste minimization. 
2. Literature Review 
There are quite a good number of studies presented in the body of literature focusing on the awareness and 
Potential for implementation of lean tool in different sector. Storch et al. (1999) shown that lean ship production 
requires continuous and uniform process flows, build strategies must be established and followed which reflect 
the proper work breakdown, especially block breakdown, even at the expense of design convenience (Rahul and 
Kaler, 2013; Mor et al., 2017a; Mor et al., 2017b). Achanga et al. (2005) research identified the critical factors 
that constitute a successful implementation of LM within manufacturing SMEs. Leadership, management,

After implementing PDCA tool of lean manufacturing it is observed that the rejection rate are still under set 
target limit i.e. 
 
For quality gate 1 it is 10% 
 
For quality gate 2 it is 10% 
 
For quality gate 3 it is 15% 
The primary objective of using the PDCA tool was to eliminate the time involved in doing unnecessary 
activities and it was found to be successful, as the time was reduced by 7 hours/week which could be used in 
doing some other productive activities. Employee morale also get boosted because of the improved work flow 
and enhanced productivity of plant (Mor et al., 2015, 2016; Rahul and Kaler, 2013). 
6. Conclusions 
Lean is characterized as a procedure for accomplishing critical consistent change in execution through the 
disposal of all squanders of assets and time in the aggregate business prepare. Its standards apply to almost all 
business operations, from the organization and item configuration to equipment preparations. Lean assembling 
is about dispensing with waste and non-esteem included assignments. Lean thinking eliminates waste for an 
organization even if it not manufacturing i.e. can be applicable to service stations as well. In the current study, 
the Kaizen tool under which PDCA working methodology was selected to eliminate waste in form of 
unnecessary activities and time as well. After analyzing the case processes at the service station, it is concluded 
that: 
 Daily analysis of rejections was adding waste of time in form of unnecessary activities. 
 Weekly analysis revealed not much effect on rejection rate because all stations were still under target limit 
set by the organization itself and resulted in saving of time to almost seven hours a week. 
 Employee morale also get boosted because of the improved work flow and enhanced productivity of plant 
which are very important for any organization to get a competitive edge over others.

For Lean Manufacturing, it is always recommended to involve lean thinking in every aspect of organization 
planning and operations as this study showed the importance of kaizen in the organization and future studies can 
attempt to reduce rejections and improve the process and can also analyze the employee behavior for rejections.

Abstract 
 
Every human being has the right for education regardless of her or his culture, race or disability. Students 
with disabilities are having a challenging experience when they go through the education stages during 
their life. Education institutions should care about the needs of students with disabilities and try to do 
whatever is needed to accommodate them in the education programs. Therefore, the purpose of this paper 
is to identify the needs of students with disabilities and identify the available assistive technologies used 
with the various types of disabilities. Based on the results of a literature review, legal documents, and ISO 
standards, it was possible to identify eight needs for the students with disabilities. Furthermore, we 
identified the state of the art of the technologies that are internationally available and being used with five 
types of disabilities, i.e. deafness, blindness, dyslexia, physical disability, and autism. Benchmarking 
University of Sharjah’s assistive technologies with best practices at other international universities 
enables the University of Sharjah to know where it stands with respect to other’s best practices. 
Furthermore, they can develop the needed strategies required to adopt the best practices, which will 
enhance the disabled student’s life in the campus.

1. Introduction 
 
Education is critical for the development of cultures and technologies, especially in the higher education institutes. It 
is an absolute right for every human being, regardless of their culture, race, or disability (The United Nations and 
UN General Assembly, 1948). Students with disabilities are having a challenging experience when they go through 
the education stages during their life. Their disability can stop them from reaching the goals they set and achieving 
their dreams. That is why education institutions should care about this group of students, i.e. students with 
disabilities, identify their needs and try to do whatever is needed to accommodate them in the education programs. 
Universities these days are becoming more aware of the importance of including students with disabilities in their 
campuses, and are aware that these students often can achieve high level of success and innovation, based upon that, 
universities are offering and searching for the best practices and the most recent technologies to make the learning 
process for these students as smooth as possible (Vrăşmaş, 2014). Therefore, in order to provide best education to 
people with disabilities the University of Sharjah has founded Resource Center for People with Disabilities. The 
vision statement of the center is “To provide high-quality university education to people with disabilities at the 
University of Sharjah equal to that of other students at the University.” It has stated two missions, and 10 main 
objectives,

5. Conclusions 
 
In this paper it was possible to identify the needs of the students with disability, validate these needs and rank them 
with the help of expert opinion. It was found that there is a need to improve the “awareness level” of the people who 
are dealing (indirectly/directly) with disabled students, since it got the highest importance weight. This was followed 
second by the need to “the disability support services”. In third place comes the need of more “assistive 
technologies”, followed by “adjustment in educational systems”. The least important need was the “sports”, 
preceded by “accessibility in facilities”. Knowing these results can help the decision maker to prioritize what should 
be improved first and initiate improvement projects accordingly.   
 
The details of the methodology of using the multi-criteria decision-making tool will be presented in another future 
paper. For one of these needs, i.e., assistive technologies, in this paper we identified the state of the art of the 
technologies that are internationally available and being used with five types of disabilities. These five types of 
disabilities are the ones that are being dealt with by the Disability Resource Centre at the university of Sharjah, i.e. 
deafness, blindness, dyslexia, physical disability, and autism. The results will help Disability Resource Centre to 
Benchmark the University of Sharjah’s assistive technologies with best practices at other international universities 
which enables the university of Sharjah to understand where does it stand with respect to others best practices and 
develop the needed strategies to adopt the best practices which will enhance the disabled student’s life in the 
campus.

Abstract 
Fouling of heat transfer tubes was major threat on the heat transfer efficiency of the condenser at the case 
study thermal power plant. Such that the mechanical methods used to clean the tubes were inefficient in 
dealing with the increasing precipitation of insoluble metal salts on the tube walls, which in turn impeded 
the heat transfer process. A the system of injecting  spherical rubber balls into the cooling water along its 
flow along the tube to scrub dirty on the tube surfaces as well as to create turbulence which disturbs the 
settling of the dirty on the tube walls was investigated using Finite Element Analysis. Ball sizes of diameter 
less than tube size were considered favorable so as to carter for possible thermal linear expansion of the 
rubber material on exposure to temperature. A magnetic water treatment unit was also added to enable the 
formation of weak precipitates of the metal salts, which has reduced tendency to stick onto the tube walls. 
This system was found to achieve substantial savings in terms of reducing downtime on condenser cleaning 
at the thermal power plant. 
1.Introduction
The case study thermal power plant was using the shell and tube heat exchangers for condensing exhaust steam from
the turbine. The cooling water passing at the tube side tended to cause gathering of deposits on flowing through the
tubes. These deposits increased with time as minerals like calcium and magnesium formed insoluble salt precipitates
in the pipe interior wall – this formation of scale build up inside the condenser surfaces cause fouling whic3333h
effectively reduces heat transfer surface. This is normally exacerbated by use of raw cooling water, in case of ducts
which are not being cleaned they are also chances of the deposition of mud inside the condenser tubes. Prolonged
fouling consequently rises frictional resistance to waters flow due to the dirty layers hence fluid mal-distribution as
well as reduced velocity on flow.  Also fouling layers are of low thermal conductivity such that they are overall losses
in heat transfer causing the decrease in efficiency (Fayard & Verona, 2011). Common offline mechanical cleaning
methods such as molded plastics cleaners (pigs) or wire brushes are used to remove off deposits in the tubes when the
condenser is not functioning. In some cases, chemical cleaning is also used to dissolve the deposits (Xu, et al., 2016).
Both these methods require prior plant shutdown to use them and they fail to return the original tube cleanliness. For
that reason, heat exchangers which carry out the cleaning process whilst in operation would be preferred as a way to
reduce unplanned shutdowns which adversely affect production cost of energy. Thus fouling will be eliminated at an
early stage to prevent cases of build-up of these tenacious deposits.
2. Fouling in heat exchangers
2.1 Forms of fouling
Fouling can be considered to be the build-up of undesirable deposits on the sides of the heat exchanger tubes is
dependent on the nature of the fluid in flow. It falls into two distinct categories namely macro and micro fouling.

Figure 12. Pumping System schematic layout 
The pumping system with a bigger pipe diameter (3times ball size) was selected. Although the cost associated with 
the bigger diameter in the five year run is higher; it is worth since at that diameter the pump operates more efficiently 
than when the pipe diameter is smaller 
5.6.5 Strainer 
This acts as the ball collector hence keeping the balls in the circulatory loop. Due to the cooling water passing through 
strainer, water impacts the strainer whilst in operation .Incase of failure on the strainer it means no ball is collected 
hence no ball  circulation is achieved. This means thatthe system will not save for its intended purpose. 
Determining Von Mises Stress on the strainer open area. 
In this analysis the researcher will consider only a small fraction of the perforated area (25mm x25mm x 15mm) on 
the strainer. Using the known pressure within the pipe flow in the main cooling water tube(50psi), force expected on 
a unit area under analysis is obtained as (219N). 
The overall analysis portrayed that Von Mises stress expected on the strainer plate is 1.9 x 106 Nmm-2, thus less than 
the yield strength of the perforated material 3.650 x 107Nmm-2. 
5.6.6 Condenser tube 
The rubber balls in circulation are coated with abrasive materials. In cases of no foulant in the tube or ball expands 
towards tube walls, it implies that ball directly contacts tube wall along the flow. The effect of the ball contact on the 
tube has to be verified if it is impactful to the tube material hence avoid damages on the condenser tubes. In this 
analysis the thrust force on the ball as obtained from is to be considered as the same force also experience on the tube 
along its wall. 
The resultant Von Mises stress after the FEA was found as 2.002 x 106 Nmm-2,hence less than the yield strength of 
the tube material,Brass,2.397 x 108Nmm-2. In conclusion, both designs are safe because the attained Von Mises stress 
of the models is lower than the corresponding yield strength in both cases. 
It is of significant importance for the operators of the set cleaning system to be fully knowledgeable on the operational 
parameters and components available. This ensures for safety and ability to identify if the system is working according 
to its intended operation. Therefore an optimum performance is achievable since external disturbances can be avoided 
if the system is    clearly known. An automated system is used to control the ball injection and collection cycles. The 
valves in the system receive set commands from the PLC at specified times in the cycles. This unit saves the labor of 
tiresome on off operations of the multiple pipe line valves.  Sight glasses on the ball collector and the strainer site save 
for the inspection of ball availability and if any ball is stuck on the strainer. Control valves are incorporated in the 
system to  allow for required flow path at different intervals of the cycles. This exercise ensured for the identification 
and eradication of hazards associated with the developed system. Potential hazards that may arise due deviation of the

design from its expected operational conditions are noted.This depends on the contracted company but after 
consulting, a good average was found to be $4500 per condenser.  
6. Recommendations and conclusion
As recommendations, there was need to improve on the reduction of ball losses, as well as to improve ball distribution
on tubes. Further development of ball material with greater resistance to wear could be developed. Development of
advanced system to control and monitor ball motion in the tubes such that no tube is missed needs to be investigated.
In systems of low turbulence, the effect of adding an agitating component to improve ball distribution   within flow
has to be researched on. Although the design of a condenser rubber ball cleaning system which saves for the cleaning
of the condenser tubes whilst in operation was done. The design paid consideration to cases of possible tube
obstructions, missed tubes on cleaning and lessening of ball wear. The introduction of an online condenser cleaning
system at the power station will be impact on the downtimes due to unexpected and scheduled shutdown are reduced
during periodical cleaning thus yearly expenses due to downtime on condenser cleaning slashed by $475 200. Major
improvement of the existing system to meet set objectives were on the addition of the magnetic water treatment  to
and  alter the super molecules in water such the calcium cation precipitate so if a specific tube is missed in one cycle,
it will be in the next cycle the while foulant will not be stubborn on removal.  The number of balls per cycle were
increased such that higher a probabilities that any tube is cleaned after multiple cycles. Reduced ball size was
introduced to cover for thermal expansion on the balls when exposed to high temperatures.

Abstract 
This design study reviewed the redesign of a manual wheelchair for the rural terrain where difficulties are 
faced in maneuvering the currently existing wheelchairs due to uneven and rough terrain particularly with 
sandy, sloping ground, and poor road system which makes moving almost impossible. Possible concepts 
which address these challenges were developed, evaluated and improved to come up with a mechanism 
that takes into account the lack of balance and difficulty in maneuvering. A detailed design was done 
including the calculations, generation of drawings of the component parts and sizing of the parts of the 
wheelchair. The wheelchair was designed for occupants of healthy upper torso with pelvic to foot 
restraint.  
1. Introduction
A wheelchair is an assistive device which enhances personal mobility and facilitates participation, for a person with
walking limitation. It is estimated that over 75% of the world’s population lives in rural areas, where standard
conventional wheelchairs just do not work: as they are hard to push, they break easily, and cannot be repaired easily.
Wheelchair designs vary to enable users to safely and effectively use their wheelchairs in the environment in which
they live and work(Cooper, 2008).A wheelchair that is used primarily in rough outdoor environments needs to be
robust, more stable and easier to propel over rough and uneven ground. Disabled people in rural areas are facing
problems with the current available conventional 4-wheeledwheelchairs because of uneven and rough terrain
especially with sandy, stony, sloping ground, steep ramps and poor road systems which make moving these manual
wheelchairs almost impossible. These wheelchairs do not fully meet the needs of the users such as to travel longer
distances, therefore, there is a need to come up with a wheelchair design that can be used in the rural environment
and terrain without any constraints.

Literature Review
2.1 Wheel concept and functions 
A wheelchair is a device that comes in variations allowing either manual propulsion by the seated occupant turning 
the rear wheels by hand or electric propulsion by motors. There are often handles behind the seat to allow for 
different individuals to push. According to the world health organization, a wheelchair is an assistive technological 
device which enhances personal mobility, promotes functional independence and facilitates participation, for a 
person with walking limitation. (Cooper RA, 2002).Wheelchair design and functionality as a whole has been greatly 
improved over the past several years, but there is still a need for new technology and innovative designs. A basic 
manual wheelchair incorporates a seat, foot rests and four wheels: two caster wheels at the front and two large 
wheels at the back. The two larger wheels in the back usually have hand rims; two metal or plastic circles 
approximately 3/4"" thick. The hand rims have a diameter normally only slightly smaller than the wheels they are

5.Recommendations 
It was found also necessary to equip the wheelchair with a reflecting system on the rear and front end to improve the 
visibility of occupant, as well as making a provision for a seatbelt for safety of the user. To save on weight, the 
chassis and frame must be made using as little material as possible. The wheelchair has puncture proof tires which 
are less shock absorbing. A shock absorber can be used on the wheelchair to absorb shock in rough terrain. The anti-
tipper devices or wheels must be installed on the wheelchair to ensure a safe ride. .The gearing mechanism size must 
be able to fit within the hub and it must be light so that it does not add too much weight to the rest of the wheelchair. 
Because the gearing mechanism is part of the drive train of the wheelchair its efficiency greatly affects that of the 
whole wheelchair. Therefore a good bearing system must be used. Typical efficiencies for internal hubs in good 
condition are between 94% and 98%. 
6.Conclusion 
It has been established that the currently used wheelchairs have many challenges in maneuvering in the rough and 
uneven terrain in rural areas. The wheelchairs lack sufficient balance in maneuvering on steep slopes and banked 
roads. To address these challenges associated with existing wheelchairs, a design concept was developed for a well 
balanced mechanism wheelchair. A completed design of the chosen concept was carried out. The design has a 
provision for anti-tipper wheels to enhance balance of the wheelchair. The mechanical advantage was greatly 
improved by using a system of chains and sprocket for the propulsion mechanism of the wheelchair and the design is 
simple to operate.

Abstract 
This work study was done to come up with an optimised design of an automated dam shutter system to 
monitor the level of water, pressure and flow of water at the case study dam site. The failure to monitor the 
opening and closing of dam gates has resulted in insufficient supply of water, water wastages and a lot of 
human errors associated with manual gate control mechanism. The designed control system was intended 
to reduce these shortcomings. The design incorporated servo- motors, mechanical hoist system and the 
electronic control to monitor the flow of water according to water level at any given time.  
1. Introduction
Mostly water outlets for dams are manually operated, resulting in failure to effectively supply water from the dams 
for the purpose of irrigation,  to control floods, as well as improve industrial uses such as hydro-electric power 
generation resulting in unwanted water wastages (Muhammad et al 2012). The importance of water in our daily life 
cannot be over emphasised, hence its distribution and usage water is of utmost consideration. The initiative to 
introduce automation and monitoring control system to manage dam water enables reliability and the same system 
helps monitor vibrations of the dam structure to ensure safety and detects early wall collapse warning collapse signs 
to avert any disaster. It is also robust for use in remote, confined and dangerous locations (Anon n.d.). Such 
installations will prove to be much economical in the long run although the initial cost of implementing the system 
could be high. 
2. Dam outlet works
2.1 Mechanical dam outlet works 
Basically a dam is a physical barrier constructed across flowing water course; to control, direct, hold or raise level of 
water. Non-corrosive materials such as concrete, wood and steel are used in its construction(Muhammad et al. 2012). 
There are many ways of preserving water through providing dams with spillway or gates systems to safely pass a 
broad range of flows over or through the dam(Bhardwaj et al. 2014). The configuration of gates used to block or pass 
a broad range of flow of water is dependent on the operation, application, purpose and location. The most common 
type is the outlet head regulator gates.

tip of the prism is no longer sensing water (contact of water) the light is reflected back to the receiver. When the water 
level is rising it does the opposite.   
The sensors would be arranged in such a way that there at midpoint of the penstock diameter to accommodate the time 
interval of opening each gate which is 160 seconds to fully open thus (continuous supply of water is required). There 
are four sensors that senses water level with each penstock having one sensor as per Figure 4 showing the penstock 
levels. The sequence of control system operations will be as follows: 
 when the dam is draining 
o 
When the water level is at the marked point above penstock 1 then the gate 1 is open 
o 
When water level passes the sensor 1, gate 2 opens while gate 1 closes 
o 
When water level passes the sensor 2, gate 3 opens while gate 2 closes 
 
 when water level is rising in the dam 
o 
When water level rise it passes sensor 3, then when sensor 2 sense water level gate 2 opens while gate 3 
closes. 
o 
 Water level passes sensor 2, then when sensor 1 sense water level gate 1 opens while gate 2 closes. 
5. Recommendations. 
 Power screw mechanism can be further designed to improve the efficiency of the system of the power screw which 
is 35% as there is room to increase this to 81%. The material selection is also to be looked at for every component and 
change  can be made depending on the rate of wearing of material due to rust, loads and frictional resistances.  
The installation of the electric motor should allow easy of access to inspection and maintenance. Also adequate 
protection should be considered since the environment will be wet and dust at most of the time. The motor should be 
kept clean from the dust, debris and oil. It should also be lubricated at regular intervals and checked for proper 
alignment of the shafts. All the internal parts of the motor should be painted to avoid corrosion and the windings shall 
be impregnated to render then non hydroscopic. The thermostat should be used for temperature protection. 
On the reduction gear box, the shaft connection and alignment should be checked in four places around the shaft at 
90°. The correct gap must also be maintained and the gear drive must be level and secure before alignment of shafting 
begins. A sufficient amount of clean lubricant is required for long service life (Cleveland, 1999). It should be checked 
for leaks on the seals and lose bolts. Tooth profile should be checked periodically to ensure maximum transmission. 
The gear unit should be enclosed with an oil bath lubricated type and it should be able to move the stem screw up and 
down under different operating pressure differential. The lifting nut should be properly aligned to the stem rod prevent 
damage of the threads. The used on the design is bronze or cast iron. Selection of another material would be necessary 
if the lifting nut wore out fast. In order to achieve maximum transmission it should be changed regularly and 
lubrication should be done each time maintenance is done. The sluice gate does not need periodic maintenance, but 
checking of crack and wearing out due to corrosion and pitting. Rust may cause weak points on the gate which cause 
water sipping through. The steel sheet must be cleaned and painted to avoid rusting. The groove where the gate seals 
seat must be cleaned to make sure that there is positive thrust and complete water tight.  
6. Conclusion 
The study came up a design to incorporate an automated dam sluice gate control system to handle floods risks and 
unnecessary water wastages the outlet penstocks. The design entailed the electric motor selection rated at 1750 rpm 
connected to the right angle worm gear of 60:1 speed reduction. The chain drive would provide speed reduction of 2:1 
to the driven sprocket that drives the lifting nut. The overall speed reduction of the system is 120:1 from the motor. 
The rotational speed of the lifting nut is 14.5 rpm that enable the stem to move up and down. The stem moves 8mm 
in one revolution of the lifting nut. Considering the safety factor of 1.3 between the rotation of the steel screw and the 
bronze nut. As the diameter of the penstock pipe is 400mm it takes 2.65 minutes (2minutes and 40sec) to fully open 
the full diameter pipe. This operation being enabled by electronic optic sensor control unit at each dam penstock water 
level.

Abstract 
Single-period problem which is called newsboy problem, is one of the commonplace problem in 
inventory control. Using inventory control models in each stage of industry cycle has become commonly 
to determine order quantities and commodity inventory. In this paper, optimizing a bi-objective, multi-
product, multi-constraint, single-period problem is considered with incremental discount policy in 
purchasing commodity to find the order quantities which will be maximized both expected profit and 
minimized service level. Constraints are budget and warehouse capacity. In addition, decision variables are 
real and it is assumed that holding and shortage costs occur at the end of a period. Formulation of the 
problem is presented and shown to be a mixed integer nonlinear programming model. Furthermore, Multi- 
Objective Decision Making (MODM) approaches are utilized to solve the model with meta-heuristic 
algorithms. Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are provided to find an 
approximate optimum solutions of the problem. After applying RSM method to calibrate the parameters of 
both algorithms, their performances in solving instances compare in terms of solution quality of both 
algorithms. In final, GAMS program is applied for validating the solutions.

1. Introduction 
Inventory control has found a great significance place with progress in technology and development in a large 
number of systems including industrial, productive, servicing and others. In general, ‘newsboy problem’ focuses on 
circumstances where demand for a commodity is random and unsold or unused ordered items become abolished at the 
end of the cycle. In one hand, buyer may incur a cost to dispose of them; on the other hand, if he initially decides to 
buy smaller amounts of these commodities; shortages may occur, causing loss of income. In this problem, commodity 
has the most considerable characteristic of a ‘single-period’ problem, and the chief purpose is to determine ordered-
quantity in order to minimize costs and maximize profit. In real-world situations, many products have a limited period 
in selling, so the newsboy model is reflective of many real life circumstances and is often used to aid decision-making 
in fashion, sporting, service industries such as airlines, hotels, to name but a few to manage capacity or evaluate 
advanced booking of orders. Hence, the classical newsboy problem and its various extensions have been widely 
studied by many researchers as a substantial number of papers published since 1951.  
The first efforts on newsboy problem were published by Arrow et al. (1951) and Morse and Kimball (1951). 
Hadley and Whitin (1963) proposed and solved a multi-products model in following years. After following decades 
with escalating interest in this problem, many articles were published in development of different extensions. Silver 
and Pyke (1998) and Khouja (1999) did complete studies for this problem; as Khouja (1999) published an article 
entitled ''The single-period problem: literature review and suggestions for future research'', which examined different 
extensions of newsboy problem and divided them into several categories. These extensions of newsboy problem that

the Goal attainment method and in PSO within the LP metrics method for both objectives.

6. Conclusion 
In this research, a bi-objective single-period problem under incremental discount was investigated. The problem 
was modelled on multi-product with budget and warehouse capacity constraints. The aim of this paper was to 
determine the order quantities such that expected profit and minimized service level were maximized. The problem 
was formulated into a mixed integer nonlinear programming and it was solved using two MODM approaches via two 
meta-heuristic algorithms. In section 5, parameters of both algorithms were tuned using RSM method and then tuned

algorithms were compared based on t-student test applying various numerical problems of different sizes in order to 
optimize both objectives which were provided to demonstrate the application and to compare the performance of both 
algorithms in both approaches. Moreover, the solution procedures were validated by GAMS program up to twelve 
products. It could be mentioned that this paper contributes in decision making of order quantities in the inventory 
control in a large number of industrial cycles.  
For future work extensions, the followings are recommended 
(1) Parameters of the model can be investigated in fuzzy form to bring the application closer to reality.   
(2) It could be considered a parameter-tuned bi-objective meta-heuristic algorithm such as MOPSO, NSGA-II, etc to 
find Pareto solutions. 
(3) In addition to mentioned constraints, further constraints such as transportation costs and total discount could be 
attended. 
(4) Taguchi method can be employed to tune the parameters of algorithms as well.

Abstract 
 
The mobile collection system of blood products is considered in this study. Blood centers often use 
bloodmobiles that park near crowded places where donors can donate blood directly. We propose the use 
of additional vehicles, called shuttles, that pick up the collected blood by the bloodmobiles. Hence, 
bloodmobiles can continue their tours without having to return to the blood center. The system manager 
must decide the set of sites to visit by the bloodmobiles among a group of potential sites, and to determine 
the tours of the vehicles responsible for this operation. In this paper, the blood mobile collection system is 
modelled as a vehicle routing problem with profits. The objective is to minimize the total routing, wastage 
and shortage costs. Each collection site has a random potential blood quantity that is modeled as a stochastic 
profit which can be collected by a vehicle when it visits this site. A Two-Stage Stochastic Model with 
recourse is developed to represent the problem using a scenario-based approach. The fast-forward selection 
algorithm is implemented to reduce the set of scenarios.  Experiments are performed considering Poisson 
distributed profits.

1. Introduction 
Blood has different functions including the transportation of oxygen and nutrients to the lungs and tissues [1]. The 
main transfusable blood components are: red blood cells, platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitated AHF condition [2]. 
These components can be mechanically separated from a unit of Whole Blood (WB), or can be obtained using 
apheresis, an automated procedure that can filter only the desired components from the blood of donors [3]. WB and 
blood components are necessary for cancer treatments, surgeries, organ transplants, among others. The Blood Supply 
Chain (BSC) controls the flow of blood products from donors to patients. The aim of the BSC is to ensure that blood

6. Conclusions 
This paper presents a study to optimize the decisions in the mobile collection system of blood products with two types 
of vehicles: bloodmobiles and shuttles. The challenge of optimizing process in the Blood Supply Chain and its vital 
importance have motivated us to start this research. This paper adapts the Vehicle Routing Problem with Profits with 
the objective of minimizing the total routing, wastage and shortage costs. Each collection site has a random blood 
collection potential following a Poisson distribution function that is modeled as a stochastic profit collected by a 
vehicle when it visits a site. A Two-Stage Stochastic Model with recourse is developed to represent the problem using 
a scenario-based approach. The fast-forward selection algorithm is implemented to reduce the set of scenarios.   
 
One of the challenges of stochastic programming is the size of the problems and the solution of these in reasonable 
computational times. For future research related to the mobile collection system of blood products modeled as a two-
stage problem, it is proposed to evaluate scenarios reduction methods to obtain shorter solution times. In addition to 
this, approximation methods can be used for stochastic models such as the L-Shape Method or Cutting Plane 
Approximation. Heuristics, Markov processes or other solution methods can be developed to optimize the blood 
supply chain proposed in this study.  
Possible extensions of the model proposed are to consider that the bloodmobile can be parked more than one day in a 
potential site depending on the profit of the site. It can also be considered that the shuttle makes more visits during the 
day to the bloodmobiles in operation to analyze how this activity affects the average age of blood products in the 
supply chain.

Abstract  
In the delivery of construction projects, different participants are brought together. The successful 
delivery of such project depends on the ability of these participants to function as a team. Identifying each 
individual’s preferred team role is crucial for the smooth running of the team and successful delivery of 
the project. This paper presents the result of an assessment of the team roles of construction professionals 
in Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipalities, Gauteng, South Africa. The study adopted 
the Belbin’s Theory on teamwork, and a questionnaire was used to gather data from construction 
professionals. Data gathered were analyzed using appropriate descriptive statistics. The study reveals that 
the preferred team roles of these professionals are Team-worker and Completer, while the least preferred 
role are Plant, and Specialist roles. Although the delivery of construction project is team oriented which 
can be responsible for construction professionals to naturally fall within the “team-worker” role, it should 
be understood that some workers are bound to fit in better within other team roles as a result of some 
inherent abilities. Therefore construction leaders should know about these team roles so that they can find 
out the type of behaviors they have in their teams.

Introduction 
The construction industry is large, dynamic, and complex in nature, and it plays an important role in a nation’s 
economy (Behm, 2008). The industry has been described as a challenging and demanding sector which requires 
many workers and many trades, and at the same time contributes immensely to the growth of any society 
(Construction Industry Development Board (CIBD), 2012; Navon, 2005). However, construction organizations find 
themselves in a constantly competitive environment that requires them to rapidly adapt to changes. Considering the 
nature of the construction industry, whereby different construction participants come together for the actualization of 
a project, utilizing the abilities of these participants to stand the constant changes within the construction 
environment is necessary for the survival of these organizations. Teamwork has therefore been identified as a crucial 
way of dealing with these changes and achieving positive results. Base on this knowledge, studies on the importance 
of brilliant teamwork in attaining organizational success have emanated (Batenburg et al., 2013; Glassop, 2002; 
Kozlowski and Ilgen, 2006).  
Smith et al. (2000) stated that the essence of team formation is to achieve effectiveness and great performance.  
However, it was further stressed that the fact that there’s a team, does not necessarily mean that the team will 
perform. Based on this background, studies on the performance of teams in projects have been carried out. Much so, 
there are also theories such as the Belbin Team role theory, developed to distinguish the types of individuals needed 
in order to achieve a great team. On several occasions of testing the Belbin Theory, researchers have found the

than other team roles. This role is more like a traditional role for most construction participants with the desire to 
achieve positive construction projects. The Completer, on the other hand, pushes the team to stay efficient and 
searches for mistakes, in order to be able to fix them whilst there is still time and maintain a smooth journey till the 
end (Batenburg et al., 2013). This role is common among project managers and construction supervisors, who are 
saddled with the responsibility of achieving a smooth construction process and successful project delivery. This 
study agrees with Rajendran (2015) which observed that the role of the plant at times may be the least preferred 
team role among workers. This could be as a result of the fact that the role of a plant in a team comes with high 
intellect and ability to come up with innovative ideas, which at times can be rather challenging (Batenburg et al., 
2013).

Conclusion 
This study assessed the team roles of construction professionals within the South African construction industry. 
Using the Belbin theory on teamwork, a survey was conducted to identify the preferred team roles among 
construction professionals within in the City of Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipalities, Gauteng, 
South Africa. Base on the finding, the study concludes that the preferred team roles of these professionals are team-
worker, and completer, while the least preferred role are plant and specialist. The delivery of successful construction 
projects involves teamwork; hence it is not surprising to see construction professionals falling suitably into the role 
of a team-worker. However, this does not negate the fact that there are some workers, who as a result of their 
inherent ability, tend to perform better in other team roles, than just being a team-worker. It is therefore 
recommended that construction leaders know about these team roles so that they can find out the type of behaviors 
they have in their teams. Also if each individual team member knows exactly the type of team role the other team 
member play, it will be easier for them to understand and work effectively with them. Thus, construction 
participants on a project need to be enlightened on the different team roles and how they can fit in well with the 
established team for the project.

Abstract  
Due to the existing transport risk on hazardous materials transportation, it is very essential to prevent risk 
agglomeration over the most frequently used edges of the intercity road network. Although, there are 
many approaches for risk distribution over the network, but the main concern is to select the best 
approach. Therefore, three different techniques including bounded proportional risk, minimizing the 
maximum loaded risk, and minimizing risk absolute errors have been investigated through developing 
their proposed risk distribution models. After developing corresponding models, the well-known criterion 
of risk variation (total variance) has been selected for comparing the performances of three techniques. In 
order to check the proposed models’ validities, the medium size of Guilan intercity road network, located 
at the northern part of Iran, including 46 nodes and 126 two-way edges has been selected as case study. 
Three mathematical models have been run using experimental data of network structure as well as 
Hazmat Origin-Destination matrix and results revealed that the minimizing the maximum loaded risk 
technique is the best one for risk distribution over the intercity road network in Hazmat transportation.

1. Introduction 
Hazardous Materials: Hazardous materials, as defined by the US Department of Transportation, include any 
material or substance that is capable of damaging humans, property, and environment. According to the dangerous 
goods transport convention by road, hazardous materials are classified into nine main classes, consisting of: 
explosives, gases, flammable liquids and solids, oxidizing materials, toxic substances, radioactive materials, 
corrosive substances and waste (Environmental Health & Safety, 2011). Since, reducing fatalities and financial 
losses, increasing the reliability as well as promoting transport safety have become the main objectives of transport 
industries not only by roads and even railways; transport of hazardous materials (Hazmat for short) is always a 
concern with possible harm to humans and the environment. Given the catastrophic consequences of accidents 
involving the transport of hazardous materials as well as the growing transport of these materials, the study of the 
transportation of hazardous materials and the use of appropriate means to reduce the resulting losses is of particular 
importance. In addition, the existence of various hydrocarbon reserves and products derived from them, such as: 
types of petrochemicals that are in turn considered as hazardous materials; on the other hand, the importance of Iran

Solving the model revealed that the value of objective function model in the maximum risk model is determined as 
805294 and 1488875 for minimizing the absolute value. As can be observed in Table 4, by examining the variance 
level of each of the three main models that include bounded proportional risk, maximum risk, and absolute 
magnitude error model, and according to the considered criterion for decision making, for the main problem of this 
research, which is the proper distribution of risk in the network, the maximum risk model has less variance than the 
other two models, so it can be said that a more appropriate model for optimal and equitable distribution of risk in the 
network will be investigated. The values for the least distance traveled by each of the three models under 
consideration with respect to the objective functions and the constraints of each one of them and calculations by the 
corresponding software are given in Table 4. It can be said that the differences are relatively small.

5.  Summary and Conclusion 
In this research work, three different approaches of distributing bounded proportional risk, maximum risk as well as 
the absolute magnitude error have been developed and investigated for Hazmat risk distribution over the road 
network. Three approaches have been utilized in the case study of intercity road network in Guilan province located 
at the north of Iran. Results obtained for the risk values and variance of each model and the analysis of the results, it

is observed that the maximum risk model has the less variance compared to the other two models. Therefore, it will 
be selected as the selected model to meet the main goal of the research, which is the proper distribution of risk in the 
network. Then, the absolute value error model and the bounded proportional risk model will be known as the best 
approach for Hazmat transport risk distribution over the intercity network.  
Further researches in this area are recommended to extend the current research to a larger, nationwide scale, or to 
distribute risk for a specific category of hazardous materials that are present more than other materials in the road 
network of Guilan province and are of higher importance for the safe delivery. Further studies can be also focused 
on other methods for distributing risk in the network, changing the studied parameter or changing the decision 
criteria for distribution of risk in the network, minimizing variance, and turning the nonlinear model into a linear 
model.

Abstract  
In this study, a simulation model was developed in order to forecast and analyze air passenger 
demand and to determine when a capacity expansion in Istanbul Atatürk International Airport 
will be needed using System Dynamics approach. In thorough literature survey it is found that 
average airfare, runway capacity, average number of flights per day, level of service, births, 
deaths, immigration to Istanbul, immigrations from Istanbul, population of Istanbul, Gross 
Domestic Products and Gross Domestic Products growth rate are key factors considered when 
creating models for air passenger demand. In this paper, we insert terror attacks as a new factor 
that may affect air transportation demand in Istanbul Atatürk International Airport. Increase in 
the number of terrorists may increase the number of attacks and may have a very negative effect 
on the mobility of people who live in Turkey or who want to visit Turkey. There were always 
terror attacks in Turkey in past too, but after ISIL emerging terror threats became more frequent. 
So terror became a very important factor which effects air passenger demand in Istanbul Atatürk 
International Airport in 2014 after terrorist attacks of ISIL. But results in this paper show that 
although terror might have a negative effect on air transportation demand, other factors for 
example airfare, population, runway capacity etc. play dominant roles and capacity expansion in 
Istanbul Atatürk International Airport will be required until 2023. This paper shows that capacity 
of Istanbul Atatürk International Airport will not be enough for air transportation and a new, 
bigger airport will be needed. Turkey has already started constructing a new airport in the north 
of Istanbul in 2014.

Abstract 
This report focuses on research done at XYZ Transmission Plant case lines. The study was conducted in 
order to develop a methodology for improving the manufacturer’s ability to forecast and predict the
variation of demand throughout the year. The current forecasting model is to simply look at historical data 
to determine how much demand for the 8 speed and 9 speed transmission case will be required on an 
annual basis. The current forecasting model in placed at XYZ transmission plant has brought problems 
due to ineffective forecasting that has resulted in product stock outs and loss of sales. Economic order 
quantity and forecasting guide to control and reduce the product stock outs.  The forecasting method used 
is the rolling average method, which takes previous historical demand and calculates the average for the 
next forecasting period. CNC is a computer numerical control machine tool which uses a programmed 
control system of an automatic machine tool.  This control system is able to handle with the programs 
which have logic control code or other symbols in accordance with procedures prescribed by the 
instruction. The purpose of this research is to develop the capability to integrate seasonality and other 
variation into a model, which will allow for more rigorous and accurate forecasting. The 8-speed case was 
less expensive to purchase and had a lower calculated EOQ, which could be due to the increased volumes 
of the 8-speed, which may lower total cost by producing in (greater) “bulk” quantities. The calculation for
forecasting methods in order to reduce the company’s products stock outs. The forecasting methods that
calculated will help to determine the amount of products in the previous two years.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing is a methodology that focuses on reducing waste, increasing productivity, and improving quality and 
safety in a systematic and organized way. WCM engages the workforce to provide and implement suggestions on 
how to... Transmission plant completed and production began in 1956. FCA announced in May 2010 that it would 
invest $43 million to adapt the plant for production of the World Engine and improve processes for the 62TE 
transmission program. Then in June 2010, the Company announced that it would invest $300 million to produce a 
new, fuel-efficient eight-speed automatic transmission for future vehicles. An investment of an additional $85 
million was announced in December 2010. In February 2013, the Company announced an investment of $212 
million at the XYZ Transmission, Tomo Casting and Indiana Transmission I Plants for additional tooling and 
equipment to produce the eight- and nine-speed transmissions, which would add up to 400 new jobs. Production of 
the eight-speed transmission began in September 2012. FCA confirmed in December 2014 that it will invest an 
additional $266 million to increase capacity of the fuel-efficient Torque Flite eight-speed transmission.  Production 
of the 42RLE ended in early 2012.  Since 1974, XYZ has built more than 67 million transmissions. The 17-million 
four-speed milestone was achieved over a 25-year period from 1988 to December 2013. The plant began building 
the six-speed in 2006 and reached the three million mark in April 2014.  In December 2014, XYZ achieved the

From the calculations, the optimal purchasing cost for the 8-speed transmission case from Machine 1 was 
approximately $5,562,400 for one year.  For the 9-speed case from Machine 2, the optimal purchasing cost was 
$3,429,600.  The optimal EOQ for Machine 1 was $263.69, while Machine 2 was $207.05.  The 8-speed case was 
less expensive to purchase and had a lower calculated EOQ, which could be due to the increased volumes of the 8-
speed, which may lower total cost by producing in (greater) “bulk” quantities. The calculation for forecasting 
methods in order to reduce the company’s products stock outs. The forecasting methods that calculated will help to 
determine the amount of products in the previous two years.  Based on that, it can determine the amount of products 
in the next year.  It used two kind of forecasting which are Moving Average Demand and the other one is Seasonal 
Index. From table 4, the company needs to order 20341 units to meet the demand for the next quarter.  The 
minimum MAD that got is 18 for 4 quarters.  Figure 1 illustrates the product behaviour over 8 quarters. From table 
5, the company needs to order 12465 units to meet the demand for the next quarter.  The minimum MAD that got is 
71 for 7 quarters.  Figure 2 illustrates the product behavior over 8 quarters. 
 
11. Conclusion 
 
Understanding economic order quantity and the forecasting model will help company to reduce their stock outs. The 
recommended model provides two different forecasting techniques which will be more accurate in forecasting the 
end result for different product. The optimized order quantity for each transmission case will reduce the company's 
product stock out issue.

Abstract  
 
It is very important to understand the factors affecting tendency of smoking for healthcare and public 
policies. Smoking is a major risk factor for health. Smoking cigarettes kills more than alcohol, car 
accidents, HIV, guns and illegal drugs combined according to the American Cancer Society. In order to 
manage public policies for the success of smoking cessation, it is essential to understand how this 
behaviour can be affected and what the important factors are. Tobacco smoking habit is defined as a 
psychiatric disorder including cognitive, behavioural and physiological symptoms by American 
Psychiatric Association. Since it is defined as a behavioural disorder we need to make clear understanding 
of what stages exist and how can they be handled in this behavioural change. This study is done in order 
to demonstrate the quitting smoking behaviour with stages using System Dynamics (SD) methodology. 
The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TOPD) and The Stages of Change model (SoC) explains how human 
behaviour is guided. Different factors which affect quitting smoking behaviour are extracted from these 
theories. The proposed system dynamics model provides important findings about quitting smoking 
behaviour model. And these findings can guide the policymakers to improve the behavioural change in 
smoking addiction.

Abstract  
 
The photovoltaic industry is present everywhere in the world, but there is a clear concentration in the 
industrialized countries. As part of their energy strategy and given their dependence on the outside for the 
energy supply, industrialized countries give priority to the development of renewable energies and 
sustainable development, including photovoltaic (PV) energy. This work aims to facilitate the approach of 
this fascinating and promising technology: it concerns the coupling of PV systems to the utility grid from 
the control/synchronization point of view. For this purpose, this work presents the modeling and control 
of a three-phase inverter for grid-connected PV system, an improved digital PI current control algorithm 
is used to remain the current injected into the grid sinusoidal and a performance synchronous reference 
frame Phase-Locked Loop (dqPLL) is used as the synchronization technique.

Figure 11. Time evolution of simple Voltages at the output of the inverter. 
 
The results presented in Figure 10 and 11 show that the inverter/grid synchronization and control are done with 
success. At this point, the photovoltaic grid-connected system is managed successfully. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The problem of integrating photovoltaic modules into the built environment is different now from a few years ago 
when photovoltaic systems were only imagined in isolated sites. Photovoltaic comes to the city, by the technique of 
connection to the power utility grid. Our goal in this study was the simulation of a photovoltaic system and its 
connection to the utility grid, using a performance technique for grid synchronization and an improved control 
strategy to control the injected current into the utility. The results mentioned in this paper show that the photovoltaic 
grid-connected system was managed successfully. 
The integration of a PV production to the utility grid is not without negative impacts, it is this point which must be 
treated in what follows.

Abstract 
 
This paper proposes a new multi-criteria decision making model to evaluate product design alternatives. It 
enables us to evaluate architecture of a new product by considering different criteria relating to product, 
process, and supply chain design. The model also uses life cycle assessment to evaluate alternatives. To 
deal with the vagueness of some data used in life cycle assessment, fuzzy set theory is employed. A real 
case is used to illustrate the efficiency of the model. In final, the conclusions and future research 
directions are proposed.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to examine relationships between personality factors and customer switching 
for services. Earlier research was directed towards establishing relationship between individual 
personality traits and customer switching variables considering five-factor model comprised of five 
personality dimensions (OCEAN), in which personality was not the only influencing factor. Moreover, 
these works were found to be focused on products and not services. In contrast, the current study is aimed 
at investigating role of personality using Myer Briggs Type indicator (MBTI) as well as Five-Big Factors, 
on customer switching and building the conceptual framework on services rather than products. MBTI 
also known as four opposite pairs or dichotomies of personality dimensions in our study are studied using 
different levels Involvement (High, Low) of consumer and Value of service-offering (Value for money 
and Premium) as moderators associated with Consumer Switching. The study is unique in sense that 
consequences of these indicators of personality on switching behavior has never been studied considering 
moderating effect of involvement and value of services. According to our prepositions for a more 
Extrovert, Intuitive Personality the switching is going to be high whereas the switching is going to be less 
for an Introvert, Judgmental kind of personality. Similarly, for a consumer with high Neuroticism and 
Agreeableness the switching would be less as compared to an Open and Conscious Personality type. 
These level differs with level of a consumer’s involvement and type of a service being offered based on 
its value.  
Keywords

1. Introduction 
In conventional marketing, Consumer switching and loyalty have been studied together as more of a same 
phenomenon. (Dick & Basu, 1994; Knox & Walker, 1995; Zeithaml, Berry, & Parasuraman, 1996; Knox, 1998). 
Until recently, when these have been separated (Keaveney, 1995; Hill & Alexandar, 2000) after realizing that 
customer may still switch even after being loyal and satisfied. These factors for consumer switching can fall into 
different categories of core service failure, service encounter failure, employee responses to service failures, pricing, 
inconvenience, competition, ethical issues, and involuntary switching (Keaveney, 1995). Apart from these 
demographic factors such as age and income, as well as individual factors such as risk aversion can influence

Abstract  
 
Combined heat and power systems also known as trigeneration and cogeneration systems are capable of 
providing electricity, heating and cooling powers using one fuel simultaneously. Natural gas, biogas and 
landfill gas can also be used as fuel for these systems. Natural gas is the most popular power source that is 
used in trigeneration systems and common fuel in the Turkish market due to its accessibility and 
sustainability. Trigeneration system projects are complex and require interdisciplinary engineering study 
and coordination. An active and effective project management is requirement because of high initial 
investment costs. 
In general, one can say that a project is successful if requirements are met on schedule within budget and 
delivers a good return on investment. In today’s competitive market failures such as project delays or 
excessive budget use are not uncommon but costly. Though management of risk associated with these 
failures are the main concern of a successful project manager. 
In traditional project management, whole project consists of independent processes where no interaction 
exists. However, as projects get complicated and larger this assumption needs to be reconsidered. System 
dynamics approach can be an alternative solution by its ability in understanding interactions and its 
feedback structures. 
In this research, the factors that affect budget and timeliness of trigeneration system projects is analyzed 
using system dynamics. Alternative scenarios are developed and reduction of gap between planned and 
realized budget and schedule target are examined. It is showed that developed model can be used by project 
managers as a decision support system.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to create a comprehensive list of lean tools that prioritizes and assigns 
the level of implementation of these tools based on manufacturing strategy objectives.  This 
empirical research utilized data collected from 32 automotive Big Three (GM, Ford and Chrysler) 
facilities in United States.  The surveys were completed through interviews with 164 senior 
managers at automotive facilities that implemented lean manufacturing since early 21st century. 
The aim was to investigate the type of lean tools implemented, the level of implementation, and 
the categorization of lean tools with respect to performance dimensions.  Data was analyzed using 
SPSS software.  Result indicates that lean manufacturing is more effective and efficient when 
companies follow a comprehensive implementation of dimensions. The results demonstrate that 
execution level of lean tools varies based on manufacturing strategy objectives. Driven by its depth 
and breadth on lean manufacturing, this paper is unique because is provide a guide for researchers 
and practitioners on lean implementation tools in manufacturing industry and their direct impact 
of specific operational performance metrics.

1.Introduction
The new worldwide business market which emerged after the Second World War focused on satisfying customers’
demands and interests by way of distributing creative and personalized products (Taj & Morosan, 2011). This market
was led by changes in buyers’ approaches and views where they became more cautious about purchasing high-quality
products at affordable prices (Mishra, Pundir, & Ganapathy, 2014). Manufacturers were forced to adopt new
production system after these alterations aroused. Thinking of new tools and techniques in substitution of mass
production was an essential task for organizations to stay competitive in this challenging market (Taj & Morosan,
2011)and (Bhamu & Sangwan, 2014).  They were forced to understand what people value as a product and attempt to
manufacture the wants of consumers with a reduction in prices. For them to provide the best value for customers while
maximizing profits in the customer-oriented and limited resources market, most corporations intended to implement
Lean Management (LM) (Bhamu & Sangwan, 2014). Lean management is coined with the principle of using fewer
resources as well as enhancing the value added activities plus eliminating wastes from the production process to derive
the best efficient production system (Sharma, Dixit, & Qadri, 2015). Improving quality, decreasing lead time, and
reducing cost are reported as the main and central goals of lean (Sanchez & Perez, 2001).
Lean Management was initially applied in Toyota, the Japanese Automotive company which was known as 
the core foundation of this concept (Bhamu & Sangwan, 2014), and (Piercy & Rich, 2015), (Sisson & Elshennawy, 
2015); (Ljungblom, 2014). Toyota turned to lean when it recognized the struggle to meet customers’ needs and at the 
same time maintain its competitive advantages taking into consideration the economic reality regarding shortage of 
available resources (Ghosh, 2012). After implementing lean production system, Toyota proved its capability of

effective, enhanced and efficient method to decrease waste and build up the appropriate implementation of tools that 
address their goals and serve as solution for their problems. Obviously, this research justifies the comprehensive 
implementation of lean tools with dissimilar level of implementation based on their manufacturing strategy to establish 
high business performance.

Abstract  
 
One of the most important problems in the hospitals is classification of epilepsy groups. Classification of epilepsy groups 
(CEG) is also an important indicator for assessing the prognosis and drug treatment. We used feed-forward neural network 
approach and regression model for prediction of the CEG based on the inputs obtained from the EEG signals and properties 
of the patients. In the neural network, inputs (sex, age of seizure groups, seizure types, and the loss of consciousness, blood 
pressure values, and frequency bands from EEG signals) and a single output (CEG) were used. In the study that used a single 
intermediate layer, Levenberg-Marquardt was chosen as training algorithm and the study was applied in Matlab 14a. 
Learning, validation, test and system performance were examined for different neuron numbers. The neural network results 
were compared with the linear regression model. R square was also expected as above 90 percent. The neural network model 
used for the CEG was achieved 94 percent. This showed that the neural network performed better than linear regression.

Abstract  
 
Maritime logistics is regarded as the primary means of transporting goods on a global scale, and have recently attracted by 
academics and practitioners. The development of maritime logistics is due to the changing role of shipping and logistics 
chains, rapidly increasing and changing demands of customers. It includes port operations, transportation of goods, global 
resource utilization, and outsourcing. It also covers new concepts such as managing risks related with maritime operations to 
improve quality and performance. Risk management has gained importance nowadays. Many methods are used for the 
risk management problems. The maritime logistics is not widely investigated based on the risk management 
approach. Otherwise, marine operations have risk problems that affect both the people and the environment. 
Reduction or preventing of the all risk factors should be ensured using risk management approaches. In this work, I 
conduct a literature survey about the risk management methods used for maritime logistics. Then, future trends and 
suggestions are given.

Abstract 
 
The rate of globalisation around the world and the corresponding emergence of innovative technologies 
daily calls for an efficient and sustainable learning strategy for professionals. It is therefore imperative for 
professionals to be well-equipped with requisite knowledge and skills to maintain relevance in their field 
of practice in tandem with the global sustainability paradigm. Nature is notably a rich source of 
inspiration for high performance, resource efficient, and innovative solutions due to its over 3.8 billion 
years of evolutionary refinement. Hence, biomimicry, a field that study and emulate nature’s forms, 
processes and strategies to find sustainable solutions to human challenges. This paper sets out to explore 
the biomimicry problem-based approach as exhibited by nature, in maintaining relevance and 
sustainability. A quantitative research method was adopted and a structured questionnaire was used for 
data collection. Data analysis reveals the systematic approaches towards understanding and emulating the 
mechanisms behind the survival, sustenance and longevity of organisms in nature. The outcome of this 
study will provide professionals and other stakeholders in the construction industry with a nature-inspired 
approach for achieving sustainable innovative solutions.

1. Introduction 
 
Globalisation with its resultant industrialisation and migration among other factors poses a lot of challenges 
which has resulted in the birth of innovative solutions in tackling them. Hence, an effective, efficient and time-tested 
learning strategies appears as a necessity to keep pace with the constantly changing career paths of professionals due 
to these transformations on the global scene. In the last decade, there have been records of an increasing birth of 
innovative technologies in response to global demands. This explosion of knowledge evident through various 
technological and product innovations therefore requires professionals to learn afresh at well-paced intervals of their 
lives (Duţă & Rafailă, 2014). In this age, the knowledge, aptitudes, skills, trades, strategies and approaches acquired 
by professionals reaches its limits very fast (Manole & Alpopi, 2013). In addition, professionals and other 
stakeholders need to be kept abreast continuously of the various technologies in order to encourage their 
acceptability, adoption and implementation. One of the ways of filling this gap is through a robust learning path for 
professionals either in a formal or informal system.

state to an effective and resilient one, by its potential to proffer sustainable solutions to identified existing 
challenges.

7. Conclusion and Recommendation 
 
The study has shown the existence of a gap in the learning path of professionals in keeping abreast with the 
consistent changing and advancing technological terrain. In keeping to date with these changes in maintaining 
relevance, professionals are now heading outside the box and consulting with the natural environment proven to be 
of high performance. However, one major hindrance to this effort identified in literature is the lack of a 
comprehensive and well-defined approach for adopting, applying and incorporating nature’s blueprint that have 
made them to become models, measures, and mentors of sustainability. However, the study showed that 
professionals agreed that the application of the stages involved in the problem-based approach of biomimicry would 
offer sustainable learning process. Though, the pattern of this approach follows a progression of different steps. It is 
an approach effectively spearheaded by engineers, innovators, and designers identifying preliminary design 
objectives and frameworks (El Ahmar, 2011). Here, the professionals look to the living world for solutions by first 
identifying the challenges with biologists needed to correspond these to organisms that have resolved similar cases 
(Zari, 2007). Hence, the need for multidisciplinary collaboration among the professionals in order to maximize the 
in-depth knowledge and learning pattern that nature has to offer through biomimicry. Awareness, training, and 
education of professionals on this significant biomimicry approach should also be encouraged for its adoption and 
application to be widely embraced. Integration of biomimicry into the university curricula and likewise the 
continuous professional development activities of professional bodies is therefore highly recommended. It is also 
recommended that government and other authorities, with the full support and partnership of professional bodies, 
should put in place policies and frameworks that will be encourage the adoption and application of biomimicry. This 
is believed will result in the birth of innovative and novel technological solutions with sustainable characteristics to 
human challenges.

Abstract 
 
Today, the world is involved in a cyber-physical technology revolution that is called Fourth Industrial 
Revolution or Industry 4.0. However, Lean Manufacturing and Lean Thinking are theoretical-practical 
approaches that still have a 25 years old framework.  
We started with a primary assumption: the emerging of cyber-physical systems and robots; additive and 
nano manufacturing, high interconnectivity and interoperability; biotechnologies and integrated 
ecosystems; have established an urgent re-formulation of the “lean thinking” foundations. 
This research seeks for answers to what theoretical principles must to be changed in “lean thinking” using 
a Grounded Theory design with hermeneutical analysis of qualitative data and theoretical saturation in 
different lean enterprises located in Costa Rica, Central America. 
We conclude that classic lean manufacturing must to evolve to a “lean enterprise 4.0” approach with a 
new framework of theoretical foundations. The adding value process must to open to environmental and 
social purposes and the “value stream” is not a chained system anymore; this implies hat the concept of 
MUDA must to be aligned not only with “cost reduction” but with customer needs and sustainable return 
on investment. In addition, MUDA re-conceptualization implies the analysis of new categories related 
with data management, machine learning and software architecture.

Abstract 
 
South Africa’s education sector comprises various individuals, all with different backgrounds, and this 
sometimes creates challenges when it comes to the teaching and learning processes, especially in 
construction education. This research assessed the impact of experiential training on construction 
education in South Africa. The study used a survey research design. Data were collected by the use of a 
structured questionnaire aimed at 130 respondents purposively selected among the students who were 
registered for Construction Management (CM), Quantity Surveying (QS), Civil Engineering and Building 
Science at a South African higher education institution. Out of the 130 copies of the questionnaire, only 
101 were usable and therefore analysed for the study using descriptive statistics. The findings from the 
survey indicate that most of the respondents were of the view that collaborative learning is effective. 
Also, the findings of the study suggest that majority of the students are aware that they are working with 
people from different cultural backgrounds with experiential training running between a period of six 
months and 12 months. Regarding the influence of experiential training on education of students of 
construction programmes, the finding shows that experiential training has an influence “in encouraging 
students to find greater meaning in their studies”; “in providing students with exposure to the real world 
of work”; “encourages students to develop a greater sense of responsibility”; “encourages students to 
place more reliance on their judgement” ; “in creating students who are readily employable”; and  “gives 
students access to possible funding sources in that order. The study concludes that experiential training 
influences education of construction students in South Africa.

1. Introduction 
 
Education is a method in which training, teaching and learning take place, mostly at a school or university to 
improve knowledge and to develop skills (Oxford Advanced Learners’ Dictionary, 2015). Education in construction 
is one of the contributing variables to the construction industry since it involves the process of teaching, training and 
learning about construction, infrastructure, structures and roads, amongst others. The construction industry is one of 
the biggest industries in the world and contributes greatly to the economy of any country.  It is responsible for all the 
construction and conservation of infrastructure and structures (Owolabi & Olatunji, 2014). Furthermore, it is an 
industry that plays a substantial part in a coun-try’s economy, irrespective of the country’s level of development; it 
also plays a significant role in the transformation of the physical terrain of any nation in its march toward greater 
civilization and economic independence (Owolabi & Olatunji, 2014). The importance of the industry is not only due 
to the fact that it is responsible for the infrastructure and buildings from which nearly every other sector depends on 
but also to the fact that it is a large sector in its own right (OECD, 2008). It is necessary to emphasize that 
construction education is done through various learning institutions which include colleges, universities and 
universities of technology. Like-wise, the learning institutions are the key centres for developing and foster-ing the 
necessary manpower needed to run the construction industry (Ayarkwa et al., 2011).

4.3. Discussion of Findings 
 
In some cultures, group dynamics are developed in a more systematic and sustained manner, with greater value 
placed on interdependence and collaboration than on individual performance (ECTE, 2005). The study findings 
revealed that 81 per cent of the respondents say collaborative learning is effective while 10 per cent of the 
respondents said collaborative learning is not effective and the remaining 9 per cent were not sure. The study 
findings further revealed that experiential training plays a role in encouraging students to find greater meaning in 
their studies, in providing students with exposure to the real world of work, in encouraging students to develop a 
greater sense of responsibility, in encouraging students to place more reliance on their judgement, in creating 
students who are readily employable and in giving students access to possible funding sources. The findings were 
similar to what the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) (2015) Prospectus outlined, namely that the 
experiential learning experience illustrates that the incorporation of theory and in-service/experiential learning 
creates diplomats who are more mature and readily employable.  
 
Similarly, this work experience encourages students to develop a greater sense of responsibility, place more reliance 
on their judgement, and find greater meaning in their studies. However, the findings were not in agreement with the 
study conducted by Haupt (2003) which revealed that the separation between practical and academic work creates a 
division in the mind of students rather than relating the theory to the application that reinforces the basic concepts 
taught in the classroom.  However, Hynds and Smith (2001) also state that the relationships with the industry are 
essential to programmes of post-secondary education in construction. Moreover, the NMMU Prospectus (2015) 
further adds that during the time when stu-dents are undergoing their experiential learning, they become exposed to 
people from diverse spheres of life and therefore develop greater confidence when working as part of a team.  
 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
This study sought to find the impact of experiential learning on construction education in South Africa. From the 
findings relating to the demo-graphic aspect of the study, it can be concluded that construction education is studied 
by people of various cultural groups: Africans, whites, Indians or Asians and coloreds, which indicates that all the 
ethnic groups were represented in the study. Also, the findings indicate that construction students are registered for 
courses in Quantity Surveying, Construction Management, Civil Engineering and Building Science. It can also be 
concluded that the majority of the respondents were young people who are from different cultural backgrounds. The 
findings also revealed that majority of the respondents take part in collaborative learning once a week or two to three 
times a week or more. Additionally, most of the respondents were of the view that collaborative learning is effective. 
Furthermore, majority of the students are aware that they are working with people from different cultural 
backgrounds. It can also be concluded that for construction related programmes, students did their experiential 
learning between a period of six months and 12 months. It is also evident from the study that experiential training 
has an influence in encouraging students to find greater meaning in their studies and in providing students with 
exposure to the real world of work. Further, it encourages students to develop a greater sense of responsibility and to 
place more reliance on their own judgement. Above all, experiential learning has an influence in creating students 
who are readily employable and it gives them access to possible funding sources.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of culture on construction education in South Africa with 
a view to determining how cultural backgrounds influence students’ behavior. The data used in this paper 
were derived from both primary and secondary sources. The secondary data were collected through a 
detailed assessment of related literature. The primary data were likewise collected via a structured 
questionnaire aimed at 130 respondents who were students registered for Construction Management 
(CM), Quantity Surveying (QS), Civil Engineering and Building Science at a South African higher 
education institution. Out of the collected 130 questionnaires, only 101 were usable, representing a 
response rate of 78 per cent that was deemed viable for statistical analysis for this study. Data received 
from the questionnaires were analyzed using descriptive statistics procedures. The higher education 
institution used for the study has a variety of students and lecturers: through this study it is evident that 
the cultural background of the students shapes their attitudes and values, knowledge base as well as the 
skill set and these, in turn, influencing classroom behaviors, their study habits, their writing styles and 
faculty student interactions. The study concluded that culture is an important concept when it comes to 
education, especially construction education, which needs to be managed appropriately. The study, 
therefore, recommended that in order to manage cultural differences, students need to be aware of the 
cultural backgrounds of those with whom they work and interact since failure to manage cultural 
differences in a collaborative learning environment could possibly lead to student failure.

1. Introduction 
 
The Republic of South Africa (RSA) is a multicultural democratic country in Africa which is bordered by countries 
such as Mozambique, Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Zimbabwe. The country is divided into nine 
provinces and has a total population of about 54 million people (2014 mid-year estimate) Statistics South Africa 
(Stats SA) (2014). In 2013, there was a total of 136 public and private higher education institutions (HEIs), where 23 
of them were public HEIs and the remaining 113 private. From these higher education institutions, 85 per cent of the 
students were enrolled in the public HEIs and this large percentage saw the Department of Higher Education and 
Training (DHET) establish two new public HEIs in the same year. The two new public HEIs are the Sol Plaatjie 
University and the University of Mpumalanga which both started operating in 2014. Higher education institutions 
(HEIs) have become essential for employment, for social mobility, economic development and growth and to this 
day, the significance of a vibrant higher education sector is even internationally recognized (Pouris & Inglesi-Lotz, 
2014). The role of education in improving work-skills, learning and in developing personal preferences is 
unquestionably important and it continues to be one of the pointers of human development and wellbeing (Timæus 
et al., 2011).

Further, the research findings revealed that the cultural background influences the students’ values, attitudes, student 
interactions, the study habits, the classroom behaviour, the writing styles, the ability to change, the knowledge base, 
the skill set and the abilities to learn of construction students. The findings were in agreement with the study by 
ECTE (2005) which highlighted that the cultural background of the students shapes their attitudes and values, 
knowledge base as well as the skill set and these, in turn, influence classroom behaviours, their study habits, their 
writing styles and faculty student interactions. The findings are also in agreement with the study by Baier (2005) that 
indicates that we are shaped by our view of those outside our defined culture based on the differences in religion, 
language, ethnicity, values and norms. Also, our identity with regard to where we were born and raised influences 
our behaviour and the ability to adapt to changes (Kagerer & Gandarilla, 2011).  
 
 
5. Conclusions and Implications of Research Findings 
 
The findings indicated that cultural background influences the construction students’ values more than the other 
factors such as attitude, student interactions, the study habits, classroom behaviour, the writing styles, the ability to 
change, the knowledge base, the influence on the skill set, and the abilities to learn. Furthermore, most of the 
respondents reported that they refer to their lecturers by their titles and surnames and only a few of the respondents 
said that they use either ‘Sir/Madam’ or they just refer to their lecturers by name. 
 
A failure to manage cultural differences in collaborative learning could lead to a decrease in productivity; it may 
cause delays in project deliveries; it may create a bad image for the group; it leads to project failure, and it gives the 
group a weak competitive edge.  
 
From the above findings, it is evident that the cultural background of the students influences their attitudes and 
values, the knowledge base and the skill set.  These in turn influence the classroom behaviours, study habits, the 
writing styles and their student interactions. Additionally, people’s identity regarding where they were born and 
raised influences their behaviour and ability to adapt to changes.

Abstract 
 
Today, there is increasing competition in all markets. Companies must evaluate performance in order to 
be able to survive in this competitive environment and to be able to see the extent to which they achieve 
the targets that they set. The concept of logistics, which is an advanced expression of the concept of 
transportation, has become one of the most important means of playing a role in the recovery of economic 
indicator. In this context, companies have begun to make more efforts to improve their logistics 
performance. Performance evaluation is an important issue for firms and requires the use of certain and 
uncertain data in the decision-making process. In this study; a large size logistics company's performance 
evaluation made with fuzzy analytical hierarchy process method. In the first phase of the study, the global 
weights were evaluated by using the fuzzy AHP method. After that, Weighted Score method was used 
and the result were calculated.

Abstract 
Visual comfort is an important parameter for evaluation of existing building spaces and for designing of 
buildings to be constructed. Any indoor environment is not comfortable or satisfactory if the illumination 
is poor. In this paper the authors have analyzed the data collected through experiments performed in 
various illumination settings in laboratory. Measured and calculated values of illumination level, position 
index, Unified Glare Rating (UGR) along with user based survey was used to perform regression analysis. 
The analysis was used to develop relationships between UGR and Illumination level with discomfort 
experienced by the users in same individual visual setting. The significance of discomfort glare along 
with illumination level in evaluation of building spaces has been discussed.

1. Introduction 
 
When evaluating building spaces for various task based requirements, man-machine interactions are observed. 
Along with such interaction, environmental factors including illumination or visual comfort are also significant 
(Attaianese and Duca, 2012). Illumination is related to one of the five human sensations and is as important as any 
other environmental factors to be considered in evaluating building spaces (Chiang, et al., 2001). Unified Glare 
Rating is the most commonly used rating system to quantify the discomfort glare due to poor illumination in any 
indoor environment. The light intensity or illumination level contributes towards visual comfort/discomfort. 
Changes in moods and behavior have also been observed due to poor illumination and discomfort glare (Katzev 
1992). 
 
The ill effects of poor lighting affect the comfort as well as the productivity of the occupants or workers. In order to 
evaluate the building spaces it is necessary to consider illumination level as well as discomfort glare. There are 
various standards available for optimum illumination levels for respective requirements in building spaces and same 
is the case for glare also, but there is no such data or relationship available which can help in evaluating the visual 
discomfort on the basis of both glare as well as illumination level.

Figure 3. Fitted line plot of Illumination Level v/s Visual discomfort 
 
The fitted line plot of Illumination level versus visual discomfort as shown in figure 3 signifies that the illumination 
level is not solely responsible for visual discomfort. The graph shows that even at low illumination levels the 
average visual discomfort is less and users are satisfied with the visual settings. Also the users feel low discomfort at 
high levels of illumination in the same environment but different position of light source. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
The experimental study which was conducted was to mainly emphasize on the importance of light positioning and 
glare in user comfort in any type of building space. The subjective data which was based on visual discomfort, 
revealed that illumination levels are not solely responsible in comforting the users but glare and positioning of light 
source according to the background luminance plays a vital role too. Through the regression analysis of measured 
and collected data for eighteen experiments based on different settings of illumination levels, light source type and 
different positions, following conclusions were stated: 
 
 
Higher UGR results in increased visual discomfort for users and an effort to optimize the UGR or glare 
should be made in order to achieve maximum visual satisfaction of the users in building spaces. 
 
Irrespective of the optimum illumination level the users may experience discomfort due to poor positioning 
of the light source. 
 
Solely UGR or Illumination levels are not responsible for visual discomfort. 
 
In order to evaluate the visual discomfort/comfort in building spaces, glare should also be considered along 
with optimum illumination levels. 
 
The relationships developed through regression analysis may further be used to evaluate and provide 
scoring for building spaces in context of visual comfort/discomfort due to illumination and glare. 
 
This study may fuel further studies based on visual comfort of users in building spaces. The ergonomic aspect of 
visual comfort cannot be overlooked and the discomfort glare along with other physical parameters might contribute 
towards overall assessment of comfort in indoor spaces.

Abstract  
 
Materials called very fine aggregate or filler may affect the performance of concrete in an either positive 
or a negative way. Discussions on aggregate containing very fine material are vitally important. The goal 
of the study was to determine how the content of filler might affect properties of concrete. The effect of 
applying different amounts of filler on concrete was then determined. An experimental approach 
developed a building product consisting mainly of limestone dust, which is considered as waste or by 
product material of aggregates industry. The majority of abandoned limestone powder wastes (LPW) is 
accumulated from the countries all over the world and causes certain serious environmental problems and 
health hazards. This paper presents a parametric experimental study which investigates the potential use 
of LPW combination for producing a low-cost and lightweight composite as a building material. The 
results of investigations on the suitability of using limestone dust as aggregate in lightweight aggregate 
concrete (LWAC) production are reported. In this way, different amounts of limestone dust were used. 
Some of the physical and mechanical properties of concrete mixes having high level of LPW are 
investigated. The obtained compressive strength, flexural strength and unit weight satisfy the relevant 
international standards.

1. Introduction  
Lightweight aggregate concrete (LWC), popular through the ages, was reported to have a comparable or some times 
better durability even in severe exposure conditions (Galetakis, 2004).  Researches had been conducted worldwide 
on a large number of natural or artificial lightweight aggregates (Ganesh Babu, 2004). The mix design of lightweight 
concrete is complicated because it depends on the type of lightweight aggregate (LWA). The use of a local product 
depends on its specific properties and the requirements for a particular job. One of the methods of producing 
lightweight concrete is to use light aggregate instead wholly or partially of normal concrete aggregates.  
The most important uses limestone dust are: in agricultural as liming material, in plastics and paper industry as filler, 
in iron and steel industry as flux, for flue gas desulphurization and for wastes neutralization. Since limestone dust is 
of varying quality it has to be further processed such as drying or screening or blended to meet the specific market 
requirements. There is an increasing interest to turn limestone dust into a building product (Khandaker, 2004). 
Nevertheless, there are limited numbers of studies about the possible utilization strategies of limestone in civil 
engineering industry (Turgut, 2007). Using limestone as lightweight aggregate in its natural form allows 
economical, lighter and environmental-friendly new composite material. 
In earlier studies, the effects of this material on fresh concrete properties and the influence on hardened concrete 
properties have been already pointed out the mechanical properties of concrete made from substitution of 30% of 
coarse aggregates by limestone (Kitouni, 2013). In addition, the mechanical properties of concrete made from 
substitution of 50% and 100% of coarse aggregates by limestone were studied (Kitouni, 2015). In this work, the 
mechanical properties of concrete made from substitution of 70% of coarse aggregates by limestone are 
investigated. Concrete test samples were standard cylindrical samples with 160 mm diameter and 320 mm length 
and were cast to examine the compression resistance and elastic properties. Furthermore, 7x7x28 cm prismatic test 
samples were used to examine the flexural tensile strength. For each test, three samples were prepared and cured for 
28 days, 90 and 180 days at ambient temperature until the time of testing.

Flexural tensile strength (MPa)
Age (days)
 
Figure 6.  Flexural test results at different ages 
 
The effect of age on the moduli of elasticity is shown in Figure 5. As with the compressive strength there is 
retrogression at later ages. It is noted that the later curing did not significantly decrease the E value as it did in case 
of the compressive strength (Table3). 
Compared to the compressive behavior of concrete, its tensile behavior has received a little attention in the past, 
partly because it is a common practice to ignore tensile resistance in reinforced concrete design. Interest in tensile 
properties has grown substantially in recent years partially due to introduction of fracture mechanics into the field of 
concrete structures. In addition, the flexural tensile of concrete is important to resist cracking from shrinkage and 
temperature changes. 
The flexural tensile of concrete specimens were measured up to 28, 90 and 180 days of curing (Figure 6). The 
variation of tensile strength shows trend, similar to that of compressive strength. It is concluded that the concrete 
strength depends on the strength, stiffness and density of coarse aggregates. For building materials to be used in 
structural applications, the minimum flexural tensile strength requires is 0.65 MPa (Turgut, 2007). 
The flexural tensile strength value was 6.23 MPa for samples with 70% replacement                     (Figure 6). 
Generally, the compressive strength is over 15 MPa and the flexural tensile strength is over 3 MPa. The increase in 
the flexural tensile strength has the advantage that the corrosion resistance of such concrete will be improved. The 
flexural tensile strength of concrete is one of the parameters that control the rate of reinforcement corrosion. 
Therefore, increased flexural tensile strength of concrete indicates the potential for an increase in the useful service 
life of the concrete structures (Mouli, 2008). 
 
4. Conclusions  
This paper demonstrates how the use technology can transform the cause of social and environmental disaster into a 
natural resource and, hence, can be used in the post disaster rehabilitation construction projects. It is confirmed that 
limestone can be used as a resource in concrete production and can be used in low cost construction especially in 
seismic zones. 
This experimental work showed that limestone can be used for the production of concrete with acceptable 
mechanical properties. However the complete investigation of limestone concrete, should include further tests 
concerning mainly with their durability. To investigate the utilization of limestone dust for the production of high 
strength building products, like concrete paving blocks, new specimens with higher cement content must be 
prepared and tested. Also the use of other types of cements, like cements with high Blaine value, may be 
investigated.

Abstract  
 
The work is focused on the study and analysis of the management of maintenance in the industry in general and in 
particular the transformation of polymeric materials in Cuba, focusing attention on the analysis of the deficiencies that 
occur in maintenance operations and in the inexistence of a procedure to execute it. The objective was to develop a 
procedure for the management of maintenance in the industry of transformation of plastic materials in our country. The 
results include the preparation of the procedure consisting of eight stages that must be progressively developed 
according to the current scenario of the organization, emphasizing the management and sustained optimization over 
time of processes associated with planning, programming, execution and maintenance control, aligned with the 
strategic objectives of the company and taking into account health and safety at work as well as the standards 
established for environmental protection.

1. Introduction 
The decade of the 80's of the last century, marks the beginning of the upswing and development of plastic materials in our country. 
Since its inception, production has been characterized by rapid growth, replacing metal, wood and ceramics, among others, thanks 
to its excellent properties and the low costs involved in its transformation (Pérez Rodríguez, 2005). The plastic industry in Cuba, 
although it does not have a development that places it in a top place in Latin America and the Caribbean, is not exempt of last 
generation machinery, exhibiting results that can be considered acceptable for our environment. 
The increase of the demand in our country of objects, pieces and plastic components, originates the growing need to create 
companies for the transformation of polymeric materials. This is how plastics transformation factories such as Cajimaya, in 
Holguín Province and Cienfuegos, which extrude polyethylene (PE) hosepipes and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipelines that are 
widely used by agriculture and by the Company of Telecommunications (ETECSA by its acronym in Spanish) as well as factories 
for plastic pipelines up to 900 mm in diameter in Holguín, La Habana and Ciego de Ávila. The growing development of these 
processes requires the implementation of actions that contribute to maintenance management as a first-rate task in this industry. 
The present work is focused on the study and analysis of maintenance management in the industry in general and in particular the 
transformation of plastic in Cuba. The present work focuses on the study and analysis of maintenance management in the industry 
in general and, in particular, the transformation of plastic in Cuba. 
The function of maintenance in the companies is one of the impacting elements in their results, due to the direct influence of the 
management of the same on the downtimes for the production area, the timely delivery and with quality to the clients and the costs 
associated to the works and inventories of spare parts (Pérez Rodríguez, 2005). As of February 2013, a chronogram was drawn up 
in our country that included the development of a process to diagnose the technical state of the facilities and maintenance 
management, implemented in 91 selected companies of 8 organizations. The main problems identified, according to the study

4. CONCLUSIONS 
1. The basic functions of maintenance management were identified: plan, organize and control and their operation, as indispensable 
requisites to achieve the optimum in this process. 
2. A procedure for the management of maintenance structured in 8 stages is proposed, which allows to guide the execution of this 
process in the plastics companies in general. 
3. The purpose of the proposed procedure is not only to maintain the machines but also the installations of: lighting, computer 
networks, electric power systems, compressed air, water, air conditioning, internal streets, floors, warehouses, etc. It must also 
coordinate with human resources a plan for the continuous training of personnel 
4. The partial application of the methodology allowed to verify its feasibility for the increase of efficiency in the companies of 
transformation of plastic materials in Cuba, demonstrating its logical consistency, flexibility, transcendence, perspective and 
relevance in the research framework.

Abstract 
 
As the business grows, the customer volume, varieties and complexity also grows accordingly.  In the 
testing area, the complexity is also higher with combinations of the tester, handler, test program, 
temperature and product. An effective solution is required to classify the accuracy of test time and index 
time and recommend the attention to the focus problem area. In this paper, the management of big data 
analytics was explored for recommending V93K tester platform focus area with high test time and index 
time deviation. The systematics will be able to summarize and help to decide quickly on the focus list for 
the factory engineers, manufacturing manager and operations to work on for productivity and gap closure.

With this project, the team is able to achieve 3 important outcomes:  
 
1) Increase the plan UPH from the initial plan UPH –Out-Of-Control-Faster (Yellow zone)  to UPH OK 
(Green zone) 
 
This gives the factory and operation the confidence that the machine UPH is stable and predictable on the 
output. The engineers can now focus on those machines or products that are truly the real problem. 
 
2) The amount of time to generate Top 20 focus list was reduced from 1 month to 15-30 minutes. The 
engineers can now work efficiently with this automated time study. 
 
3) The engineers able to detect quickly the Out-Of-Control-Faster / Out-Of-Control-Slower for 
improvement either caused by the test time and/or index time deviation. 
 
Conclusion 
 
This UPH Improvement Systematic allows various functional departments of Industrial Engineers, 
Equipment Engineers, Planners and Operations people to align better. This in turn leads to better machine 
stability, better capacity commitment and fulfillment of demand. 
 
Includes this improvement project in the weekly productivity meeting and reflect any changes required.

Abstract 
 
Building Information Modelling (BIM) is an advanced technology which is currently being used in the 
construction industries especially in other countries. However, there are still some barriers to implement 
BIM in Malaysia. This paper aims to determine the benefits of investing in BIM, explore the barriers to 
implement BIM and to persuade the implementation of BIM. The data was collected through interview 
targeting the construction player, and the data was analyzed. The result shows that the construction player 
agreed to the benefits and the implementation of BIM. However, there are still existing barriers to 
implement BIM in the Malaysian construction industry.

Building Information Modelling (BIM), benefits, barriers, implementation, construction industry 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Technologies are advancing day by day. With the constant developing, changing, and improvement of technologies, 
human’s life is getting easier, and works are completed faster. In order for the Malaysian government to achieve the 
status of developed country by 2020, they have been promoting and pushing the industries to adopt and utilise 
information technology (Zahrizan, Ali, Haron, Marshall-Ponting, & Hamid, 2013). Even in the construction industry, 
many new technologies are starting to be implemented to help change and improve the construction industry. 
According to Brandon et al. (2008) cited in Hosseini, Chileshe, Zou, & Baroudi (2013), construction industry was 
left behind by other industries in term of adopting new technologies. However, according to Thatcher Associates - 
an online blog, drones, Augmented Reality (AR), and Building Information Modelling (BIM) have already started to 
be use in the construction industry (Chaffe, 2016). 
 
Most construction industry acknowledges the adoption of technology, but they still resist investing time and money 
to see a better result (Gallagher, 2017). On the other hand, some construction industries around the world have 
started implementing BIM in their company. Therefore, this research is carried out to study the benefits and barriers 
of implementing BIM in Malaysian construction industry, especially in Kedah.  
 
1.1 Problem Statement and Objective 
 
BIM do provide many advantages to the construction players such as save cost and time of reworking, earlier 
detection of error, and detect clashing. However, there are barriers in implementing BIM in Malaysian construction 
industry. However, there are always problems that will arise in carrying out a project. For example, a project will 
run smoothly with good communication and understanding, but without proper visualization, a person will make 
mistakes. A client has a hard time understanding the building while some conceptual rendering was shown 
(AECMagazine, 2017). Besides that, communication difficulties between different parties will arise in the design 
and planning process. Thus, there is a need for Malaysian construction industry to know well the function and 
benefits of using BIM. Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore the benefits and barriers of investing in 
BIM in Malaysian construction industry.

5. Discussion and Conclusion 
 
This research found that currently the industry is good enough with using AutoCAD and have not implement BIM 
as BIM will only be beneficial if it involves big and complicated projects. However, the industry will start to 
implement BIM as they saw the benefits that BIM will offer in construction projects. Furthermore, this research 
found out that the barriers of implementation of BIM at the moment is cost, training, and resistant to change. 
 
Based on this research, BIM need to be expose more to Malaysian construction industry. More future research 
should be done and focus on Malaysian construction to help benefit the industry. Furthermore, maybe the industry 
can evaluate the differences of using BIM and traditional method in construction project. The researchers can help to 
develop a framework for the implementation of BIM that will be suitable for the local construction industry by 
referring to the successful implementation in other countries.

Abstract  
 
This paper analyze the professors narratives of different industrial engineering programs in Colombia, 
seeking to answer research question about the characteristics of configuration processes and 
transformation of industrial engineering education in the country, the methodology used was Bourdieu’s 
fields, from the habitus concept of professors while they are the education’s field agents. The study was 
approached from the analysis of social practices, in which more than mass events of a structural nature, it 
seeks to strengthen the collective memory of those who have been excluded from official history and 
serve as an educational space from study of processes and events that led to formation of social subjects, 
investigating the interaction and conflicts, in such a way that the past can be questioned according to 
current emancipatory projects. The configuration and transformation processes of industrial engineering 
as a knowledge discipline in Colombia between 1950 and 2000 were studied through the tensions and 
ruptures, the conflicts and new interactions generated from the developed world discourses. Critical 
analysis was considered as the best alternative in information treatment, because it facilitated the 
professors’ narratives analysis. For processing information it was utilized QDA (qualitative data 
analysis) y GEPHI (graph visualisation and cartography in data mining). 
 
Keywords  
Industrial engineering education, Bourdieu field’s methodology, social structures and practices. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The accession of the capitalism and the industrial strengthening that gave beginning to the production in mass and 
determined the need to adopt new forms of rationalization of the work, from the implantation of the development 
model, about 1950; an untimely managerial summit took place in Colombia that shot the demand for education in 
these areas, and motivated a new social division of the work. 
In 1958, birth the first Industrial Engineering Program in Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS) the teachers 
were coming from the careers of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering of the same university. In the same year, 
with the accomplishment of the first seminar of Scientific Administration, there is created the Instituto Colombiano 
de Administración - INCOLDA - that gave like proved the creation of the Career of Industrial Administration of the 
Faculty of Mines, now it annexes to the Universidad Nacional sectional of Medellin. In 1960 believe itself in 
Medellin the Escuela de Administración, Finanzas y Technología - EAFIT - and there is established the career of 
Industrial Engineering in Universidad de Los Andes. Hereby, the university device of the country was adjusting to 
industry requirements, which was coming applying the principles of work rationalization: the trades description, 
times and movements of the work, the cost measure is necessary of every operation and establishment of work 
standards and production incentives. 
During the 70s years as a result of the United Nations for the Development PNUD technical cooperation project, 
that which sought to direct top education to the occupational and technical thing as base of the economic growth, the 
increase arises for the demand of careers that are relatives with the administration of the industrial technology 
(specialized engineering), since it was the case of the industrial engineering, with the administration and 
'rationalization' of the State´s economy and of the private company (economy and relatives disciplines) searching of 
answers to the social demand for education and for solution of the social problems derived from the new form of 
economic growth. 
The processes of rationalization that gave origin to the industrial engineering in Colombia and then those of

persist and above all they insist on continuing reproducing and with new technologies, such as computer and 
informatics science, from cold and rigid principles of instrumental rationality that characterize the field since its 
emergence, and, in that sense, speaking of other discourses for the discipline is increasingly difficult. 
The serious danger involved in this problem of pretending to ignore the affective and social components present 
in all human activity within the discourse of industrial engineering professors, is nothing less than to underestimate 
the whole educational process, taking away its power of social identity construction and transformation 
─characteristic in every educational process─, it means, reducing it to a simple production of robots. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
With the configuration of the socialist bloc in world, after the second post-war period and the danger that for 
United States, as the nearest world power country, represented that this ideology was spread in Latin American 
countries, several studies and projects of cooperation and promotion to the industry were promoted. Education in 
technical and technological areas such as the Currie Study in 1951 ""Bases of a promotion program for Colombia"" 
and Atcon's basic plan on the Latin American university in 1961, favouring the emergence and demand of careers 
such as industrial engineering in the country. The emergence moment of education field in industrial engineering 
was marked by the influence of these reports. 
 
With communism fall in the world in 1989, the interests of United States to contain its proliferation in the 
underdeveloped countries through the policies of protection to imports and boost local industry (Mission Currie and 
Alliance for Progress), were untimely changed by the (Washington Consensus) promulgated now by the total 
opening of these economies, towards a completely globalized international market, devastating almost completely 
the local industry and forcing the education sector to further diversify and self-manage; so that, industrial engineers 
who were previously trained to run large companies or act as employees in them, now, they become trained to act as 
small entrepreneurs or independent consultants in the new neoliberal paradigm of globalization. The teachers' 
speeches are also updated in the same way. 
 
The central nucleus of industrial engineering professor’s habitus is composed mainly of a high symbolic and 
abstract reality content, in what could be called a capacity for mathematical modelling, predictive and prescriptive, 
which is used to build their stories and which converts in social capital to perform in the field. This capacity for 
modelling leads him to perceive the world only from its commensurable dimension, always susceptible to being 
improved and standardized, reducing its possibilities for analysis and critical reflection. 
 
Based on the interviews carried out, it is easily discernible how the teachers of the most recent generations give 
themselves more and more and without any reflection to the demands imposed on them by the university system to 
be able to stay in it, without opposing any resistance preventing it from arising a guild conscience and 
overshadowing any attempt at cohesion, each one works individually to meet academic standards, only meets with 
colleagues for the same purpose, is not interested in appropriating spaces for construction or deconstruction of the 
knowledge taught. 
 
Older and retired teachers are those who have greater capacity for reflection about their work, however, there are 
no institutional mechanisms to be heard and taken into account their assessments and recommendations within the 
universities. There are stories that show, that it would be better in this moment of global crisis, to speak of 
deindustrialization, and to speak rather of a humanization of the processes. 
 
The deindustrialization notion of productive processes and the return to more traditional modes of production, 
presented by one of the professors, where manual labour prevails and not mass production, is an interesting 
alternative for the deconstruction of developmental and globalization paradigms that characterize the current 
economic sector, which among others has relegated our economies to stop being producers to be outsourcing (our 
economy is concentrated in a precarious tertiary sector and in a high degree of informality of trade and services, 
because there is not industry). It is constituted in another fissure or point of break that could motivate new speeches 
for the professors of industrial engineering education field.

Present work becomes a call to the professors of industrial engineering, to abandon the comfortable position of 
experts, prescriptive and modeller of reality that keeps them safe in their pedestal of teachers, to stop hiding behind 
the institutions of higher education, that, ─they have not been anything else than the great nurseries of people, 
containing their actions─, to motivate their students to work in the deconstruction of the consumer and inequitable 
reality imposed with the development and globalization model, to think in new forms of production, to return to 
countryside, to get in touch with the peasant ancestors, to recover the knowledge lost during all the processes of 
violence and exile that we have suffered and to mobilize among all the recovery of the lost territory.

Abstract 
 
Nowadays customers’ requirements demand higher quality and better products but at a lower and more competitive 
price, such as the agricultural enterprise in this case study. The company defined a global goal of cost reduction for 
all its facilities to continue being competitive and a leader in the agricultural market, so the opportunity was set on 
the hydraulic sub-assemblies components and parts. The present case study was developed at the strategic sourcing 
department, looking to reduce the hydraulic components cost supplied by different providers due to the scale 
economy through the global supply chain without affecting the quality delivered in their final products and facing 
the demand growth.  The methodology used to accomplish the goals at the present study and research, was divided 
in four different stages such as a diagnosis of the current situation, the design of the new sourcing strategy, 
implementation of the strategy and monitoring and control of the results and key process indicators, also based on 
the Design for Manufacturing and Assembly methodology (DFMA) and Kraljic’s global sourcing strategy to 
accomplish the expected target on the total cost reduction.

1. Introduction 
 
Today companies are facing difficult challenges in order to become global competitors, starting with their 
production operations and manufacturing systems. Nowadays manufacturing approaches had been improved their 
performance through optimization in costs, so the enterprises need to focus their attention in a higher level attending 
needs through the whole supply chain. A very important link is known as sourcing supported by the purchasing 
activities, but the traditional purchasing function only was to support the operations providing materials on time and 
with the quality required to meet the assembly expectations. As we know, supplied materials represent an important 
percentage of the total product cost, so this research approach is focused in a strategy based on supplies’ cost 
reduction not for only one facility but as a global strategy in all the factories of the firm. 
Being a corporate project, the purchasing role is converted from tactical to strategic, intervening as a global agent of 
change in the way of supplying materials to the different plants, taking advantage of economies of scale and 
reducing input prices through higher-level volume negotiations. By now purchasing department become a decisive 
department for attaining competitiveness (Faber, Lamers, & Pieters, 2007).

The simulation results were a total system time of 213.92 seconds per sub-assembly (and the expected takt time was 
of 270 seconds). The operator percentage time in use was 54.45% and the percentage in transit time was 32.55%. 
The inactive percentage time was 13%.  The figure 9 shows pictures of the implementation.

To finish the operations, the physical cell was built and the manuals to operate the cell, Kanban calculations, process 
sequence documents, visual aids, aerial locations, and the containers were developed. 
In both cases, the cost reduction was achieved. 
6. Conclusion 
 
In summary, the supply management is a great opportunity for cost reduction in manufacturing. Classifying the 
purchased products with the KPM is a very interesting effort that helps the purchasing manager to make clear and 
good decisions related on how to handle the supplied parts and achieve the company goals with a strategic sourcing 
approach. 
When the strategy is defined, and the products in bottleneck quadrant are identified, the DFMA methodology helps 
for a good manufacturing process design to continue reducing the total product cost.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to examine the role of job demands on employees’ job performance. Using a sample of 
183 employees, the study investigated the impact of four variables of job demands including quantitative, 
problem solving, attention and responsibility demands on two variables of employees’ job performances 
such as task and contextual performances. Structural equation modeling analyses showed that the 
variables of job demands have negative and significant impact on employees’ job performances. The 
construct of job demands was designed as designed as second-order construct. The analysis from the 
second order model is utilized to examine the relationship between the independents variables of job 
demands and job performance. To validate the second-order formative construct model of job demands, 
alternative models were established for comparison with relative fit.

1. Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Model  
 
The job demands-resources (JD-R) model is an occupational stress model that suggests strain is a response to 
imbalance between demands on the individual and the resources he or she has to deal with those demands (Moodie 
et al., 2014). The JD-R model became highly popular among researchers (Moodie et al., 2014). The current version 
of the model proposes that high job demands lead to strain and health impairment (the health impairment process), 
and that high resources lead to increased motivation and higher productivity (the motivational process). The JD-R 
model developed by Demerouti and his associates (Demerouti et al., 2001), the JD-R model can be used as a tool to 
manage human resources in organizations because it can be applied to a wide range of occupations to improve 
employee wellbeing and job performance (Bakker et al., 2013).  
 
JD-R model argues that the factors or characteristics salient in a work environment determine the performance of 
employees at work (Moodie et al., 2014). According to this model, there are two general categories of work 
environment i.e. job demands and job resources study (Moodie et al., 2014; Bakker et al., 2013). Job demands are 
the physical, psychological, social and organizational factors which require constant physical and psychological 
efforts or skills and are therefore linked to physical and psychological costs whereas job resources are the physical, 
psychological, psychological, social and organizational aspects of a job which enable the achievement of goals and 
objectives while at the work place, reduce the negative effects associated with job demands to encourage personal 
growth, learning and development” (Luo et al., 2015).  
 
The model also proposes two psychological processes that take place as a result of the existence of perceived job 
demands and resources (Michelle, 2013). These processes relate to health deficiency and motivation. The health 
impairment process occurs when jobs are designed badly or those whose demands chronically deplete a worker’s",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Several 
studies 
state 
that 
competitiveness 
of 
international 
markets 
and 
the 
speed 
of 
technological evolution require companies to master and transfer their knowledge for greater 
performance and flexibility. Organizational performance often depends more on an ability to turn 
knowledge into effective action and less on knowledge itself (Alavi and Leidner 2001). This can result 
from good or bad choice concerning Knowledge Management tools. In this article, we focus on training 
as a frequently used knowledge management tool and propose a decision aid model for comparing 
training methods and choosing the most adequate one for each situation. Multi-criteria decision support 
methods have been in widespread use for a long time. The model, presented herein, is based on a 
combination of ELECTRE 1 method and the First Principles developed by Merrill in 2002. An 
application to industrial cases supports how this model can be useful for companies looking for more 
efficiency. Two types of training are studied and concerned consecutively Tacit and Explicit Knowledge.

1. Introduction
Nowadays global companies are experiencing a context of competitiveness never known before. With globalization 
and internationalization, cost optimization is a survival issue. At the same time, companies need more and more 
efficient human resources, which explains the maintenance of training and development investment budgets but with 
more expectations in terms of efficiency. In order to ensure the successful completion of a training action, it is 
necessary to focus on the analysis of the need but also the evaluation and the detailed comparison of the alternatives 
opened after this analysis. A good decision is money saved and a guarantee of efficiency.  
In this article we propose a model to compare between several training methods based on the multi-criteria decision 
aid method and using criterion from Merrill's First Principles. In the following section, we will review the place of 
training in business development. We will then give an overview of the Merrill's model of training evaluation. Section 
4 will present the ELECTRE 1 outranking method, and we propose, in the last part, two applications of our framework 
to two types of training that mobilized tacit knowledge for the first one and explicit knowledge for the second. Both 
cases are studied with multinational industrial companies based in Morocco, but the model is applicable to all sectors 
and to all types of training.  
2. Training as a performance lever
1.1 Training and business performance 
Training is a very old concept whose usefulness is no longer questionable today. So many studies focused on the 
impact of the training on the business performance. It’s now proven that competitiveness and survival of companies 
depends on the development of their people and consequently on the effectiveness of training process (Alvarez et al. 
2004). Even if the training return on investment is still difficult to assess, researchers and practitioners agree that it’s

5.2 Procedural training: standard revision in food company 
In order to support the usefulness of our model, we propose to help a Multinational food company based in Morocco 
to choose the best method to train its quality staff on the new version of ISO 9001:2015 Standard. 
This second case is very different from the first one regarding to the nature of knowledge concerned. In fact, the 
content of this second action is mainly an explicit knowledge and can be formalized and transferred under several 
forms.  
The analyze is still under process. We will present the results once they are validated with the company’s managers. 
6. Conclusion 
The training function meets more and more challenges and must be performant from the conception to the execution, 
the multi-criteria decision support method is an effective tool to help decision-makers to make rational and justified 
choices of training methods and techniques.  
This article proposes a model to compare training methods before engaging the investment. The Model is a 
combination of ELECTRE 1 method and Merrill’s First Principles. 
The case studied, in section 5, gives a demonstration on the contributions of this new model as well as the interest of 
its use in the companies in search of performance. The second case will bring a better understanding of the tool.

Abstract 
The term ‘Knowledge-Based Economy (KBE)’ is considered as an important strategy for the development 
of a country. It plays a crucial role to develop economic processes. It is therefore, critical to assess the KBE 
based on predefined Key Performance Indicators (KPI).  The aim of this research is to give an overview of 
the KPIs, which are accumulated based on extensive literature survey and can be usable to assess the 
Knowledge-Based Economies. This assessment process was specially focused to measure the influence of 
higher education institutions on corresponding process of transition towards a knowledge-based economy. 
The research also explores a number of currently available KPI frameworks that are introduced by 
international organizations (e.g. World Bank Institute, Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, Australian Bureau of Statistics and European 
Commission) to assess KBE. Based on the shortcomings of available frameworks, this research proposes a 
hybrid framework that can be used to assess KBE. This proposed framework is more comprehensive in 
addressing the role of the higher education institutions such as colleges and universities in the development 
of knowledge based economy.

1. Introduction 
 
The concept of KBE attempts to incorporate economic, social, and political influences that affect the ability of an 
organization or a higher institutions or universities to both create new knowledge and deploy that knowledge in 
economically useful ways. This approach therefore certainly contribute to economic growth and prosperity of a 
country (Bercovitz and Feldman, 2006). It offers to build a more general understanding of the relationships between 
the knowledge and its impact on economic development through knowledge-based innovation systems. Due to the 
accompanied benefits, over the past two decades, the economies of leading countries have increasingly evolved toward

Figure 4. Proposed Framework to Measure KBE 
 
The framework as proposed to measure the KBE can be considered as a blending between the EU framework and 
ABS framework. In the EU framework, there are 25 different indicators and 8 innovation dimensions that are used to 
measure the performance of KBE. Whereas, in the ABS framework has 3 core dimensions to measure KBE. The 
number of performance indicators of the proposed framework can be varied from one organization to another 
depending on the nature and type of organization. Similarly, institutional tasks are also varied from one organization 
to another based on the size and nature of the organization.    
 
By comparing both the EU framework and ABS framework from which the proposed framework is evolved, it is 
noticed that there are several similarities between them. The similarities between the two frameworks are displayed 
in Figure 5. From Figure 5, it is observed that 3 dimensions such as context dimension, innovation and 
entrepreneurship dimension and human capital dimension between the two frameworks are coincided with enablers 
and outcomes. At the same observation, it is also noticed that innovation, entrepreneurship, and ICT dimensions are 
coincided with enablers, firm activities and outcomes. However, economics and social impacts are not coincided with 
any of the enablers, firm activities or outcomes. Figure 5 also indicates the need for understanding and measuring firm 
activities from a contextual point of view. This is critical especially in understanding the role of the firm activities 
within the value added chain in the monetization of knowledge.

Therefore, while different sets of statistical indicators have been selected and grouped according to different aspects 
within the frameworks of international organization, they can be grouped into the above proposed framework. In other 
words, to fully understand the working of the KBE, classification of indicators are required beyond the conventional 
classification of international organization presented in previous section.  
 
4. Conclusions and Future Works  
 
In order to develop a knowledge base economy, it is necessary to develop a framework. This framework can helps to 
identify to measure the status of KBE of a country or state. The aim of this research study was to develop such a 
universal framework to measure KBE, especially in higher educational institutions. To fulfil such research objective, 
several available frameworks are reviewed critically. Based on the literature review it is noticed that there is no 
universally accepted framework to measure KBE in higher educational institutions. To fulfil such research gap, this

research study proposed a framework to measure the status of KBE of a nation. The proposed framework is developed 
based on the available EU framework and ABS framework commonly used to measure KBE. 
 
The proposed framework is especially applicable to assess KBE in higher educational institutions.   The higher 
educational institutions or universities are already involved in research to discover knowledge, but they also will have 
to ensure that a knowledge-intensive, high-skills workforce is available to give the knowledge value by bringing it to 
the marketplace in order to insure economical and social impact. This implies that such highly skilled workforce has 
to cover the entire value added chain from innovation to market entry and growth. In addition, in order to support the 
addition of value to the knowledge developed in an economy a complete support structure is necessary throughout the 
value added chain to enable the economical and social impact through cutting-edge knowledge and high-skills. It 
should be added that such a highly skilled workforce and support structure could be in house within the institutions or 
offered through public and private sector partners. Therefore, in order to understand how a university could contribute 
to the value of a state or region it is necessary to explore how value in a knowledge-based economy might be measured 
throughout the value added chain and how it is added through highly skilled workforce and a support structure 
including HEIs.  
 
Due to resource and time constraints, the proposed framework to measure KBE is not validated. In future, the proposed 
framework will be validated by applying it to measure KBE in organization, especially in higher institutions.

Chart 5 : Sensitivity analysis chart
 
The sensitivity analysis chart indicates that Contractor no. 4 has the highest level of sensitivity to criteria. In other 
words, experts gave higher scores to its sub-criteria. Moreover, Contractor no. 1 has the highest level of sensitivity 
to environmental criteria. In other words, Contractor o. 1 was more efficient in the environment than others were. 
3.2. Rank of contractors using TOPSIS
 
TOPSIS was employed to rank contractors by using the weights of sub-criteria obtained from the AHP. 
First, the decision-making matrix was formed for the five contractor companies by using the values of quantitative 
HSE performance of contractors, scored from 0 to 4 by project supervisors.

Important evaluation indices of HSE management system performance were determined for analysis of five active 
contractors based onHSE performance evaluation manual of NIGC contractors and a survey conducted on the HSE 
experts of the Gas Company ofLorestan Province.The weight of every index was then determined using AHP 
technique and Expert Choice application. Finally, contractors were ranked using TOPSIS method. 
Examination of the results revealed a relatively acceptable status of contractors in terms of HSE management. This 
was consistent with the other findings and the results of citation and observation checklists indicating the 
commitment of contractors to HSE requirements of employers. 
In general, despite the significance of score volatilities in every specialized area (positive in most cases), the HSE-
MS structure and relevant culture are still in the transition and establishment stage. However, periodic auditing and 
constant supervision can significantly facilitate this process. Moreover, employers should pay more attention to 
necessity of devising an encouragement system, attracting more participants and continuous trainingof employees in 
relevant areas in order to improve the HSE performance. 
The proposed model can be used by the employers of large organizations to evaluate the HSE performance of their 
contractors. Furthermore, the output of performance evaluation process can be employed to rank contractors by their 
HSE performance. This ranking can be used as an input to select contractors for the next projects.

Abstract  
 
Shopping centre in Malaysia has shown progressive growths and increasing level of competitiveness. 
Shopping centre plays a crucial role in promoting economic growth and urban development. Now, with 
the emergence of more shopping centre, undoubtedly the competitions between malls have become 
stiffer. Shopping centre that are unable to stand the test of time will not survive because of online 
shopping. Online shopping provides consumers with ultimate levels of convenience. Malls will never be 
able to compete with the endless product selection, price comparisons and always-on nature of online. 
Nor should they try. Instead, malls need to move in a different direction, away from commoditized 
shopping experiences and toward a broadened value proposition for consumers. Given this context, this 
paper brings the Malaysian shopping centres into focus by analysing the criteria and characteristic of the 
Kuala Lumpur shopping centre through classification of shopping centre. Delphi Method was selected as 
a reliable qualitative method based on the local context in developing criteria and characteristic of 
shopping centre ranking through the viewpoints of local expert panels. It is believed that the viewpoints 
can deliver guidance to the researcher in recognizing the quality of each shopping centre criteria in local 
environment. There are three rounds Delphi Method used through expert panels in various field including 
property valuation property management, architecture, estate agency, and building surveying. The study 
was successful in evaluating the criteria and characteristic of shopping centre in local context and it is 
expected to provide insights to the stakeholders in improving their investment and business decision of 
the shopping centre in Malaysia.

Abstract 
 
This paper discusses the Value-at-Risk Contribution under the asset liability model using the EWMA 
approach. It is assumed that asset returns and liabilities are time series data following the Exponential 
Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) model. Return of surplus which is the difference between asset 
return and liability is analyzed using asset liability model. In this case the risk of surplus return is 
measured using the Value-at-Risk model. When investments are made on multiple assets, each asset will 
contribute to the establishment of Value-at-Risk from the investment portfolio, which can be measured 
using the Value-at-Risk Contribution model. Using Value-at-Risk Contribution, it can be seen how much 
Value-at-Risk surplus investment portfolio, and what is the proportion of Value-at-Risk contribution of 
each surplus of investment asset. Based on the calculation of Value-at-Risk Contribution, can be 
considered for investors in investing in some assets analyzed.

1. Introduction 
Financial risk management aims to balance between risk and profit in accordance with established policies. These 
policies range from the limits of dynamic tactical decisions to strategic decisions in allocating capital to invest 
(Sukono et al., 2016). In investing, investors are generally well aware that there is a potential risk of loss that needs 
to be measured and carefully considered (Dowd, 2002). Usually risk is measured by using variance or standard 
deviation, but variance or standard deviation is an average risk measure. So it can not accommodate all the risk 
events that occur (Sukono et al., 2017.b). Then comes the idea of risk measurement using quantitative, better known 
as Value-at-Risk (VaR) (Khindanova & Rachev, 2005). VaR has become popular and has been widely used for risk 
measurement, by financial institutions for internal importance in decision making (Bohdalova, 2013). 
In making investment decisions, to minimize the risk of loss is usually done by portfolio setting. Portfolio 
formation is done by diversifying investments that is spreading investment in several assets with the aim to reduce 
risk (Sukono et al., 2017.a). Then there is the problem of how to measure the risk contribution of each investment 
asset to the overall risk of its investment. Haaf & Tasche (2002) and Huang et al. (2007), has conducted a study on 
how to measure marginal risk contribution to total portfolio risk. The study shows that Value-at-Risk Contribution 
(VaRC) risk measures can be used to measure the total risk contribution of individual assets to Value-at-Risk. Thus

variance is done by referring to equation (28). If you have a portfolio that produces four kinds of surplus returns, 
each with a proportion 1
d = 0.20; 
2
d = 0.20; 3
d = 0.25 and 
4
d = 0.35, then the result of estimation of variance and 
standard deviation of portfolio are: 
2p

= 0.027920 and 
p

= 0.167094. 
 Furthermore, the estimation is magnitude

VaRC  (

) is performed by referring to (30). If set the level of 
significance =0.05, then the standard normal distribution percentile is obtained

VaRC = 0.006740; 
2
VaRC = 0.006245; 
3
VaRC = 0.008016 and 
4
VaRC = 0.013262. 
So obtained 
p
VaR = 0.034263. 
 
Based on values of 
i
VaRC  (

) and 
p
VaR , it can be explained, that the first asset return and liability 
contribute a risk of 0.006740; second by 0.006245; third by 0.008016; and fourth by 0.013262 against total risk

 amount 0.034263. Thus, the values of risk contribution can be used as consideration for investors in 
investing in assets and liabilities analyzed. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This paper has analyzed the Value-at-Risk Contribution under the asset liability model using the EWMA approach. 
Asset price data and liabilities analyzed are generated by simulation techniques, each of 500. The results obtained 
that the analysis 
1
VaRC = 0.006740;

VaRC = 0.006245;

VaRC = 0.008016 and 
4
VaRC = 0.013262, 
p
VaR
= 
0.034263. These values are certainly very useful for investors in investing in assets and liabilities that are analyzed.

Abstract 
 
Pension fund is an alternative option in providing old-age insurance for employees who do not work 
anymore due to the expired working age limit, by way of planning periodic payments called pension 
benefits. One of the factors affecting the pension fund is the amount of basic salary of the last month and 
years of service. This study discusses the computation of pension fund using projected unit credit and 
pay-as-you-go method on the data of Insurance Company ""ABC"". The method used herein is to calculate 
the retirement benefits earned by participants after entering the retirement age, and the amount of the 
normal contribution to be paid by the participants of the pension plan and the actuarial liability to be paid 
by the company. The results show that the calculation of pension benefits and normal contributions using 
the projected unit credit method is more profitable for the employees because of the same fee as the pay-
as-you-go method, but the pension benefits received by the retired participants are greater.

1. Introduction 
Uncertainty of human life no one can predict it. For example, uncertainty will occur in the future. For a civil servant, 
productive age will support the welfare of his life, including home, car, health, and all the needs with salary earned. 
However, the welfare may be disrupted if the employee is sick, the accident causing the defect to the possibility of 
death, or unproductive again due to age (Haberman and Owadally, 2001; Owadally, 2003). Because of these risks, 
the need for welfare insurance to reduce the risk that will occur, one of which is the guarantee for old age (Lenze, 
2009). The old-age insurance program is intended to ensure and provide protection for employees who will retire in 
their old age (Gerke et al., 2006). 
The risk of old age causes the inability to earn an income and leads to economic difficulties for both 
themselvess and families / dependents. But this risk can be avoided or reduced by participating in the pension plan 
(Devolder and de Valeriola, 2017; Sukono et al., 2016). A pension plan is a remuneration program provided by 
employers / employers to improve the welfare of their employees in old age (Ramaswamy, 2012; Kompa and 
Witkowska, 2016). There are several methods of calculating pension funds. Among other methods are unit credit 
and pay-as-you-go (PAYG) method. Hendriksen (2017), Butt (2009), and Viorica et al. (2012), in his research

4. Conclusion 
In this paper has been discussed about comparing the calculation of pension funds using the projected unit credit and 
pay-as-you-go method on the data of the Insurance Company ""ABC"". Based on the calculation of the data used, it 
can be put forward some conclusions as follows. The calculation of pension funds in this study uses the assumption 
of the last salary with the rate of increase in salary ͳͲ% and interest rates of ʹ
ଵ
ଶ%. In addition, it is assumed that a 
person is calculated to be a retirement participant at the age  𝑒= ʹͷ years and retire at age 𝑟= ͷ͸ year. Based on 
the graph in Figure 1, the amount of retirement benefits obtained using the projected unit credit method is greater 
than the pay-as-you-go method. Based on the graph in Figure 2, the amount of normal dues to be paid by the 
participants using the projected unit credit method is similar to the pay-as-you-go. Based on the graph in Figure 3, 
the amount actuarial liabilities to be paid by the company using the projected unit credit is much larger than the pay-
as-you-go method. The projected unit credit method is more profitable for the employee than the pay-as-you-go 
method, since the pension benefits received are greater, even though the normal contributions paid by pension 
participants are almost the same.

Abstract 
Signal Groups of clique a compatibility graph is used to solve conflict between the traffic streams and 
hence can be used as a solution for traffic control problem at an intersection. In this paper we have 
considered cliques of the compatible graph as signal groups and the set of signal groups which can 
simultaneously move at an intersection is taken in a phase. Phasing of traffic lights is done by splitting 
the cycle time among these phases so that each set of signal group is allowed to move once in the 
cycle. 
Keywords : Compatibility Graph, Clique, Conflicting Streams, Phasing and Sequencing, Signal Group, 
Traffic Control. 
1. Introduction 
Traffic Theory is a physical phenomenon that aims at understanding and improving automobile traffic, and the 
problem associated with it such as traffic congestion (Gazis,1970). The traffic control problem is to minimize 
the waiting time of the public transportation while maintaining the individual traffic flow optimally (Gazis, 
2002). A significant development of traffic control systems using traffic lights has been achieved since the first 
traffic controller was installed in London in 1868. The first green wave was realised in Salt Lake City (U.K.) in 
1918, and the first area traffic controller was introduced in Toronto in 1960. At the beginning, electromechanical 
devices were used to perform traffic control. Then semi conductor-based controllers known as sensors were 
placed in different places to collect traffic information are used in traffic control system (Gu,W. and Jia X., 
2005; 2006). Nowadays, microprocessor based controller are used in Traffic Control Systems. In 1960’s a 
method of combinatorial optimisation approach of Branch and Bound type (Mitten, 1970; Suyudi et al., 2016; 
2017; 2018) was used for solving optimal traffic control problems (Locatelli, 2000). The combinatorial 
approach to the optimal traffic control problem was founded by introducing the Compatibility graph of traffic 
streams (Stoffers, 1968). The most common means of traffic control in modern cities is traffic control by traffic 
signals. Traffic signals made it possible to solve conflicts between traffic flows at intersections (Guberinic, 
2008). This goal however can be achieved in different ways and applications of particular methods have 
different consequences regarding the intersection capacity, delay, or environmental pollution. Traffic signals are 
introduced at an intersection to solve conflict between traffic streams in traffic control problems. For solving the 
control problem it is necessary to knowrelations between traffic streams at an intersection. By traffic streams we 
mean the following :

8. Conclusion 
Here we have used compatibility graph as a graph theoretic tool to study traffic control problem at an 
intersection. Traffic signals are used to solve conflict between traffic streams at an intersection and signal 
groups are used to control traffic streams by different light indications which provides an optimal solution to the 
control problem. Here we have considered an example of a traffic control problem with two different solutions. 
In the first case the conflicting streams are not allowed to move simultaneously while in the second case left turn 
of the conflicting traffic streams are allowed. In terms of accomodating more number of traffic streams in the 
signal groups, it is found that the solution of the second case is a better one compared to the first case. Finally, it 
is to be noted that different choice of signal groups e.g. ܵଵ, ܵଶ, ܵଷ and ܵସ of the example will give different 
solutions of the problem.

Abstract 
 
A new jerk chaotic system with three nonlinearities is investigated in this work. By modifying a jerk 
chaotic system with two cubic nonlinearities obtained by Sprott (1997), we obtain a new jerk chaotic 
system with three nonlinearities (two cubic nonlinearities and a transcendental nonlinearity).  Dynamics 
of the new chaotic system with three nonlinearities are analysed by means of phase portraits, Lyapunov 
exponents, Lyapunov dimension, bifurcation diagram and Poincaré map. Then an electronic circuit 
realization is shown to validate the chaotic behaviour of the new jerk chaotic system. Finally, the physical 
circuit experimental results of the jerk chaotic attractor show agreement with numerical simulations.

Abstract 
 
Health insurance is one form of insurance products specifically ensures healthcare services or medical 
treatments. Health insurance is considered compulsory for each individual, since it is very useful to aid 
treatment, especially for those less fortunate people. Hence, to solve this problem, a calculation of net 
annual health insurance premium is needed. This calculation might be carried out using several methods, 
including mortality table and Burr distribution. The calculation result of net annual health insurance 
premium showed that the premium result calculated using the Burr distribution is smaller than the result 
calculated using mortality table. The premium is personalized based on age, sex, cost and duration of 
health insurance policy.

1. Introduction 
Sickness is an unpleasant condition which occurred to someone and causes impairment in daily activities either 
physical, spiritual or social activity The environment is one of the factors affecting human health, especially on the 
less fortunate families whose daily activities are conducted on unhealthy environment (Workman, 2000). This 
causes these families to be prone to certain diseases, considering they consume less consumable foods every day. 
Should any member of these families contracts a certain disease, several costs need to be paid, and even more, 
should the person needs to be admitted in the hospital or requires intensive care, the hospital bill will increase in 
amount (Sukono et al., 2017a). 
Considering this reason, health insurance is compulsory to each individual due to its benefits to ease access to 
medical treatment especially for the less fortunate families. The main function of insurance is as a risk-forwarding 
mechanism, i.e. forwarding the risk from one party (insured) to another (insurer) (Morton, 1999; Sukono et al., 
2017b). This risk-forwarding does not necessarily mean total absence of misfortune possibility, but rather that the 
insurer ensures financial security and calamity to the insured. As a consequence, the insured party provides the least 
amount of premium compared to the potential loss (Morton, 1999). Insurance has several products, one of which is 
health insurance (Karnon et al., 2009). 
Health insurance is divided into two categories, i.e. individual hospital care health insurance and collective 
hospital care health insurance (Saputra et al., 2018). This paper discusses individual hospital care health insurance 
program which is an insurance providing financial support to pay hospital care bills for the insured and his/her 
family.  The amount of premium billed is defined based on the type of insurance and the applied annuity. Annuity is 
a type of payment in certain amounts paid regularly on an agreed time frame for as long as the person may live 
(Futami, 1993a; 1993b). Determining the premium of health insurance requires temporary initial annuity, i.e. series 
of payment due on an equal time range from the agreed time which are paid since the first payment period.

Thus, the annual hospital care health insurance premium calculated using mortality table was IDR 156,513.8533 . 
 
4. Conclusion 
The calculation of net health insurance premium is completed by first determining the initial temporary life annuity, 
net single health insurance premium and then, net annual health insurance premium. In determining the initial 
temporary life annuity, the survival probability of the client was first obtained using Burr distribution. Net annual 
health insurance premium calculation model using association between single health insurance temporary premium 
with initial life annuity and agreement that payment was due in the beginning of the policy year is written down as 
follows: The amount of net annual health insurance premium calculated using Burr distribution is smaller compared 
to those calculated using mortality table. This result is affected by single health insurance premium.

Abstract 
 
In this paper, a numerical analysis of mathematical model, in the form of a system of ordinary differential 
equations (ODEs) was carried out. The mathematical model describes the effect of tumor infiltrating 
lymphocytes (TIL) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) on the dynamics of tumor cells. It characterizes the ordinary 
differential equations system dynamics by determining stability properties. The system characteristic is 
useful to gain a broad understanding of the specific system dynamics and to help guide the development 
of tumor therapy.

A tumor is an abnormal growth of body tissue. It begins to form when a single cell mutates in such a way that lead 
to uncontrolled growth (Chang et al., 2003). Tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). In

4. Conclusion 
The bifurcation point in this model has been analyzed.  Through this analysis we search the parameter whose alter 
the stability of the equilibrium point. We procure that parameter c (the fractional tumor cell kill by NK) cells have 
important role for change stability of the system. We obtain bifurcation point for our system is

this case which parameter c smaller than the bifurcation point, thereby equilibrium point is unstable where a small 
perturbation from equilibrium point will cause the system to move away from that point. The immune system cannot 
handle a single tumor cell and consequently tumor continued to grow and become aggressive. However, if parameter 
c is larger than the bifurcation point value, the system becomes stable and a single tumor cell will die.

In this research paper, we report the finding of a new four-dimensional, two-wing, chaotic system with 
two quadratic nonlinear terms. It is worthwhile to note that the new dissipative chaotic system has two-
wing chaotic attractor and that it has a hyperbola of equilibrium points. Thus, it follows that the new two-
wing chaotic system exhibits a hidden attractor. Phase plots of the new two-wing chaotic system are 
illustrated, properties are elucidated, and electronic circuit simulations are also depicted to verify the 
feasibility of the theoretical mechanical chaotic system developed in this work.

Abstract 
 
An objective visibility analysis has been developed as an integral part of the research  ""Identifying 
Indicators for Rice Crisis Forecasting in Asia"". Analysis of visibility is a topic that received less attention 
in the study of forecasting models. Yet without a visibility analysis predicted results would be 
questionable whether the forecasting results can still be trusted. Analysis of visibility is required for 
assessing the ability of a model to forecast future events. In this paper we introduce visibility error which 
has different concept from the definition of error obtained during model building. Visibility error is the 
forecasting performance statistic which is needed as base in determining how long period of forecasting 
can be done. Without this statistics the forecaster can predict the next thousand years without clear 
statistical reasoning. Specifically this study developed error time variant visibility using inductive logic. 
One important finding raised in this paper is a formula for determining the numbers of data testing 
required to perform forecasting work based on specific forecasting specifications. The formula is: N = V 
+ 2. 
 
Keywords: 
Visibility, error visibility, forecasting, error time variant 
 
1. Introduction 
Rice crisis is defined as a situation in which a prolonged uncontrollable riot occurs because of rice scarcity, 
(Hidayat, 2015). This definition is inspired by the thought that crisis can be stated compactly as a situation when 
intolerable bad things are happened, (Hidayat, 2013; Torbick et al., 2017). The severity of the situation during those 
years was widely reported. A summary report of food riots that erupted across the globe in 2008 outlines state 
responses to the food riots and sketches the state of democracy in countries where riots occurred (Mindi Schneider, 
2008; Boansi, 2014).

5. Conclusion 
Based on the above result of the induction process has been obtained a new technique to decide the validity period 
of a forecasting method. Forecaster cannot do forecasting without knowing the statistics forecasting performance of 
a forecasting model. Please note, forecasting performance statistics is only a necessary condition and not a sufficient 
requirement to know the substance of prediction accuracy. One important finding of this framework is that we now 
have a formula for determining how much data testing is required to perform forecasting work based on specific 
forecasting specific lengths. The formula is:  N = V + 2, where N = Number of test data required, and V = visibility 
or validity period. According to the formula we need N=3 to obtain one step ahead forecast or one validity period. 
We need 5 data test to get three steps ahead forecasting.

Abstract 
 
The aim of this paper is to integrate quality, health & safety, environmental and social accountability 
standards under a comprehensive management system. To attain a specific function these compliance 
standards have been expanded separately at different occasions. Handling with these individual 
management systems and confirming their in-line position with organizational business objective are 
always found difficult. The current situation has accelerated the demand for integrating individual 
management standards in conjunction with business objectives of the organizations. A holistic TQM 
approach can effectively consolidate the existing quality, health & safety, social accountability and 
environmental operations into an indivisible and cross-functional management system. To some extent, 
the current management standards are treated as a subgroup of TQM. The benefits of such fusion exceed 
the sum of fractional benefits of individually handled management systems. The synthesis does not intend 
combining a few management standards conjointly, rather it means projecting the several disciplines in 
unique management standard based on their cross- functional inter connections. Actually, it is analytical 
in nature on the basis of the compliance criteria of OHSAS 18001, ISO 9001, ISO 14001 AND SA 8000. 
The main finding of this study concludes that, integration is feasible based on their philosophical 
analogies between TQM and other management standards. This paper will contribute in the way that, it 
establishes a model of integrated management system accompanying its implementation instructions in 
connection with TQM.

1. Introduction 
Readymade garments (RMG) sector is one of the most important sectors in Bangladesh. It has started is journey in 
the late1970s. Foreign trade, employment opportunity, mitigation of poverty, and delegation of power to the women 
are the four important areas where this sector can play an important role. At present, there are around 3.6 million 
workers are doing their work in this sector (Mahmud, 2012; Khan, 2006; Pojasek, 2006). The previous literatures 
provide evident that, working condition of this sector is very poor and does not match with the ILO labour standards 
(Khan, 2006; Turk, 2009; Dasgupta, 2002; Morshed, 2007). A lot of dust is being generated during cutting and 
sewing of fabrics in the garment industry. Sometimes, the harmful chemicals are also released from the fabric. When 
these chemicals saturate the air, it creates difficulties in breathing and eye irritation of the workers. Fatigue, 
headache and dizziness frequently occur due to the inhaling of solvents used for cleaning fabric and garments. 
According to the doctor’s opinion, the breathing of dust and solvents is one of the most common causes of various 
lung diseases which are very dangerous for human health. As a result, it will not only influence on the worker’s 
health, but also result in reduction of productivity, product quality, increased absenteeism, and turnover of staff 
(Mahmud, 2012; Pojasek, 2006; Alam et al., 2004; Dasgupta, 2002).

7. Conclusion 
Industrial firms have already realized that, they need to create their products with good quality under safety 
environment and better working condition. It is essential because it will ensure sustainability of the firm in the 
competitive global market and associated diversification of customer requirements. Consequently, assimilation of 
several management standards is very much obligatory. Management sub-systems like quality, health & safety, 
social accountability go hand-in-hand with each other. For example, the primary aspect of improving product quality 
is to increase the productivity. On the other hand, the main reasons for protection of environment are to ensure 
quality of life inside and outside the company and improvement of company’s public image. Quality of life inside 
the company means creating safe and secure working condition for the employees. It will eliminate or minimize risk 
to worker, increase the moral of the employees and reduce the rate of absenteeism due to occupational disease. This 
would also increase employee’s eagerness to improve their quality of work. 
Several authors (Khan, 2006; Pojasek, 2006; Jorgensen et al., 2006; Beckmerhageniet al., 2003; Vrassidas et al.,  
2010) have presented their approach for efficient integration of different management sub-systems in terms of  their 
compatibilities. But the main finding of this paper highlights that, compatibilities among the sub- management 
systems alone cannot ensure the sustainability of an integrated management system in the global market. Total 
integration may not be feasible without understanding the interrelationships among these management systems in 
terms of their cross -functional competence. So, alignment of these sub-systems under the broad conceptual 
management can further increase the scope of integration. The wider scope of integration will not only ensure the 
compatibilities among the sub-systems, but also ensure their cross-functional competence. In this regard, TQM has 
an ability to accumulate all cross-functional activities in an organization. Therefore, the philosophical similarities 
between TQM and proposed management system will ensure complete integration. 
According to Rasmussen (2007), there is not a single international standard for IMS. The process of developing IMS 
on the basis of national standards is still in progress. Progressive integration of different management systems is a 
common practice in today’s competitive market. Requirements of different systems vary in terms of their scope, 
control, monitoring, and follow up actions. So, opportunities of integration on the basis their commonalities 
decreases with the increase number of function specific management systems. Therefore, degree of compatibility in 
case of multiple management systems is a major limitation of this model. In this circumstance, the author suggests 
integration under the common philosophy of a wider management system will be the best strategy. 
It is possible to develop an integrated management system on the basis of the similarities found in different 
management system. Nevertheless, the philosophical similarities between TQM and other management systems 
have not been tested empirically. It should be given emphasis in the future studies on identification of some other 
philosophical similarities between TQM and other management systems. It will be helpful to make an integrated 
management system more reliable.

Abstract  
 
Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing is an industrial revolution, challenging traditional 
manufacturing models, but is still in the development phase after more than 30 years of discrete existence 
in prototyping labs. AM is an advanced manufacturing technology that fabricates parts layer by layer 
from one from a digital model (CAO) that manages a digital stereolithography (STL) file. From standard 
NF ISO 17296-2, there are 7 families of the most used processes, such as FDM (Fused Deposition 
Modeling) was developed by S. Scott Crump, unction by the temperature setting of the machine (around 
200 ° C), necessary for the melting of the material and deposited by a thin-layer nozzle that can range 
from 0.08 to 3 mm thick. Due to the nature of the FDM process many benefits appear but making 
functional parts using FDM has proved to be a difficult task. The difficulty comes from the influence of 
processing parameters such as: Platform temperature, Extruder temperature, Layer thickness, Number of 
shells, Infill density, print speed, Infill pattern and Number of solid layers on the final characteristics of 
the pieces. Our work presented provides an experimental study to analyze the effect of each processing 
parameter on the dimensional accuracy and time of manufacture of FDM parts. In general, 18 test samples 
were made using various treatment parameters. In order to analyze dimensional tolerances of these 
samples they were measured and compared to a 3D CAD model.

1. Introduction 
 
The engineering profession constantly reinvents itself through innovations and technologies so the world changes 
the industry also to meet the new expectations of consumers. It focuses on personalization and responsiveness. 
Additive manufacturing [1] is an industrial revolution that challenges traditional manufacturing models and disrupts 
the relationship between the manufacturer and the consumer. This process of shaping by adding material is a real 
economic and environmental opportunity. 
Additive manufacturing or 3D printing the most popular term with the public is still in the development phase after 
more than 30 years of discreet existence in prototyping laboratories. The first technology was invented in France and 
the patent was filed on July 16, 1984 under the name ""device to realize a model of industrial part"" [2], based on the 
same technic, the Americans also deposited theirs on August 8, 1984 [3]. So additive manufacturing is not a new 
technology, manufacturers have been using it for more than 30 years mainly for prototyping [4,5]. 
Today, the 3D printing market offers different types of machines. So not so easy to locate, especially as each device 
has its own technology to make the object in volume. But whatever the used method, the volume object is always a 
layer-by-layer succession from a numerical model (CAD) [6] which manages a digital stereolithography (STL) file 
[7]. Based on the standard NF ISO 17296-2 [8], there are seven families of processes to use the most. The FDM [9] 
"" fuse deposition Modeling "" is the most popular method. It builds parts layer by layer ranging from 0.08 to 3mm

4. CONCLUSION: 
 
This paper examines the effect of FDM processing parameters on the final geometry of printed parts, material 
consumption and printing time. The study examines the influence of eight processing parameters which are: 
Platform temperature, Extruder temperature, Layer thickness, Number of shells, Infill density, Print speed, Infill 
pattern and Number of solid layers. Using Taguchi's experimental design method is a new approach developed to 
model and optimize print parts by FDM. The 18 reference components were constructed based on the experimental 
design and measurements that were made on the samples. 
Generally, to improve the dimensional accuracy we need a higher Extruder temperature, higher Infill density, 
average Layer thickness, lower print speed, low number of shells, low number of solid layers and Infill pattern grid 
which less dimensional error. The dimensions may be preferable when comparing several dimensions at the same 
time, so that the error in the width and its changes is a little negligible compared to the errors of the other 
dimensions if the error has been described as a percentage error. 
It has been demonstrated that the time of printing is significantly influenced by Layer thickness, Infill density and 
printing speed; less significantly by Extruder temperature, Number of shells, Infill pattern and Number of solid 
layers. For decreased printing time, higher printing speed and higher layer height are required in addition to low 
infill density. To decrease the consumption of the material; Infill density more reliable, small layer height and low 
Number of solid layers are required. 
Future work in the field of research on the FDM process, the process of additive manufacturing shows a maximum 
of knowledge in making engineering applications with high quality parts, accuracy and high properties with low 
consumption and reduced printing time.

Abstract  
 
Today’s world and its globalized business environment focus heavily on designing effective team climate based on 
innovation and collaboration to protect their corporate interests as well as market share. The referred corporate 
requirement is discussed and analyzed in the current study by attempting to evaluate the effectiveness of new 
product development team climate based on team collaboration to strengthen innovation process on the basis of a 
newly established research tool and a newly validated extended theoretical framework. The survey is conducted on 
30 team member’s representing new product development (NPD) operations at three selected work locations (i.e., 
Finland, Norway and the UK) of a European multinational company. The results of the study reflected the desire to 
establish strong team climate potential supported through team collaboration to support innovation at the studied 
work locations. 
However, the weak areas in operations management were identified as the real time team cooperation, effective 
communication process and timely completion of work targets, limitation in the capacity of data collection and 
record keeping. All the above referred areas are critically significant in building effective NPD team’s innovative 
capabilities to strengthen healthy NPD team climate supported through collaboration and innovation. 
 
Keywords  
New product development team climate, market positioning, collaboration, innovation. 
 
1.  Introduction 
 
For long collaboration might be as old as humanity itself and its gaining more and more significance in the modern 
corporate world. One of the most common reason for corporate collaboration is streamlining business risk and costs. 
Collaboration is essential to the individual worker as well as the work team and the overall company’s growth. In 
truth, collaboration is extremely important element in business. So much so, considering corporate collaboration like 
teamwork, the companies often end up building great team, but might not always achieve great outcome. The 
innovation management is connected to the generalized view of today’s corporate world which connects the 
corporate idea that no single company, particularly with reference to the technological advancements can do 
everything on its own anymore in the globalized environment. Building effective teams include challenges like 
corporate trust development, effective communication, global outreach, ethical limitations, ability to convey social 
presence, lack of information-rich nonverbal cues etc. (Kirkman et al., 2002). In-depth empirical studies conducted 
during approximately three decades on analyzing corporate success factors have focused on the area of innovation 
and collaboration to support new product development processes (Cooper’s and Kleinschmidt, 1995; Heskett, 2001; 
Sparke, 1983; Jevnaker, 1998; Leenders et al., 2007; Murray and O’Driscoll, 1996; Kazmi, Naaranoja, 2015). 
Referred studies have focused either on the internal organizational elements that hold influence on NPD activity to 
gain competitive edge through reaching the market needs early through innovation and team collaboration (Kazmi, 
Naarananoja, 2014).

Abstract 
This paper presents a case study aims to redesign a hand bag assembly line to reach maximum line 
efficiency with an optimum number of workstation for a constant cycle time. Three heuristic assembly 
line balancing algorithms known as “Kilbridge and Wester Column”, “Rank Positional Weight” and 
“Largest Candidate Rule” are applied to design this single model assembly line. Yamazumi chart is used 
to the visual representation of workload on each workstation. Best two solution models are then simulated 
in Arena to check the feasibility. By comparing analytical and simulation report one best solution model 
is recommended to implement. The evaluation of the proposed solution model shows that the production 
line efficiency increased from 49 percent to 77 percent, number of manpower reduced from 23 workers to 
16 workers and provides more balanced workload on each worker. Therefore, this paper can contribute to 
meet the same amount of customer demand with a minimized operator cost by higher utilization of 
worker.

1. Introduction 
 
An assembly line consisting a number of workstations where a group of task is performed to produces goods or 
product as it transfers successively from one workstation to the next station along the line (Avikal, Jain, Mishra & 
Yadav, 2013; Kara, Ozguven, Yalcin & Atasagun, 2011; Scholl & Boysen, 2009). A company must manage the 
production line very well and distribute workload in various workstations to obtain the maximum production line 
performance or efficiency. In this case, should be introduced, line balancing is a systematic technique or approach 
that is used effectively to distribute the total workload as evenly possible to the workstations (Kucukkoc, Karaoglan 
& Yaman, 2013; Tuncel & Topaloglu, 2013). Line balancing technique is able to increase the assembly line 
efficiency of a company. 
Yamazumi chart is used as a tool to proceed Kaizen for line balancing (Naufal, Jaffar, Noriah & Halim, 2013). 
Yamazumi chart is a man-machine bar chart that shows the total cycle time for each operation when performing 
their process in the production flow (Sabadka, Molnár, Fedorko & Jachowicz, 2017). It is a visual representation of 
workload on each station that shows how the production time is distributed over the line. The methods to formulate","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

line from 49.16% to 77.83% and reduce the number to the worker from 23 to 16 by using any of these solution 
models. So total worker cost per day will be decreased by about 2100 BDT per day. Although the two solution 
models give approximately same results, it is recommended that the ‘Ventura leatherwear Mfy (BD) LTD’ should 
use the Kilbridge and Wester Column model solution workstation layout. As it is seen from Figure 3 and Figure 5, 
there is not more than three task is allocated in a workstation by KWC model where RPW model does have more 
work element in a workstation. So this model is more feasible than the other one and will be easy to implement. 
Also from the result of the simulation, it is seen that idle cost for KWC model is lower than the RPW model and a 
number of product output is larger by 2 unit per day. Idle cost for RPW model is higher than the KWC model 
according to simulation results. After all the consideration Kilbridge and Wester Column solution model is 
recommended to implement. 
 
 
Figure 14. Comparison of simulation results 
 
7.0 Conclusions 
 
The efficiency is of the two solution model is empirically same. Although, in real life, the efficiency is slightly 
lower as practical conditions are variable and unpredictable. The limitation of implementing these solution model 
multi-skilled worker is highly required. So recruiting multi-skilled worker is recommended to a workstation when 
implement KWC solution model.

Abstract 
Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is a non-parametric methodology for evaluating the relative efficiency 
of Decision Making Units (DMUs). Each of the DMUs produces multiple outputs through multiple inputs, 
and in some cases, there are measures that can be considered either as input or output which are called 
flexible measures. In the present work, we develop an alternative model to simultaneously address the two 
concepts relevant to the previously neglected aspects of DEA: cross-efficiency and flexible measure.

Abstract 
Proactive service procurement is a highly sensitive and risk prone phenomena due to being intangible in nature that 
requires innovative design-thinking approach by the suppliers and mutually comprehensible and acceptable by the 
buyers to ensure long term success and profitability of both the parties involved process. Services are affected by 
various factors, which should be taken into serious consideration while designing the process of service procurement. 
This paper, throws light on multi-factor proactive service design and its procurement process which helps in 
comprehending the critical nature and the significance of designing fool proof proactive service procurement 
framework to strengthen corporate risk management mechanism to ensure long term effective buyer supplier 
relationship. The study sample was taken from three European medium range enterprises engaged in energy sector 
businesses i.e., Mechanical and electrical products and service suppliers. The study findings highlight the multi-factor 
and critical nature of service offerings and its procurement procedures to suggest the serious requirement of installing 
systematic mechanism by the service industries to protect the interests of both buyers and suppliers through designing 
proactive procurement procedures (i.e., Plans and contracts etc.) for services to ensure long term profitable corporate 
relationships (i.e., Buyer and suppliers or Business to Business etc,). The study results revealed the following as the 
significant factors to be considered while designing effective proactive procurement procedures of services i.e., 
making right choices at the first place (Lean thinking approach), waste elimination, cost effectiveness, speedy and 
intelligent procurement. customer‘s profound satisfaction, competitive edge or advantage. This study provides real 
time corporate experiences and examples from the European medium range industries to demonstrate the utility and 
authenticity of the research findings and will therefore contribute in future, through result implementation while 
designing complex frameworks to strengthen and support the operations of proactive procurement of services.

1. Introduction
The world of today’s instantaneous evolution in the areas of commerce and technological networking has open up 
avenues for pioneering products and service offerings to attract local as well as global customer base to capture 
maximum market share and economic growth. Such economic trend has introduced the concepts of work outsourcing 
and lean thinking in industrial innovative production and service offerings by implementing complex global value 
chains. This phenomena is carried out by the corporate leaders, not only to support and sustain in their business 
environment but to lead in the overall global corporate scene. The corporate services aspect, being intangible in nature, 
holds high level of risks (i.e., Financial and reputational) at its procurement level, due to the factors like 
misconceptions during the ordering stage. Hence there is a greater need and demand by present day’s corporate players 
to develop and work with fool proof value chains, to ensure best and successfully managed proactive procurement 
practices. The manufacturing sector initially focused on designing and producing innovative products to attract their 
market base and offered maintenance services for their clients marginally as a gesture of good will to their customers. 
However, with the passage of time, the manufacturing companies realized the significance of using their, once called 
maintenance services, as being equally revenue generation activity as their main product. Hence, the manufacturing 
sectors taken the value added role of introducing the concept of customer’s customers, in addition to their erstwhile 
role of producing and selling goods. This activity further created the concepts like performance partnering and value 
partnering. Since, the services as being intangible phenomena, attach with its-self great risks (i.e., Financial and 
reputational) at their procurement level, due to the misconceptions, while ordering. The companies can not only face

customers taste and convenience, creating what is needed and when it is needed etc. will help the company 
to enjoy the true market leader status in no time and in return strengthen its profitability manifolds. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study has offered investigative findings to unearth the modern industrial practices and trends of “service 
procurement” by the manufacturing companies, in addition to the ways through which the current service procurement 
concept facilitates the proactive business practices, on the basis of lean thinking as well as the innovative tools and 
methods by the modern day’s Industrial sector. The above referred facts, consequently, generated the need of 
strengthening the techniques like, well defined and carefully designed “service purchase orders” dully supported by 
smartly worded service procurement contracts. During workshop discussions with the key state holders of almost all 
the companies, it was revealed that the service business is still to be established as a separate entity from the tangible 
products of the companies. In addition, the representatives of all the target companies, agreed on the significance of 
outsourcing the services through the service providers and developing strong internal systems for the procurement of 
“business services” to avoid huge costs by wrong specifications and faulty ordering by installing proactive 
procurement procedures mainly through expert brainstorming and authoring fool proof contracting to ensure effective, 
profitable and long-term corporate relationship between the buyer and supplier of services.

Abstract 
  
This paper presents an overview of Finland’s health care sectoral structure to further explore the gaps if present, on 
tri-dimensional basis (i.e., a-health care leadership, b-organization communication and c-creativity) linked to the work 
practices, to offer insight and support to the policy formulators and care providers to implement innovative solutions 
for transformation. The sample and the target locations in the current research study belonged to the regions of Vaasa, 
Laihia and Vähäkyrö, The study results revealed considerable gap between the verbal or desired aspect and the actual 
or practical level of work practice in the focused dimensions (i.e., 92%, 84%, and 93% for Health care, communication 
and creativity respectively) as compared to their actual work effort levels (i.e., 43%, 48% and 29% respectively). The 
study findings offer assistance to the care providers and policy reformers by pin pointing the weak areas for timely 
preparation of support processes for perfecting the ideal health and social care sectoral transformation.

1.  Introduction 
 
Finland’s Healthcare system is undoubtedly a true example of innovative leadership by exhibiting a tendency to 
achieve the landmarks of consistency through sustainable development. The success story of Finnish health care 
system unfolded over a span of few decades and resulted in presenting an internationally acclaimed health care model 
from a somewhat elementary. The system is designed in such a balanced way that though each and every individual 
permanent resident gets its proper share from the extensive set of medical services but still the sum of total per capita 
health care expenses remain considerably lower than in most of the similar countries, leaving the local population 
generally contented with it. Following are the ingredients (Teperi, et. al, 2009) of Finland’s premiere Health Care 
System currently in place: 
 
1 1 Value for patients 
 
Some of the main aspects are as below, 
• 
Implementing innovative ways to contain cost and increase value to obtain improved health care 
outcomes,  
• 
Care should be organized around medical conditions over the full cycle of care,  
• 
Health care value be measured periodically against global standards and gaps be reported for reformation

Figure 4. Graphic representation on study results presenting comparative analysis on three focused study dimensions 
 
Figure 4. above represents comparative analytical results on three selected dimensions ., a-Healthcare leadership, b- 
Communication and c- Creativity obtained on the basis of study sample’s feedback analysis. The distinction is created 
on the basis of the gap between the respondents’ desired or verbal expressions as compared to their actual or practical 
response or tendency linked to each focused dimension. The results displayed, through the above graphic 
representation, revealed that the respondent’s verbal or intentional expressions in case of each dimension is on the 
higher side (i.e., 92%, 84%, and 93% for Health care, communication and creativity respectively) as compared to their 
actual work effort levels (i.e., 43%, 48% and 29% respectively in cases of the referred study dimensions. The pointed 
out tendencies or the gaps pinpoints the weak areas to offer opportunity to the policy reformers and management to 
implement transformational solutions for health care sectoral success.

Conclusion 
 
The current analytical study was intended to explore the current state of affairs in the selected study locations i.e.,   
Vaasa, Laihia and Vähäkyrö, to further examine the gaps if present, on three selected dimensions (i.e., a-health care 
leadership, b-organization communication and c-creativity) linked to the work interactions and practices to suggest 
support and insight on the weak areas, to the policy formulators and care providers to implement innovative solutions 
for sectoral reformation. The study results revealed considerable gap between the verbal or desired aspect and the 
actual or practical level of work practice in the focused dimensions (i.e., 92%, 84%, and 93% for Health care, 
communication and creativity respectively) as compared to their actual work effort levels (i.e., 43%, 48% and 29% 
respectively). The study findings offer assistance to the care providers and policy reformers by pin pointing the weak 
areas for timely preparation of support processes for perfecting the ideal health and social care sectoral transformation.
