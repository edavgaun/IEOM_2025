Abstract  
 
Bananas are a staple food in most developing countries and are considered a ‘superfood’ due to their health benefits. 
However, they are also the most wasted fruit in the world, generally due to retail outlets throwing them away due to 
over ripeness. This paper highlights an alternative and more precise method to the conventional human visual tests 
which are conducted to precisely estimate the ripeness of a banana. The product is made specifically with the small-
scale agriculture industry in mind. The device utilizes the internal physico-chemical changes caused by the banana 
ripening process to estimate its degree of ripeness. Utilizing data gathered from colour, pH and moisture sensors, a 
support vector machine-learning model is created to predict the ‘stage of ripeness’ based on these input parameters. 
These parameters have undergo significant in the ripening process where colour changes due to decreasing magnesium 
content, acidity changes due to ratio of acids changing and finally moisture increases as the banana becomes softer. 
By having a better estimation of the ‘stage of ripeness’, supply-chain efficiency can be increased by allowing bananas 
to reach retail outlets at the optimal time to reduce wastage.

Abstract  
 
In this paper we pose the location-allocation problem (single stage) with shortages and inventory variables in a style 
similar to Sharma (1991). Vimal Kumar (2012) gave a novel method of eliminating shortages and this is considered 
here (this leads to reduced number of variables). Next he problem SSCMPWLP is formulated in the conventional 
manner where no variable can be eliminated. We derive a formulation where the resulting 0-1 MILP is solved by 
Bender’s decomposition and the associated all real problem is solved by Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition where the sub 
problems are posed as min-cost-network flow problems. It offers computational advantages. Thus we give three 
different methods to solve the problem SSCMPWLP. An empirical investigation is underway to see which of these 
three methods perform the best.  
 
Keywords  
Warehouse location problem, Lagrangian relaxation, Dantzing-Wolfe decomposition 
 
1. Introduction  
In this paper we directly give the novel formulation of the problem posed as above. Here goods (single commodity) 
are moved from plants to warehouses to markets. Plants are already located and warehouses are to be located at points 
that represent potential warehouse locations. We consider inventories at warehouses (as in Sharma (1991)) and 
consider inventories and shortages at markets. We also consider inventory and shortage costs and this means we have 
a multi-period problem. We wish to minimize sum total of transportation, location costs at warehouse points, the 
inventory costs at markets and warehouses and shortage costs at markets. We give a mix 0-1 integer linear 
programming formulation of the problem (in fact we give three approaches to solve this problem). We discuss its 
important merits in the discussion and conclusions.  
 
2. Problem Formulation 
Here, we have developed a single stage warehouse location problem. In this mathematical model we have considered 
shortage and inventory distribution. To reduce the complexity of the problem we formulated the model for single type 
of product or service.

Thus in this paper we have given three methods for solving the SSCMPWLP. We have undertaken an investigation to 
empirically determine which method does the best. Method three can be accelerated by the inclusion of ‘feasibility’ 
constraints in the all integer sub problem.

Abstract 
 
In this paper we give 91 hypotheses and 6 conjecturers that relate various aspects of Information Technology / Systems 
(IT/S) as related to the strategy of the firms (cost leadership, differentiation and innovators). These are virtual teams 
(VTs) in track 1, enterprise social media (ESM) in track 2, analytics, strategy of organization (cost 
leadership/differentiation) and types of innovators (continuous innovation, modular innovation, architectural 
innovation and radical innovation) in track 3 and machine learning, artificial intelligence, types of programming (OOP, 
extreme and scrum) and internet of things (IoT) in track 4. These are new hypotheses and have tremendous 
implications for top management of firms as they go about managing its IT/S infrastructure.  
 
Keywords 
 
Information Technology / Systems, cost leader and differentiation strategy, modular and architectural innovation, 
extreme and scrum programming.  
 
1. Introduction 
 
For extensive literature on IT/S readers are referred to four books by Sharma (2018) (publisher LAP LAMBERT). 
Scholars have identified three basic strategies of the firm (wiki on strategic management and strategy, Miles and Snow 
et al (1978)). Firms pursuing cost leader (CL) strategy focus on lowest cost and deploy mass production. Here Power 
distance is high and these firms have high standardization, specialization, centralization and formalization; and have 
high complexity of work flow (CWF). CL firms focus on stable (and narrow) product lines and have typically low 
environmental uncertainty. Whereas firms with differentiation (DIFF) strategy focus on providing more additional 
features to products for additional price. These firms have broad product lines (tending to mass customization and 
deploy FMS hence) and face higher demand uncertainty due to fickle tastes and preferences of its high end customers.

H87: Low Bureaucracy, High Professional, High Market will lead to emergence of mavens (and e-mavens).  
 
We relate IT flexibility to strategy of the firm and its volatility.  
 
H88: Analyzers/Differentiators with large resource base (operating in every segment, especially the lucrative premium 
segment) should go for aggressive IT flexibility strategy, even if environmental uncertainty is high.  
 
H89: Differentiators with small resource base (not operating in every segment, especially not in the lucrative premium 
segment) should NOT go for aggressive IT flexibility strategy, as environmental uncertainty is high.  
 
H90: In the same vein, architectural innovators should go for aggressive IT flexibility strategy (as its resource base is 
much higher), even if environmental uncertainty is high.  
 
H91: In the same vein, modular innovators should NOT go for aggressive IT flexibility strategy (as its resource base 
is much lower), if environmental uncertainty is high.  
 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
In this paper we relate different dimensions of IT/S to strategy and type of the firm. This will enable top management 
of companies to choose right IT/S mix (appropriate relation or organizational variables to strategy of the firm) for 
their companies for max effectiveness. Also the role of IT professionals to align IT strategy to corporate strategy will 
be enhanced by this article. The hypotheses given in this paper are picked up from un-referred books (book of working 
papers, Sharma (2019, 2020 and 2021).

Abstract 
 
Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise (MSME) is the largest business executor to Indonesia's national gross domestic 
product. Due to the size of the company, it is inevitable that MSME is required to have an efficient workflow and 
material purchasing to minimize the costs. One of the most popular sectors of MSME is food and beverages, Glucofeel 
is one of them. Glucofeel is a company that sells cakes that are tasteful and attractive. Based on the company’s data, 
it is important for Glucofeel to be able to fulfil their customer’s demand. These objectives, however, were inhibited 
by the problem of the company’s inability to make efficient material procurement in order to fulfil the customer 
demand in the right amount and at the right time. The purpose of this research is to increase the company efficiency 
by implementing MRP. The MRP will be based on the company's historical data and bill of material. The final 
calculations of MRP are being totalled and compared to the actual purchasing data. The result of the total calculation 
shows that if the company has implemented MRP from the beginning, the company can save the amount of Rp 
115.746,66,‐ in price and make a saving of 6,22%.

1. Introduction 
The food production business is one of the business fields that has a lot of interest and competition (LPPM IPB 2018). 
This is due to the importance of the goods produced (food) in human life as a basic necessity in everyone's life. 
Therefore, this business field is the main focus of this research. Although this field is a major field, it also has many 
factors that influence the running of the business. Although it is the basic need, each customer has a different variety 
of tastes which causes instability in this area of business (Bech et al. 2019). The wide variety of customer tastes 
depends on themselves, some like Sweet tastes and some don't. In recent years, many businesses in the food sector 
have flourished because of their concept and great taste (Galanakis et al. 2021). Among these foods, there are many 
sweet food businesses, both as a side dish and as a dessert. Intense competition requires business people to be more 
creative in attracting customers. To solve this problem, many business people have innovated, including innovating 
in the taste offered (Bech et al. 2019). It is hoped that the uniqueness of the taste offered will attract the attention of 
new customers. 
One of the businesses that is engaged in this field of business which has become our main focus is Glucofeel, this 
business offers a dessert in the form of Cakes with a variety of flavors that are not commonly found. This business is 
a Micro, Small And Medium Enterprise (MSME) business that was started in early February 2021 in Surakarta, Central 
Java.  
Inventory control management is very important for a business, especially the MSME business (Atnafu and Balda 
2018). MSME businesses that tend to have minimum funds are expected to control their inventories as best as possible 
to avoid any avoidable losses. With a high enough demand and limited time, inventory control is certainly needed. 
This problem is very fatal to business continuity if it is not handled properly. The use of MRP is expected to solve this 
problem.

After we have the material procurement cost for both the actual data and the MRP, we will then compare both of them 
to see the difference if the company chooses to use MRP for material planning from the beginning. The differences 
between the actual cost and MRP cost is shown in the table below.

Based on table 7, should the company use MRP from the beginning of their operation, they may save up to Rp 
115,746.66 and increase the company’s efficiency by 6,22%. These saved funds can be allocated to other sectors that 
can help develop this company. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Glucofeel company is a Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) food and beverages company which has the 
problem of company’s inability to determine what materials should be purchased and how much the need and 
company’s inability to make a production planning in order to fulfill the customer demand in the right amount and on 
the right time. This problem results in the company to experience a shortage and excess in the purchase of raw 
materials such as sugar, milk, margarine, etc. 
 
To answer this problem, an implementation of Material Requirement Planning is performed in the calculation of raw 
materials purchasing plan. This method was chosen because it was considered appropriate to answer the problems that 
were faced by the Glucofeel company. Its objective to perform a better response to customer demand, more efficiency 
in production control, and to avoid excess in inventory (Heizer & Render, 2011) is also beneficial to fulfill the 
company customer demand. 
 
In comparison, it can be figured that, in demand from February to March, the company can save costs by 6.22% if the 
company used MRP for their production. The company also makes savings of Rp 115,746.66 if the MRP method has 
been applied early February. Efficiency generated from MRP calculation is relatively small in percentage. However, 
in its capacity as MSME, the application of MRP in the purchasing of raw materials saves a lot of money to the 
company.

Abstract  
 
The environment has been a significant concern for practitioners in recent years, so the goals related to 
environmental sustainability encouraged industries to adapt the green practices. This paper explores green 
operational practices associated with environmental standards and their comparative impacts on Indian 
organisations. A major reason for this study is to gain awareness and understanding of environmental 
sustainability. The green practices are majorly based on environment management, and we have selected a 
great philosophy related to environment management, i.e., Total Quality Environmental Management 
(TQEM). This leads us to perform a short literature review for Quality Management and Environmental 
Management to identify the critical barriers and enablers of Total Quality Environmental Management 
(TQEM) for its sustainability. The findings of this paper will lead the managers and practitioners to carry 
organisations towards more environmental sustainability.

1. Introduction  
Manufacturing firms are the main economic driver of different countries such as China, Thailand, and Vietnam, and 
it also helps to develop these countries. Similarly, these firms, in India have become the main driving force of 
economic development. Despite its contribution to economic growth, it is also criticised for being a major cause of 
environmental degradation, climate change, and natural resource insufficiency.  Organisations in today’s scenario are 
facing pressures to establish their environmental responsiveness. Such pressures come from trades, investors, and 
customers. TQEM is structured around two management concepts of Total Quality Environmental Management 
(TQEM) and Environmental Management System (EMS). These two sub-systems are brought together through their 
management approaches to constitute TQEM. TQEM could be the solution for more effective interaction between 
these two tiers of management. The early human generations recognised the need to carefully use natural resources 
and that everything on this planet is equally dependent but with the revolution of science and technology, this thinking 
changed towards an unsustainable approach to exploit nature with the perspective that nature’s services will always 
available (Opoku et al., 2019). 
 
1.1 Introduction to Quality 
A definition of quality stated that quality is the state of conformity of the previously set requirements within the 
product Sweis (2019). This definition highlights the indication of conformity, which is related to the process of 
testing, trying, and focusing on the results of the product before it reaches the customer.

444","6. Conclusion and Further Research 
The outcome of the study is strongly influenced by practitioners of TQEM and suggests that QM can be particularly 
suitable as a frame of reference to help company managers to adopt corporate TQEM and other related 
environmentally sustainable practices. In this regards the present study suggests possible future research on various 
standards and government policies for TQEM. This can help to enhance awareness of organisations, as regulation and 
policies has been mentioned as a barrier in the implementation of environmental practices.  
 
Lastly, the present study suggests possible future research that analyses the impact of TQEM and its sustainability on 
energy sectors highlighting Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy majorly on power plant sectors for using coal 
as a conventional method of combustion, as the coal waste products and CO2 emission can affect the environment on 
large scale.

Abstract  
 
As a company who excels in agriculture, nutrition & health, and home & personal care, it is important for BASF to 
have the ability to forecast future market conditions. One of which is forecasting customers' demand. Poor forecasting 
would create problems in the management of product availability, namely the lack of availability of stock quantities 
or the amount of excess product stocks. Lack of available stock quantities may result in unfulfilled requests from 
customers, while producing excess stocks may result in losses. Hence, the aim of this study is to compare the demand 
forecast for Softex 1400-M, a product manufactured by BASF, using the Single Moving Average and Single 
Exponential Smoothing method by applying Mean Absolute Deviation, Mean Square Error, and Mean Absolute 
Percentage Error. The method applied in this study is a quantitative method. Based on the testing result, the method 
which often depicts the best result is Single Moving Average Method with periods length is 5.   The demand forecast 
can support BASF to prevent excess or shortage of product stocks.

1. Introduction  
BASF (n.d.), the approximately 110,000 employees in the BASF Group work on contributing to the success of our 
customers in nearly all sectors and almost every country in the world. BASF portfolio is organized into six segments: 
Chemicals, Materials, Industrial Solutions, Surface Technologies, Nutrition & Care, and Agricultural Solutions. BASF 
generated sales of around €59 billion in 2020. BASF has been investing in Indonesia since 1976. Today, BASF 
solutions support Indonesia’s key industries including agriculture, nutrition & health, and home & personal care such 
as Softex 1400-M. It is one of the many products being produced using BASF’s chemical ingredients.  This research 
is needed to help BASF forecast its future market conditions so that it can remain competitive in the global market. 
Thus, effective planning regarding scheduling, inventory, production, and so on is very crucial as it is considered to 
be the backbone of  successful operations. (Karmaker, C. L., P. K. Halder, and E. Sarker, 2017). So, to ensure 
successful operations, forecasting plays a pivotal role in the company’s decision to determine the number of chemical 
ingredients that must be distributed. Effective forecasting will help reduce unnecessary inventories, improve product 
availability, and level of customer satisfaction. (Karmaker, C. L, 2017).  
 
1.1 Objectives  
The aim of this study is to identify the most appropriate forecasting method for predicting the demand forecast for 
Softex 1400-M using the Single Moving Average and Single Exponential Smoothing method.  This study also aims  
to measure the comparison of error values from the Single Moving Average and Single Exponential Smoothing 
method using Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Percent Error 
(MAPE). 
 
2. Literature Review  
Forecasting is a common activity in many companies affecting operations, marketing, and planning. It involves 
predicting the amount customers will purchase, given the product's features and the condition of the sale. Forecasting

452","6. Conclusion  
In conclusion, this study examined forecasting methods using single moving average (n=5) and exponential smoothing 
(α=0.6) to forecast demand sales for Softex 1400-M. Monthly data from January of 2021 to December 2021 were 
collected and used to forecast the month of 2022 customer of BASF demand. The study revealed that the five months 
single moving average has higher accuracy then the exponential smoothing with smoothing constant of 0.6. High level 
of accuracy has been proven through calculation of errors. The result for forecasting the number of demands for the 
coming month by the Single Moving Average method  is 15,952 kgs/month with errors calculated, namely 2,7257 
(MAD), 19,6159 (MSD), and 12,8168% (MAPE) whereas by Single Exponential Smoothing method The result for 
forecasting the number of demands for the coming month is 17,0858 kgs/month with errors calculated, namely 4,5888 
(MAD), 61,9394 (MSD), and 15,7311% (MAPE). Therefore, it can be concluded that the five months single moving 
average method will give a better forecast for the demand in the year 2022 and subsequent months if adopted.  
 
This study helps BASF to find out which forecasting method is the most accurate because demand forecasting plays 
an important role for any company to stay competitive and survive in the global business environment. Therefore, 
effective forecasting does not only play a crucial role in the production processes but also for suppliers and transports. 
With effective forecasting, this will help BASF reduce unnecessary inventories and focus on improving product 
availability and customer satisfaction.

Abstract 
 
Coal is a fossil fuel that is commonly used throughout the world. Nowadays, the demand for coal is fluctuating because 
of several factors. These changes and uncertainties on the demand level of coal requires more attention from the 
companies because they must determine the accurate level of production in a certain period of time. The accuracy in 
predicting how much is needed and how much is produced will be very necessary, because it helps the company to 
fulfill the market needs and to retain customer loyalty. In this paper, we estimate the demand for coal production for 
the next 6 years in Company X using Brown’s and Holt’s Double Exponential Smoothing Method then determine 
which method is the most accurate. With Brown's method, the result obtained is that the maximum value of α 
parameter is 0.4 and the MAPE value is 6.74. On the other hand, with Holt’s method we got the value of MAPE is 
5.8157, with alpha 0.5867, and gamma 0.14754. By comparing the two methods, we conclude that Holt’s method is 
more accurate in predicting the demand level in the next 6 years than Brown’s method, as Holt’s method has a smaller 
value of forecast error.

1. Introduction 
Coal is a fossil fuel that is commonly used throughout the world. The definition of coal, according to Undang Undang 
No. 3 Tahun 2020, is a deposit of organic carbon compounds that are naturally formed from plant debris. In Indonesia, 
the number of sediment areas is scattered from Sumatra to Papua, with the largest source of coal being in Kalimantan. 
As stated by the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM Ministry) in their 2019 annual 
performance report, it was written that the amount of coal in Indonesia reached 149 billion tonnes. This amount does 
not include the amount of coal reserves of 37.6 billion tonnes, according to a study by the Badan Geologi. In the 
following year, the ESDM Ministry said that the realization of coal production reached 561 million, which is 
equivalent to 102% of the previous target of 550 million tons. Meanwhile, the realization of domestic coal utilization 
reached 85% of the target, namely 155 million tons. 
 
Nowadays, the demand for coal is fluctuating because of several factors including the increasing number of public 
demands for energy and coal as a more affordable choice than any other energy source. It is also influenced by the 
demand of the electricity industry, where coal is mostly used for electricity generation, which reaches 70% of the total 
domestic coal demand. Meanwhile, other needs are for the processing and refining industry at 11%, for the cement 
industry at 10%, for the paper industry at 4%, for the textile industry at 4%, and for the fertilizer industry at 1% (Arif 
2014). In 2018, the ESDM Ministry explained that the use of coal in Indonesia has increased every year. In an interval 
of 5 years, since 2005, the use of coal has increased to 67 million tonnes, previously only 41 million tonnes. During 
this period, the proportion of coal in energy units also increased by 4% and this value is also predicted to continue to 
increase up to 33% in 2025. 
 
Moreover, in a bigger scope, the demand for coal could also be affected by the export price of coal, GDP per capita, 
the total population, and the real exchange rate of the exported country. On the other hand, currently there is a shift in

6. Conclusion  
From this paper, the forecasting of coal demand is done based on the historical data from the past 11 years. This will 
help the business owner to be prepared to produce at the same level with the predicted numbers. Using Brown's 
method, the result obtained is that the maximum value of α parameter is 0.4 and the MAPE value is 6.74. On the other 
hand, with Holt’s method we got the value of MAPE is 5.8157, alpha = 0.5867, and gamma = 0.14754. By comparing 
the two methods, we conclude that Holt’s method is more accurate in predicting the demand level in the next 6 years 
than Brown’s method, as Holt’s method has a smaller value of forecasting error. Our suggestion for future research is 
to implement and optimize this method to achieve a higher accuracy so that it will be more beneficial for the company 
in producing the coal in order to meet the customer demand.

Abstract 
As one of the most critical issues that arise in industries, inventory control is important for operations in the industry. 
As one of the small and medium enterprises industries in Indonesia, PT. Wijaya Agung Hutama is able to apply EOQ 
to solve their problem regarding inventory control of raw materials, especially EMAL 270N that are used to make the 
company’s hand soap product. This paper examines the phenomenon in the company based on its historical data from 
January 2020 until December 2020 and forecasts the demand of EMAL 270N for the next 12 months of operation. By 
using the EOQ method for controlling inventory, this company can minimize the inventory cost by 88.21% in 2020 
and predicted to be reduced by 81.66% in 2021 and determine the most efficient order quantity of each purchase.

1. Introduction 
PT. Wijaya Agung Hutama is a Business to Business company that manufactures cleaning chemicals and 
supplies cleaning equipment and cleaning services based in Jakarta. Established in 2000, this company started to sell 
cleaning chemicals and supply its product to other companies and malls in Jakarta, such as Mall Ambassador, 
Jamsostek, and so on. With the brand BESTKP (formerly BEST), PT. Wijaya Agung Hutama has owned more than 
30 types of cleaning chemical products, including floor care products, cleaning and sanitation products, and special 
cleaning products. 
Inventory control is one of the most critical issues that arises in various industries these days (Jackson et. al, 
2019). To overcome this complexity of problem, many practitioners use stochastic inventory control. But in some 
small and medium enterprise (SME) industries, the use of traditional tools like EOQ takes the upper hand (Dumas, 
2008). MRPII and ERP, two of the modern inventory management systems, offer a complete solution, but little 
research has been conducted to prove that modern inventory management gives a competitive advantage for SMEs. 
 
Based on the interview with the production manager from PT. Wijaya Agung, the company doesn’t have a 
clear method for inventory control. At some point, this results in out of stock that can disturb the production. 
Otherwise, when the company doesn’t have much demand from customers, this results in overstock of raw material. 
The biggest demanded product from PT. Wijaya Agung Hutama is BEST - Hand Soap. This product consists of EMAL 
270N, solvent F, cellosize, dye, perfume, and EDTA 4 NA. The largest ingredient from this product is EMAL 270N. 
In this paper, we want to optimize the inventory control of raw materials, EMAL 270N, to prevent shortage of stocks 
and overstocking of the raw materials. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
The objective of the study is to determine the optimal inventory cost of EMAL 270N through application of 
two different traditional inventory control methods. Because there’s no clear information from the company regarding 
the actual inventory cost, we will compare inventory cost from EOQ Method and Min-Max Method. From its result,

Based on table 9, the safety stock from 2020 and 2021 are 467,750 and 522,861. The minimum stock from 
2020 and 2021 are 70,556.8 and 79,288.2. The maximum stock from 2020 and 2021 are 503,028.4 and 562,505.1. 
The reorder points from 2020 and 2021 are 432,471.6 and 483,216.9. The inventory costs from 2020 and 2021 are 
$124,133.57 and $74,466.40.

81.66% 
 
After applying the EOQ method and Min-Max method, there is a significant difference between inventory 
costs, both in 2020 and 2021. From the EOQ method calculation, we found out that inventory costs from 2020 to 2021 
have decreased from $14,635.59 to $13,654.96. From the Min-Max method, we found out that it also has decreased, 
from $124,133.57 to $74,466.40. 
When we compare between two methods, the differences are huge. Between two methods that are mentioned 
above, the difference between inventory costs from both methods are very large, with the EOQ method having the 
least amount of inventory cost from each year. With the difference of 88.21% and 81.66% in 2020 and 2021, this 
proves that the EOQ method is the best-in-slot method for doing inventory control at PT. Wijaya Agung Hutama. 
Comparing the safety stock and reorder point, the min-max method determines the safety stocks lower than 
the EOQ method. With the difference of 254,734.25 gram and 275,042.98 gram in 2020 and 2021, this huge difference 
leads to a reduced risk of running out of stock. This implies that this company would run out of raw materials more 
frequently. This stockout will hamper the production, and the company’s profitability couldn’t be maximized.  
 
6. Conclusion 
Economic order quantity (EOQ) is a tool to calculate the lot size of order in every purchase. With EOQ, we 
can optimize the inventory cost by determining the order quantity if there’s no clear inventory control method. 
Implementation of EOQ brings many advantages for SMEs, especially in inventory management. Min-max method 
used to determine the inventory cost when the company decides to classify their inventory cost. This method allows 
us to calculate the inventory cost using maximum used and average used on the inventory based on customer’s 
demand. 
From the analysis above, we conclude that the inventory cost by using the EOQ method is far more efficient 
than using the Min-Max method. In 2020, the optimal order quantity in each purchase activity is 2,146,860.92 gram, 
9 times a year, with the total inventory cost being $14,635.59. Same thing with year 2021, the optimal order quantity

is 2,242,138.5 gram, 9 times a year, with the total inventory cost is $13,654.96. By using the EOQ method for 
controlling inventory, the company can minimize the inventory cost by 88.21% in 2020 and predicted to be reduced 
by 81.66% in 2021 and determine the most efficient order quantity of each purchase.

Abstract 
 
This paper will discuss the importance of preparing the change of production plan during and the effect of COVID-
19 pandemic using linear forecasting (FORECAST.LINEAR). Many manufacturing companies are in shock because 
of the pandemic, from the uncertainty of government regulation and the scarcity of raw material. In addition, not only 
about a pandemic or epidemic, but can be a monetary crisis or other kind of uncertainties. And, adjusting the 
production level severely affects the supply chain, since these companies also need to adjust their production level. In 
the planning process, we need to know how are the customer demand to ensure the production. To forecast the 
customer demand, we use linear forecasting. The method we used for acquiring the data for covid lockdown are all 
on public domain. As for the company data, we acquire it by asking the company with the requirement that we 
shouldn't publish the company name in regards of company privacy. From this study, we hope a better way to adjust 
production level including preparing for every uncertainty could be used for better decision making in forecasting the 
production plan and could be used for shifting production plans when adjusting to government regulation and customer 
demand.

1. Introduction 
The production plan is the next step after we made a strategic business plan. The reason we need a strategic business 
plan because we need to achieve enough quantities of each product group, desired inventory level, the resources 
needed, and the availability of resources on each period (Introduction to Material Management Sixth Edition, 2008). 
Ikon, Nwankwo, and Catherine Nkechi (2006), research shows that production plan has a functional relationship 
between the factor of production planning and profitability. So, a proper production plan is needed to achieve 
maximum profit.  
 
After making the production plan, a proper manufacturing company must have an MPS or Master Production Schedule. 
Which is a derivative of the production plan which leads to the MRP or Material Requirements Plan. MRP in short is 
only the list of material and their time series data which is only a more detailed version of MPS (Arnold et al., 2008).  
In preparing for a change in the production plan, production forecasting must be conducted to make sure the proposed 
changes will be feasible and appropriate for the production’s future condition and situation. In such cases, conducting 
a forecast by basing it on previous production data will produce the best possible outcome. But in the case of today, 
with the global coronavirus pandemic happening, little to no company has such data for when it comes to pandemic 
conditions beforehand. Even so, with only a year's worth of production data, a forecast still can be conducted and so 
a production plan shift is plausible. 
 
1.1 Problem Statement 
The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us about the importance of facing uncertainties. We all know that pandemics 
are unpredictable, just like the previous pandemics such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS, 
chickenpox, Spanish Flu, and even bubonic plague. Other than a pandemic, some examples of uncertainties are 
financial crises. A good company is one that can adapt and survive to these conditions, even when it forces the 
company to change its business focus. The pandemic affects many industries, including the automotive industry. With

482","5.2 The Effect to Production Plan One Year Later 
According to our data until mid 2021, we linear forecasted the production plan as the graph shown in Figure 3. The 
graph illustrated that the production of the company will be decreasing with no indication of growth. This indicated 
that pandemic decreasing the demand for vehicle spare-part thus decreasing the volume of production plan and 
forecasted January through September. 
 
6. Conclusion 
From this paper, we concluded that there was a limited time span of countries reacting to a global pandemic. Most are 
in the range of 9 to 26 days (about 3 and a half weeks) from the first case to lockdown or curfew, with an average time 
are 27 days (about 4 weeks). The Effect of the pandemic can be seen with linear forecasting. Even though the pandemic 
has been a year, the effect to the automotive manufacturing sector still can be seen, affecting the demand of spare part 
which lower the volume need of the production.

Abstract 
 
Productivity is not just about doing more, it is about creating more impact with less resources, and it can be 
achieved only by intelligent planning and sustained hard work. Employee productivity play a vital role in any 
organization, it is biggest challenge to sustain with low operating cost and manpower cost with high profit margin 
in such competitive environment. This paper illustrate the journey to improve employee productivity and resource 
optimization approach in a pharmaceutical industry. The entire exercise consists study of existing process and 
manpower deployment pattern, identify the redundancy and bottlenecks in the current system, manpower 
benchmarking and comparison exercise and proposed standard manpower with skill enhancement framework. 
Industrial engineering tools and techniques being applied in the data collection and process mapping exercise. 
Study has been conducted in the pharmaceutical processes like- Granulation, Compression and Coating and 
packaging. This paper also includes a skill enhancement framework to make the operatives’ multi skilled, thereby 
allowing them to work in different departments flawlessly.

1. Introduction 
In the journey to improve employee productivity, it is important to have a robust structure of manpower planning 
which should ensure adequate supply, proper quality and quantity as well as effective utilization. It is the process 
by which management determines how an organization should move from its current manpower position to its 
desired manpower positions with the objective of less resources with high productivity Manpower planning helps 
the organisation to tap talents efficiently which will help to achieve both the individual and organisational goal. 
This will consequently minimise some of the problems associated with absenteeism and labour turn- over. 
Moreover, the process of manpower planning includes analysis of skill level in the organisation (skill inventory), 
analysis of expected and current vacancies due to discharges, transfers, promotions; sick leaves, absence on other 
reasons.  
 
This manpower planning exercise is divided into two parts:-  
(a) Standard manpower mapping Exercise: 
• 
Identify the current manpower (operatives) numbers in each area like-Granulation, Compression, 
Coating in Plant-1. 
• 
Study the current occupancy of the machines and workload. 
• 
Benchmarking and comparison of manpower against the equipment capacity with other units and 
industries. 
• 
Identify the gaps in current manpower deployment and conduct a Time and motion study, DILO study 
(Day in a life of officer/operator/ helper) and Man M/c study, SMED to identify the current utilization 
of manpower. 
• 
Identify the redundancy in the current system by segregating non value added activities and value added 
activities.

9. Conclusion 
As, stated in the beginning, manpower planning is the process by which management determines how an 
organization should move from its current manpower position to its desired manpower positions. Which 
eventually help the organization to sustain in terms of optimum utilization of resources, employee productivity 
improvement, manpower for casting with proper recruitment plan, Skill enhancement and career progression 
roadmap etc. Based on the study done and proposed optimum manpower with a concrete skill enhancement 
framework, there has been 15% saving in the manpower numbers and 10% reduction in the cost. Moreover it 
helps in succession planning of existing operatives with proper road map on career progression. Training plan has 
been shared for all the current identified skills and implemented successfully. The best practices of this study has 
been shared with other pharma plants and horizontal deployment in under execution. Apparently this also helped 
the production planning team and human resources team to work together to plan the current and future resources 
at optimum level.

Abstract 
 
Improved productivity, resource utilization, and efficiency are crucial for the industries working with batch production 
systems and have attracted growing interest from academia and practice. Five focusing steps approach (FFS) of the 
Theory of Constraints (TOC) is considered a reliable solution to achieve these ends by effectively elevating the 
constraint within the system. Although earlier studies highlighted significant advantages of FFS to the manufacturing 
firms that adopt it, empirical validation from the real-life cases about these benefits is unaddressed in the literature. 
Most of the studies on TOC concepts are found to have utilized hypothetical cases to demonstrate their applicability. 
However, this study successfully implemented the simulation-based TOC application in the real-life case of the Indian 
automobile component manufacturing firms using a resource reallocation strategy to elevate the constraint. A 
simulation model of the firm under study is created in a discrete event simulation software, ARENA©. The simulation 
results show that the TOC implementation resulted in an improved manufacturing performance viz. Throughput and 
resource utilization. The results also establish that the application of TOC reduces the lead time and shown a positively 
productive efficiency. 
Keywords  
TOC, Reallocation Strategy, Simulation, Manufacturing Performance, Case Study. 
 
1. Introduction  
The concept of Theory of Constraints (TOC) emerged with the pioneering work by Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt in 1980 when 
Goldratt along with his team, developed a production programming software- “Optimized Production Technology 
(OPT)” for optimizing the operations of production systems to enhance the profit margins of the plant (Cox III and 
Schleier, 2010; Goldratt, 1980; Plenert, 1993; Rabbani and Tanhaie, 2015). Dr. Goldratt further published the book 
entitled “The Goal” to introduce the concepts for governing manufacturing in an optimal manner by adopting the 
continuous improvement techniques for achieving competitive manufacturing performances (Goldratt and Cox, 1984). 
The authors provided a structured approach called ‘Five Focusing Steps (FFS)’ for managing the bottlenecks in the 
system through the adoption of a ‘Drum Buffer Rope (DBR)’ scheduling approach. The intention behind the 
emergence of the drum buffer rope and bottleneck management is to avoid the overproduction of non-bottleneck 
resources  (Goldratt and Fox, 1986; Ikeziri et al., 2019).  The DBR proposed in TOC aids in improving the utilization 
of productive resources to enhance the manufacturing firms’ financial aspects (Telles et al., 2020).   
TOC seeks to maintain keen observation on the constraints in the system to help managers for handling bottlenecks 
effectively. Therefore, TOC is primarily focusing on maximizing the capacity and availability of the capacity-

500","4.2 Scenario 2 
In scenario 2, the production load on the resources having utilization more than 80% i.e., bottleneck resources, is 
shifted to their duplicate resource. This resulted in compressing the utilization band to 15% to 85%, as shown in Figure 
2. Also, there are few resources with utilization > 80%. Further from Table 3, it can be seen that the required level of 
the demand for parts is not fulfilled. Thus, again the same step is followed as scenario 1 to remove the bottlenecked 
resources.

4.3 Scenario 3 
From Figure 2, the results obtained in simulation scenario 3 depict that the utilization band is further compressed and 
ranges from 44% to 72%. Despite, no bottleneck is observed, the required level of customer demand remains 
unsatisfied (see Table 3). The possible reason for this can be an underutilization of few resources. As the production 
manager suggested to maintain the utilization band of 50% to 80%, some resources are found to have utilization < 
50%. Thus, the load of the resources with higher utilization is reallocated further to create scenario 4. 
 
4.4 Scenario 4 
In this scenario, the utilization band is observed to range from 52% to 79%, i.e., the suggested range by the expert 
(See Figure 2). Also, the demanded level of parts (throughput) can be produced in this scenario with-in the required 
lead time (167.42 hours), as shown in Table 3. 
 
5. Research Implications 
Applications of TOC to remove the bottlenecks have received immense attention from researchers and practitioners 
worldwide. Most of the researchers have demonstrated the implication of TOC strategies through the demo of 
hypothetical cases (Ikeziri et al., 2019). A hypothetical case is an ideal scenario where the manufacturing constraint 
is known to the researchers or practitioners (Gupta et al., 2002). However, in actual situations, the constraint is 
unknown and gets shifted after every constraint removal. Thus, the actual case scenario has a complex nature than the 
hypothetical. Therefore, the present study is a novel contribution to the body of knowledge on TOC literature to 
illustrate the implementation of TOC strategy for removing and exploiting the manufacturing constraints in an actual 
case to highlight the applicability of TOC in real situations. Further, the proposed TOC strategy i.e. reallocation 
strategy of TOC can be effectively utilized for redistributing the load of constraint or CCR resource over the 
underutilized duplicate resources. The policymakers or practitioners can adopt the proposed DES-based reallocation 
TOC strategy at a manufacturing firm for the successful removal of resource constraints.   
 
6. Conclusion 
The bottleneck management concept is emerged out of the TOC approach (Daultani et al., 2015). TOC has a fruitful 
application since its inception in 1980. TOC consists of different strategies for elevating/exposing the capacity or 
availability of the bottlenecked resources. This study successfully demonstrated the use of reallocation/redistribution 
strategy of TOC in the actual case to enhance the manufacturing performances for fulfilling the customer wants using 
the simulation method. Shifting a load of CCR on the duplicate resources resulted in maintaining the resource 
utilization within the range and thereby helps to achieve the required throughput level within the stated lead time. 
Thus, the proposed strategy can be further utilized by researchers and practitioners for bottleneck management in the 
manufacturing firm. The proposed versatile TOC strategy can further be extended in the fields viz. Project 
management, supply chain, healthcare, marketing, accounting, and logistics.

Abstract 
 
Despite being the sixth-largest manufacturing country in the world, India lags many other countries in the adoption of 
I4.0 technologies. Industry 4.0 is a wide spectrum of technologies which help firms improve on their performance and 
customer satisfaction. Adoption of I4.0 makes a firm more competitive in terms of cost, responsiveness, value, and 
other such dimensions of performance. However, all I4.0 technologies are not equally beneficial. Further, firms are 
not capable of implementing all technologies, at least, in one go. Therefore, a firm with certain limitations needs to 
decide the order in which it should adopt these technologies to improve its performance. The present study is an 
attempt to identify and prioritize these I4.0 technologies and their benefits for manufacturing firms in Indian context. 
The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique has been used for this purpose.

1. Introduction and Literature Review 
Industry 4.0, a term coined in Germany about 8 years back, is a wide spectrum of technologies to help firms improve 
on their performance and customer satisfaction. Industry has witnessed transformative changes starting right from the 
seventeenth century till date, in the twenty first century, and is still undergoing rapid changes which shall continue in 
the near future as well.  According to Zhong et. al. (2017), Industry 4.0 combines embedded production system 
technologies with intelligent production processes to pave the way for a new technological age that will fundamentally 
transform industry value chains, production value chains, and business models. 
 
To better understand Industry 4.0, we need to have a close look at the set of technologies which actually make up this 
entire revolution, Alcacer and Cruz-Machado (2019), for example, have included the Internet of things, cloud 
computing, big data, simulation, augmented reality, additive manufacturing, autonomous robots, and cyber security 
in their literature review on manufacturing technologies in the era of I4.0. 
 
Industry 4.0 adoption is likely to benefit the manufacturing related firms both economically as well as technically. 
The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has reported various such benefits in the context of German manufacturing 
firms. The benefits include improvement in productivity, employment, revenue and investment (Gerbert et. al., 2015).   
 
Industry 4.0 technologies are not expected to bring benefits to the manufacturers without posing some challenges to 
them. Some important challenges to I4.0 adoption have been identified as inadequate physical and digital infrastructure, 
high cost of digital technologies, cyber security issues and skill gaps in workforce and leadership (KPMG, 2018; 
Luthra and Mangla, 2018). 
 
The literature on I4.0 suggests that the concept is in its infancy (Rojas et.a., 2017; Marr, 2018) and that there is not a 
closed definition of I4.0 (Castelo-Branco et. al., 2019). Moreover, the I4.0 technologies are not equally beneficial. In 
the context of over 2000 Brazilian companies, Dalenogare et. al., (2018) have found using regression method that 
some of the I4.0 technologies are more promising than others. Regarding implementation of I4.0 technologies, a study 
in Germany concludes that there is a lack of understanding of how companies implement these technologies (Frank 
et. al., 2019).

5. Conclusions  
The present study had three objectives- prioritization of I4.0 benefits, benefit-wise preference of technologies, and 
overall ranking of the I4.0 technologies. The three benefits include reduction in production, logistics, inventory and 
maintenance costs; shortening of time to produce and time to market; and improvement in output, quality, quality of 
life and customer satisfaction. The technologies had been identified as additive manufacturing (including AI, 3D 
printing and robots), data analytics, Internet of things, and virtual & augmented realities. The findings of the study are 
concluded as below. 
• 
Value enhancement has been judged as the most important benefit of I4.0 adoption with approximately 60% 
importance as compared to reduction in costs (27% weightage) and improvement is response time (nearly 
13%). 
• 
3D printing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robots have emerged as the most preferred 
technologies in order to reap the I4.0 benefits. 
• 
Adoption of IoT at this stage has been found as least important as compared to other three technologies with 
respect to all three benefits. 
• 
Data analytics has more important role to play to achieve reduction in costs and response time as compared 
to that in value enhancement. 
• 
Virtual and augmented realities are more important for value enhancement as compared to reduction in costs 
and response time. 
• 
The overall ranking of the technologies indicates that 3D printing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, 
and robots together (AMG) have been preferred over all other technologies with 55% weightage, followed 
by virtual & augmented realities (VAR), data analytics (DTA), and Internet of things (IOT). 
 
The experts were asked to judge the relative importance of the three benefits and relative ranking of four technologies 
to take advantage of these benefits. This was asked in the context of medium and large manufacturing firms in India. 
Despite being the sixth-largest manufacturing country in the world, India lags many other countries in the adoption of 
I4.0 technologies. Though the automotive industry in the country has taken lead in this direction, the manufacturing 
sector has to go a long way to transform its processes into the Industry 4.0 era. Following recommendations are 
proposed. 
 
• 
Challenges like, large investments, different leadership and skills, and better physical and IT infrastructures 
need to be taken care by the policy makers and industry experts.

In order to move gradually towards fourth industrial revolution along with these challenges, the study 
proposes that the industry should first focus on 3D printing, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and 
robots.  
• 
Intense and efficient use of data to make processes more responsive and efficient may be the next priority.  
• 
Adoption of other advanced technologies shall follow in the due course of time. 
 
There is a wide range of technologies which re coming up under the umbrella of Industry 4.0, nine of them are more 
popular. Also the benefits of I4.0 implementation are many-fold. Since the concept is new and even experts in this 
area may not be fully aware of the technologies and their implementation, only some of them were included in the 
study. Similarly, benefits have been clubbed into three to make comparisons easy. The study is likely to suffer from 
the following limitations- simplification and consideration of limited variables, the number of experts who have 
participated in the survey, and subjective measurement of the variables. Future researchers may take care of such 
limitations by increasing the number of experts, considering specific technologies and benefits, limiting the scope of 
industry with in the manufacturing sector, and choosing other MCDM techniques like Analytic network process 
(ANP).

Abstract 
 
Smart Manufacturing System (SMS) is facilitating new ways for humans and machines to work together, empowering 
businesses to achieve greater insights, reduce the risk of error and make better decisions. This revolution in the 
manufacturing sector is possible through digital transformation, up-gradation to new technological developments and 
effective use of data and thus making the manufacturing sector more intelligent and smart. In recent times, significant 
efforts have been undertaken by the Indian government to promote the implementation of SMS in the Indian 
manufacturing sector to leverage the benefits of this technological transformation. Thus, this paper presents the status 
quo of SMS implementation in Indian “Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)” and discusses the various initiatives 
undertaken by the Indian government and private players. In addition, five case studies are conducted which either is 
seeking or have already implemented SMS system in their working environment. The study also comprehends detail 
about challenges faced by SMEs in SMS implementation and finally elaborate the future scope of SMS based research. 
 
Keywords 
Implementation Challenges, Indian Manufacturing Sector, Multiple Case Study, Smart Manufacturing, SMEs. 
 
1. Introduction 
Manufacturing sector is constantly evolving and producing real value for the manufacturers in all shape and sizes. 
However, complexity in manufacturing, increased global competition, radically changing the demands of the customer 
and need of higher system security requires some pervasive application of network and some real-time monitoring. 
Smart Manufacturing System (SMS) potentially addresses these issues through highly automated system and advance 
enabling technologies (Shukla and Shankar, 2021). SMS is believed to be one of the promising technologies that are 
associated with artificial intelligence and real-time system making the manufacturing practice more efficient (Fedorov 
et al. 2015).  
 
Smart manufacturing is often associated with Industry 4.0, the term introduced in an exposition held in Germany, with 
an intension to promote 4th phase of industrial revolution (Moyne and Iskandar, 2017). This revolution considers 
smart manufacturing as its central element and generally the term is interchangeably used by the most of the researcher 
(Kagermann et al. 2013). SMS is set to revolutionize the present manufacturing ecosystem by incorporating use of 
recent technological developments. Furthermore, this will create foundation for a new digital manufacturing era 
(Shukla and Shankar, In Press). 
 
Smart Manufacturing leverages advance technologies which provide promising approaches to address specific issues. 
The most important ones are “Big Data Analytics (BDA, Cloud Computing (CC), Digital Twin (DT), Internet of 
Things (IoT), 3D Printing and Cyber-Physical System (CPS)”. These technologies can be integrated as per the need 
of the industry instead of going for complete SM system implementation. This can foster great advantage to SMEs 
where financial capability is a constraint in SMS implementation. SMEs have potential to play a crucial role in 
boosting the Indian economy as they can contribute greatly to the country’s socio-economic development (Shukla, 
2018). This sector also contributes in generating employment opportunities thus fostering rural development (Abubakr 
et al. 2020).

needed to eliminate this attacks. 
 
7. Conclusion 
The manufacturing sector is globally witnessing a new period of radical change and transformation. Several advance 
economies are focusing on the implementation of SMS to withstand the competitiveness of the market. Further, SMEs 
across India accounted for nearly 30% of India's GDP and 48% of export in the financial year 2019-20 (PTI, 2018). 
Indian government is much focused on their SMEs as these units also drives employment, exports, and provides 
inclusive growth opportunities. Implementation of SMS in SMEs will act as a catalyst in improving the manufacturing 
prosperity of these enterprises and of the nation. Companies can strategies the implementation of this industrial 
automation using a suitable framework and with clear system architecture. Instead of going for a high-cost 
sophisticated transformation, SMEs can deploy simple and affordable customized automation support system. As 
transformation is not about cost; it is also about how much improvement it brings in manufacturing practice. The cases 
discussed in this paper is a clear evidence to prove that small or single technology transformation provided a major 
help in their production output. Furthermore, the government is also showing clear interest in providing platforms or 
SMS and Industry 4.0 implementation, especially in SMEs to move the steady growth of manufacturing sectors. With 
some successful initiatives like SAMARTH, Aatmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India, the Indian government is 
providing financial support and ease of doing businesses to SMEs. Apart from the Indian government, the private 
firms are also coming forward to joins hands in bringing the SMS implementation in Indian industries. 
 
It is observed through this study that SMEs are going under the required amount of transformation as financial 
constraints restrict them from complete transformation. Case company A an auto ancillary company by installing real-
time monitoring in their machinery benefited around 20% output increases in their production. Similarly, Case 
company E a food-producing, and packaging company integrated an RFID system for tracking and monitoring food 
packaging. By this single integration, the company benefited from the increase in sales turnover 485cr INR (approx.) 
from 80.2cr INR (approx.) by minimizing food waste. The other three case companies also believed in the potential 
of SMS and rather than waiting for complete transformation companies planned to implement this system in specific 
areas. SMEs in India are highly organizing themselves in terms of improving their technology infrastructure and skill 
management. However, many challenges are in the way of these technologies evolving completely in the Indian 
Scenario. But with the confluence of the wisdom of researchers, academicians, “public private partnerships (PPPs)” 
and government members; the complete existence of the SMS in Indian manufacturing can become reality.

Customer convenience has a large role in a customer's decision to use banking services. The major goal of this research 
is to illustrate how different components of customer behavior influence technical improvements in the banking 
business.The findings from 110 bankemployees’ responses have been collected relevant to mobile banking as a 
technological change through convenient sampling for primary data collection. Quantitative data analytical tool –
MATLAB was used to find the correlation between the attributes of cause for changes in banking services and 
technological change. The results appeared were not significant which has made us to use the qualitative data 
analytical tool – NVIVO software which have highlighted convenience is the response of most of the questions 
comparative to other variables for technological changes in banking sector. Through NVIVO Tree mapping, Word 
count, Text search have shown same results.  The results here have highlighted on importantaspect that customer 
convenience is the cause for technological changes in banking sector. These findings insights to banks about how 
important is the customer convenience which is leading to technological upgradation and appropriate usage of tools 
for data analysis depending on qualitative data and quantitative.

1. Introduction 
The organized retail industry, which has experienced remarkable expansion over the previous two decades, is one 
of the most significant fields of research today. During the last two decades, Indian retailers have had to cope with 
more demanding and intelligent consumers, as well as new and often unforeseen conditions, as well as competition 
from both international and local sources, because of a surge of technology advancements.These changes and 
advances put constant pressure on retailers to find new and imaginative methods to add value and set themselves 
apart from their competition (Srivastava 2014). 
 
Banking sector has experienced tremendous changes due to practice of innovations like online banking being at one 
place several jobs done throughout the world, and India is one among them. Continuous customer demands and high 
competition have India to identify the key drivers of loyalty and customer satisfaction (Lenka et al. 2009). Return on 
investment, market share, profitability which are the factor of economic success is realized by loyalty by the customers 
led by satisfaction (Reichheld 1996). The market now lies on the customers which has changed drastically.  
 
The importance of banking was realized by the end of 17thcentury which made the changes in government regulations. 
The new implementations in the banking sector of making payments had highly promoted the industrial growth leading 
to the convenience in payments (Prabhavathi K.  and Dinesh P. 2018).   
 
The rapid development of information technology, the internet, and mobile banking has led to tremendous worldwide 
expansion (Laukkanen 2016; Shankar et al. 2020).Customers' adoption of technology is impacted substantially by the 
speed and convenience of use provided by service providers (Duarte et al. 2018).If any bank provides branch banking

Abstract  
 
Machine learning models have been employed in many organizations for impactful decision-making processes. 
However, bias prevalent in an organization’s model could create meaningful issues, ranging from incorrect hiring 
decisions to a negative impact on an organization’s image. Organizations often lack the knowledge or time to create 
a model in line with society’s standards, leading to the utilization of faulty systems. Here, we present a framework to 
help combat this issue, allowing organizations to prevent bias in their models. Our framework starts with a general 
guidebook to clarify relevant terminology and provide best practices for developers to measure and mitigate bias. We 
then incorporate an automated algorithm based on statistical parity and disparate impact to de-bias raw data. We apply 
SMOTE-Tomek to resample imbalanced datasets and a Reject Option Classification algorithm to reduce biased 
predictions. We infer adding more data related to minority and unprivileged classes to datasets will help create more 
equitable and representative datasets leading to fair AI systems for all. We propose a novel decentralized database 
using web-scraping and homomorphic encryption as a reliable source of real-world data. Our assumed hypotheses 
were confirmed by data derived from extensive testing.

541","One approach to implement explainability in AI is to look into the scope of the explanations, which could either be 
global or local. Global explainability refers to the ability of the model to explain how the overall algorithm functions 
(Guidotti et al., 2018) and how decisions are generally made based on a holistic view of its features and each of the 
learned components such as the parameters, weights, and structures.  Global explanations give an overview of the AI 
system, how the AI learned, what training data were used, and the limitations to the model and use restrictions.  On 
the other hand, local explainability refers to the ability of a model to explain how a specific decision was made such 
as what the main factors were considered to arrive at that decision. Providing explanations of how a decision was 
made largely depends on the context specifically on the target audience of these explanations. For instance, the end-
users of these softwares need different explanations from those who are developers. To efficiently mitigate bias, the 
models need to look at a broader explanation that will give more insight on how the overall system works which will 
let the human operators or the developers identify when the AI systems will likely perform well or badly, or when the 
system will likely show bias in their decision. In this case, the global explainability model best fits the problem of 
mitigating bias. In applying for credit loans, several cases have been reported wherein certain minorities and 
ethnolinguistic groups were penalized by AI systems through their automated recommendation and decision-making.  
By applying the global explainability model to that AI system, it can now have an overall understanding of how they 
make their decisions. Hence, the cause of the bias to those minorities can now be identified and avoided in the future. 
With that, the developers can adjust and modify their algorithm to achieve a better and fairer system. 
 
4 Regulations & Report Logistics 
Bias in AI poses great risks especially when it negatively affects people and violates their rights. When this happens, 
statutory, contractual, and common laws may be violated which will make the companies and organizations liable for 
their AI systems.  Although AI is a relatively new emerging field, many regulations have been enacted by the Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC), the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), and other law-enacting bodies in other 
countries to protect the people from AI's unfair decisions.  
 
Specific Regulations -  
● 
Section 5 of the FTC Act - The FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive practices. That would include the sale 
or use of – for example – racially biased algorithms. 
● 
Fair Credit Reporting Act - The FCRA comes into play in certain circumstances where an algorithm is used 
to deny people employment, housing, credit, insurance, or other benefits. 
● 
Equal Credit Opportunity Act. - The ECOA makes it illegal for a company to use a biased algorithm that 
results in credit discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, 
or because a person receives public assistance. 
 
We propose the creation of a B2C form involving government intervention that affected consumers can fill to report 
bias. If the predictions made are discriminatory, due actions can be taken.  
 
5 Proposed Improvements 
Edited Nearest Neighbor (ENN) is an undersampling technique where the nearest neighbors of each of the majority 
class are estimated. If the nearest neighbors misclassify a particular instance of the majority class, then that instance 
gets deleted. In this approach, the oversampling is done by using SMOTE, and undersampling is done by using ENN. 
This results in a more clear and concise class separation. However, SMOTE+ENN is incredibly aggressive at 
downsampling datasets, and the initial datasets we had used to test our algorithms varied with results with each 
technique, and the implementation of SMOTE+ENN required much more labor. Due to time constraints, we used the 
SMOTE+TOMEK approach instead. However, a SMOTE+ENN solution would have better performance, and this is 
a point of future improvement. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been recently increasing in popularity, 
and we have also attempted to utilize them in our GUI. However, the complexity of GAN models was too high to 
work within our scenario. Further research in GANs would be a huge step forward in the future.  
 
6. Conclusion 
In this paper we have outlined the structure and benefits of our proposed algorithmic framework to counter bias in 
AI/ML systems composing of a general guidebook, an automated de-biasing algorithm, SMOTE-Tomek, and a Reject 
Option Classification algorithm. As reported previously, we have devised a strategy incorporating a novel 
decentralized database to retrieve additional data used for representative datasets. Consequently, this framework

550","represents a powerful tool for teams of all sizes and of all skill levels to address the potential discriminatory predictions 
by its artificial intelligence/machine learning solution.  
This study is an important step towards a user-friendly, accessible approach for common but severe issues in AI 
solutions, in this case bias in artificial intelligence, in a world in which AI is becoming increasingly important. On a 
wider level, research and practical implementation is also needed to determine the solution’s suitability in a large-
scale industry or real-world scenario. However, the prospect of AI being able to transform virtually all sectors and 
the formidable danger of discriminatory towards specific population groups serves as a steady incentive for further 
research.

Abstract 
 
Mobility is always been an important and integrated part of human civilization. It supports social, cultural, & economic 
interaction. However, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, mobility has been restricted due to fear of coronavirus, and 
therefore home delivery services started playing a vital role in contributing to economic activities. That led to manifold 
growth of the E-commerce business. This has significantly affected urban mobility and travel demand.  And it is safe 
to believe that this e-commerce approach will continue to grow even after the pandemic situation gets over. 
Furthermore, the concept of Industry 4.0, IoT, & ICT will definitely have some role to play in E-commerce and, 
therefore, in urban mobility. This paper discusses, at a conceptual level, a number of issues related to E-commerce, 
transportation, Industry 4.0, IoT, & ICT along with logistics and supply chain. This study is important from a futuristic 
point of view as the future looks more toward an automated internet-based approach, and mobility, transportation, and 
logistics cannot remain un-impacted by this. Therefore a possible integrated model for passenger metro train and last-
mile parcel flow of E-commerce deliveries has been proposed. This study is concentrated on Nagpur urban area and 
focused on developing a working methodology to understand the concept of Industry 4.0, IoT, ICT, and E-commerce 
on transportation and mobility.

1. Introduction 
In the last few decades, with the decrease in the prices of technological equipment and internet services, the adoption 
of information and communication technologies (ICT) has increased drastically. The emergence of ICT causes a 
revolutionary impact on the transportation network and people’s choice for performing daily activities. 
Telecommuting and E-shopping are possible just because of ICT (Keskinen et al. 2001, Inro 2002). The modern 
purchasing habits of consumers have altered the shopping and travel pattern significantly (Mans 2012). The E-
commerce market has seen a steep growth in recent years, and it can be observed through the surge in online shopping 
(b2c e-commerce) (Rutter et al.,2017). 
 
However, amid the covid-19 pandemic, restrictive measures taken to control coronavirus spread have given the E-
commerce business manifold growth (Vitale et al., 2020). The research studies from different regions have reported 
that the customers who have adopted online shopping will not revert to offline shopping completely even after the 
pandemic (Pedro Ramos, 2020). To keep the customers attracted to online shopping even after the pandemic, 
businesses should utilize the concept of Industry 4.0 and IoT (Czifra and Molnár, Fatorachian & Kazemi, 2020).  
 
Industry 4.0 is the Buzzword, which Germany first presented to the world and started the Industrial 4.0 revolution 
(Wagner et al. 2016, Hofmann and Rüsch 2017,  Alcácer and Machado 2019). The industry 4.0 approach converts 
conventional factories into smart factories (Hofmann and Rüsch 2017,  Alcácer and Machado 2019). Industry 4.0 
approach consists Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing (CC), Big Data (BD),

mobility, this paper lacks the practical application of IPFS. This is the limitation of the study. In this paper, we have 
just presented the idea for integrating people and fright flow by utilizing the unused capacity of the transit metro rail 
network. This work can be carryforward by a pilot study. Furthermore, the type of infrastructure improvement 
required, planning needed, resources needed, technicality involved, and operational constraints must be researched 
thoroughly before implementation.

Abstract 
Moroccan industrial companies are leading many changes inside their supply chain to take advantage of industry 4.0 
transformation. This optic aims to ensure sustainability and innovation simultaneously.  Or, one of the most crucial 
operations is to enhance innovation inside supply chain processes and to improve supply chain resilience and 
sustainability regarding the changeable environment. Therefore, in this paper, we develop an integral business model 
considering six constructs: supply chain integration, supply chain orientation, competition capability, business 
continuity management, environmental sustainability, and finally human and social approach. Then we apply the 
business model to the case of large and medium Moroccan companies. The main objective is to study the impact of 
the considered constructs with the mediation of industry 4.0 technological systems in achieving supply chain 
innovation and sustainability. Our paper is built of four sections, the first lists previous studies performed in some 
countries, the second presents the proposed business model, the third describes the experimental data collection, and 
in the last part, we discuss the results of the data validation process, followed by a conclusion and work perspectives.

1. Introduction 
In the age of Industry 4.0, the Moroccan manufacturing sector is becoming a dynamic changing field due to the 
international permanent flow of inventions and technological progress. Moroccan authorities have also put forward 
an ambitious industrial acceleration strategy giving new impulses to the field: policies review enhancing 
infrastructure-related public-private-partnerships, high way network and maritime infrastructure modernization, free 
zones creation in many cities, special academic and professional programs more adapted to Moroccan manufacturing 
cooperates needs. Despite those structural reforms and strategic investments as part of the industrial acceleration plan 
launched in 2014 by the Moroccan government, this transformation generated a moderate gain to the country. 
According to IMF Bank data, the gross domestic product (GDP) showed a slow positive trend moving from 101.18

6. Conclusion  
This study aimed to investigate the supply chain innovation and sustainability in the Moroccan industrial field, by 
considering the mediation role that Industry 4.0 technological systems have on the main constructs. The study has 
used the primary data exploratory technique for data collection, along with the help of online questionnaires emailed 
to professionals and experts in Moroccan industrial firms. Using SPSS and SmartPLS software, several tests were 
performed on the 99 completed responses. Basing on factor loading values, Cronbach’s alpha, composite reliability, 
AVE, and discriminant validity, internal and external validity and reliability were confirmed for the constructs. The 
“total effect” analysis is confirming the importance of the following in achieving Sustainable supply chain Innovation: 
Supply chain integration, competition capability, business continuity management, social environment strategy, and 
Industry 4.0 technological systems. The human and social approach has no significant impact on SSCI. The “specific 
indirect effect” analysis confirms the indirect link between all other constructs except the Human social approach. The 
management and policymakers of the Moroccan industrial field are advised to consider strongly this model and the

 Abstract  
 
This article aims at prioritizing and analyzing the enablers that supports implementation of Lean Six Sigma with 
sustainability considerations. 10 such crucial enablers were identified and an integrated Interpretive Structural 
Modeling (ISM) and MICMAC (Matriced’ Impacts Croisés Multiplication Appliqués à un Classement) approach was 
applied for prioritizing the enablers. Based on the analysis, the most dominant and dependent enablers that enables 
LSS adoption with sustainability considerations were identified. The enablers, namely, “Availability of proper defect 
monitoring system, Availability of well designed roadmap for sustainable LSS Implementation and Effective in-bound 
and out-bound communication”, occupy the base segment of the ISM hierarchy; the enabler, namely, “A supportive 
Leadership”, occupy the top level of the ISM hierarchy. The study helped in identifying and prioritizing the enablers 
that supports LSS adoption with sustainable considerations arrived using a mathematical approach. This approach will 
be helpful for practitioners and implementation experts to focus on enabling the key dominant enablers and to deploy 
LSS adoption with sustainable considerations.

1.0. Introduction 
Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a data-driven methodology that combines two effective business improvement 
methodologies, Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma, to improve a company's performance by eliminating wastes and 
lowering process variation (Zhang et al., 2012; Sreedharan et al., 2018). Sustainable manufacturing is defined as the 
production of manufactured goods using cost-effective procedures that reduce negative environmental consequences 
while preserving energy and natural resources (Moktadir et al., 2018; Malek and Tushar., 2019; Sony and Naik, 2020). 
Employee, community, and product safety are all improved by sustainable production. Six Sigma is a well-known 
problem-solving methodology in the manufacturing business. The DMAIC paradigm, which consists of five steps: 
Define, Measure, Improve, and Control, was developed by Motorola in the 1980s and has achieved widespread 
adoption in industry. The DMAIC approach provides a framework for improving a current process' capabilities by 
reducing variance, faults, and even costs. Manufacturing firms have started to deploy both LSS and Sustainable 
Manufacturing strategies to attain integrated benefits. The three dimensions of sustainability i.e Environment, 
Economy and Society have a direct correlation with LSS strategies as both aims at improving the productivity of the

575","4.0 Conclusion 
Ten enablers affecting LSS adoption with sustainable considerations were identified from the literature and their 
interrelationships were obtained based on expert opinion from the case organization consisting of practitioners and 
academicians. Based on the ISM methodology, the model was built which consists of four levels. The first level 
consists of three enablers namely ‘Availability of proper defect monitoring system’, ‘Availability of well designed 
roadmap for sustainable LSS Implementation’ and ‘Effective in-bound and out-bound communication’. These three 
enablers possess maximum driving power and are considered as the most crucial enablers in adopting LSS with 
sustainable considerations. The enablers ‘Availability of infrastructure’ ‘Enhanced focus on sustainable process’ 
‘Frequent amelioration of processes’, ‘Adequate training’, ‘An engaged sponsor’, ‘An engaged sponsor’ and 
‘Effective designing of implementation process’ occupy the second and the third levels. The first level enablers have 
an influence on these enablers and support them. ‘A supportive Leadership’ is at fourth level. These enablers possess 
strong dependence powers and weak driving powers. The firm must take necessary mitigating actions to remove these 
identified enablers in order to make LSS adoption process with sustainable considerations without any hurdles. The 
developed ISM model is further analyzed based on the Enabler’s driving and dependence power in order to create 
clusters of enablers. Based on results of ISM analysis, the enablers are categorized into autonomous, dependent, 
linkage and independent clusters as indicated in Figure 2. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Classification of Enablers 
 
MICMAC principle is based on multiplication properties of the matrices. The purpose of MICMAC analysis is to 
interpret the driving power and dependence power of the enablers. This is performed to identify the key enablers that 
drive the system in various categories. Based on their driving power and dependence power, the enablers in the present 
case have been classified. The enablers ‘A Supportive Leadership’, ‘Adequate Training’ and ‘An Engaged Sponsor’ 
and ‘Effective Designing of Implementation Process’ are considered as the driver  elements. These enablers are 
dependent on their own and are considered as the powerful enablers for integrated implementation of LSS with 
Sustainability considerations. The enablers ‘Availability of Infrastructure’, ‘Enhanced Focus on Sustainable Process’ 
and ‘Frequent Amelioration of processes’ were identified as the linkage enablers. These enablers possess strong

582","dependence and driving powers. These enablers are influenced by lower level enablers and are not stable. These 
enablers have a greater impact on other enablers and significantly affect the LSS adoption with sustainable 
considerations. The enablers ‘Availability of proper defect monitoring system’, ‘Availability of well designed 
roadmap for sustainable LSS’ and ‘Effective Inbound and Outbound communication’. The developed ISM model and 
clustering of enablers will be useful for implementation managers for planning the deployment activities 
systematically. One of the limitations of the study is that about the contextual relationship among the enablers. The 
obtained relationship is based on the brainstorming conducted by the expert panel and were finalized based on the 
practical validity. In future to make the model more competitive, the number of enablers can be increased and the 
relationship can be justified using a statistical model.  Further,  a structural equation modeling approach can be used 
for validating the model statistically.

Abstract 
 
Several smart manufacturing concepts have been proposed during the past half-decade, such as cloud 
manufacturing, industry 4.0 based manufacturing, industrial Internet, and many more. One of their shared 
objectives is to enhance joint efforts across the enterprise by building up a stage to deliver an appropriate 
smartness in manufacturing. A total manufacturing framework consists of a given actual manufacturing 
framework and a stage incorporating a virtual manufacturing framework (planned from actual 
manufacturing itself). The research on scheduling in cloud manufacturing faces numerous difficulties. So, 
there is a need to comprehend the current circumstances and recognize future issues and problems related 
to scheduling in a cloud manufacturing environment. This work covered the spread of the most recent ten 
years and present state-of-the-art studies on scheduling issues in cloud manufacturing. The operating modal 
and procedure are elaborated. Also, this domain is classified precisely. Various conclusions are drawn, and 
future research directions are suggested.

1. Introduction 
The past few years are driven by new industrial production trends and demands such as globalization, personalization, 
digitization, collaboration, and integration by newly emerging technologies such as cloud computing, the Internet of 
Things (IoT), and cyber-physical systems (CPS). It results in a new production paradigm known as cloud 
manufacturing by big data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) (Li et al. 2010, Zhang et al. 2011, Xu 2012). So 
far, cloud production has attracted a lot of research worldwide (Zhang et al. 2013). More than 900 articles have been 
published in this research area (Adamson et al. 2017, Liu et al. 2017). The purpose of cloud manufacturing is to 
provide consumers with on-demand manufacturing services over the Internet. Scheduling is a critical way to reach 
your cloud manufacturing goals. Scheduling has been for decades like operating system process and threat scheduling 
(Tanenbaum et al. 1987) workshop scheduling (Chaudhry and Khan 2016, Sharma and Jain 2016) and flow shop 
scheduling (Yenisey and Yagmahan 2014). In addition, it was a research theme in various fields. Scheduling tasks for 
computing and manufacturing systems such as production environments and computing grids (Rahman et al. 2013) 
Cloud Computing (Singh and Chana 2016) and Manufacturing Grid (Tao et al. 2009). 
 
Scheduling in manufacturing can be characterized as the process of deploying, controlling, and optimizing tasks or 
workloads (Pinedo and Michael 2016) Scheduling can be defined narrowly or broadly in the context of cloud

Abstract 
 
The United Nations (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs) aim to target different stakeholders including 
businesses and development agencies like Non-Government Organisations (NGO) s into doing more. The SDGs are 
inspiring many people; society recalls them frequently and the government is also citing them. The implementation 
of SDGs needs every government and corporate to judiciously prioritize the capacities and resources available. The 
question for corporations is how the stakeholders can work together more effectively to achieve them. India over the 
past few years directed its development to meets its priorities in many areas like employment, food, water, education, 
and energy. In this paper, the researchers are exploring how corporate in India have aligned with SDGs through their 
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The researchers employ the content analysis approach to study and assess the 
annual report of each of these Indian companies through their CSR activities. The researchers through a mapping 
exercise align the CSR activities to the various SDGs. Through the mapping exercise the researchers have explored 
the specific SDGs to which these companies are focused. The researchers also explored the convergence between 
SDGs and the existing CSR activities within their companies. The study was performed with a sample of 58 
Government-owned companies, various sectors like Energy, Oils, Financials, Telecom and IT.

Introduction 
 
The United Nations developed and approved the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 as part of the 2030 
Agenda, which is a UN accord to enhance sustainability by 2030(Fleming et al,2018).The General assembly 
established  special commission which later became known as the World Commission on Environment and 
Development (WCED) distributed  “Our Common Future,” further known as “The Brundtland Commission Report” 
that defines sustainable development as “progression that addresses current problems without endangering people's 
ability to meet their own future needs  ""(WCED,  1987). 
 
Earlier sustainable development was considered as an environmental issue and later considered as a protection of the 
natural resources. Recent studies show that economic and environmental issue is not separate from social issue. Earlier 
the responsibility to protect the environmental was on government, which was later considered to be part of society 
and recently it is looked as a responsibility of the business (Behringer and Szegedi, 2016). 
 
The SDG Compass developed by GRI, UN Global Compact (UN GC) and WBCSD states that the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) define worldwide sustainable development needs, preferences and inclinations for the

597","Continuing to address the second research question, the chart shown below in Figure 6 depicts that, 64% of company 
CXO’s bring up the goals into their discussion. It is evident that more than more than half of the top executives 
mentioned and broach SDGs in their conversation and certainly strategic within their plans and goals. These CXOs 
also mention the SDGs within their company annual reports. 
 
Findings 
Although there was no widely accepted framework or standard for SDG acknowledgment, the business interest in the 
SDG has grown significantly since its introduction in 2015. Most of the companies mentioned SDG goals in their 
Annual Reports, whereas some companies are yet to add and announce in their open data.  
 
Limitations 
The researchers included only a sample of 58 listed CPSE for this study. Only the data for the year 2017-2018 was 
collected and analysed. For the study, the mapping exercise was done only with the CSR tasks/activities. The 
researchers did not include the amount spend by the CPSEs on each task/activity. 
 
Conclusion 
This research explored the convergence between SDG and CSR initiatives within the public listed government owned 
companies in India. The analysis is focused on Government-Owned Public Listed companies in India to ensure if these 
companies are aligned strategically towards SDGs. The study mapped the SDG goals towards the CSR activities of 
these listed CPSEs and through the mapping exercise shown in their results explored the specific SDGs which these 
companies focused on and also the least concentrated goals.

Abstract  
 
In the current industrial scenario, manufacturing organizations are dealing with issues pertaining to lack of resources, 
higher environmental impacts and decreased value creation. To make the manufacturing process more efficient and to 
cope up with the volatile industrial market, manufacturing organizations have started to adopt sustainable strategies 
that focus on gradually decoupling economic activity from the consumption of finite resources, and designing waste 
out of the system. Circular Economy is one such strategy which involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, 
refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products. Deploying circular economy strategies would make the 
firm to strengthen its business model and also improves the overall value of the manufacturing process and as well as 
the product. A dedicated framework is required for deploying the circular economy concepts systematically. This 
research article proposes a dedicated framework for deploying circular economy concepts in manufacturing 
organizations. The developed framework consists of five phases namely Framing the factors, Production and 
Deployment, Collection and Reuse, Usage and Consumption and Measuring the performance. Each phase consists of 
a set of directives for deploying the concepts. The developed framework will be useful for implementation managers 
and manufacturing firms willing to deploy circular economy concepts in their organization.

1. Introduction 
The structure of the supply chain has been largely untouched since people started to make and distribute products to 
each other (De Angelis et al., 2018). Raw materials flow in, are transformed into a product, and distributed and used 
until they are finally discarded. These discarded products have the potential of being raw materials or inputs for other 
process that are carried out worldwide (Tseng et al., 2020).  This will most probably reduce the consumption of new 
raw materials and increase the profitability of the industry. Hence the after-market supply chain is gaining popularity 
over the custom linear supply chain, which is circular supply chain. The circular economy is a business concept that 
promotes application of reuse, remanufacturing, recycling methodologies on the discarded materials by product 
manufacturers and suppliers (Patwa et al., 2021). Industries are refurbishing discarded parts by melting down them to 
return them to their raw material form rather than developing a one-time-use products and transforming the model to 
“take, make, use, reuse”.In industrial ecology and production economic literature the term circular economy is deep 
rooted, at present it is spreading in business and its practices too. It is also  termed as a systemic approach

Fuzzy logic mathematical tool could be  deployed for performing the assessment. Fuzzy logic has the ability to deal 
with complex concepts, which are not responsive to a straightforward quantification and contain ambiguities. Further 
by applying fuzzy logic techniques, it is possible to identify the weak enablers and suitable improvement activities 
could be deployed for enhancing the performance of such enablers.  
 
4. Conclusion 
Circular Economy is an approach that is applied to eliminate waste and to maximize value by redesigning the 
manufacturing and distribution process. It concerns about making the production more sustainable by focusing on 
improving the indicators of Environment, Economy and Society. For deployment of Circular Economy concepts 
systematically, it requires a high level map or framework for guiding the implementation process. The present work 
describes about development of a dedicated framework for deployment of circular economy concepts for 
manufacturing organizations. The developed framework consists of five phases namely Framing the factors, 
Production and Deployment, Collection and Reuse, Usage and Consumption and Measuring the performance. Each 
phase consists of sub activities to be deployed and are designed to be implemented in a step by step manner. The 
developed framework allows the firm to assess its resources before implementation and makes the firm ready to the 
actual deployment. The developed framework provides a step by step procedure for deployment and also supports in 
enhancing the firm’s efficiency post deployment of CE concepts. The developed framework will be useful for 
implementation managers, production managers and process engineers to systematically analyze their production and 
distribution system and allows them to plan their deployment activity during the framework deployment. In future, 
the developed framework can be validated with the case study and based on the implementation challenges, the 
framework can be further modified.

Abstract 
 
In this research study, the researchers have analyzed the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) of the 58 listed Central 
Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) in terms of women empowerment and further analyzed in terms of Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). To analyze and measure women empowerment, the researchers extracted relevant data 
from the 2019-20 Annual Report of the 58 CPSEs. The researchers performed qualitative content analysis and through 
descriptive data analysis analyzed the participation of the CPSEs towards women empowerment through their CSR 
activities. The results of the study suggest that most of the listed CPSEs are engaged in women empowerment-related 
CSR activities. The result further shows that participation of the Heavy Engineering, Refinery, and Service Industries 
towards women empowerment-related CSR activities is the highest, whereas that of the Coal, Fertilizer, and 
Medium/Light Industries is the lowest. The study has also found that most of the sectors are promoting women 
empowerment through skill and educational development of women followed through their health and hygiene 
improvement programs. It also shows that these activities would improve their productivity and employability which 
in turn will open the opportunities for generating steady and sustainable income for them.

1. Introduction 
Member countries of the United Nations set Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000. It aimed to achieve 
eight goals and the goals was decided to achieve by 2015. MDGs were not effective enough to address all the global 
issues as these are more of a politically inclined agenda for developing countries (Pedersen 2018). Therefore, the idea 
of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) came as progress to MDGs in 2015, where 193 member countries agreed 
to achieve the goals under SDGs by 2030.  
 
Sustainable Development means fulfilling the needs of the current generation, but at the same time not compromising 
the needs of future generations. All the member countries of the United Nations organized a summit on Sustainable 
Development in September 2015 at United Nations headquarter in New York and decided on 17 sustainable goals to 
achieve to ‘make the planet a better place. Compared to MDGs, the SDGs agenda are more ambitious and inclusive. 
SDGs are not only for developing countries, developed countries are part of this ambitious project as well. Govt of 
each country declared these 17 goals and under these goals 169 targets to achieve.

614",,"On the other hand, the Coal/Lignite, Medium/Light Engineering, and Fertilizer sectors focus little on women's 
development. In Medium/Light industries many companies are running at loss. So CSR rules are not applicable for 
them. This could be a reason for the poor performance of this industry towards women’s development activities. In 
the Industry-wise division here, less number of CPSEs are coming under the Coal/Lignite Industry. So the Coal 
industry is also not contributing enough towards women empowerment through their CSR activities. On the other 
hand, the coalfields are usually located in interior areas of the country, where women's development activities are the 
most important and urgently needed to eradicate gender inequality. Women in these areas are lagging in terms of 
educational attainment, health awareness, and economic activities. Therefore, the researchers recommend to the govt 
to prioritize women empowerment-related other activities in these areas as it is of utmost necessity to achieve gender 
equality by reducing regional disparities among women. 
 
The current study shows that most of the CPSEs are contributing maximum resources for skill and educational 
development, followed by their contribution towards health and hygiene-related programs. These results are 
encouraging because job-oriented skill development and educational attainment will finally lead to women 
empowerment. Moreover, CSR activities for health development programs will enhance health and hygiene awareness 
among women which will also increase their economic productivity. So improvement of women’s health condition 
and their educational development will help the country achieving women empowerment more steadily and 
sustainably. 
 
6. Limitations and Future Research 
The current research was done with a narrow sample space of the 58 listed CPSEs and their CSR activities towards 
women empowerment and only for the financial year of 2019-20. In the future, further research can be carried on by 
taking a bigger sample and by using the time-series data. In addition, the researchers also addressed only the 
fundamental questions towards women empowerment. Using a larger sample size and using longitudinal data and 
utilizing statistical methods the study can reveal more insights.

Abstract  
 
Ergonomics has created a lot of interest and is being increasingly applied in manufacturing and service 
organizations. The research output from academia has highlighted the relationship between ergonomics and 
productivity, health and safety and quality. For small and medium industries, the application of ergonomics is a 
hurdle as necessary information, guidelines and training for risk assessment tools is seldom available from a  
single source. Therefore it is proposed to develop a Computer Assisted System for Ergonomic Risk Assessment 
(CASERA), which is user-friendly.  The proposed system is developed in Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET). The 
proposed system is divided into three modules, information, assessment and standards. The information module 
educates the user about ergonomics, applications, principles, anthropometry, workstation design guidelines, 
awkward postures, musculoskeletal risks etc. In the assessment module, most popular ergonomic assessment tools 
such as Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA), Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA), Quick Exposure 
Checklist (QEC), Ovako Working posture Assessment. System (OWAS), NIOSH lifting tool and Strain Index 
(SI) are included. The step by step information given along with images of postures makes it easy for the user to 
perform assessments. In each tool, the workers preliminary information, job/tasks assessed and other details can 
be stored and retrieved. In this module provision is made to add further assessment tools. The standards module 
gives an overview of all environment standards about noise, heat, illumination; workspace, checklists, 
questionnaires, ergonomic controls, list of ISO and other standards and links for further information. Hence the 
proposed system is a complete package aimed to assist the owner/engineer/supervisor in understanding about 
ergonomics and carry out preliminary assessments for identifying the level of risks, designing workstation and 
applying standards. The CASERA software has been validated by carrying out RULA assessment for 100 postures 
from different occupations. The results of assessment from the software are on par with the manual assessments 
done by RULA scoring sheet. The system is user-friendly, and saves times in assessments, and all information is 
easily stored and retrieved for further analysis. Especially for the small scale industries, CASERA can be used to 
increase the awareness and application of ergonomics.

Abstract 
 
Social Entrepreneurship is a growing field, with its new approaches and distinct goals, it has its important role in the 
development of the economy. In this study, the researchers through an exhaustive review of literatures reveal the 
several concepts of Social Entrepreneurship and in try to develop a unique dimension towards the study of social 
Entrepreneurship. Since, Social Entrepreneurship has emerged from different regions and geographical boundaries of 
the world, it has been defined by many researchers in different ways. In this study, the authors utilize a detailed review 
of literatures approach through various existing definitions and develop three (3) key dimensions towards social 
entrepreneurship:  Social change, Social Innovation and Social Value. 
 
Keywords  
Social Entrepreneurship, Social Change, Social Value, Social Innovation 
 
1. Introduction  
‘Social Entrepreneurship’ has been expressed and defined by experts and researchers in many ways.  Even after more 
than two decades, research in Social Entrepreneurship is still very promising. The meaning of social entrepreneurship 
has been stated in numerous ways by several people. (Dees, 1998). Social entrepreneurship is a developing field and 
is attracting large number of academicians in the field of research, by policy makers and practitioners. (Editorial, 
2006). (Mair & Lanuza, 2006) expresses that there is an absence of complete understanding and distinct views of 
social entrepreneurship, the author writes that our main aim must be to describe the thoughts and theories of social 
entrepreneurship so that it can become an organized field of research. 
 
Social Entrepreneurships has the capacity to advance by developing products and services to solve the various societal 
problems. They are called as ‘change agents’ for the reason that they have the passion and the determination to develop 
ideas into reality. (Thompson, Alvy, & Lees, 2000). According to the authors, social entrepreneurs can satisfy the 
needs of the people by utilizing the various available resources to make a difference in all kinds and sectors of the 
economy from profit, non-profit to hybrid organizations and of all sizes that are not taken care by the government.  
Growth in the study of social entrepreneurship has led to the advancement of several definitions. To come to a proper 
understanding of the key element of the construct there has to be an agreement across various fields.  (Miller & Certo, 
2008). Therefore, the requirement of this paper is to develop key dimensions to the meaning of social entrepreneur. 
 
1.1 Objectives  
In this study, the researchers focus to understand the important concepts used in the various definitions of Social 
Entrepreneurship and finally develop a dimensional concept on Social Entrepreneurship.

625","4. Limitations of the Research 
This study, the researchers attempted to explore the various concepts and sub-concepts of Social Entrepreneurship and 
create the key dimensions, however, the authors explored only limited literature reviews. There is further scope to 
perform an exhaustive literature reviews for better understanding of the dimensions. In addition, the authors can 
develop a deeper conceptual model on dimensions after an exhaustive literature review. The authors should also 
explore the quantitative and qualitative research analysis methods for a better analysis.  
 
5.  Scope for future research 
The researchers can explore and develop the study on Social Entrepreneurship based on qualitative and quantitative 
methods and analysis. The authors can also perform case studies and across timeframes. The researchers also need to 
perform an exhaustive literature reviews for a deeper research study. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The study has considered the three key dimensional concepts of social entrepreneurship as social change, social 
innovation and social value by studying the various definitions. These three main concepts bring out the meaning of 
social entrepreneurship that has been given by various authors and writers.

Abstract 
 
Location of ambulances is an important decision in the planning of emergency medical services, which 
enables responding to patients within short response time, thus, reducing morbidities and saving lives. We 
consider an ambulance location problem that takes into account the variation in demand across the hours 
of day and also accounts for server level ambulance availability. The proposed problem considers a 
combination of performances measures including coverage and survival function for different patient types. 
A mixed integer programming (MIP) model is presented to model the problem. A solution approach based 
on the genetic algorithm that uses a mixed chromosome representation is developed. The proposed approach 
is applied on a realistic dataset generated based on an urban location in India. The effectiveness of the 
proposed solution approach was validated through comparison with results from commercial optimization 
software (CPLEX).

Abstract 
 
With ever rising need to showcase behaviour that is sustainable not only for the present but the generations to 
come, there is an ardent need to understand what possibly might      stop them for not doing so. The blame of the 
likely deviation from being environment friendly in choice of green substitutes could be charged on various 
situational factors, which in this paper has been termed as A’s (Affordability, Availability, Accessibility, 
Acceptability, Awareness, Apprehension) – the moderators in the process of intents converting in to acts. The 
relevant literature mentions a lot in terms of what forms the basis for the intentions to shape up, however the paper 
proposes the use of Maslow’s needs hierarchy model to delve into the driving motives to buy a certain product or 
service deemed to be GREEN. This paper also proposes a conceptual framework which weaves in the flow of the 
likely intention-action gap right from the motives that may shape the attitude to buy green products/service to 
situational roadblocks that may not allow to do so. The proposed model can be extended and thereby validated 
with empirical work as part of the future scope of study.

1. Introduction 
Whilst a lot is often debated about going green, significance to sustainability both by consumers and the companies 
are at all-time high, where the former often holds later responsible for green production of their goods; consumers’ 
green purchasing lags far behind: an intention-action gap exists (Carrington et al., 2014). Additionally, young 
consumers are the ones that suffer continuous confusion in making that purchase decision as to picking 
environmentally sustainable product or choosing products that they are brand loyal about which they may or may 
not be ecologically conscious (Barbarossa & Pastore, 2015). 
 
Notwithstanding, the kind of importance that is conferred to be green and green products, the market share of 
green products stand at meagre 1-3% (Bray et al., 2011) Also, regardless of consumers’ interest in sustainability 
and green products, green plays a very “non-important” criteria while making a purchase decision. Researchers 
find an obvious  gap in what consumers deliberate and what they really act on when it comes to green purchasing: 
the so called attitude-behaviour gap (intent-action gap) (Vermeir & Verbeke, 2006), (Karem Kolkailah et al., 
2012). Consumers particularly millennials often ask for brands that embrace purpose and sustainability. In a recent 
survey 65% respondents reported that they intend to buy purpose-driven goods that support sustainability, however 
only about 26% actually went ahead and exhibited the same. Hence, an unsatisfying inconsistency is at the core 
of green business (White et al., 2019). 
 
Whilst consumer’s mandates firms to be ever more environmentally conscious, firms expect the consumers to be 
more sustainable consumers. Like, with Unilever approximations of 70% of company’s greenhouse gas footprints 
will be contingent to its consumer’s choice of product and whether or not they use and dispose of them in

Abstract 
 
Automation of operational activities in trackless underground hard rock mines is very common and necessary 
trend in present day Indian mining scenario. The use of various types of electrical machineries and equipments 
like electro-hydraulic drill jumbo, electrically operated LHD (Load haul Dump), auxiliary and booster ventilation 
fans, winding system and pumping system etc. are essential requirements for carrying out mining operations 
efficiently and safely. Beside this, mine Illumination system comprises large number of electrical components. 
As the use of the electricity is indispensable in nature and exposure of miners to the electrical equipments is 
increasing day- by- day, the occurrence of electricity related accidents in mining industry is also increasing. In 
this context, a detailed study on recent accident/incidents caused by electrical installations in mines and 
associated hazardous issues in a trackless underground hard rock mine was conducted. The major outcomes of 
case study exhibited the necessity of a methodical approach using suitable scientific tools to moderate the hazards 
associated with the electrical equipments and installations during different unit operations in case study mine. As 
the measures of control, a proactive Mine Electrical Safety Management System (MESMS) has been established 
in accordance with the Directorate General of Mine safety (DGMS), India, guidelines, CEA (Central Electricity 
Authority) Regulation,2010, India and Hazard and Operability Analysis (HAZOP) procedure and instigated for 
implementation. In this paper; design and development of various components of MESMS viz. hazard 
identification and Risk assessment of electrical equipment operations and maintenance activities, Standard 
Operating Procedures (SOP) for significant hazards and apposite   work plans (WP) to accomplish the goal of 
operational safety have been demonstrated.

1. Introduction 
In industries, the incidents or hazards can be categorized mainly into two distinct types, the electrical incidents 
and the non-electrical incidents, and the mitigation measures are based on the category of the incident aiming to 
minimize the risk of the incidents for future occurrences and reducing the probability of occurrences. This paper 
focused explicitly on electrical incidents in mining industries as the use of electrical equipment like mining tools, 
logistics and other numerous types of equipment in mining industries are very common these days. However, with 
such tremendous use of electrical equipment/tools on the other hand increases the chances of electrical hazards 
like electrical shock, fire eruptions due to electrical faults, and at extreme cases the explosions etc. Therefore, 
electrical safety has become one of the major concerns for mining industries.  
 
The electrical hazards are very different from nonelectrical hazards and are very difficult to deal with as it is 
apparently very hard to envisage the level of hazard associated with an electrical circuit just by mare visual 
inspection of the circuit. For example, just by visual inspection, it is impossible to realize the voltage level of a 
conductor or a terminal with respect to the earth or ground potential, or how much current a conductor is carrying 
or whether a given circuit is energized or not, and hence the main cause of electrical hazards. Therefore, external

It is very difficult to establish wireless communication in underground mines as the “Wireless systems did not 
work effectively due to complicated line of sight and signal transmission constraints” (Sarkar, Adhikari and 
Mangal A,2021). Thus, necessity of efficient communication system between several workplaces at underground 
is demonstrated as a vital constituent of MESMS. 
 
7. Conclusion 
The process of evaluating the safety performance over preceding years is a postmortem or reactive safety 
management effort (accident enquiry, analysis of safety statistics, finding responsible persons etc.)  and is not 
useful in present day scenario. The healthier way would be to recognize the lead indicators like numbers and 
quality of training classes conducted, evaluation of worker’s risk sensitivity and understanding of MESMS etc. 
which can indirectly help in identifying new hazards, improving standard operating procedure(SOP), bringing 
existing risk control indexes(ERCI) from low to high etc. There is a need for modernizing the training system by 
using simulation based modules and audio visual effect oriented systems. The world of virtual reality and digital 
monitoring of Major hazards could be an effective step towards efficient implementation of MESMS. However, 
it is essential that the input of all stakeholders should be given solemn consideration during feedback management 
for the enrichment of such proactive approach; otherwise the process of MESMS will remain an exercise on paper 
and not promulgate in right way.

Abstract 
 
Employee engagement has been a key focus area by Indian Organizations during the pandemic. This research paper 
focuses on the origins of Employee Engagement theories and how Indian companies are navigating these employee 
engagement practices due to the pandemic. There have been studies in this regard and empirical evidence indicates 
that improvement in Employee Engagement directly correlates to improved productivity. 
The authors in this paper, explore the details of the employee engagement and map the theoretical aspects to the 
various engagement practices undertaken by Indian companies during the pandemic. The research shows that 
organizations have been able to effectively manage the crisis by supporting the employee’s infrastructure requirement 
and address their safety needs. However, there is little evidence by these organizations, rehauling their core 
fundamentals in the terms of employees Roles & Responsibilities and changes in organizational processes.

1. Introduction 
Human resource consultancy firms are positive that work engagement is the key to improve productivity.  In this belief 
organizations now measure their employees' level of engagement, attempting to positively influence productivity, 
profitability, turnover and safety (Little and Little 2006). An engaged employee is happy & satisfied and has positive 
relationships with their environment resulting in enhanced productivity (Kaushik and Guleria 2020).   So, it does mean 
that work engagement pays off and that, it is vital to understand what drives engagement (Bakker and Leiter 2010). 
There has been several sketchy definitions of Engagement and Disengagement in the past (Kahn 1990) and a variety 
of opinions exists as to how it can be measured and improved.

The outbreak of Covid-19 across the world is the biggest concern for all the countries. Controlling the Covid-19 virus 
outbreak is very challenging and India has managed the pandemic through strict measures. This research explores the 
impact on employees working in companies in India. The researchers extracted data from various Research journals, 
Articles, and Newspapers. This study presents the Impact of Covid-19 on employees of various companies in India 
and measures taken by different companies in the field of safety, healthcare, Wellbeing Allowances, financial aspects, 
and how many companies are thinking beyond their own staff to cope up with the difficult situation and impact of 
Covid-19. This study answers different research questions like how companies are managing their work in this Covid-
19 pandemic situation in a comprehensive manner. Based on the theoretical underpinnings of Employee Engagement, 
the researchers explore the various engagement aspects by companies in India.

1. Introduction 
Covid-19 or Novel Corona Virus was declared as a worldwide epidemic as well as a pandemic by the World Health 
Organisation at the beginning of the year 2020 due to infections by humans. The Covid-19 pandemic caused a loss of 
economy, health, and human life in India. The government of India has utilized its existing pool of resources to its full 
extent to tackle the impact. Covid-19 impact in India ruined the economic activity of industries and businesses across 
various sectors. Many lost their jobs and some companies deducted the salary of their employees. There were multiple 
effects like people reducing their expenses, impact on demand and hence supply and increase of market goods.  This 
also led to increasing in unemployment. Millions of workers were forced to select government-supported job schemes 
from various sectors. Private sector also joined the bandwagon on supporting the workers. Big tech firms such as 
Microsoft, Accenture, Tata Group, Reliance Group, Walmart, Google, Amazon, and many other corporate sectors 
pledged their support. 
 
COVID-19 brought dire need to strengthen the engagement level of employees, and human resources (HR) of 
organizations were adversely impacted with Covid-19. The corporate world was undergoing all aspects like layoffs, 
furloughs, and resignations. Some companies had to adopt the dismissal of employees (Kumar 2021). The Covid-19 
put employees of India in a despondent situation. Many companies took initiatives to minimize the impact on 
employees like employee's safety, redefining seating arrangement, introducing shift system work, virtual meetings, 
introducing cleaning protocols through frequent and regular sanitization as well as facilities of hand sanitizers, use of 
access cards instead of biometric and work from home. 
 
The economic activity of India got badly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic because of which thousands of people 
lost their jobs, or the major part of their incomes, in a very short period of time (Bapuji et al. 2020). Apart from reduced

1. Introduction 
Management of Human Resources in the Telkom Pension Fund can be said to be very important to improve the 
performance of HR itself which will certainly have an impact on the company's performance (Fakhri et al., 2020). 
Therefore, the performance of Telkom Pension Fund employees must be good because it will also affect the 
achievement of Telkom Pension Fund in managing retired employees of Telkom Indonesia. The effectiveness and 
efficiency of a company depends on the performance of its employees. The following employee performance data for 
the last three years are available in Table 1. 
 
Based on Table 1 above, the performance of employees at the Telkom Pension Fund in 2017 all employees were in 
the P2 position with a percentage of 73%. In 2018 and 2019 there was a very significant decline, namely employees 
were in the P3 position with a percentage of 92.3% and 95.5%, respectively. Based on this, it can be concluded that 
employees have not achieved maximum performance. Then the author conducted an interview with the Head of

691","3.4 Hypothesis Testing 
a. Partial Hypothesis Testing (T Test) 
 
Based on Table 7 data processing t test results (partial) can be seen that: 
The Work Life Balance (X1) variable has a value of t_(count ) (2.374) > t_(table ) of (1.993) with a significance level 
of 0.020 < 0.05 then H_0 is rejected, H_1 is accepted. Therefore, it can be concluded that partially there is a significant 
effect of work life balance (X1) on employee performance (Y). 
Physical Work Environment Variable (X2) has a value of t(count) (7,000) > t(table) of (1,993) with a significance 
level of 0.000 < 0.05 then H0 is rejected, H1 is accepted. Therefore, it can be concluded that partially there is a 
significant effect of the physical work environment (X2) on employee performance (Y). 
 
b. Simultaneous Hypothesis Testing (F Test) 
Based on the table above, the results of the f (simultaneous) test above, it can be seen that F_(table) is 3.12. The value 
of F(count) is 52.860 with a significance level of 0.000 < 0.05. So it can be concluded that the effect of work life 
balance (X1) and physical work environment (X2) on employee performance (Y) with a value of F(count) of 52.860 
> F(table )3.12. These results indicate that H0 is rejected while H1 is accepted, meaning that the independent variables 
consisting of work life balance and physical work environment simultaneously have a significant effect on employee 
performance.

3.5 Coefficient of Determination 
Based on Table 9 above, it can be seen that the coefficient of determination R is 0.771 and the value of  𝑅𝑅2 (R square) 
is 0.595 or 59.5%. Here is the formula for calculating R square: 
Kd= 𝑅𝑅2 x 100% 
= 0,7712 X 100% 
= 59.5% 
This shows that the independent variables consisting of work life balance (X1) and physical work environment (X2) 
have an influence on the dependent variable of employee performance (Y) of 59.5% while the remaining 40.5% is the 
influence of other variables that not researched.

Abstract 
 
The employment as lecturers can cause them to be tied with the scope of duties related to teaching, learning, research, 
publication, consultation, and administration. All these scopes involve varying workloads. Therefore, lecturers need 
to divide time for happiness in carrying out their duties. This study was conducted to measure the happiness of lecturers 
in Malaysian Public universities and find the main reasons or factors to be happy at workplace. In addition, the 
relationship between lecturer happiness factors and organizational factors was also investigated in this study. A total 
of 30 lecturers who represented Malaysian public universities were randomly selected as respondents. The findings of 
the study showed that lecturers in Malaysian public universities were happy all the time at workplace. The five factors 
that had been identified related to lecturer happiness include workload, work environment, income, leadership, and 
job specifications. In addition, this study also examined the different organizational factors that contributed to lecturer 
happiness. The results of this study can be used to enhance the happiness of lecturers at Malaysian public universities.

1. Introduction  
The transformations and revolutions that have taken place in the current era of globalization have affected many 
sectors especially the education sector. This situation could affect the thinking of academicians to be competitive in 
line with the current scenario. Lecturers need to ensure that the goals set by the organization need to be achieved as 
planned by the organization. A lecturer or academician has a high responsibility in the teaching and learning system 
to produce students who are competitive and in line with the needs of the market in the future. Meanwhile, lecturers 
have high responsibilities because they have to ensure that students get jobs according to the job market. Lecturers in 
public universities are not only responsible for the teaching and learning process only but also have to face the seven 
(7) scopes of work which including teaching, learning, publication, supervision, research, consulting, as well as social 
services to the community (Zaini Ujang, 2012). The lecturers are bound by these seven scopes of task which may lead 
towards the inability to control the stress and being unhappy at workplace. All the tasks of the scopes need to be done 
at the national or international levels. If the lecturer succeeds in reaching the international level, the merit given is 
higher compared to the achievement at the national level (Isa et al., 2021).  
 
According to Isa et al., (2021), apart from the scope of duties that can result in lecturers feeling burdened, they are 
also tied to administrative duties such as having positions in associations or organizations. They also added that the 
lecturers are also bound to hold rotational positions in the university’s administrative structure. Each scope entrusted 
to the lecturers has a different weighting. Thus, these types of factors can cause the lecturers to be vulnerable to stress 
if the they are not able to manage the task systematically. 
 
The responsibilities borne by these lecturers can lead to psychological disorders. If the psychology of the lecturer is 
disturbed, the lecturer will be overburdened and unhappy at workplace (Fanggidae et al., 2016). Therefore, lecturers 
need to control the stress faced wisely to ensure that the lecturers feel happy in doing the tasks. Thus, a study needs 
to be done to identify the organizational factors that can contribute to the happiness of lecturers so that lecturers can 
focus on happiness against stress (Angriani et al., 2017).

In conclusion, it can be said that the level of happiness of lecturers in Malaysian public universities is moderate. The 
factors that contribute in organizational happiness are workload, work environment, income, head leadership, and job 
specifications. These factors are also found to be the main prevalence contributing to the happiness of lecturers in 
public universities. However, leadership factors and job specifications have less impacts on lecturer happiness. It can 
be concluded that lecturers in Malaysian public universities have their methods in managing stress and ensuring that 
they remain happy at workplace. The findings of this study can be used to conduct stress control programs as useful 
strategies to ensure that the organization is always happy in carrying out tasks.

Abstract 
 
This paper presents the descriptive data of organizational factors that contribute to staff happiness. The 
survey was conducted in one of the Malaysian Higher Education Institutions which was located in the 
southern region of Peninsular Malaysia. The study involved 15 respondents comprising academic and non-
academic staff at Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia. A session of Round Table Discussion (RTD) was 
organised to discuss the issues that were highlighted in a survey data. The topics included the opinions and 
suggestions of respondents to propose personal factors that contributed to staff happiness. The RTD session 
was audio-recorded and transcribed. The respondents were given a copy of the transcripts to review and 
ensure the accuracy. The data were analysed using thematic analysis. In order to confirm data 
trustworthiness, the researchers applied both participant and literature review cross-checks. The data 
analysis showed that personal economy and appreciation dimension were among the highest contributors 
in determining employee happiness, followed by support system, workstation environment and trust. In 
conclusion, the data set provided an initial record on how personal factors of employees in the organisation 
had affected their happiness at workplace.

1. Introduction 
Happiness is a personal perception of the state of being happy. The positive human emotion phenomenon has long 
been related to the success of employers' jobs, wellbeing and efficiency at the workplace (Nasir & Omar, 2006). Most 
adults typically, spend the whole day at work. There is also no surprise if the effect of employment and workplace 
have impact on the workers. Happiness can increase the productivity and quality of workers since they tend to perform 
at their best. In addition, occupation does not only contribute towards the economic level, but also the psychological 
aspects of the workers, such as career fulfilment, pleasure and social stability in human life. Individuals who are happy 
at work would be more likely to support others, possess innovation, be social, remain compassionate and have healthy 
behaviour (Biswas-Diener & Dean, 2007). Happy individuals in a positive mood may also be able to hinder themselves 
from being subject to risks of anxiety, depression and hypertension.

Table 7 presents the data of the respondents’ responses about the trust element which contributes to staff happiness at 
the workplace. Most of the respondents’ responses (f=6 out of f=9) stated that ‘believe in God’ was an important 
element that affected the staff’s emotion to feel happy. Besides that, employees wished that organisations could 
organize more events to strengthen the spiritual elements (f=2) and be fair (f=2) all the times in any decision making. 
According to Anu (2013) employees with spiritual qualities would quest for a higher purpose of life, have personal 
meaning and create a desire to integrate the self with God. Furthermore, it also can be said that spiritual element can 
be used to improve organisational performance.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 The data revealed that staff happiness is very much contributed by the personal factors which included personal 
economy, personal appreciation, support system, workstation environment, and trust. Considering the fact that 
employees are the significant sources to help achieve the organization’s goal, the management should put employee 
welfare as a priority before hiring them. Personal factors of employees play a significant role in affecting their 
emotions and behaviour during office hours. In addition, happy emotions will affect their performance and the 
organisation’s effectiveness as well. In future, this study recommends to expend more elements of the organisational 
factor because there are too many elements that could have influence towards employee happiness and stress as well.

Abstract  
 
The advancement of modern technology, specifically speaking Industry 3.0 and 4.0 has brought enormous amount of 
changes to the manufacturing sector. It has resulted in a very high automation of existing manufacturing sectors. 
Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS) have become the backbone of the modern industries due to this technological 
advancement. However, the complexity of the FMS requires a system to be developed to analyze and design complex 
manufacturing systems. This paper attempts to find a solution to this problem. Simulation is a powerful tool that is 
used to study and analyze the system performance. Numerous works has been done by various researchers considering 
various types of flexibilities. The main aim of this study is to develop a demonstrative model of Flexible 
Manufacturing System (FMS) using ARENA simulation software and to study the effect of operations flexibility on 
the performance of FMS. One of the reasons to select the operations flexibility for the study is due to very limited 
work done for this flexibility type. Based on the selected configurations, the conceptual and simulation models and 
their respective animations have been developed by ARENA Software. To verify the simulation results, multi-criteria 
decision making techniques viz. Grey Relational analysis (GRA) is used.

1. Introduction  
FMS is defined as a highly automated machine cell, which consists of a group of workstations interconnected by an 
automated material handling (AGVs, Robots, conveyors etc.) and storage system (AS/RS etc), and all of these 
integrated workstations are controlled by a computer system. A FMS layout is capable of processing a large variety 
of different part styles simultaneously at different workstations. The use of robots, AGVs in the manufacturing 
industries or a given FMS layout provides a variety of benefits ranging from high volume of productivity to high 
utilization. The production of each part or product requires a different combination of operations or manufacturing 
nodes (sequencing or operations flexibility). The FMS provide better flexibility, productivity, efficiency and 
adaptability which is lacking in traditional manufacturing systems. The simulations are performed for designing a 
model of a real life system and conducting the required experiments with this model instead of running the actual 
system. In this paper we are studying the effect of operations flexibility on the performance of the FMS. Operations 
flexibility can simply be defined as possibility of performing an operation on more than one machine. In other words 
the operations flexibility refers to producing same part or some part feature by varying the operations. Some 
researchers have referred operations flexibility while some have referred the sequencing flexibility in the research 
papers. 
 
Our initial motivation is based on to explore the effect of operations flexibility on the performance of FMS. Since the 
parts are made at various operational conditions, FMS will take care of the variation in operational conditions to give 
the desired output. Despite recent interest in flexible manufacturing, more work is to be done in the domain of 
operations flexibility. This consists of determining the effect of manufacturing flexibility in order to improve 
performance measure such as average system output, average machine utilization and the average queue time of FMS. 
The proposed models of FMS will help decision makers to take appropriate decision regarding the choice of various 
manufacturing for FMS.

718","as the optimum sequencing rule while performing the simulation study and studying its results. So, this analysis also 
results in the verification that SPT is best rule followed by FIFO, LIFO and LPT respectively.  
 
6. Conclusion  
This work provides a framework based on simulation experiments which can be applied to a FMS for improving its 
performance by optimizing certain design parameters. This has been done by developing a dynamic, deterministic and 
discrete type of the simulation models using ARENA simulation software to study the effect of operation flexibility 
on the performance of FMS. From the series of experiments conducted with four sequencing rules viz. FIFO, LIFO, 
SPT & LPT and operation flexibility it was found that SPT rule comes out to be the best rule followed by the FIFO 
rule. The sequence ‘3-2-1-4-5-6’ in combination with the SPT sequencing rule gives the optimum performance for 
FMS. This selection of optimum sequence and the sequencing rule was verified by performing a MCDM analysis i.e. 
Grey Relational Analysis (GRA). The GR analysis results were found to be in accordance with the simulation results 
and it verified the selection of optimum sequence and sequencing rule.

Abstract 
 
Financial inclusion is reaching the unreached sector of society in banking or financial services at an affordable cost 
which may deliver them financial resilience for their sustenance and Social Empowerment. The government of India 
is initiating setting up SHGs for women, especially from an economically disadvantaged society, to achieve 
Empowerment.  The focus of SHGs is to pool in the resources-both financial and skill set available within the 
disadvantaged women to enhance their income levels and improve their standard of living. The financial inclusion 
will be effective in empowering the women as it provides equal opportunities. The SHG supported bank linkages act 
as an effective mode for bringing the women under poverty into the formal financial system of the nation. The linkage 
program enhances SHGs play a pivotal role in increasing access to credit services that can be used to develop 
entrepreneurial opportunities for financially and socially deprived women. The present study focuses on the effect of 
financial inclusion programs on enhancing the capabilities of women under poverty by creating opportunities for a 
dignified life. Scheduled interviews and observation, and secondary data sources are used to collect the required 
information from the rural women. The collected data was analyzed with the help of paired sample test.

Abstract 
 
Selection of best alternative among multiple alternatives is a tough task for decision makers in many industrial 
situations. This paper explores the applicability and capability of an outranking method known as Analytical Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) for selection of right alternative. The novelty of the proposed methodology is its capability of dealing 
with both ordinal and cardinal information. The integrated approach is a effective tool of the decision-making process 
in industrial environments. Five examples are illustrated to show the effectiveness of method. The term “LAST-MILE” 
came from telecommunication industry and refers to final leg of the network. Last-mile delivery has become a critical 
source for market differentiation, encouraging retailers to invest in a myriad of consumer delivery innovations, such 
as buy-online-pickup-in-store, autonomous delivery solutions, lockers, and free delivery upon minimum purchase 
levels. Consumers care about last-mile delivery because it offers convenience and flexibility. For these reasons, same-
day and on-demand delivery services are gaining traction for groceries. To meet customer needs, parcel carriers are 
increasing investments into urban and automated distribution hub. However, there is a lack of understanding as to how 
best to design last-mile delivery models with retailers turning to experimentations that, at times, attract scepticism 
from industry observers.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 which has no longer remained future of manufacturing world. It has started to root itself in 
manufacturing industry at varying level. One of the key aspects of its adoption is how it get integrated with tradition 
competencies. One such competency is Industrial Engineering which is here to stay as foundation of manufacturing. 
Smart factories can improve efficiency, profitability, compliance, and customer satisfaction by implementing 
components of Industry 4.0. During the Pandemic 67% of the Manufacturers have accelerated towards digital Projects 
and it is very much expected that digital manufacturing market to cross $767 Billion by 2025. Industrial engineers 
will undoubtedly play a key role in Industry 4.0 environments, such as designing, implementing, and maintaining the 
enabling technologies of a fully automated smart factory. 
 
Today there is less to refer on how Industry 4.0 can be integrated with Industrial Engineering. Some of the 
researchers have done great work to rethink on Industrial Engineering curriculum. IE Community has a huge scope 
for research and knowledge sharing for integration of actual applications of Industry 4.0 components in Industrial 
Engineering competency.  All of Industry 4.0's connection - sensors, IoT, AI, and so on – is aimed at one thing: 
improving production processes. Automation allows factories to work more quickly, while data analytics enables 
leadership to make data-driven decisions to boost productivity. Industry 4.0 enables greater flexibility across the 
industrial operation, resulting in higher asset utilization and, as a result, the possibility for increased profitability. 
 
This paper will discuss about such specific applications of different industry 4.0 components like Big Data, 
IIoT, Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity, Robotics, AR, Additive Manufacturing, Real Time Simulation etc. These 
technologies can contribute greatly to reach the full potential of manufacturing 4.0 movement. We will review the IE 
areas of application with Industry 4.0 components with their approach, advantages, benefits, and challenges. Some of 
the examples that we will discuss in this paper are Data Analytics of Standard time data and time study data, Analytic 
of standard time data for ergonomics improvement opportunities, IIoT for motion economy analysis, Machining 
Learning for predicating the time standards, Additive for developing efficient methods,   collaborative robots to 
combine people and robots in manufacturing operations to increase efficiency and revenue, autonomous mobile robots 
(AMR) for efficient material handling.

Abstract 
 
Glass means all can see each other, and it is very transparent and not immediately apparent to the observer. Ceiling 
means there is a limit to how far one can ascend the corporate ladder. “The invisible but unbreakable barrier that 
prevents women and other minorities from rising to the top rungs of the corporate ladder, regardless of their 
qualification or accomplishment is referred to as the Glass Ceiling”. This paper deals with the objective of finding 
out that level of employees perception towards survival of Glass ceiling outcome among the women employees 
of Information Technology sector, To know element contributing for Glass ceiling result, to find out the 
association linking Individual barrier and Glass ceiling effect and to find out the relationship between 
organizational barrier and Glass ceiling effect. This was analysed using Karl Pearson’s correlation tool. The 
information is gathered by framing the suitable questionnaire for women working in IT sector in Karnataka. A 
sample size comprise of 200 women employees of IT sector. From the analysis point of view we can conclude

Abstract 
 
Women Entrepreneurs in India or taken from a broader perspective play a vital role in the economic 
society. These areas unit the entire community people that possess the talents, initiative to do 
something, which is required to develop sensible new innovative ideas for development, to create 
the proper selections to maintain a profitable structure. The achievement reward is usually for the 
risks taken for the potential development economic suitability for the overall business personality 
who may earn significantly in the economic sector. Technically the meaning of a ""women 
entrepreneur"" is a woman who maintains runs and manages any enterprise all by herself, with a 
huge esteem risk. Women driven entrepreneurship is now growing and gain significant importance 
within the frame of economic and globalization across the world. Rules, policy and institutional 
frameworks helps in improving the person’s entrepreneurial driven skill set, building an 
infrastructure for education and coaching has apparently widened the economic empowerment of 
many such women in our society. These studies show many women entrepreneurs contributes just 
one third of overall economic structural enterprises in business where we can observe much scope 
and room for development of women entrepreneurs in the business sectors. The present paper aims 
to study and analyze women entrepreneurs who do not want to be a part of formal sector.

Abstract  
 
The development and improvement of entrepreneurial activities in a country cannot be separated from the participation 
and role of women. Women need a place to work with. Moreover, women in the rural area should also have a special 
space to develop and improve their skills. This article would take a deeper part to analyze about how the social and 
economic implication of the communication network pattern among the community member. This is broadening the 
analysist of the previous research that has been done by the writer about Communication Network Pattern of Rural 
Women Pelangi Nusantara Community in Malang Region. In addition, the factors of network communication pattern 
that influenced the developing and sustainability of the community also becoming a part of the discussion. The results 
show that the communication network pattern is a wheel. This wheel pattern has the advantage that the rapid flow of 
information and command given from the founder to the leaders. So that the quality and quantity of production remains 
the same as in the Pelanusa OPS. The disadvantage of this pattern is, because of the centered information and 
communication, members who have no position in the community have no access to share their needs and their 
capability in designing and producing the product. Regarding the economic and social situation, showed that there is 
no significant change in rural women members of the economic situation. Meanwhile, in terms of social aspect, 
members admitted that skills and information networks and knowledge gained to design products have increased.

1. Introduction  
Human resources are one of the important factors of production as the productivity of human resources will affect 
other factors of production. The Increased of productivity and quality of human resources and natural resources which 
are very limited in number can be processed by humans with a variety of expertise that is supported by technology 
and entrepreneurship to meet the demands of development in order to improve the welfare of society (Mardatillah, 
2012). Human resource management can be done by anyone, including women. Women have an important role in the 
management and development of human resources, especially among women, which is then called the empowerment.

748","6. Conclusion  
Managing a community especially when its members are rural women, certainly challenging. Because there is the 
desired of hope to be achieved, especially in economic terms. There is a desire to change the economic situation of 
the family that cannot be delayed. However, this cannot be done quickly because it often clashes with the interests of 
the organization.  
 
According to the analysis of the Social Economic Impact of Communication Network Pattern of Rural Women 
Community in Malang Regency showed that the communication network pattern formed in Pelanusa is a wheel 
pattern. A pattern which information flow is centralized. Centralized communication patterns in Pelanusa make 
information management and production go through one channel, from the Founder to the leaders of women groups. 
This wheel pattern has the advantage that the rapid flow of information and command given from the founder to the 
leaders. So that the quality and quantity of production remains the same as in the Pelanusa OPS. The disadvantage of 
this pattern is, because of the centered information and communication, members who have no position in the 
community have no access to share their needs and their capability in designing and producing the product.  
 
Nevertheless, this pattern should be satisfying the members, in fact Leaders and members feel dissatisfied with the 
management of this community. Through this research, showed that the implications of the wheel pattern are related 
to the founder leadership skills. The relation among members is transactional based on the business needs. While the 
aim of the community is to empower rural women in the economic sector and reduce the number of early marriages 
in the village. Thus, the relations should be more focused on the relationship. 
 
 Regarding the economic and social situation, showed that there is no significant change in rural women members of 
the economic situation. Because of the reward system considered too low and cannot quickly get the money from the 
production services. Meanwhile, from social conditions there are perceived changes ranging from communication 
skills to design skills, networks for women's empowerment as well as information on existing sales and marketing 
activities. So that members can participate to sell their community products.

Abstract 
 
Charcoal is known not only for grilling but also for its ability to absorb odor and moisture. The presence of 
charcoal on the container results in a change in its odor intensity with respect to the change in time. This 
study developed a first order, first degree differential equation that can be used to predict the odor intensity 
of the container with respect to the time after putting charcoal or vice-versa. The variables used were the 
perceived odor intensity of 20 respondents as the dependent variable and time as the independent variable. 
Parameters such as the container’s volume and temperature were held as constants for the simplicity of the 
model. The data used were the mean odor intensity rating for every 8 hours. The computed odor intensity 
per time (t) has varying absolute percentage errors because the data used deviated. This model is effective 
as long as the odor intensity rating is more accurate. Therefore, it is recommended to gather data on odor 
intensity with the use of equipment and instruments to make the predictions more accurate. It is also 
recommended to modify or improve the model and consider temperature and the volume of the container 
as variables instead of constants.

1. Introduction 
1.1 Background of the Study 
Aside from being used in grilling, charcoal is also known for its ability to absorb moisture and odor. It is commonly 
used as a substitute for air fresheners to keep the closed areas like cabinets, boxes, and fridge clean and smell-free. In 
an article written by Han (2013), he stated that by placing a small stack on a room, charcoal has done a noticeable job 
of reducing the humidity levels and absorbing any light odors. The room smelled neutral and unscented, much better 
than any product masking smells with perfume. Moreover, he takes the pieces in the sunlight for a few hours to 
recharge, and the pieces are ready to work their purpose again.

758","As seen from the table, it can be observed that the absolute percentage error per time of observation ranges from 
reasonable to high accuracy. The initial time where t=0 and the first observation where t=8 hours got 0% absolute 
percentage error because referring to the model, there is a need to compute for the proportionality constant k using the 
observed data from the experiment. However, the succeeding computations showed that the mathematical model can 
predict the actual time it will take for the odor rating to reach a certain level or the odor rating at a given time t. On 
the other hand, the absolute percentage errors were due to other factors such as the volume of the container, the 
temperature, and the fact that everyone has their preference when it comes to smell. These are the factors that are held 
as constants upon developing this mathematical model. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The researchers were able to develop a mathematical model that shows the relationship between the effect of charcoal 
on the odor rating of a container. This proves that the odor intensity of the container-when treated with the help of 
charcoal decreases with respect to time until it reaches the level where the odor is not perceptible anymore. When the 
volume and the temperature of the container are held as constant and based on the parameters and factors used in the 
study, the observed optimal time for the odor to be fully-removed on the container will take about 56 hours or more 
than 2 days.  
                
On the other hand, the accuracy of the model is highly dependent on the data gathered from the experiment that the 
researchers conducted. The percentage errors of the computed odor intensity are caused by the factors being held as 
constants. It can be concluded that this mathematical model can be used with the odor ratings/intensity and when the 
temperature and the volume of the container will be held as constants. 
 
6. Area for Future Work 
Based on these findings, the researchers highly recommend using a greater scope of data on odor intensity. The use 
of accurate data such as the actual measurement of odor intensity with the help of equipment and instruments would 
greatly help for the accuracy of results. Moreover, a longer period for the data gathering and larger-scale data prompts 
greater modification of the model. The researchers also recommend developing a model that will consider the 
temperature and volume of the container being observed. Moreover, the use of objective measurements when it comes 
to odor intensity would also be an essential tool to achieve more accurate results. For future related studies, it is also 
recommended to use a device to validate the results.

Abstract  
 
Deming award is the topmost award conferred to the industries which exhibit excellence in business capabilities 
in terms of managing quality, cost, and competitiveness. This paper deals with the journey of the Indian industry 
for achieving the Deming award through the lens of new product development. The study reveals that 
competitiveness in terms of cost, quality, and innovation are the key drivers of new product development. New 
product development when integrated with the other cross functions themes of an organization creates a sense of 
togetherness. The process of NPD synergically vibrates with the other functions of the organization like quality 
assurance, sales and marketing, cost management, delivery, and HRM. These functions when managed holistically 
result in both tangible and intangible benefits. The tangible and intangible benefits involve a competitive product 
profile, improved market share, improved profitability, improved customer satisfaction, and improved 
sustainability.

1. Introduction 
Product development activities are associated with the transformation of new feasible ideas about a product into 
a profitable product. This transformation requires a detailed analysis of customers' voices, technology 
requirements, and market competition to reduce the uncertainty about market needs and technological choices. 
There are complexities involved in translating dynamic customer needs into functional and emotional product 
attributes that give rise to market uncertainty on the other hand the technical uncertainty can0 be linked to the 
degree of novelty in product and manufacturing process design decisions. In designing a product development 
process, it is important to identify the strategic problem of risk and uncertainty reduction and the organizational 
issues of cross-functional integration in the formulation of design decisions. The significance of new product 
development is paramount for an organization as it helps in realizing the market share due to addressing customer 
expectations on Quality, Cost, Delivery, and Reliability. So, there is a need to develop products with high quality, 
low cost, meeting various global standards and regulatory requirements, and faster development cycle time. It is 
important to ensure reliability in the development of products from the prototype stage to the production stage to 
ensure full functionality of the product before coming to customers. 
 
Synergies between NPD and customers 
The process of NPD is founded on the customer requirements and with this, the organization is intended to achieve 
a different level of customer satisfaction known as customer delight. This helps in creating a reputation for 
excellence. The customer requirements comprise availability, delivery, reliability, maintainability, cost-
effectiveness, aesthetic appearance, etc. The transformation of customer requirements into product specifications 
needs special care. It is also very important to involve suppliers of the organization in the transformational process. 
  
Synergies between NPD and Market 
The NPD process begins from the market, and it involves a review of market needs in terms of unclear or unstated 
expectations or preconceived ideas in the mind of customers. Excellent communication between an organization, 
customer, and suppliers is the key to total quality management and thus can lead to a better NPD process. 
 
Synergies between NPD, Technologies, standards, and Innovation  
There is a great affinity between product specifications and standardization. It is necessary to build the quality 
into the design specification. The choice of standards remains with the organization and the market into which the 
product is being launched. Also, an organization needs to strike out a balance between standardization and 
innovation.

1.11 Market share has been increased to 22% from 10% 
The NPD resulted in the launching of products having USPs like reliability in performance, safety in operation, 
user friendly, and ease of maintenance. These USPs helped in the increase in the market share of the organization 
from 10% to 22% as shown in Figure 6. 
 
 
 
Figure 6: Market Share 
 
Conclusion  
This paper presents a case study on the role played by New Product Development which is one of the most 
important elements of TQM for improving organizational performance in a Deming awarded Indian industry. The 
major contributors in NPD were the customer requirement, suppliers’ capabilities, market analysis, and technical 
analysis. Both suppliers and customers helped in the generation of initial product configuration. The NPD was 
focused on developing products that are reliable in performance, safety in operation, user-friendly, and ease of 
maintenance. So, a 5-stage new product development process accompanied by six check gates was adopted. These 
gates were designed to address every possible issue after every stage that can delay or fail the product. The study 
also reveals that the NPD increased the new product intensity, customer satisfaction, and market share of the 
organization which is tangible benefits to the organization. The study also reports that the interacting factors as 
reported by various researchers in the literature review are consistent with this study. 
 
Limitations of case study 
This case study is conducted on a single organization so the results may not be generic so for the generalization 
more organizations should be considered. Also, the NPD maybe not be as structured as this in small, medium 
enterprises.

This case study pertains to an organization that has adopted TQM as its business excellence tool but some 
organizations are smaller in size and cannot afford the implementation of TQM and the supporting factors of the 
NPD may behave differently or they might be altogether different. So for getting a real picture more such 
industries should be taken for preparing the case study.

Abstract 
 
Parenting style is one of the factors which can influence the occurrence of student discipline problems in school. There 
are four types of parenting styles according to Baumrind’s Theory of Parenting (1991) which are authoritarian, 
authoritative, permissive, and neglectful. This paper reviews the influenced of parenting style towards students' 
disciplinary problems and students’ happiness in the Malaysian perspective by conducting Literature Review. The 
findings of this study are based on the findings of studies which conducted by previous researchers. In addition, this 
study also examines the types of parenting styles that are often practiced by parents which their children involved with 
disciplinary problems in school. The parenting style practiced by parents can influence the child's personality and 
behavior, which is indirectly associated to the disciplinary problems.

1. Introduction 
The discipline problem among students is becoming a common thing in the society. This problem is now becoming 
more common with as there is news broadcast on television and in local newspapers. However, this issue is becoming 
increasingly concerning with the involvement of the police. This is because the offenses committed by some of the 
students are not only minor offenses but already have criminal elements. 
 
There are several factors that contribute to the occurrence of student discipline problems in schools. Azizi and Rohaya 
(2010) have identified a total of 7 factors that are the cause of this problem. Among them are student self-factors, 
parent or family factors, community factors, school factors, mass media factors, government factors and peer factors. 
 
Based on several studies from past researchers such as Breda (2014), Donkor (2015) and Gase et al. (2016), stated 
that parent or family factors become one of the main factors contributing to student discipline problems. Furthermore, 
it was found that parenting style is one of the variables often associated with student discipline problems (Zins, 2013; 
Bezrukova and Samoylova, 2015; Woude et al., 2016). Not only that, the behavioral problems faced by children are 
likely from lack of emotional awareness and their ability to manage emotions (Zeman et al, 2002). 
 
2. Research Problem 
Through the writing of John Locke (1689) in an essay on human understanding, the child is born with a ‘tabula rasa’ 
or blank slate. The values and beliefs delivered by parents will be easily infused in their children. Parents have a role 
to play in instilling good values in their children. Therefore, parents have a very important role in educating a child to 
be a better person. 
 
A child’s morality starts from home (Ghafani, 2007). The family institution is the first school for a child and the 
parents becoming the child’s first teacher. Parents carrying a big responsibility in shaping a good personality in the 
child. Mental, physical, and social development are influenced by the things which taught and shown in a family

775","Parents who practice an authoritarian parenting style are seen as parents who stifle their children. According to 
Baumrind (1971), authoritarian parents are restrictive. Children are not given freedom in making choices and every 
action needs to get permission from the parents. Children are urged to follow every instruction (Santrock, 1998). 
According to Longmore, Monica and Giordano (2001), parents who have a high level of control will influence on a 
child’s behavior to engage in unhealthy activities. Although this style is considered harsh for some people, but the 
main purpose is simply just to educate their children. However, there is still a probability for the children to be caught 
up in unhealthy activities (Rathakrishnan and Abd Rahim, 2008). 
 
Permissive parenting styles are also often associated with children’s tendency to engage in unhealthy activities. This 
is because parents often ignore misbehaviors that can caused a negative effect towrds the children (Howenstein et al., 
2015). Meanwhile, children who raised by the authoritative parents have shown the best results in the formation of a 
child’s personality (Kuppens et al., 2019). Although authoritative parenting style is said to be the best parenting style, 
there are also cases of disciplinary problems involving children who are educated with this parenting style. However, 
authoritative parenting is associated with little to no serious cases disciplinary problems (Hoeve, Blokland, Dubas, 
Loeber, Gerris, and Van Der Laan, 2008). 
 
5.2 Relationship between Parenting Style Happiness of Student 
Socio -emotional development is an important aspect of a child's development. It is believed that a child’s behavior 
can be influenced by the parenting style practiced by the parents. According to Tiller et al. (2003), parenting style can 
directly influence social and emotional development. Educating and surveillance are very important in developing a 
child’s level of emotional intelligence. Receiving enough love will bring happiness to a child. This is because a stable 
level of emotional intelligence can form children more confident in relationships and social interactions (Omar and 
Zakaria, 2018). 
 
Furthermore, a study from Hiang and Kutty (2021) found that there is a significant relationship between the 
development of emotional intelligence of Iban students in secondary school and authoritative, authoritarian, and 
permissive parenting styles. Meanwhile, neglectful parenting style showed an insignificant influence on student’s 
emotional intelligence (p = 0.710 > 0.05), which can cause a negative impact on the formation of a student’s emotional 
intelligence. 
 
In addition, a study from Shahida Hashim et al. (2012) found that behavioral problems caused by a poor emotional 
management. Children often show negative emotions such as screaming, getting angry if disturbed or if their requests 
are not fulfilled. These negative emotions have led children to misbehave such as harassing friends, difficult to 
understand rules and instructions and less tolerant. This is also supported by Liau et al. (2003) who stated that low 
emotional intelligence in a child can lead to the occurrence of internal and external behavioral problems. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In summary, parenting style can either influence or not influence students ’disciplinary problems in school. This is 
because, there are other factors which can contribute to a child’s involvement to disciplinary problems such as 
individual factors, family factors, peer factors, schooling factors and community factors (Tharshini and Ibrahim, 
2020). In addition, most parents adopt an authoritative parenting style. According to Baumrind (1991) and Maccoby 
and Martin (1983), authoritative parenting style is an ideal parenting style in the formation of a child's personality. 
Therefore, this is also considered if the parenting style does not affect the disciplinary problems of the students. 
 
In addition, a child's emotional intelligence plays an important role in a child's behavior. A child who is given enough 
love will grow up in a harmonious and happy atmosphere, and this will help the child to always behave well. Therefore, 
parents need to further strengthen their relationship with their child so that the child feels comfortable when 
communicating with parents. Not only that, parents also need to be aware of what their children do when they are 
away from home. Parents do not need to monitor them 24 hours but just to make sure that the child does not fall into 
social problems. 
 
Moreover, parents need to build a strong relationship with teachers in the school. Teachers have a role to educate a 
student and are considered as parents while in school. The good relationship that is highlighted between teachers and 
parents will give a lesson to the child to respect the teacher as much as they respect their parents. When teachers feel

780","respected by parents and students, this will raise the spirits among teachers and at the same time create a comfortable 
and fun learning situation for students. 
 
Society as well needs to play an important role in controlling disciplinary problems among students. The way of 
blaming other parties such as parents and the school for the behavior of a student should be removed from society, 
instead it should be replaced with the way of caring towards other children. The children will be the future leaders of 
our country. It is also our responsible to take care of them. Being honest in giving advice and making complaints to 
the authorities is not a bad thing to do, but rather shows the responsibility in forming a healthy and positive community.

Abstract 
 
Spirituality has been shown to have a favourable impact on academic achievement in numerous 
research. This tiny study analyses students' attributions of the causes of their academic success 
or failure across secular and religiously connected universities, finding similar findings. 
Students who do well blame their lack of spirituality for their poor academic achievement, 
whereas students who do poorly blame their lack of spirituality for their poor academic 
performance. There have been many different perspectives on the importance of spirituality in 
academic success. Some people are vehemently in agreement or adamantly opposed to the 
topic. Others believe that the importance of spirituality in academics is determined by the level 
of involvement of the student.Because there hasn't been as much research on the link between 
spirituality and academic performance as there has been on the link between spirituality and 
stress, psychology, coping strategies, and stress, these differing viewpoints are prominent.

Abstract 
 
Assembly Production Systems (ASPS) are used to assemble complex components in manufacturing industries such 
as automobile production, aviation, mechanical equipment, electronic goods and household items. Importantly, ASPS 
may, in a single production process, merge two or more serial production lines. Contrastingly, disassembly systems 
(DisASPS), with split lines, are employed to disassemble/systematically remove constituent parts from the final 
product, without impairment. The buffer size of the bay in front of each machine tool should be optimized for an 
efficient ASPS or DisASPS. The characteristics of machine tools, including their uptimes and downtimes, have a 
significant impact on decisions concerning buffer size and subsequently on the production rate of an ASPS or 
DisASPS. Optimum buffer size can achieve a high production rate which enhances the performance and operation of 
the entire production system. This research presents an effective method for determining optimal and near optimal 
design for assembly and disassembly production systems. The proposed model optimizes the buffer size among each 
couple of machine tools in the ASPS and DisAPS for any given uptime and downtime parameters of the machine 
tools. A Genetic Algorithms (GA)-based optimization model is used to determine the optimal values of buffer size for 
serial production lines in the production systems. The numerical examples performed in the research validated the 
ability of the optimization model in determining the buffer size. Optimized selection can be carried out quickly as 
compared to previous selection techniques. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can back the manufacturing engineer’s 
decision-making while development stage of new ASPS or DisASPS.

1. Introduction  
 
Short product cycles and a greater need for customized items based on consumer demands are two key 
characteristics of the present competitive market. As a result, there has been a substantial growth in product variety. 
To meet these requirements is challenging using typical production and assembly lines (Villarreal and Alanís 2011). 
The assembly line is a discrete event system, which is widely used in manufacturing. It is an efficient combination of 
man and machine that fully reflects equipment adaptability by naturally combining the conveying system, 
accompanying jig, and testing equipment to meet product assembly requirements (Huang 2012). A serial production

6. Conclusion  
 
This paper proposed an enhanced optimization algorithm to find the best buffer size for assembly production 
systems with both assembly (merge) and disassembly (split) lines. The algorithm simultaneously maximizes the 
throughput of the production lines. The results show that the algorithm requires only a short processing time for large 
numbers of machines and multiple production lines. The algorithm was tested on production lines with four and ten 
machines to confirm it was not limited to a specific number of machines. The symmetry of the two problems meant 
the results with DisASPS were the same as for ASPS with an inverted sequence of the production lines. The 
optimization algorithm was designed to be able to integrate with the decision support system (DSS) to provide a 
correct decision to the operator in a short time. For future work, the author aims to update the algorithm to be part of 
a multi-agent artificial intelligence system that can predict regular maintenance needed and optimize manufacturing 
process parameters.

The authors met through a medium (Dr. Hari Lamba) in January 2020.  Som Soni had triple bypass surgery done in 
Oakland California. Mr. Lalit Kapoor, had developed a WhatsApp group called 4MakeMyHealth for guiding interested 
individuals adopt a healthy lifestyle. This lifestyle includes plant based whole food (PBWF) diet; intermittent fasting (IF) and 
10k steps walk a day. Complete details of first author’s health issues, food as medicine, required fasting, autophagy and 
resulting outcomes are provided in reference [1]. A summary of their and other individuals experiences in reversing chronic 
diseases is given.     
 
The following key steps are instrumental in accomplishing the healthy life style: 
 
I.Drink 2 glasses of warm water in the morning without brushing. 
II.Fix a window for eating in the day. Start with 9 to 10 hours and reduce to 8 hours a day. No eating or drinking out of this 
window. Water is allowed. 
III.Plant based whole foods including fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, no processed foods. 
IV.Drink 1 or 2 glasses of green vegie/ fruit juice a day.  
V.Walk 10k steps a day. 
 
 
In addition to authors’ stories, a sample of thirteen additional testimonials is given. These testimonials show the spectrum of 
beneficiaries from all walks of life, health issues and medicines. A summary table 1 shows important data about the 
beneficiaries. This data is drawn from their testimonials. The testimonials do not follow any specific format. As can be seen 
each individual has provided what they felt necessary. There are lots more individuals who have taken advantage of this

I’m a cardiac Nurse Practitioner @Stanford and joined your group in June. So far I’ve been very impressed with 
your medical knowledge of disease and the in depth research that you have done with every aspect of your suggested 
lifestyle change. Although I joined in June, I was mostly observing from the sidelines, trying to make small changes, 
stopping and starting. I wholeheartedly adopted your 4 pillars starting about 10 days ago and already feel great. 
Personally I have been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and as you are well aware the medications work to 
suppress the immune system but otherwise create havoc with inopportune infections and  especially vulnerability 
with the new Delta variant for COVID now. 
So my ultimate goal is to get rid of my medicines and hopefully reverse or at the very least halt the progression of 
my RA. I will keep you posted  
Finally, a heartfelt thanks to you for this amazing service you are providing free of charge to not only your fellow 
SF bay area community but all over the world. I am very impressed and have been spreading the word.  I bought a 
juicer per your advice and it has changed my life  
 
    7.13   Testimonial-4 
Everything is good and helpful. 
I could implement the following: 
1. No Animal food: No Dairy, No Egg,.No Meat 
2. No free oil in cooking, using peanut butter. 
3. Increasing consumption of vegetables. 
4. Occasional protein fast by not eating dal and nuts and seeds for 5 days. 
5. No IF 
6. Equivalent to 10k steps. 
 
The results are: I have lost around 10.8 kg.  I am feeling more energetic. I have reduced sugar medication. I am 
taking mild BP Medicine as I am alcoholic and smoker. Hope and strive to do better. This program has been one of 
the best things in my life. Joined in February and continuing till today.

Abstract 
 
Food Waste Index 2021 report reveals that people wasted 931 million tonnes of food material in the year 2019, 
out of which 61 % is contributed by households, 26 % by food services, and 13 % by retail; Indian households 
waste 50 kilograms of food annually per individual. The large quantities of food waste created by the worldwide 
food system is a critical issue that is getting major focus owing to its environmental and socio- economic impacts. 
Internationally, since visibility regarding sustainability, food wastage and impoverishment is on the high, the 
requirement to understand the behaviour patterns behind reducing food wastage and food insecurity is the need of 
the hour. In this paper, the authors make an attempt to list and analyse the theories behind the food wastage 
behaviour in households and to assist future research identify the antecedents of food wastage behaviour. The goal 
of this paper is to demonstrate a theoretical foundation for household food waste. The paper focuses on the Theory 
of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) majorly to explain constructs of behaviour.

1. Introduction 
According to the estimates of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, around one 
third of the consumable food generated, meant for consumption by mankind is wasted internationally, 
corresponding to around 1300 million tons of food annually (Gustavsson et al 2011, Lipinski et al. 2013). Food 
wastage is becoming a prominent socio-economic regional, national, as well as global issue. The Food Waste 
Index Report 2021, released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) showed an estimate of 0.93 
billion tons of food being disposed by households, restaurants and other food services in 2019 globally which 
corresponded to 17% of the total food available (Mohan 2021). The issue and spread of food waste is different 
from nation to nation and also individual to individual. The developing countries for example, in Sub-Saharan 
Africa record lower food waste when compared against the developed countries in Europe, USA etc. 
(Papargyropoulou et al. 2014).  Around 21% of food available for consumption in U.S. was discarded by 
households in 2010 (Buzby et al. 2011). In 2019, FAO estimated around 690 million individuals being hungry 
and the food waste index report also hinted at a sharp rise of the number during and post-Covid-19 (Mohan 2021). 
A 2018 report underlines that the quantity of food wasted in India equals the total quantity of food consumed in 
the country of United Kingdom (UK). The weddings in India typically waste around 10% to 20% of the food and 
the food wasted per year adds upto approximately 14 billion USD. This not only highlights irresponsible 
consumption, but also throws a very concerning example of food wastage especially in a country, which performs 
extremely low on the global hunger index at a mere 94th position among 107 countries in the year 2020 (Hussain, 
Goyal 2021). In 2019-20, the amount of the food waste produced globally was almost equal to India’s overall 
production of food grain, oilseeds and other agricultural products, combined. The report highlighted the fact that 
lion’s share of this waste worldwide is derived from households, next by food channels and then retail channels 
(Mohan 2021). In India, the sudden enforcement of an unforeseen & extended lockdown in the background of the 
COVID-19 outbreak has led to refreshed attention on challenges such as starvation and food insecurity. Owing to 
an unexpected deprival of income, the majority of India’s poor population face challenges like growing food 
insecurity, mal nutrition and starvation. SOFI’s (State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World) last published

Abstract  
 
Manual material handling (MMH) is one of the most physically challenging works where workers are vulnerable to 
awkward postures, repetitive movements, forceful exertions and contact stresses. MMH tasks include lifting, lowering, 
holding, pulling, pushing, carrying and moving a load. These tasks, if repeatedly performed lead to fatigue and 
musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) of lower back, shoulders and lower extremities. While performing MMH tasks, the 
operator’s posture is at an unacceptable position, exposing them to MSD risks and low back problem (LBP). A field 
study of small scale industries in informal sector such as stone cutting & polishing units, saw mills, bottling plant and 
warehouses is undertaken. The methodology for present study is Body discomfort questionnaire, Rapid Entire Body 
Assessment (RULA), Rapid Entire Body Assessment tool (REBA) and NIOSH lifting equation. The primary data is 
collected through observations, interviews and discussions and RULA, REBA and NIOSH. RULA and REBA 
analyses the working postures of workers and determines the ergonomic risk factors. NIOSH determines the 
recommended weight limit (RWL) and calculates lifting index (LI), which analyses whether a lift is safe or hazardous. 
The ergonomic studies revealed that in almost all industries the workers complain of discomfort & pain in shoulder, 
low back and lower extremities due to unscientific methods of handling and awkward postures. The postural analysis 
according to RULA and REBA tools revealed most of the postures are in medium to high risks (40% to 55%). In one 
particular case, ergonomic interventions by Digital Human Modeling and Simulation (DHMS) are done using CATIA 
V5 software.  By implementing suitable ergonomic interventions, the lifting index value was reduced from 1.64 to 
1.2, and 1.79 to 0.98. The postural risks are also reduced considerable. Several ergonomic interventions and redesign 
of workplace and training of workers were recommended. The findings indicate an immediate need to implement 
ergonomic principles and interventions throughout different industries to reduce the risks due to MMH tasks. After 
implementation of proper lifting techniques and redesign of work systems, showed that the workers yielded lower 
lifting index, reduced physical exertion and MSDs and improved productivity.

Abstract 
 
Logistics is an important of Supply Chain Management. It ensures smooth flow of information and material across 
the supply chain. Countries have always tried to reduce the money and time spent on supply chain logistics. Logistics 
industry impacts a country’s economy, both on macro level and micro level. Logistics sector is the key to globalization 
and internationalization. Logistics Performance Index (LPI) as defined by World Bank and Human Development 
Index (HDI) as defined by United Nations Development Program (UNDP) have been discussed in this paper. The 
relation between International LPI and HDI have been explored. The authors have attempted used a linear regression 
model using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) for studying this relationship. The data for 154 
countries for the year 2018 has been used for this study. Each assumption relating to regression analysis is satisfied 
and the same is proven with the help of SPSS outputs. The regression equation obtained is used to predict the LPI 
value for the year 2019.

1. Introduction 
Supply chain logistics involves the coordination among supply chain members and detailed arrangements to ensure a 
smooth flow of information and material across the supply chain (Harrison and Van Hoek, 2008). Countries have 
always tried to reduce the money and time spent on supply chain logistics. Logistics industry impacts a country’s 
economy, both at macro level and micro level. At the macro-level, it boosts the national economy by generating 
employment and encouraging foreign investments influx. Logistics sector is rightly considered to be the key to 
globalization and internationalization. At the micro level, logistics industry gives rise to increased competition that 
results in competitive pricing. The performance of the logistics sector of any country is measured by the Logistics 
Performance Index (LPI) of the country. Calculation of LPI is in accordance to what is defined by the World Bank. 
Human development of any country is measured by the Human Development Index (HDI) as defined by United 
Nations Development Program (UNDP). This paper studies a possible relationship between these two metrics. 
 
The World Bank provides an interactive benchmarking tool called Logistics performance Index (LPI). With the help 
of this tool, countries can easily spot the unexploited opportunities and the underlying challenges involved in trade 
logistics performance. LPI was last released in 2018 comparing 160 countries. A survey of ground operators is 
conducted worldwide and their feedback on ease of working and friendliness of the countries they operate in is 
recorded. Apart from this feedback, quantitative data on logistics network in the country emphasizing on performance 
of key components is also assessed. Therefore, LPI is a combination of both qualitative and quantitative measures. 
 
International LPI consists of evaluations done qualitatively by the trading partners operating abroad. The assessments 
are done in six areas that include ‘customs’, ‘infrastructure’, ‘ease of arranging shipments’, ‘quality of logistics 
services’, ‘tracking and tracing’ and ‘timeliness’. On the other hand, Domestic LPI comprises both qualitative as well 
as quantitative evaluations of a country conducted by logistic professionals working within the country. Ranking is 
not a part of Domestic LPI, rather it gives details containing information abouts logistics processes, logistics 
environment and institutions within a country, constraints hindering smooth flow of logistics activities present at ports, 
borders or inside the country. It is measured in six areas that include ‘infrastructure’, ‘services’, ‘border procedures 
and time’ and ‘supply chain reliability’ (World Bank, 2020).

Also, it was found that there were 78 countries for which predicted LPI was within 10% of the actual LPI value. As 
high as 112 out of 154 countries had depicted error within the range of 15% as compared to the actual LPI scores by 
World Bank.  This validates the model and shows that results obtained by using the model give a fairly good prediction 
of the LPI values of various countries. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future research directions 
Due to cut throat competition among various countries, the need for improvement in the logistics front appears to be 
necessary. Every nation is in a race to achieve better logistics performance index but this fact seems to neglected that 
apart from the six key indices as defined by the World Bank, LPI depends on other factors too. HDI is one such factor 
that is responsible to the variation in LPI. Level of development of a nation and logistics costs are interrelated. 
Developing countries see a logistics cost of as high as 25% of delivered costs while for developing countries this cost 
is dipped to 8-9% (Roberts, 2003). A reduction in the logistics cost for any country can help in bringing down the 
final cost of the product which in turn can make things more affordable for the people of the country. This is how the 
LPI can affect the HDI of any country. Taking appropriate measures for increasing life expectancy of its citizens, 
providing access to education and offering a decent standard of living can be linked to a rise in HDI. The LPI can 
contribute to offering a decent standard of living by making prices competitive thus affecting HDI. It can also be seen 
that logistics costs have a direct relation with increase in international trade and hence increase foreign direct 
investment (Coto-Millán, 2016). Increase in foreign direct investment can enhance the foreign exchange reserves of 
any country. A country’s external obligations can be met by its reserves and just the presence of these reserves can 
boost market’s confidence level in its country’s capabilities. Not only this, reserves provide external assets to a country 
which are in turn responsible for backing of domestic currency. Also, reserves provide assistance to government when 
it comes to meeting requirements involving foreign exchange and external debt obligations. Maintenance of reserves 
is also crucial in case of national disasters and natural calamities (Mathews & Singh, 2020). This will indirectly help 
the government in improving the HDI for the country.  
 
This study is limited to 154 countries as only these countries had both the indices defined. The lack of LPI data by 
World Bank for the year 2020 limits the study to year 2018. Logistics Performance Index values are available only 
for 6 years as this index is released every alternate year. These values can be extrapolated to find values of this index 
for all years starting from 2008. The value of LPI predicted by the model is a fairly accurate. A more accurate model 
could be developed by including more variables in the model. Other factors like Gross Domestic Product, Ease of 
Doing Business scores could have been used to see if these indices have an impact on LPI and hence, predict a more 
accurate LPI score.

Abstract 
 
Software vulnerabilities are one of the main security risks involved in Information systems. The vulnerabilities might 
be a path for cyber attackers or hackers to exploit the information systems. Thus, vulnerabilities might lead to loss of 
data or the ability of the information system to serve. The number of vulnerabilities discovered is increasing. The 
Information Security manager’s key challenges are to fix these vulnerabilities on time before they are exploited. In 
this paper, to minimize the operational challenges in fixing the vulnerabilities, the authors proposed a new method 
based on the textual description of the software vulnerabilities with help of data collected from a multinational 
company with 77,360 vulnerabilities over ten years.

1. Introduction 
The usage of Information systems is increased in business operations. Thus, systems are vulnerable to attacks or 
exploitation, which might lead to the loss of data present in the systems or not able to serve in the business operations 
(NVD, 2021). Software vulnerabilities are increasing continuously. Thus increasing the number of software 
vulnerabilities makes the difficult for the security manager of IT firms to fix vulnerabilities before exploiting them by 
the attackers.  
 
To understand these losses the information technology firms spent most of the resources on identifying and rectifying 
the vulnerabilities in devices or the systems of the company network. IT firms are following many methods of 
identifying vulnerabilities and fixing them. Also with the growth of IT infrastructure, the number of vulnerabilities is 
increasing. This makes IT firms difficult to prioritize and fix the vulnerabilities based on the impact that would create 
them. 
 
In July 2005, the National Infrastructure Advisory Council and Forum of Incident Response and Security Team 
(FIRST) came with Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) to rate the risk of the vulnerability on a scale of 
0 to 10 (FIRST, 2021). The vulnerabilities with ten are very risk and with zero are very low risk. The CVSS is generic 
and does not take care of system environment parameters. This makes it the IT firms difficult in managing the human 
resources to fix the vulnerabilities  
 
2. Literature Review 
The common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS) version 1 was not subjected to peer review across IT firms, 
deployed in production. With the feedback of various companies, Mell and K S (2007) improved the CVSS version1

6. Conclusion 
The authors analyzed the vulnerabilities within labs of a multi-national company based on the textual description. 
They grouped them into priority groups and then manually classified them into various categories based on the textual 
description of the vulnerability. This analysis narrows down the vulnerability to the top 20 and would help the security 
managers in efficiently managing the software vulnerabilities. 
  
7. Future Work 
  
This research work could be taken further by automatic the classification process of software vulnerabilities based on 
the text description and would validate the method with efficiency improvement of managing the software 
vulnerabilities in the lab.

1. Introduction 
Seeing the number of internet users in Indonesia, especially nowadays the internet has a considerable role that helps 
every community activity, especially in terms of fulfilling daily needs. The development of internet technology also 
influences the changing shopping patterns of consumers, so that from small businesses to large companies also turn 
to the digital world to grow their businesses. And currently the number of  e-commerce actors in Indonesia is also 
increasing. In the report about the data of the top 10 frequently visited e-commerce  in Indonesia, Shopee ranked first 
with 71.53 million clicks per month in the first quarter of 2020. Cosmetic market segment is very promising and 
experiencing good growth, Seeing today people make beauty products as their main needs, and the growth of e-
commerce in Indonesia is increasing, the beauty industry began to transform to implement its business into a digital-
based to facilitate indonesians in making purchases online. The beauty industry in Indonesia is currently on the rise. 
In the face of fairly tight competition, Present one of the E-commerce sociolla, is an e-commerce that only focuses on 
the provision of cosmetic and skincare products only, so it is not surprising if Sociolla is in great demand and sought 
after by consumers, especially women lovers of cosmetics and skincare who are certainly looking for quality , 
complete, and reliable products. Although the number of visitors soco by Sociolla application is high, but SOCO by 
Sociolla is not ready to provide the best service to its consumers, judging by the many comments about the kelu-han 
that is presented to the SOCO by Sociolla Application. Based on research [2 iprice] Sociolla experienced a 236% 
increase in the number of web visits compared to the first quarter of 2018, and in the first quarter of 2019 access to

by providing appropriate information to consumers about the complaints they feel and improve ser ta evaluate related 
to the work system of Customer service to be faster to respond, by providing training to employees, it is recommended 
that the SOCO by Sociolla application is more innovative in providing promos to consumers. For example, SOCO by 
Sociolla should provide promo prices without a minimum number of transactions, because not all consumers spend 
large amounts. This will attract consumers to transact.  it is recommended that SOCO by Sociolla increase. 
 
This study only examines the influence of service quality and consumer confidence on customer loyalty, so for the 
next researcher is suggested, Conduct research on similar applications or e-commerce by using the same variables so 
that the results can be used as comparison material., Conduct research using other indicators as a tool to quantify the 
variables studied and use new theories that are more rele-van so as to expand the science of libraries, Conduct research 
on other factors beyond the variable quality of service and trust that are the factors of customer loyalty.

Abstract 
 
This research was conducted to determine the impact of the work from home policy on the performance of the 
State Civil Service Agency employees of the Directorate of Procurement and the rank of the Procurement sub-
section. The purpose of this research is to find and analyze the implementation of work from home policies at the 
State Civil Service Agency (BKN), how the performance of employees from the State Civil Service Agency 
(BKN), the magnitude of the influence of work from home policies on the performance of the State Civil Service 
Agency (BKN). This is a quantitative method with a descriptive research type. Sampling was carried out using a 
non-probability sampling method with a saturated sampling type, with a total of 33 respondents. The data analysis 
technique used is descriptive analysis and simple linear regression analysis. The results of the study were based 
on descriptive analysis of the work from home policy variables and overall performance in the good category. 
Based on the hypothesis test (t test) it was found that the work from home policy variable had a significant effect 
on the performance of the State Civil Service Agency employees. This is evidenced by having a value of tcount 
(9.683) > ttable (2.039) tcount (9,683) > ttable (2,039) and a significance level of 0.000 <0.05. Based on the coefficient 
of determination, it is found that the effect of work from home (X) policy on performance (Y) is 75.2%.

Preface 
At the end of 2019 all countries in the world were shocked by a global pandemic called Corona Virus Disease 
(Covid-19). This virus attack has had a major impact on human life in the world and has changed many important 
aspects of life. This also causes a change in work methods to work from home (WFH). The change in work methods 
in question is a change in the organization in assigning duties and responsibilities to its employees by ""forbidding"" 
its employees to work in the office and gather in the room. This prohibition is not intended to damage the 
organization's performance but to prevent the spread of Covid-19 which continues to increase the number of 
victims in Indonesia. The concept of Work from Home (WFH) has been the subject of discussion and the theme 
of global studies by researchers in the last 10 years, but this global phenomenon began to emerge at the time of 
the Covid-19 attack and became an alternative strategy for many organizations. 
 
In Indonesia, Work from Home (WFH) has not yet become a work culture within the organization, there are still 
few organizations that have provided the flexibility to work for their employees, especially government employees 
as civil servants. In addition, advances in information technology in the current industrial revolution have changed 
the work order and organizational culture, where organizations are required to transform from all aspects to build 
a competitive advantage strategy. The development of technology and information not only has an impact on 
organizations, but the lifestyle and social life of the community has also changed so that the demand for special 
services for the community is certainly an important priority for many organizations. According to Kumar & Aithal 
(2016), current technology has changed attitudes and social life of the community, gender differences are no longer 
a limitation of qualifications and specifications in many jobs that no longer look at gender but rather on the skills 
and knowledge of human resources. 
 
Work from Home which is a phenomenon nowadays in Indonesia is not a work culture found in many

Conclusion 
Based on the results of research and discussion that have been stated previously regarding the influence of the 
Work from Home Policy in influencing the performance of the State Civil Service Agency employees. Some 
conclusions can be drawn which are expected to provide answers to the problems formulated in this study are as 
follows: 
 
Work from Home Policy of the State Civil Service Agency. 
Based on the results of the descriptive analysis, the work from home policy in the eyes of the respondents as a 
whole is in the good category. Of all the work from home policy statement items, there are statements that get the 
highest response from respondents and fall into the very good category, namely the WFH Policy statement based 
on the SE Minister of PANRB No 19 of 2020 and my statement that I am committed to completing work both 
WFO and WFH. This means that the implementation of the work from home policy at the State Civil Service 
Agency is in accordance with the SE Minister of PANRB No. 19 of 2020 and the employees of the State Civil 
Service Agency have a high commitment to completing their work, whether work is done by WFO or WFH. 
 
Performance of the State Civil Service Agency. 
Based on the results of descriptive analysis, employee performance in the eyes of the respondents as a whole is in 
a good category, of the overall performance statement items that get the highest responses and fall into the very 
good category, namely my statement that I complete the task according to the target that has been set, I am thorough 
in completing the work. , I am committed to maintaining the quality of work, I improve the quality of work 
according to established procedures, I can complete work on time, and I work properly and responsibly. This 
means that employees of the State Civil Service Agency can complete tasks according to predetermined targets, 
are thorough in completing their work, have a commitment to maintain the quality of work, improve quality in 
accordance with established procedures, can complete work on time, and also carry out work correctly, and be 
responsible. 
 
The Influence of Work from Home Policy on the Performance of State Civil Service Employees. 
Based on the results of the hypothesis test (t test), the work from home policy variable has an effect on the 
performance of the State Civil Service Agency employees. This can be seen from the results of of tcount (9,683) > 
ttable (2,039) and a significance level of 0,000 < 0,05, so H0 is rejected and Ha is accepted. So it can be concluded 
that there is an effect of the work from home policy (X) on performance (Y). The magnitude of the influence of 
the work from home policy variable (X) on performance can be seen from the calculation of the coefficient of 
determination (R2), which is 0.752 or 75.2%. While the remaining 24.8% is influenced by other factors not 
examined in this study, such as leadership style, organizational culture, or motivation.

Abstract 
 
Back pain is the leading common occupation disease found in industries with activities requiring manual labor and 
sitting for long periods for the years 2015, 2013 and 2011. The nature of sedentary work is at potential source of work-
related musculoskeletal symptom. Back support has been known as a support device on chairs. However, it still does 
not meet the needs of user to ease comfort while performing work seated tasks (Olabode et al., 2017). This paper 
intends to assess the current component of the back support, identify which component has the greatest impact on 
productivity and comfortability, and develop an ergonomic design of back support to increase comfortability and 
productivity level of employees. Regression analysis was utilized to determine the component that have the most 
impact on comfortability and productivity. Results showed that curve on the lumbar region greatly affects 
comfortability whereas the greatest predictor for productivity was the height of the back support. Therefore, the 
proposed back support would serve as a supporting device in call center industry to help increase comfortability and 
productivity of BPO employees.

1. Introduction 
As of April 2020, records from the Philippine Statistics Authority (2020) showed that there is a total of 82.3% 
employment rate from the total population of 73,722,000 people above the age of 15 years old. Employees play vital 
roles in a company because they carry out the tasks needed to meet the organizational goals. In a company, an office 
worker is someone who works and most of the time stationed in the office performing diverse tasks as assigned based 
on the position occupied. And most of the nature of work done in the office requires long sitting hours for desk job 
tasks, computer setting, reading, and meeting. Research shows that work-related factors are one of those which are 
associated with occupational sitting, and it varies from office groups. Highly sedentary groups with more workloads 
are more prone to sitting and sedentary behavior (Yang et al., 2017). Computer and office-based workers are more 
frequent to sit and extend their computer use on a normal working day. 
 
Today, lumbar support has been an effective device for individuals with seating discomfort and treatment for low back 
pain. It has also been a source of reducing the exposure of workers to lower back pain and musculoskeletal disorders 
(Lanhers et al., 2016). Lumbar support had been widely known as a supporting device on chairs while performing 
seated tasks. However, there are still problems with back support on office chairs and it causes health discomfort on 
their work (Olabode et al., 2017). Existing back support still does not meet the needs of the user. There are still lacking 
in the structure and design of the back support that needs to be worked on to maximize its use as an effective device 
for office workers.  
 
Work-related discomfort is affected by the extent of exposure and the use of computers. Back support devices 
maintained the S-shaped curve which helped in increasing comfort and good posture when sitting. The back of an 
individual varies differently, and it is important to have lumbar support enough to cover the lumbar vertebrae. 
Employees have difficulty being productive when they are not physically comfortable with the structure of their 
workstation (Corlett, 2006). As the employees work in a hazardous environment and workstation, they become more

Most of the workday of BPO employees required long periods of sitting hours and performing sedentary work that 
are prone to risk. Back supports are supporting devices that are used to alleviate discomfort to the back region of the 
body. In this study, comfortability and productivity of employees were assessed on the use of back support. The 
components of back support that have an impact on comfort are height, width, type of material, cushion thickness, 
design, and curve on the lumbar region. In XYZ company, the employees used two designs of back support, namely 
the D-shaped and pillow-shaped back support. The researcher assessed the components through surveys distributed to 
100 participants. The respondents were asked about their personal & work information, evaluation of components of 
back support, comfortability experienced with the components, Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire 
(CMDQ), and productivity evaluation. 
 
Based on the results of the survey, most of the respondents used Pillow-shaped back support than D-shaped back 
support. The components curve on the lumbar region and the design of back support obtained the least comfort level 
experienced by the employees using the current back supports.  In the CMDQ section, results showed that the back 
and lower regions were the parts that experienced the most discomfort. The researchers conducted RULA and REBA 
to assess the level of MSD risk. The results indicated that investigation and implementation change is needed to 
prevent workers from exposure to high risks of injury with the two designs of back support. Moreover, they conducted 
recommended anthropometric dimensions to the back support regarding backrest to achieve the supporting function 
on the back region.  
 
The statistical analysis shows that there is a significant difference in the productivity of the workers and the back 
support. It is also the same as the CMDQ score of the upper and lower back. For the comfortability in the components, 
the comfortability experienced at the height of the back support was the only exception that has no significant 
difference for the variation of the back support. The greatest predictor for productivity was the height of the back 
support but it is not significant according to its standardized effect, and for the upper and lower back was the curve on 
the lumbar region.  The proposed design of the back support was based on an ergonomic design and the anthropometric 
measurements of Filipinos. The posterior pelvic cut was used based on the Review of Related Literature. The 
measurements followed the anthropometric data.

Abstract  
 
All activities carried out by the community are now influenced by digital processes. including online payment 
activities or the term e-money. The growth of e-wallet is driven by many developments in payment systems that can 
replace the presence of cash as a means of payment into non-cash payments that are more efficient and effective. This 
explains that there is a changing lifestyle in society in the digital era, using a cashless system more. E-money 
transactions increased during PSBB. One of the e-wallet that is now widely used by the public is OVO. This study 
was conducted with the aim of knowing how the effect of perceived convenience, perceived benefits, and perceived 
security on interest in using OVO in Central Java. The researcher uses a research that uses descriptive and causal types 
with a quantitative approach and uses a non-probability sampling data collection method with a purposive sampling 
type. The number of samples used in this study were 400 respondents. The data analysis method used is path analysis, 
data analysis using SmartPLS software version 3.1. The results of this study indicate that the perceived convenience 
variable has a positive and insignificant effect on interest in using. The perceived benefit variable has a positive and 
significant effect on interest in using. The security perception variable has a positive and significant effect on interest 
in using.

1. Introduction  
Indonesian people involve the internet in carrying out and supporting all their daily activities, including online 
payment activities or commonly referred to as e-money. It is undeniable that the internet and humans today have 
become a single entity that is difficult to separate. Electronic money (e-money) is money used in internet transactions 
by electronic means. The number of companies that participate in issuing electronic money shows that the demand 
and interest of the public to use e-money is also getting higher. This explains that there is a changing lifestyle by 
people in the digital era who prefer cashless or cashless payment systems. The growth of FinTech in the payment 
category is driven by the widespread development of payment systems that can shift the presence of cash as a means 
of payment to an effective and efficient form of non-cash payment. The Next cashless society study conducted by 
marketing research company Ipos Indonesia explained that non-cash transactions currently reached 4.7 million 
transactions. Its value reached IDR 128 trillion in 2019. 
 
Based on the results of research, it is explained that the number of electronic money instruments (e-money) used by 
the Indonesian people during the implementation of Large-Scale Social Restrictions has increased. In April 2020, the 
number reached 412.1 million users, an increase from the previous month of 330.4 million. However, in May and June 
it decreased. Quoted from (Indonesian Fintech Association, 2020) explains that financial technology companies have 
the potential to support national economic recovery. During the pandemic, digital payments have helped more 
individuals and MSMEs in transaction activities. 
 
OVO is ranked second during the 2019-2020 period which is the most used by consumers, this is the reason and the 
author's basis for why the object of research on OVO is compared to other e-wallets. The convenience and benefits 
offered by OVO products can have an impact on increasing the number of users. When OVO products have 
convenience and benefits that can help for the benefit of economic transactions, so people prefer to use OVO service 
products (databoks.katadata.co.id).

(2020) which explains that the perception of convenience does not have a significant effect on interest in using. 
Perception of convenience does not have a significant effect on interest in using because consumers will use the 
application even though it is difficult while it is still considered useful to support daily activities. Then the results of

influence on Interest in Using Electronic Money. Furthermore, the results of Perception of Security on Interest in 
Using got a tstatistic value of (5,756) > ttable (1,96) and p value (0,000) > 0,05 indicating that there is a positive and

Dewi Hermawan (2020), which states that there is a positive and significant influence on Interest in Using. 
 
5. Conclusion  
According to the results of the research and discussion, several conclusions can be drawn, namely: 1) according to the 
overall descriptive results, Perception of Ease, Perception of Benefits, Perception of Security and Interest in Using are 
in the fairly good category. 2) Perception of Ease has a positive but not significant effect on Interest in Using. 3) 
Perception of Benefits has a positive and significant influence on Interest in Using. 4) Perception of Security has a 
positive and significant influence on Interest in Using.

Abstract 
 
The current research work seeks to analyze the changes in the muscle fatigue and strength, if any, due to the restrictions 
of use of facial mask while at work. The workers are required to perform tasks like lifting and pushing which range 
from moderate to heavy workloads. Alternative approach had to be used as the shop floor environment did not facilitate 
the use of standard laboratory setup for measurement of muscle fatigue.

1. Introduction 
Unprecedented changes have taken place in the work environment due to COVID 19. These being an unchartered 
path, new set of working norms were introduced to ensure the safety of employees at the work place. This had to be 
done to ensure the economic survival of the industry as a whole. This situation has given rise to many new 
requirements, like re-setting of production norms and other related allowances like fatigue and policy allowance. It 
is still very new for any norms to be finalised, so an attempt to evaluate the impact  of working restrictions like 
wearing of facial mask imposed due to COVID 19, on the workers, working on the shop floor. This is going to affect 
the productivity of the industry, already under tremendous financial strain to accommodate the restrictions for every 
ones health and safety. 
 
1.1Objectives 
The objective of this study was to determine the changes in fatigue experienced due to use of facial mask for protection 
against COVID 19, which may lead to productivity loss on the shop floor. 
 
2. Literature Review  
The Maharashtra Government along with the Central Government, have issued the following guidelines which are a 
very tight rope walk for Medium and Small Scale Industries around Pune. 
 
Guidelines for the workers 
1. Ensure 24 -hour sanitisation of the factory premises. 
• 
Factories need to maintain a sanitisation routine every two-three hours especially in the common areas that 
include lunch rooms and common tables which will have to be wiped clean with disinfectants after every 
single use.

6. Conclusion 
It can be concluded that there is increased fatigue experienced by the workers involved in moderate to heavy intensity 
of physical activity, due to use of facial mask for protection against COVID 19, which may lead to productivity loss 
on the shop floor by about 8% to 12%. This value of loss will change depending upon the policy allowances provided 
by the Management based on the ambient conditions. Research is being conducted to determine the best suited mask 
for such working conditions. Further research needs to be undertaken to find if feeling of discomfort is felt by the 
workers due to which there is a decrease in productivity.

Abstract 
Coronavirus strikes again with the delta variant and puts the world in a phase 3 pandemic state. Countries all over the 
world have adopted different response mechanisms to contain the virus's spread. Health officials call for lockdown 
strategies as Covid-19 cases rise in most countries. In a faster and more effective worldwide vaccination scenario, 
leading economies are racing towards ""herd immunity"" under an optimistic hypothesis, speeding the world's economic 
recovery. The justification behind countries making a move towards the open community approach is to keep the 
economy in good shape. Validating both ""lockdown"" and ""herd immunity"" approaches, Scandanavian countries were 
studied in this paper. Sweden, a Nordic member state that follows an open economy approach, and; Denmark, Finland, 
and Norway that follows strict social-distancing and lockdown strategies as a measure to flatten the curve were 
considered in this study. This can help assess each government policy's success or failure against containing the virus. 
IBM Cognos Business Intelligence platform is used to visualize the different factors affecting the economy namely, 
the number of infected people and the number of deaths per country. The analysis revealed that Sweden chose an open 
economy strategy, failed to sustain a stable economy, and continued its upward trajectory with a rising number of 
virus-related deaths. The comparison of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), inflation, and unemployment rates showed 
Sweden as one of the least, if not the worst, among other Nordics in flattening the curve. This research thus contradicts 
the notion of herd immunity as a measure to sustain a healthy economy to be no longer valid.

1. Introduction 
Coronavirus at its new form, strikes again (Islam et al., 2020). The outbreak has set the world in an unprecedented 
health challenge, causing neuro-respiratory failures leading to death along with disruptive effects on the global 
economy (Ibarra-Vega, 2020). When writing this manuscript, the total number of infected people worldwide reached 
203.25 million with 4.3 million deaths as per World Health Organization (WHO, 2021). The Alpha B.1.1.7 Corona 
Virus first started in late 2019 in China's Hubei province and started spreading worldwide through human-to-human 
contact. International air travel and the high infection rate helped the virus spread rapidly, with almost 10 times more 
reach than the seasonal flu variants (Mukherjee, 2020). By March 2020, the virus spread alarmingly in European 
countries, especially in Italy, France, and Germany (Anttiroiko, 2021). As the virus began to mutate in late 2020, 
governments worldwide enforced strict restrictions to contain the spread of the virus as most available vaccines were 
proven less effective to the mutant variants (Islam et al., 2020). These measures include; increased safety while 
traveling, banning events, closure of shops and institutions, and forced quarantines for suspicious and infected patients 
(Ibarra-Vega, 2020). These measures were enforced to reduce the risk of transmission of the disease between the 
infected and non-infected people and, to slow down the virus spread to avoid flooding the health care facilities with 
patients more than the hospital capacity (Anttiroiko, 2021). On the other hand, some countries adopted softer measures 
such as the ""herd immunity."" The concept behind this lies in protecting the high-risk population by infecting all 
healthy, low-risk populations surrounding them, which will prevent the virus from reaching high-risk vulnerable 
people. Even though this approach feels right and can be a solution, the main issue with this idea is that there will be

894","6. Conclusion 
It is seen from the study that Sweden is one of the countries that adopted the herd immunity approach for fighting the 
virus, while others opted for partial and full lockdown strategies. This research investigated and compared different 
data for the selected Nordic countries to understand the effectiveness in their response mechanism to flatten the curve. 
These selected countries have a lot in common, such as common geographic boundaries, culture, and monetary values, 
and many more, which will help assess each government policy's success or failure against containing the pandemic. 
In conclusion, Sweden's choice of choosing an open economy on public safety was inappropriate since it failed to 
sustain a stable economy and exacerbated the overall number of new deaths. It has drained the health care system, and 
when considering the spread of the virus due to travel, it will affect other nations. The comparison of GDP, Inflation, 
and unemployment rates showed that Sweden was one of the least if not the worst among the other Norden regions. 
So, any argument that the option of herd immunity was made to sustain a healthy economy can no longer stay valid. 
A dashboard was created to study all the factors together, as shown in Figure 8. 
 
Figure 8. Covid-19 visualization dashboard for Nordic countries 
 
The novel Coronavirus has been declared a pandemic. Therefore, even though it is detrimental to their economies, 
countries should take the right steps to monitor the spread of this disease. Future research can be conducted to study 
the correlation between these different factors. The authors could not do this due to various time intervals for each 
element and pandemic dynamics being a wicked problem. For future research, the authors suggest in understanding 
the Global Health Security (GHS) dynamics post the pandemic recovery through the lens of sustainability and global 
sustainable development goals.

1. Introduction 
Sustainability in higher education (SHE), a paradigm that has spurred interest among educational practisioners has 
acquired immense popularity over the recent years (Maragakis and Dobbelsteen, 2015). Higher Education Institutions 
(HEIs) continuously commit in fostering sustainable future in the area of research and educational excellence. Thus, 
sustainability is identified as sculptures that bring life to the next generation HEIs. This goal is often achieved through 
proper sustainability reporting. One of the most commonly used reporting tool developed by Lozano, (2011) is the 
“Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)” that covers all the requisites fit for educational institutions apart from teaching and 
research (Findler et al., 2018). These tools contain several categories of broadening indicators that aid in building an 
ideal sustainability model for the educational institutions (Alhorr and Alkuwari, 2018). Enhancing knowledge about 
sustainability among the key employees can foster sustainable outcomes and help in supporting the sustainability 
assessment committee at the institution (Caeiro, 2015). Concerns have arised about the lack of inclusion of educational 
dimensions of sustainability along with the economic, social and environmental dimenaions of sustainability for the 
categories of broadening indicators. Hence, a better understanding on the reporting systems and indicators availability 
should be of great concern for researchers working in this area of knowledge to build a sustainability model. 
Several research articles, conference papers, and book chapters have been published over the years, in which a clear 
understanding can be drawn that “Sustainability in Higher Education” is an emerging area of interest among the research 
community. Despite a growing concern in this area of research, it can be seen that this emerging area has not been 
deeply reviewed previously using a bibliometric study. As a result, the paper furnishes a bibliometric analysis on the 
several sources of data collection and reporting systems for sustainability related assessment and practices in HEIs. This 
research paper characterizes the search results according to; 
a) Journals, Conference proceedings, and Book chapters   
b) The publication year 
c) The assessment methodology 
d) The methods and techniques used for the assessment  
e) The broadening indicators availability

Abstract 
 
A company’s performance is determined by the conditions and behavior of employees owned by the company. The 
form of employee behavior that cannot be prevented is the desire to move (turnover intention). High employee 
turnover rates result in companies becoming unstable, losing experienced employees and needing to train new 
employees. In the last three years State-owned bank has a turnover intention value above the normal global turnover 
rate. Job stress is one of the factors for turnover intention, high job stress will affect the increase in turnover intention. 
This research aims to find out how the work stress on employees of State-owned bank Regional Office VI Bandung. 
How is Turnover Intention of employees of State-owned bank Regional Office VI Bandung, as well as to calculate 
how much influence Job Stress has on Turnover Intention of Employees of State-owned bank Regional Office VI 
Bandung. This research is descriptive and causal analysis with a population of 210 permanent employees of State-
owned bank Regional Office VI Bandung. The total sample taken is 74 male and female employees from State-owned 
bank Regional Office VI Bandung. The scale used in this study is a Likert scale using research data testing. Validity 
and reliability testing is a quantitative method. Sampling was done by non-probability sampling method with 
incidental sampling type. The data analysis technique used is simple linear regression analysis. The results of this 
study indicate that work stress is in the fairly good category, which is 66.72%, turnover intention is also in the fairly 
good category, which is 67.60%. From this research, work stress has a positive and significant effect partially on 
turnover intention of 38.9% and the remaining 61.1% is influenced by other factors not examined in this study.

1. Introduction 
In the world of business development, one of the determining factors for company development is the company's 
resources (Anitha, 2014). Human resources are the most important assets and must be owned by every company 
because the progress of a company depends on its human resources (Fakhri et al., 2021). However, human resources 
are often demanded by companies to further improve their abilities and expertise in carrying out a job and without 
realizing it, this can make employees feel stressed which will affect job satisfaction and employee performance 
(Diamantidis & Chatzoglou, 2019). The definition of job stress is as a condition that suppresses a person's self and 
soul beyond the limits of that person's abilities (Eisapareh et al., 2020). In addition, work stress can affect a person's 
emotions, thought processes and psychological conditions (Lee & Jang, 2020). 
 
From the results of the pre-survey of 15 senior employees at State-owned bank Regional Office VI Bandung, it 
indicates that employees at State-owned bank Regional Office VI Bandung have a fairly high stress level. With that 
results, the level of stress experienced by the employee is thought to be due to pressure when there is a supervisor 
and a work environment that is not conducive. This is in line with the results of interviews that have been carried out 
previously also to several employees who work at State-owned bank Regional Office VI Bandung saying that they 
experience work stress, this is due to experiencing pressure due to the many jobs given by their superiors and the 
many demands of their work, sometimes they are also given a workload outside of their duties. there should be special 
handling of work stress experienced by employees and the company must be responsive to handle it properly and

The value of the coefficient of determination is used to determine the magnitude of the effect simultaneously and 
described in Table 4: 
 
Table 4. Coefficient of Determination. 
 
The following is the calculation of the coefficient of determination: 
KD = R2 × 100% 
KD = 0,389 × 100% = 38,9% 
 
The coefficient of determination from the calculation results obtained is 0.389 or 38.9%. This shows that work stress 
has an effect of 38.9% on Employee Turnover Intention of  State-owned bank Regional Office VI Bandung, while 
the remaining 61.1% is influenced by other variables not examined in this study. 
 
5. Discussion 
Work Stress (X) is in the fairly good category with a value of 66.72%. This indicates that the employees of State-
owned bank Regional Office VI Bandung do not experience work stress. The highest dimension is the dimension of 
economic problems of 86.57%. And the one who got the highest score on the dimension indicator of role demands 
was ""With the pressure of time, I feel that the work I have completed is maximal"" with a percentage of 74%. This 
shows that the problem of time for employees of State-owned bank Regional Office VI Bandung that appears does 
not interfere with attention to work. Meanwhile, the lowest dimension is the dimension of personal characteristics 
that is equal to 57.63%. 
 
The Turnover Intention (Y) variable as a whole is included in the fairly good category which can be proven by having 
an overall value on each turnover intent variable which has a value of 67.60%, which means that employees of State-
owned bank Regional Office VI Bandung have a turnover rate. employees quite well. The highest value of the 
dimension of intention to search for alternatives with a percentage of 72.29%, this indicates that employees of State-
owned bank Regional Office VI Bandung have no intention to look for other alternatives while the lowest value is in 
the thinking of quit dimension with a percentage value of 65.13% with the indicator “about looking for another 
company if there is a better company” of 63%. Therefore, 
 
Work stress shows that it has a positive and significant influence on turnover intention, this can be seen from the 
results of the T test, and it can be seen from the t value of 6.772 (to) > 1.66757 (tα) = H0 is rejected, H1 is accepted. 
And the significance value is smaller than the value of (alpha), which is 0.000 <0.05. The results of the regression 
analysis show that the work stress variable has a partial influence on turnover intention in employees of State-owned 
bank Regional Office VI Bandung. Based on the results of the coefficient of determination (R2), it shows that the R 
value of 0.624 means that the relationship between the independent variable (work stress) and the dependent variable 
(turnover intention) has a positive and close relationship. The value of R2 = 0.389 or 38.9% means that the work 
stress variable has an influence of 38.9% on the turnover intention of State-owned bank Regional Office VI Bandung 
and the remaining 61.1% is influenced by other factors not examined in this study. This shows that the results of the 
output of work stress have an influence on the turnover intention of employees of State-owned bank Regional Office 
VI Bandung. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded as follows:

Abstract 
 
Additive manufacturing technologies have evolved rapidly and steadily over the last decade and they become widely 
used not only in large, high-level companies, but also in medium-sized industries for both the production of prototypes, 
mockups, and the production of finished components. Stratasys' patented fused deposition modelling (FDM) 
technology, or more generally Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), is by far the most cost-effective additive 
manufacturing (AM) technology especially if compared to powder technologies such as selective laser melting. It 
offers an extremely wide range of materials from nowadays mainstream, low-cost polylactic acid to the more advanced 
carbon fiber PEEK. The use of this technology is usually finalized on the production of prototypes and few case studies 
of end-use components can be found in the literature. This is due to the difficulties in predicting the final behavior of 
the resulting component and the presence of defects that can cause unpredictable premature failures in the component. 
This study focuses on describing how it is possible to reduce the defects present in the component with a careful choice 
of printing parameters and in particular focus on the effect of the parameter called “line width” and its correlation with 
the geometry of the printable part. The results would help to make FFF a more reliable process that could be used for 
obtaining a reliable, industrial production as well as prototype manufacture.

1. Introduction  
The Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process was first introduced by Stratasys, a leading company in AM 
technologies, under the name of FDM®. It was patented as a mouldless technique for the fabrication of solid objects. 
Nowadays it is the most widespread AM technology because it offers a versatile choice of thermoplastic materials 
such as low cost polylactic acid (Rajpurohit et al. 2019) up to engineering plastic like Nylons (Guessasma et al., 2021). 
It consists in a continuous deposition of lines of extruded material up to the formation of an entire layer (Shahrubudin  
et al. 2019). Moreover, the component is built layer by layer and is possible to obtain solid object having complex 
shapes, as reported by the studies of (SAVU et al. 2019), (Mahamood et al. 2019), and (Brian et al. 2014).  
Furthermore, research by (Tofail et al. 2018) stated that FFF can create fully complete parts in series production.  
 
1.1 Defects in 3d printed parts 
Defects plays a key role in 3D printing since they are responsible for the degradation in mechanical properties with 
respect to injection molded parts. As suggested by (Gordeev et al. 2018). Voids of molten material found between 
lines and layers in the printed structure leads to a reduction in the final density of the component. These voids are 
strictly correlated with the values of slicing parameters.  Moreover, the chosen printing strategy can also generate 
voids in the structure for example where perimeter lines joined infill lines. The presence of pores can be observed in 
a nondestructive way using CT (Computed Tomography) scans on the specimens (Damon et al. 2019) or by using a

5. Conclusions    
The mathematical Gcode-based model demonstrated the importance of the line width as a crucial slicing parameter in 
the FFF process. This parameter has a direct effect on the number and final volume of defects obtained in the printed 
component. A reduction on the volume of defects proven to be feasible by means of a modification of input printing 
parameters and correct hardware selection. Furthermore, changing the percentage of volume of defects implies that 
mechanical characteristics of the material would change accordingly and can be compromised because of poor choice 
of printing settings for a given 3D printed part. This approach and the use of a mathematical model with “standard” 
predefined condition made possible to make a valuable comparison between different slicing settings and therefore 
appreciate the theoretical gain in defects reduction with the given setting. This work consequently represents a step 
forward in order to turn FDM technology processes into the mainstream production of components with higher 
mechanical properties and that would turn this process feasible for creating structural-applicable parts. 
 
6. Future Developments 
To extend this study and consider further parameters like positioning defects of the machine and filament tolerances. 
To extend this algorithm for the evaluation of defects also on complex geometries. To identify a correlation between 
defects volume and mechanical properties of the specimen by means of tensile test.

Abstract 
The study was embarked upon to throw light on the existence/ prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress 
among nursing professionals working in hospitals treating COVID-19 patients and also to assess the level of the 
same. This study also aims to study the influence of gender difference, marital status, socio economic status and 
educational qualification on mental health of nurses dealing with ongoing pandemic. Most Health care workers 
have been acutely impacted by the widespread social and economic disruption which has impacted the emotional 
wellbeing of the health care workers.  These issues (if any) should be timely addressed to ensure positive mental 
health and early interventions for COVID -19 healthcare workers. The target population is basically the health 
care workers (nursing professionals) located across various hospitals in Kerala. Furthermore, this study had been 
carried out using data obtained by self-administered online questionnaire which comprises of a set of general 
questions based on previous literature across globe, and standardized DASS 21. The responses are then analyzed 
using SPSS software. The findings revealed that the gender of the respondents has a substantial impact on the 
anxiety of nursing professionals treating COVID - 19 patients in hospitals.

2. Introduction 
The Novel Coronavirus which first appeared in Wuhan, (T Phan 2020) emerged from wet markets (Zhu N, 
Zhang D, Wang W et al 2020). The first case of human infection occurred in December 2019. The emerging 
infectious disease (now called COVID-19) has spread across all counties at a very fast pace, affecting people in 
approx. 210 countries and territories with an infection no. exceeding 7.5 million and approximate death of 1 
million (Jalili, et al 2020). On 11th March 2020, World Health Organisation (WHO) declared it a pandemic due 
to its fast-paced transmission rate and its vital influence on global healthcare systems (WHO 2020). In addition 
to the deaths, it has caused around the world, the pandemic has caused widespread panic and anxiety among 
patients, general people, and healthcare workers. 
 
The COVID-19 is known to have limited known effective treatment (Heng Li) and is currently uncontrollable. 
This potent nature of COVID -19 in combination with a high rate of infection and death rate among commoners 
and particularly healthcare providers, is likely to take a toll on nurses with regards to anxiety and stress. The 
social stigma, lack of personal protection equipment (PPE) supplies, and overtime working in PPE suit can all 
exacerbate the situation. (Sudip Bhattacharya,). In Combination of the aforementioned factors, this pandemic is 
expected to have an implication on the emotional well-being of the nurses/healthcare providers on COVID- 19 
duty (Konstantinos Tsamakis ,2020).  Moreover, the emotional wellbeing of the health care providers can affect 
patients at a minute level. (Talaee, Negin et al 2020) (Embriaco et al. 2007). It not only causes deteriorating 
physical and mental health outcomes followed by lower motivation, morale and absenteeism. These factors can 
cause a decline in the standard of treatment rendered by the affected employees resulting in poor patient 
outcomes (Harnois Phyllis Gabrie 2000). COVID-19 could influence the mental state of people at different strata 
of society, starting from the patients, staff in health care, to kids and families, and even staff in alternative sectors 
(Nader et al 2020). The medical health-care workers treating patients who are critically ill, who are experiencing 
anxiety and other emotional distress due to the illness or experiencing a personal loss are themselves prone to 
trauma (Qian Liu, Dan Luo 2020). Additionally, high risk of getting infected, simultaneously shouldering burden 
in the public prevention efforts in hospitals  and other COVID care community centres is also taking a toll on

6. Conclusion  
Prevalence of Stress, Depression and Anxiety is 7.5%, 30%, 42.5% respectively among nurses taking covid duty. 
It is concluded that out of total 200 nursing professionals only 4.5 percent have mild level of stress and 3.0 
percent have moderate level of stress, 30.0 percent have depression with different level as mild 15.0 percent, 
moderate 13.5 percent, and severe 1.5 percent and 42.5 percent have anxiety with different level as mild 7.5 
percent, moderate 26.5 percent, severe 6.5 percent and extremely severe 2.0 percent.Research reveals that there 
is no significant influence of Gender difference, Marital Status, Educational Qualification, Age and type of 
hospital on stress and depression among sample populationStudy discloses that there is no significant influence 
of Marital Status, Educational Qualification, Age Category and type of hospital on anxiety of the nursing 
professionals undertaking COVID-19 duty. However, there exists significant influence of gender of the 
respondents on anxiety among sample population. Considering the percentage of normal level of anxiety, 62.3% 
of the respondents experienced high anxiety among females. Whereas, among males and 39.0% of the 
respondents experiences low anxiety. Considering the events around the outbreak of corona virus, it is quite

938","natural to have anxiety and fear among female due lots of issues such as dealing with at risk patients and family 
members, keeping kids occupied amidst high duty schedule and managing household responsibilities. The 
anxiety, if not managed early can lead to excessive stress and depression with good family support, working.  
 
7. Limitations 
This study does not consider the duration of duty (shift) per week. The emotional well being is likely to get 
affected for nursing professionals with longer working hours. The above study reveals that women experienced 
higher level of anxiety. However, it is to be noted that, 80% of the respondents are women. The result is likely 
to change if the male to female respondent ratio is 50:50.

Abstract 
 
In this paper, we give a new method for solving the MID CPLP problem that results when vertical decomposition is 
applied to two-stage capacitated warehouse location problem (see Sharma and Agarwal (2014)). In the MID CPLP 
problem, warehouses are locatable in stage 1 and stage 2 (thus incurring fixed costs), and we incur transportation costs 
as goods are transported from stage 1 to stage 2. Here in MID CPLP, we minimize the sum total of the cost of 
warehouse location (stage 1 and stage 2) and transportation. In the method due to Sharma and Agarwal (2014), the 
decomposition is followed where location variables at one of the stages are relaxed, and it is reduced to LHS CPLP 
(Left Hand Side Capacitated Plant/Warehouse Location Problem), and reasonable bounds are obtained by the 
procedures given by Verma and Sharma (2007).  
 
Thus, in the method, due to Sharma and Agarwal (2014), the problem TSCWLP is reduced to LHS CPLP, MID CPLP 
(that is again reduced to LHS CPLP) and an RHS CPLP. This paper reduces the problem TSCWLP to LHS LP (linear 
program), MID CPLP and RHS LP (linear program). It is expected to offer good computational advantages. This 
procedure is outlined in detail in this paper.

1","Step 3: If QTY = 1 then GO TO STEP 4; else set current xpws1(h,i) = xpws1(h,i)  - (QTY – 1) & GO TO STEP 4.  
 
Step 4: Compute GOOD_SOLN_VAL = sum(h,i), xpws1(h,i)*cpws1(h,i) & STOP.  
 
It is easy to see that solution given by primal based procedure A is an upper bound. Similar procedure can be used for 
solving RHS LP. From this good solution one can proceed to optimality easily. It is to be noted that complexity of 
procedure A is O(n*ln(n)) if we use binary sort (at Step 0).  
 
Now we give below a dual based procedure to obtain a lower bound to LHS LP and RHS LP that have similar structure. 
LHS LP and RHS LP is similar to as given below.

Where we have in general sum (h), s(h)) >= 1 and sum(i), capws1(i) >= 1   (17).  
 
This is similar to problem P in Sharma and Sharma (2000). We associate dual variables vo with equation (13), v1(i) 
with equations (14) and v2(h) with equations (15).  Then its dual is written as given below.  
 
Max vo – sum(i), capws1(i)*v1(i) – sum(h), s(h)*v2(h)          (18) 
 
s.t. vo – v1(i) – v2(h) <= C(h,i)  for all h, i                               (19) 
 
v0 uis, v1(i) >= 0 for all i, v2(h) >= 0 for all h                         (20)  
 
Although in Sharma and Sharma (2000) it is assumed that sum (h), s(h)) = 1 and sum(i), capws1(i) = 1   (18); but it 
causes no problems. For a given value of v2(h) optimal value of the remaining dual problem can be easily found (see 
p. 219 of Sharma (1996) (problem DRP3)).  
 
Thus, very easily a lower bound to problem LHS LP can be found by solving dual problem (18), (19) and (20) by 
using method given in Sharma and Sharma (2000).  
 
These lower and upper bounds to LHS LP and RHS LP can be fruitfully used to quickly determine the optimal solution.  
 
5 Conclusion  
 
In this paper we give a new relaxation scheme for solving problem TSCWLP that leads to 2 LPs and one MID CPLP 
problem (that is intractable). In the earlier method due to Sharma and Agarwal (2014) the problem TSCWLP was 
decomposed into one LHS CPLP, one MID CPLP and one RHS CPLP (all three of them are intractable). The method 
given in this paper could offer computational advantages (as only one problem is computationally intractable; and 
other two LPs (RHS LP and LHS LP) can be solved by polynomial time procedure to get a good upper bound and 
lower bound).

Abstract 
 
Enterprise social media (ESM) is a social media within an organization (see wiki pages on enterprise social media). 
One can note the proceedings of ESM in an organization for a functional area or project and it is useful tool for 
knowledge management, training, designing tailor made OD interventions and employee performance appraisals. In 
the modern world one can watch a prospective employee for a long period of time and makeup one’s mind about his 
suitability and make a job offer to him. In this paper we give several interesting hypotheses regarding analytics 
(descriptive, diagnostic, predictive and prescriptive) required for different HR activities (for the case when 
organizations use or do not use SM/ESM).

Abstract 
 
Innovation is very important in current times. It is a major weapon that enhances competitive advantages. Four types 
of innovations are reported in literature: continuous improvement, modular innovation, architectural innovation and 
radical innovation. In this paper we give theoretical framework that relates modular (MI) and architectural innovations 
(AI) to different organizational variables. Contribution of authors on modular and architectural innovation is scattered. 
Here we put all these in one place. In this paper we present eighty nine theoretical propositions.  
 
Key Words:  
Architectural Innovation, Modular Innovation and Organizational Variables) 
 
1. Introduction 
In this paper we relate AI/MI to different organizational variables, these are strategy, personality, culture and structure 
of the organizations. We start with strategy. Different strategy types are given in Miles and Snow et al (1978). It is 
reproduced below for ready reference.  
 
Strategy-  
Strategy is derived from the Greek word which means the art of leaders of troop wherein it was defined as “general 
plan for the achievement of long term or overall goal under uncertain conditions”. (Michael porter, 1980) defined 
strategy as “formula of a business to compete, defining business goals and framing different policies to achieve those 
goals”. He provided different type of strategies named Cost leadership, Differentiation and focus to cope up with 5 
competitive forces (i.e. Suppliers, buyers, new entrants, Competitive rival and Substitutes)

We note that National Culture Percolates into the organization for AI/MI (as PD is low in general) and will have its 
own effect on compensation.  
 
It has been noted in literature that it is difficult to keep exploration and exploitation under the same roof (USR). It has 
been noted by many that innovative conglomerates. are keeping exploration and exploitation under the same roof 
(USR): these are small base of resources (for small firm), short product life cycles etc. Alternatives are suggested to 
try and make a compromise by (1) Outsourcing (2) Separate Exploitation and Exploration and align them (3) cycle 
back and forth between exploration and exploitation and (4) continuous and incremental reconfiguration. We note that 
exploration and exploitative processes are happening in both modular and architectural innovation. Now we argue as 
given below. 
 
(H90): Option (1) as above to be followed predominantly in modular innovations; and Option (4) as above to be used 
predominantly in architectural innovations.  
 
3. Conclusion 
In this theoretical paper we give a rich framework that relates modular and architectural innovation to various 
organizational variables (strategy, personality of knowledge workers, culture, VT/ESM). These are likely to be useful 
to top management of AI/MI who can set controllable organizational variables at required levels. These hypotheses 
(presented in this paper) are available in scattered form in Sharma (2019, 2020 and 2021). Here these are presented as 
a unified whole. We are undertaking a empirical investigation to verify above framework; and we will get back with 
results.

Abstract  
 
In this paper we give a brief review of holonic, bionic and fractal manufacturing. We discuss role of wisdom 
manufacturing in each of these. We finally conclude that Wisdom Manufacturing will take more time to evolve in 
firms with differentiation strategy and hence in holonic manufacturing (compared to firms with cost leader strategy 
and hence in Bionic Manufacturing).

Abstract 
 
In this paper we relate different OD interventions to the strategy of the firm (as given by Miles and Snow 1978: these 
being cost leaders (CL) and differentiators (DIFF)). Later we identify essential personality attributed of OD 
consultants (in the Big-5 and MBTI personality typology). Interesting testable hypotheses are presented.

1. Introduction 
Different strategy types are given in Miles and Snow et al (1978). It is reproduced below for ready reference.  
 
Strategy-  
Strategy is derived from the Greek word which means the art of leaders of troop wherein it was defined as “general 
plan for the achievement of long term or overall goal under uncertain conditions”. (Michael porter, 1980) defined 
strategy as “formula of a business to compete, defining business goals and framing different policies to achieve those 
goals”. He provided different type of strategies named Cost leadership, Differentiation and focus to cope up with 5 
competitive forces (i.e. Suppliers, buyers, new entrants, Competitive rival and Substitutes)  
 
1) Cost leader- Firm by adopting this strategy try to gain market share by providing lower cost value and by 
doing so it gains competitive advantage over other rival firms. To provide low cost generally firm produces 
large volume of products to have benefits of economies of scale (CL).  
2) Differentiator- Firm adopting this strategy tends to differentiate its products on some or other basis like 
offering innovative products or some other certain differentiating criteria like building its product brand 
image, and try to charge higher price. (Porter 1980 and 1985) (DIFF).  
3) Focus-By this firm tries to focus on the particular buyer or on producing particular segment of product. By 
having the focus strategy firm can focus on differentiating its products or providing low cost. 
 
Miles and snow (1978) gave strategies to solve engineering, administrative and entrepreneurial problem and named

Abstract 
 
H1: Thematic based ads appealing to customer’s cognition can be dubbed in different languages and used in different 
countries or states.  
 
H2: Thematic based ads (using pictures and symbols) appealing to customer’s emotions should NOT be dubbed in 
different languages and should not be used in different countries or states. 
  
It is known that ads shown internationally are prone to misunderstanding. Hence, we argue that messages appealing 
to ‘cognition’ are prone to less misunderstanding than messages that are appealing to ‘emotions’ (in an international 
context: with cultural differences and in multi-country/state settings).  
 
Particularly true in Industrial marketing where messages are typically targeting ‘cognitions’. 
  
Keywords: Cognition, Emotion, Thematic based ads 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Promoting is a method for correspondence with the clients of an item or administration. “Promotions are messages 
paid for by the individuals who send them and are proposed to educate or impact individuals who get them” as defined 
by the Advertising Association of the UK. Usually promoting has been shown to individuals especially intrigued by a 
specific sort of item. The focal thought or message which is reflected in all the promotions in an advertisement mission 
of an item is named as publicizing subject. The goal of a publicizing subject is to situate the item immovably into the 
personalities of target clients. Henceforth, a progression of promotions is made under an advertisement crusade having 
the same subject with the goal that clients get similar messages severally and record something very similar in their 
psyche. This has ended up being more powerful in making sway than indicating singular promotions of a similar item 
yet with various topics.  For example Coca-Cola Ad Theme: Coca-Cola has situated itself as an item that cares about 
relations and qualities. The equivalent is reflected in its promotion crusades. In each promotion of Coca-Cola, there 
will be a family celebrating together over some occasion with Coca-Cola on the other side, Pepsi Ad Theme: Pepsi, 
even though selling the comparative item as Coca-Cola yet utilizing completely inverse promotion subject in its 
advertisement crusades. In their advertisements, they generally advance youth energy, boldness to take up difficulties 
and new activities. Pepsi promotions never talk about family esteems connections and this component is found in each 
Pepsi notice.

4. Conclusion 
Prior to marketing analytic tools, it was very difficult to understand the preference of the customer towards ads. In 
this study two hypothesis were taken and based on the literature it explored that thematic ads that are dubbed in 
different languages appeal the customers and whereas there are some thematic ads that should not be dubbed in 
different languages for countries or state as it loses its real meaning. This study is based on concept further it can be

Abstract 
 
The adverse impact of climate change is possibly decreased by reducing the anthropogenic carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere. As the coal-fired power plant is the primary source of anthropogenic carbon dioxide generation, our 
research work focuses on the maximization of capturing of released carbon dioxide from the power plant. This paper 
proposes capturing carbon dioxide by considering decisions regarding clean technology such as carbon capture 
technology by linear optimization model. This paper's other contribution is to solve the optimization problem 
considering the loss of energy due to the implementation of the clean technology, which is compensated by 
incorporating the coal-fired compensatory plant. With the introduction of compensatory plants, the model becomes 
nonlinear, which is managed by auxiliary equations. It is observed from analysis results that the proposed model is 
35.62% more effective to capture carbon dioxide from the coal-fired power plants of Orissa state in India due to the 
optimal selection of clean technology. These research works provide one of the paths in reducing the risk of exceeding 
a global temperature increase of 2 0C compare to the preindustrial period in the context of sustainable operations.

1. Introduction  
The warming of the earth’s atmosphere due to the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) accelerates climatic change. 
According to the synthesis report (Albritton & Dokken 2001), the witness of climate change is by a remarkable 
variation in change in weather events and a rise in earth’s global mean surface temperature over a long period. The 
other elements that demonstrate that climate is changing are thinning sea ice, a decrease in snow cover leading to 
increased global mean sea level, frequent and intense El-Nino events, and unpredictable extension of seasons. The 
natural and human fingerprint of greenhouse gases (GHGs) ascribes the temperature rise. However, the natural 
greenhouse effect makes life easier on the earth, but the anthropogenic greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, NOX) act as 
catalysts and accelerate climate change. The uncontrollable increase in GHGs concentration level will enhance the 
greenhouse effect and lead to global warming (Houghton et al. 1990; Mitchell et al. 1990). 
 
Among different GHGs, carbon dioxide is the most prominent GHGs enhancing the greenhouse effect much faster 
due to its long-lived characteristics. The inefficiency in the absorption of CO2 further enhances an imbalance in the 
carbon cycle. A Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius in 1895 has established a relationship between the increase in CO2 
concentration and the rise in the earth’s temperature (Arrhenius 1896). According to the paper of Rodhe, Arrhenius 
explains that if the concentration of CO2 doubles, then this conduces to increase in temperature around 5 0C to 6 0C 
(Rodhe et al. 1997). The first assessment report of IPCC (Houghton et al. 1990) elaborates the relationship further, 
where researchers create the four scenarios. The four scenarios help to study the impact of the rise in the CO2 
concentration on the earth’s temperature. The first scenario refers to the business-as-usual scenario, where the 
researcher made no effort to reduce emissions. The doubling of the CO2 concentration in the first scenario will occur 
by 2025. The extra CO2 in the atmosphere led to an increase in temperature rate by around 0.3 0C per decade compared 
to the preindustrial period. Subsequently, the other scenarios deal with the control of the emission of CO2 in the 
atmosphere. The simulated results of these scenarios indicated that the maximum doubling of the CO2 concentration 
would happen in the year 2050, and the maximum rise in temperature at the rate of 0.1 0C per decade compared to the 
pre-industrial period.

45","4. Result 
The above mathematical formulation results are presented in this section with consideration of data from the case 
study. In Odisha, considering three post-combustion CC technology, Kamalanga TPP, and Sterlite TPP are retrofitted 
and captured 1037.4 tCO2/h and 2964 tCO2/h amount of CO2. Initially, Kamalanga TPP releases 1092 tCO2/h 
(mentioned in Table 2), but after retrofitting, the CO2 emission decreases to 54.6 tCO2/h. Similarly, Sterlite TPP 
initially releases 3120 tCO2/h (shown in Table 2), retrofitted by CC1 technology releases 156 tCO2/h. Both the power 
plant is retrofitted by CC1 technology.  Two compensatory plants balance the loss of 1035 MW of electricity. One of 
the compensatory produces electricity at its full load capacity, which is 660 MW. The other compensatory plant 
generates 375 MW of electricity. Thus, the net capture of CO2 emission is 4001.4 tCO2/h which has a 35.62% capture 
rate compare to the initial emission release by the coal-fired power plant in Odisha state. The total incurred overall 
cost of electricity increases to 30%, where each retrofitted plant contributes a 101% increase in cost and each 
compensatory plant incur a 70% increase in cost. None of the compensatory plants gets equipped with CC technology, 
as mentioned in Table 3. However, this may occur when the limitation of increase in the overall cost of electricity will 
be more than 30%.

5. Conclusion  
The information provided in the above study concludes that CC technology must be developed to become effective in 
terms of cost. However, CC technology is a viable and clean technology to mitigate the problem of climate change. 
Long-term and more stable storage facilities must be developed. An interdisciplinary approach must be taken to tackle 
CCS issues like technological aspects, economic factors, timing issues, carbon cycle dynamics, and unstable and 
uncertain sustainability. It had to be widely accepted that government incentives are needed, and other stakeholders 
must support the power plant firm. Government incentives can provide incentives in many ways like giving tax 
incentives, provide funds at a cheaper rate for installation, provide funds for research and development of advancement 
in CCS to reduce its cost, and increase operational efficiency and lower energy requirement. Further, CCS 
technology’s validity in different manufacturing sectors helps in sustainable energy management and reduces overall 
CO2 emission in the atmosphere.

Abstract  
 
The nature and extent of disasters are incrementing with the progressive nature of the economies across the globe. The 
uncertainty factor has made the global humanitarian agencies much more proactive to analyze the coming disasters 
before the generation of their impact. This resilient behavior has provided ample opportunity to the decision makers 
for identifying, planning, and progressing towards Humanitarian supply chain management (HSCM). The literature 
on HSCM comprises studies dealing with the enablers or the challenges in delivering essential goods. The focus on 
understanding the relationships between the challenges is, however, missing from the literature. In this context, the 
present work aims to identify the challenges from the literature and decision-makers and to understand their 
relationships for a better decision-making process. The study utilizes the Grey Decision trial and evaluation laboratory 
(DEMATEL) to identify the interrelationship between the challenges for effective HSCM implementation. The major 
findings of the study are to understand the situation in an emerging economy like India for building a humanitarian 
supply chain operation network during pre and post-disaster scenarios.

1. Introduction  
There has been a growing increase in understanding the uncertainty due to natural and man-made disasters, globally, 
it has become imperative to be prepared for facing such situations and examining their degree of impact. Planning and 
preparing for the ‘next disaster’ is an ongoing process and calls for identifying critical challenges and suggest possible 
solutions to overcome them during a crisis (Roadman, 2020). Therefore, one could claim that humanitarian endeavors 
take place in an intricate and challenging situation where the immediate requirement of essential items must be 
fulfilled. This difficulty causes numerous challenges including the instability of demand, time pressures, and lack of 
resources (Sohn, 2018). The major challenges are the fear of unknown demand and sudden emergencies (Wassenhove, 
2006). Providing the ‘right supplies’, at the ‘right time’, to the ‘right place’, in the ‘right quantities’ and to the ‘right 
people’ are the essential success factors in commercial and humanitarian supply chain management systems (HSCM) 
(Van Wassenhove, 2006). Various HSCM challenges have been recognized and discussed across various research in 
the literature. Numerous studies have referred to lack of coordination as a fundamental problem in humanitarian action, 
arguing that this challenge could cause numerous impacts ranging from ineffective aid distribution, to competition 
among actors for scarce resources, and congestion at airports and local roads (Kabra and Ramesh, 2015). Problems in 
fundraising have been highlighted as another important challenge of HSCM, due to its impact on providing immediate 
relief rather than making investments that would benefit the community in the long term (Kabra et al., 2015). Other 
essential challenges include poor information technology infrastructure, cultural differences among involved 
organizations, lack of clear policies, lack of knowledge management systems, and lack of trust between actors (Kovacs 
and Moshtari, 2018). The study by Kannan et al. (2020), discusses the application of physicians' familiarity and fuzzy 
inference system (FIS) to help with the demand administration in the health care supply chain, to reduce stress in the 
community, to break down the COVID-19 spread chain. A paper by Alessandra (2012), states key concepts related to 
the intricacy of an emergency relief operation by integrating effective and strong HSCM networks in organizations.  
The topic of HSCM challenges has been discussed extensively in the humanitarian operations in literature, however, 
several gaps still need the attention of the stakeholders. First, to the best of our knowledge, none of the previous studies 
examined the interrelationships between HSCM challenges. Most researchers have so far focused on the detection of

4. Results Discussion  
4.1 Numerical Results  
As seen from the above study and discussion, the factors which constitute cause are M6, M8 and M10. Examining the 
analysis, the positive number are the causal factors and negative numbers are the effect-based factors. This study has 
attempted to cluster the factors through the principal component analysis to find the relative importance. The present 
study has established three causal factors and seven effect-based factors. There have been tremendous changes the 
economy is making the business undergo. There are varied transitions at various levels, whether it has been due to 
globalization, competition or the COVID scenarios. The factor M6 - Information dissemination and advanced logistics 
stated that the road to communication has major hurdles and gaps, which may dissolve the essence of communication 
if these hurdles are not properly addressed. Effective HSCM framework is primarily dependent on efficient flow of 
information to the right people in organization, at the right time. While factor M8 – Policy planning and practical 
implementation usually depends on external factors like government support and policies formulated. The factor M10 
- Proactive communication before disaster advocates implementation of a stepwise refinement to be followed in which 
process elements are developed sequentially and pertinent performance indicators are recognized well before the 
disaster takes place. 
The factors which constitute the cause are M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 and M7. Factor M1 – Clarity in adopting to 
organization culture and role diversity is one of the most relevant factors helping to build a resilient HSCM framework 
in organizations. The factor M2 – Building flexibility in organizations helps in creating agility to adapt changes and 
prepare themselves to meet unexpected challenges. The factor M3 – clarity in reporting and submitting information is 
another crucial factor. With the increase in differential handling and managing of global workforce, the need to allocate 
the apt job to the right person with minimum flaws in managing the work and ensuring an effective utilization of 
available resources is in demand in today’s businesses. Thus, it becomes imperative to establish a clear strategy with 
focused goals and transmitting correct information as and when called for. The factor M4 – Effective operational 
management is the backbone of a prosperous business; it is the effectiveness of the operations in the business. The 
factor M5 – Strategic planning states the relevance of long-term planning as it leads to proactive, measures and future 
oriented strategies for long term planning. Irrespective of the type of business, the key differentiator is how seamlessly 
the supply chain operates. The complete effectiveness of business and economy rests on a robust supply chain network 
interconnecting the business operations for effective performance.  
 
4.2 Proposed Improvements  
 
The future scope and research include the validation of cause effect model. The results of this study provide a base 
work which can be endorsed for the other sectors of the economy. The future work may be done by including some 
mathematical models. Future research may also consider other disaster types. Advance research may also reflect case 
studies to analyze challenges, drawbacks, and improvements in the concept of real-life humanitarian supply chain 
environment.  
 
5. Conclusion  
The study provides an analytical framework to the investors and policy makers in building effective and strong 
sustainable humanitarian supply chain. The research focused on scrutinizing the challenges in successful implantation 
of effective humanitarian supply chain in organizations, making them proactive and effective in meeting any 
unforeseen situations, preparing them for future challenges. In the literary work it was analyzed that all the authors 
used a limited number of challenging factors for their research lacking in making a comparative analysis in finding 
the relative importance of the factors critical for implementing successful and resilient humanitarian supply chain 
network in organizations. 
The research gap identified through detailed literature review makes the study relevant when it examines the 
interrelation between cause and effect of humanitarian supply chain . The problem that we came across is that all the 
papers identified have focused their research on challenges and ways for implementing humanitarian supply chain but 
lacked in analyzing the cause - effect of the critical factors required in building successful HSC framework in 
organizations. The study adopts Grey DEMATEL methodology to understand the interrelationship. The focus of the 
study was to recognize the critical successful factors for the industry and to find out the cause - effect relationship for 
the factors. To study the relationship grey linguistic terms were used to avoid uncertainty of data. The decision makers

Abstract 
Most mining houses are shifting their strategies and implementing new business and 
operating simulations to include new technologies and are doing so on a more rapid and 
global basis than ever before. A combination of market volatility, changing global demand, 
radically different input economics, new locations in search of more reserves, a focus on a 
longer asset lifecycle and a commitment to operational excellence as well as policy shifts 
around the globe are all contributing to a total shift in the industry. Periods of cost reduction 
and the aging workforce have left mining companies with limited resources to adjust. Now, a 
rapidly evolving set of new technologies, the digital transformation, open new possibilities to 
improve operating efficiency, develop more accurate and agile planning, heighten salesperson 
awareness and collaborate with business partners throughout the mining value chain. The 
mining business is at the heart of this digital transformation, and can drive considerable 
distinction and competitive advantage within the sector.

Abstract 
 
Stunting is one of indicators to be achieved in Goal 2 of sustainable development goals (SDGs), that is to end 
hunger, attain food security and better nutrition security, and promote sustainable agriculture in 2030. This study 
aims to examine the trends and factors that affect stunting in six economic development regions, that is low 
income, low and middle income, lower middle income, middle income, upper middle income, and high income. 
The data used in this study came from the World Bank Indicators in 2005 and 2010–2019 . The outcome variable 
was the prevalence of stunting, that is height for age. The independent variables included the number of physicians 
per 1,000 people, access to electricity (% of population), GDP (current US$), and prevalence of anemia among 
pregnant women (%). The data was analysed using bivariate regression and random effect multiple generalized 
least square. The results of the study show that lower stunting prevalence was associated with better economic 
development, higher number of physicians per 1,000 people, higher access to electricity (% of population), higher 
GDP (current US$), and lower prevalence of anemia among pregnant women.

1. Introduction 
Stunting is an indicator of Goal 2 of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that is targeted to be achieved in 
2030. The goal is to end hunger, achieve food security and good nutrition, and improve sustainable agriculture. 
In 2012, the World Health Assembly Resolution 65.6 (WHO 2014) issued a comprehensive implementation plan 
on maternal, infant, and young child nutrition (1), which specified six global nutrition targets for 2025 (2). This 
policy included the first target, that is to reduce stunting prevalence by 40% in 2025 and then end all forms of 
malnutrition by 2030.

5. Conclusion 
The results of this study confirm the findings from previous studies on the importance of maternal factor 
(Destarina 2018; Nainggolan and Siagian 2019, Warsini et al. 2016, and Lubis and Santi 2020), healthcare access 
(Saiah and Saputra 2019; Aday et al. 2016; Hlasny and Intini 2018), infrastructure (Hoffman et al. 2017; Anderson 
et al. 2010; Kodavalla et al. 2015; Martinez et al. 2021; Davenport et al. 2017), and income (Mary 2018; Yaya et 
al. 2020; Wicaksono and Harsanti 2020; de Jesus Silva et al. 2020; Ruaida and Soumokil 2018) on stunting 
reduction. Non-anemic pregnant mothers would reduce the probability of stunting among for children aged under 
five years by giving birth to healthier and more nourished babies. Access to healthcare through adequate 
physicians improve child’s nutrition intake through more and better counselling on sufficient feeding practice 
information and guidance as well as early stunting diagnosis. Access to electricity can also reduce stunting through 
increase access to nutritious feeding practice information among mothers with under five years of age children. 
Better economic development achievement could prevent stunting through better resources to nutritious food for 
children aged under five years. Therefore, countries, in particular low and lower and middle income countries, 
should improve maternal health, access to healthcare, infrastructure, and income in order to eradicate stunting.

Abstract 
 
Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a combination of technological processes in which the design, construction, 
operation, and maintenance of any construction project can be digitally managed. Even though BIM’s promising 
nature has been appraised in scholarly works, it is not yet being fully implemented in the construction industry. Many 
scholarly works have identified cost headings of the BIM implementation as the major barriers for a successful BIM 
implementation. As a come-up strategy, Lean Construction Principles (LCP) can be used to minimise the wastes which 
do not add value to the construction. Therefore, the aim of this research to develop a lean integrated BIM framework 
to minimise the cost headings of BIM implementation. Accordingly, an extensive literature survey was conducted to 
develop a conceptual framework by identifying the cost headings and the possible expectations with the BIM 
implementation and identifying the applicable lean construction principles to optimise the value of BIM 
implementation with respect to each cost heading as the objectives of this study. So that, this study has identified the 
BIM implementation with the expectations of the stakeholders and the associated cost headings. Further, BIM 
implemented projects have been compared with the traditional projects to identify the major benefits. Addition to that, 
LCP were discussed with the benefits of its usage. Therefore, this framework lays down the guidance for construction 
industry-related firms to find their capabilities and competence to implement BIM with the integration of lean 
construction principles. Hence, this research will be effective for the construction industry as the major barrier for the 
BIM implementation has been recovered with the strategy of lean construction principles.

Abstract 
 
In the last decades, the world has undergone rapid changes including demographic explosions, population 
movement, increase in international trade and travel, emergence of new pathogens. To respond to this changing 
environment, there is a need to develop the capacities of the systems to detect, notify and respond to health risks 
that may constitute a threat to human health. The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic highlights the need for effective 
tools capable of predicting the onset of infection outbreaks at their early stages. Early warning systems are 
therefore an essential requirement for a robust public health emergency work. Fever is a common symptom in 
infectious processes. A subject with high temperature in a crowed place could become the zero subject of an 
outbreak. Keeping this in mind, I have designed a non-invasive low-cost electronic device that senses and 
displays the temperature of individuals. The prototype was made with low-cost electronic components. This 
electronic device will allow to monitor the temperature of individuals in crowded places. The device can be 
installed at busy places like train stations, schools, malls or hospitals etc. Visitors can check their temperature 
before they enter the site. The prototype has two sensors: a thermal sensor, and an ultrasonic distance sensor. 
The temperature sensors operate on a one-to-one basis. Rather than looking at a crowd of people, this setup 
scans one person at a time. Scanning is very fast. Every 3 seconds a temperature reading is processed and can be 
displayed. This allows to quickly process large groups of people. It performs the skin temperature measurement 
with an accuracy of ±0.5°C. The setup measures the temperature, when a person is within less than 25cm from 
the sensor. Another sensor used is ultrasonic distance sensor. This sensor is used in applications where 
measuring distance or sensing objects are required. It has two eyes like projects in the front which forms the 
Ultrasonic transmitter and Receiver. The sensor works with the simple high school formula that Distance=Speed 
x Time. This sensor in the device helps in maintaining a safe distance between two people entering the site. 
While entering if the distance is less than defined norms there will be buzzer thus ensuring no over crowding at 
point of entry. The device can be installed at the entry gates of any establishments. This is one of the tools to 
keep malls, businesses, schools, colleges or facilities of any kind open. The device enable the precise non-
reactive, contactless recording of body temperatures and ensuring a safe distance at entry points hence, it is 
highly suitable from public health perspective.

Abstract 
 
In recent times, predictive technology is altering product design and performance by incorporating new capabilities 
such as monitoring, control, and optimization. By predicting specific failure modes, such technology converts 
unplanned, uncertain failure events into planned ones, reducing the effective product failure rate. It thus enhances the 
service productivity of the OEMs that also offer product maintenance services. Driven by these benefits, OEMs could 
use predictive technology to penetrate remote product service markets served by local fringe firms. 
 
In this paper, competition for service of products between the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and a fringe 
firm is studied using a sequential game-theory model. The OEM utilizes predictive technology to reduce the product 
failure rate, and the fringe firm provides efficient service at a reasonable price. Because of market remoteness, the 
OEM is incapable of matching the local fringe firm's service quality. 
 
The price of service offered by the two players, the effective failure rate of the product when serviced by the OEM, 
and the fringe firm's service quality drive the number of products in the service market. Further, the captive market 
segment for OEM service and the products' failure rate as seen by each player drive that player's service demand. In 
such a setting, the OEM invests in predictive technology that reduces the effective failure rate of the products serviced 
by it. 
 
We find predictive technology benefitting both the players at higher failure rates, thus acting as a Pareto improvement 
while implying co-existence in such remote product service markets. We further find the OEM dominating the fringe 
firm with higher price and profits only when the OEM captive market segment is large.

Abstract  
 
The dynamics of generational consumer behavior in this millennium are very diverse, so this study aims to see the 
impact of a well-designed servicescape on purchasing decisions at Starbucks Benton. This impact is assessed from 
discounts, brand image, service quality, purchases made by Starbucks Benton on the intended product decision. Data 
collection will be carried out by distributing questionnaires to Starbucks customers, both by online using the Google 
application technology. Determination of the sample according to the theoretical criteria suggested. Data processing 
and analysis techniques in this paper used the SEM-AMOS statistical applications. As a conclusion, this study 
proves that the discount provided by Starbucks Benton influences purchasing decisions. On the other hand, the 
Starbucks brand image has a consumer appeal for purchasing decisions, that cape service is considered by 
consumers as another thing that influences purchasing decisions and the quality of service when visiting a place of 
purchase at Starbucks Benton Tangerang influences the purchasing decisions because of the advantages of different 
services and the convenience environment of the places with greening area.

1. Introduction  
Competition in the business world around the world is getting higher and tighter, every company is always trying to 
get market share which will always grow every day  (Primahendra et al., 2021) (Hikaru et al., 2021). Consumer 
purchases are unique because everyone's preferences for a product are different (Juliana et al., 2021). This is 
influenced by many factors including Discounts, Brand Image, and Servicescape (physical environment) 
(Adirinekso et al., 2020) (Indra et al., 2019) . The retail business in Indonesia has developed quite rapidly in recent 
years with various forms and types. Along with the rapid development of this retail business, including the family 
business (Tan et al., 2019) do the competition in the retail or retail marketing sector is increasing  (Indramawan et 
al., 2018). The development of the times that have become modern, something new has been present in human life. 
Advanced technology makes people experience convenience in various fields (Budiono, Purba, Adirinekso, et al., 
n.d.). An example is the interaction that can be done through social media, but not only that, because social media 
has even become a place to share stories with friends or other users. This culture has even made a new habit when 
eating or drinking in a place by uploading photos of food and drinks to social media pages (Alfirahmi, 2019).

Abstract 
 
Process maps provide a significant level diagram of an organization’s business processes and Business Process Maps 
are techniques that are used as tools to boost the organization's performance and upgrade the efficiency. This paper 
proposes a methodology, integrating the Deming's Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle and Business Process Maps 
scope. The utilization of the suggested method is validated through an undertaking of a research-based case study on 
creating New Product Introduction (NPI) process maps. The effects of the case study determine that the projected 
PDCA-based approach to deal with Business Process Maps will be a compelling option to show the perceivability of 
end-to-end processes.

1. Introduction 
Business Process Maps are used as a tool for business improvement. It has been stated as a useful technique that 
conducts process improvements in business and knowledge acquisition of organization and their mankind. Process 
maps, being a knowledge storehouse is found to have more merit that is farther away than the development of improved 
business process. The crucial element for knowledge collaboration and transfer is socialization. This method gives the 
perception about the usage of business process maps as a technique for aiding the acquisition of knowledge in each 
person. In this paper, we will see an overview of business process maps, their types and benefits, etc. followed by a 
case study using PDCA cycle for mapping business processes. 
 
1.1 Business Process Maps 
Processes are an important part of the way each business is managed, and the more clarity one has to understand what 
they are, how they work, and the impact they need, the greater one’s ability to get into their business. Business process 
planning plays a very important role during this position. Visualizing the causes of operations, we improve the 
understanding of our business capabilities, even if they are your characteristics and your flaws.  This, in turn, makes 
you create your business more productively1. Business process mapping is often called a business process 
visualization, which consists of a top-down view and explains how the business operates. The main advantage of 
process planning is reflection1.

In this paper, we understood an overview of different types of business process maps, their benefits, etc. which was 
followed by a case study using PDCA cycle for mapping business processes. The underlying mechanisms, tests, and 
input mechanisms of PDCA enable decisions and improvements during the usage phase of the cycle. The PDCA cycle 
divides the enterprise into small rational advances and allows for slow, gradual upgrades. PDCA is used for solving 
problems at all levels of the enterprise. Before moving to a larger area, it is useful to look up different answers to the 
question and test it in a controlled environment.

Abstract 
 
Flexibility in the context of an organization is the ability of it to respond and cope with uncertainties. These 
uncertainties can be both internal as well as external. Therefore, it has become very critical to manage and effectively 
react to several uncertainties posed by today’s changing environment. Operational flexibility is a formative approach 
to meet the demand of a customer during a changing environment. The research focuses on operational flexibility at 
a micro-level in the context of an Indian manufacturing organization, ‘XYZ’. By referring to past literature and 
experts’ opinion, 7 main and 28 sub-attributes have been established as the parameters for measuring the operational 
flexibility index. The study is an approach to evaluate operational flexibility through the fuzzy logic approach. The 
research concludes that the organization is found to be ‘very flexible’ in its routine operations.   
 
Keywords 
flexibility, operational flexibility, attributes, fuzzy set theory, Euclidean distance. 
 
1. Introduction  
Patel et al. (2017), reviewed flexibility in the context of a manufacturing organization, as an amalgamation of 3 sub-
divisions of flexibility- operational, organizational and supply chain flexibility. Operational flexibility has distinct 
dimensions that may vary in importance across environments (Stevenson and Spring 2007) and are crucial to be 
adopted by organizations to respond to changes and uncertainties. Operational flexibility is described as a short-term 
flexibility potential pertaining to everyday operations (Johnson et al. 2003), or a routine activity maneuvering capacity 
that constitutes maintenance of these routines based upon existing structures and goals of an organization (Volberda 
1997). Operational flexibility is particularly critical for a manufacturing organization as it integrates fluctuating 
demand and supply based on an uncertain working environment. Therefore, operations managers need to ensure that 
an organization is capable to adapt to potential threats of uncertainty. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic is one 
such example that unfolded the importance of flexibility in routine operations. 
 
The research explores operational flexibility and examines it empirically for an Indian manufacturing organization 
‘XYZ’ based in northern India by implementing a fuzzy approach. The name of the organization is kept confidential. 
Beach et al. (2000) reasons that the employment of the fuzzy set theory approach deals with ambiguity and dubious 
complications; Zadeh (1965) et al. provided linguistic labels that have been employed with approximate reasoning 
within the framework of fuzzy theory. Implementation of fuzzy approach enables evaluators to use simple and 
understandable linguistic terms to evaluate attributes. As a distinct membership function is associated with each of 
these linguistic terms, a calculation to establish a fuzzy index is carried out (Ansari and Mittal 2010).

flexible index for operational flexibility. It has been concluded as ‘very flexible’ at the operational level for the 
manufacturing organization considered for this study. The linguistic label for corresponding Euclidean distance 
(Vinodh et al. 2013) is given in Table 8.

5. Conclusion 
A manufacturing organization must deal with changes in its operations to breakout from threats posed by uncertainties 
and changing environments. Therefore, it is very crucial to incorporate flexibility for an organization in its routine 
operations. To empirically determine the level of operational flexibility in a manufacturing organization, the fuzzy 
logic approach is used. This approach is used to eliminate problems associated with vagueness complexities in the 
study. A conceptual model has been developed and seven important enablers of operational flexibility have been 
established. The first step for this study is established by collecting ratings and weights of attributes and sub-attributes 
consolidated through literature and industry experts’ opinions. Flexibility Index has been computed. The organization 
is found to be ‘very flexible’ by employing the Euclidean distance method to obtain operational flexibility level. The 
study is based on evaluation of flexibility in manufacturing organization. However, it can be extended to a series of 
other organizations of different sectors of economy. The study focuses and evaluates operational flexibility of an 
organization. Following this, it can be extended to other notions of flexibility such as organizational and supply chain 
flexibility. This method can help an organization to identify and monitor weaker areas in its operations that help 
determine flexibility. Following the study, it is evidently drawn that operations managers of the organization need to 
establish and improve material handling flexibility, labor flexibility and automation flexibility. This improvement can 
be done by focusing on a pool of factors explained in the study.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of brand experience on brand loyalty, and brand trust affect 
brand loyalty. This study aims to observe the behavior of the adidas company as a transnational company in developing 
and maintaining brand loyalty among its consumers. Brand loyalty is a key business which must be managed. Brand 
Adidas keep striking forward in the markets and penetrates bigger and wider market, to secure its position. Adidas 
maintain its position as a great brand consist of making sustainable, stylish, and functional products which peak the 
creator interest. This study uses 190 samples of adidas users around Jakarta. Collected data is tested for its reliability 
and validity. The results of the analysis conclude that an increase in brand experience and brand trust can significantly 
increase brand loyalty. Every increase in brand experience will increase brand loyalty by 0.42 times in 5 Likert scale, 
then each increase in brand trust will increase the brand loyalty by 0.60 times in 5 Likert scale. This study suggests 
that the brand experience and brand trust is crucial to improve consumer’s brand loyalty in regions in Indonesia.

1. Introduction 
In Indonesia, there are few well-known brands for sport and daily attires, such as Adidas, Nike, Puma, Reebok and 
much more. In terms of quality, innovation and durability, Adidas keep being on the top as it was expensive but worth 
the payment. Adidas on its top position, has notable competitors which exceed its own revenue globally and competes 
in the matters of style, quality, and durability (Budiono, (2011); (2012); Purba et al, (2020)). Adidas primary 
competitors were Nike and Puma but recently, Puma has been acquired by Adidas, eliminating its own competitor. 
Effective marketing strategies and innovative products in attempts to fulfil the needs and desires of community were 
the preparations and steps for Adidas to outperform other apparel industries (Adirinekso. G.P., Purba, Budiono, & 
Rajagukguk, 2020).  
 
Adidas Brand spread its wings in many countries globally, including Indonesia. Rapid economic growth in Indonesia 
has affect the markets significantly. Revenues of both company, Adidas and Nike were great in the states of 
development from 2015 to 2018. In Figure 1, Net Sales and Revenues of both companies were concluded there, and 
still, the winner is Nike, but their growth as we can see, quite tremendous and having a great run. Trade values, import 
and export were treated as normal basis and effectively increase economy potentials in Indonesia (Budiono et al,  
(2020); (2020); Rajagukguk et al, (2020)). Global products and materials were traded and being used frequently in

The partial analysis shows that the results of the t-test on the variable Brand Experience and Brand Trust reject the 
null hypothesis and the direction of the positive coefficient. The value of this positive coefficient parameters supports 
to the theory. Every increase in Brand Experience will increase the Brand Loyalty by 0.42. Every increase in Brand 
Trust will increase the Brand Loyalty by 0.60.

5. Conclusion 
The research has been carried out, with an aim of answering the problem and solving the hypothesis that existed. 
Based on the results and discussion that has been done can be concluded that, Brand Experience has a significantly 
positive effect on Brand Loyalty. Brand Trust has a significantly positive effect on Brand Loyalty. 
 
First, Adidas must pay attention to and improve the independent variable brand experience variable that can be given 
to the consumers. By improving existing technology for the products, into something more unique and attractive, 
allowing it to be felt by consumers, for its good sensation and comfort, will affect the behavioral conduct, done by the 
consumers. Through the uniqueness and value that Adidas bring to it consumers, it will trigger them to feel, to 
recognize and to act for what they get, for what they experienced. 
 
Second, Adidas company can center on progressing and extending in terms of innovation, not fair on its creation of 
items, but they must start to investigate and extend in terms of advanced promoting by communicating through 
different web media in maximizing conveyance channels that lead to the Adidas item itself. There were many 
competitors with their own value and specializations, and based on the background, Adidas have quite much 
competitors, therefore Adidas needs to innovates to make its brand more recognizable with its specialization and 
therefore gives an outstanding experience followed by satisfaction and trust for its products which causing loyalty.

Abstract 
 
Sustainability is one of the major aspects to enhance the economy and standard of living of a country. Moreover, the 
essential services and infrastructure facilities of a country procured through a Public Procurement Process (PP Process) 
directly affect the economy and standards of living of the country. Further, the improvement of services and 
infrastructure facilities direct links with the construction industry of a country. However, development partners and 
funding agencies pointed out that sustainability is a lagging area in the construction industry when compared with 
other industries in developing countries. Consequently, integration of sustainability factors into the PP Process 
proposed as one of the effective solutions to upgrade the existing PP Process. Hence, this paper aims to identify and 
verify the sustainability factors to be integrated into the PP Process in construction industry. Accordingly, 72 
sustainability factors identified through a comprehensive literature review were further summarised into 15 key 
sustainability factors through a desk study. Subsequently, 14 semi-structured interviews were conducted with subject 
matter experts to verify the applicability of the identified sustainability factors into the PP Process. The paper outcomes 
will be beneficial to the relevant authorities, funding agencies and policymakers to upgrade the existing PP Process in 
construction in developing countries.

1. Introduction  
Enhancements of the Public Procurement Process (PP Process) contributes to the economic development of a country 
(Sönnichsen & Clement, 2020). Further, World Bank (2016) has mentioned that contemporary versions of the PP 
Process facilitate to upgrade the living standards of the community. Thus, the PP Process should be upgraded to 
achieve the desired goals of an organisation or a country by considering, not only the traditional elements of time, cost 
and quality but also the social, environmental, and economic elements of a country (Meehan and Bryde, 2010). The 
construction industry is an open system and very sensitive to change, along with the needs and requirements of the 
stakeholders (Sönnichsen & Clement, 2020). Interagency Procurement Working Group (2006) motivated practitioners 
and researchers to identify the possibilities to incorporate sustainability into the PP Process in the construction industry 
to ensure sustainable development of developing countries. Accordingly, Grandia and Voncken (2019) highlighted

stakeholders relevant to efficient and cyclical functioning of an e-commerce based supermarket supply chain for timely 
delivery of consumer goods ordered online through digital platforms. Through the use of open modelling tools the 
interaction between various member stakeholders of any e-commerce supply chain can be presented easily for both 
supply and demand side. The actor or stakeholder entity based dependency models provide an interactive 
representation of key operational and financial activities performed by major stakeholders in the supply chain 
supported over cloud based network. The internal requirements of each stakeholder along with external dependencies 
is presented through multiple hybrid SD-SR diagrams for these major actors in the supply chain network. These 
representations provide an insight into the functioning of online supermarket stores in emerging markets in South Asia 
with its services hosted on a global cloud platform. The operations of all member stakeholders can be integrated and 
streamlined by real time information exchanged over cloud, thus aiding in demand based Inventory management. The 
rural economy can be also supported by inclusion of village agricultural markets acting as suppliers of perishable food 
products.

1. Introduction  
With the advent of Information and communication technologies a new culture of ordering consumer goods online 
to be delivered at your doorstep has come into existence rather than visiting a supermarket store in person and bearing 
additional costs every time (Wu et. al 2019). The same supermarkets have now come up with either web based or 
application-based service platform to facilitate online ordering by customers and scheduling delivery of those ordered 
goods based on their time preferences.  
 
These supermarkets now function using their own e-commerce websites accessible by consumer's digital devices 
such as desktop or smartphones. The supply chain network which acts to bring consumer goods from supplier units 
and warehouses to your doorstep in a co--ordinated manner includes a whole group of actors. It comprises of large 
manufacturers and suppliers who deliver finished consumer goods which in turn are procured by supermarket stores 
at their distribution centers, logistics (storage, packaging and transport) services providers (either supermarket owned 
or third party) for transit of procured/supplied consumer goods from/to distribution centers and local storage 
stations/warehouses to be subsequently delivered to consumer households (Vallandingham et. al 2018, Wu et. al 
2019). 
 
Also, in cases where fresh and perishable food products are to be delivered there are local vendors /supply and 
delivery agents  for picking up such food products from village/town markets. The same vendors ensure either 
vehicular or in person delivery of all kinds of consumer products to city as well as remote town households. In case 
there is a shortage of specific products demanded by consumers, a supplemental quantity of similar products are 
manufactured by supermarket’s production units which are located near their major distribution centers. The raw 
materials required for manufacture of these consumer products are supplied by same entities which supply to large 
manufacturers.

141","made during procurement. The damage due to improper product handling is reduced through in house employee 
supervision while packaging of all kinds of consumer goods. 
 
In case of returned goods (undamaged non-essential products) with validated quality and remaining shelf life, these 
are placed ahead in Inventory of similar type of goods in order to sell them earlier than the remaining newly ordered 
products. Even then if these items are returned the second time, these are bundled with other products at stashed 
prices during sales offer period. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper provides a review of e-commerce solutions strategy deployed in consumer goods industry today but in the 
context of a hypothetical supply chain as our case study presenting cloud integration of online retail services and 
extension of e-commerce services to tier-2 cities and town/village population. 
 
The detailed SD-SR diagrams presented above and block diagrams with layout showing material/personnel movement 
and information flow provide an insight into the functioning of entire supply chain by highlighting the interactions 
and associated responses from different participating actors/stakeholders. It also shows how interactions between one 
set of members affect the relationships and counter actions by another set of members and how selective actions and 
fulfillment of individual or group objectives of a depender element relies on a timely and collaborative response by 
the dependee which in turn results in smooth and continuous operation of the entire supply chain network thereby 
attaining the maximum customer service level objective.  
 
Also a robust and interactive payment system mechanism, role of government departments in facilitating online 
orders and tax payments and use of GPS and RFID for real time product tracking whether in transit or storage paves 
a way for successful utilization of cloud technology which in turn helps in efficient Inventory management at all 
levels leading to customer demand fulfillment by supermarket organizations (dealing mostly in FMCG and edible 
products).  
 
5.1 Scope of Future Work 
A detailed study about different inventory management plans for different storage locations (DC, supply station, local 
warehouses, franchise stores) can be conducted in future for variable demand multi-product handling. Other food 
processing industries (bakery, beverages) situated in remote small city/ town /village areas can also be integrated 
further with the local cloud network of supermarket thereby promoting rural economic activities further and also 
enhancing total number of customers. The type of customers from each City A, B and town C can also be further 
categorized into regular, occasional and elite based on frequency and value of purchases exercised or purchasing 
behavior and based on their demand data, the inventory levels of different products can be optimized and sale offers 
for each separate type of customer can be customized accordingly.  
 
The transportation routes of supply and delivery agents or third party vendors can also be planned and optimized 
daily for better fuel economy and simultaneous reduction in order delivery time which can significantly improve net 
profit margin due to reduced costs and increased sales for supermarket and other contributing stakeholders..

Abstract  
 
This article aims to generate a model to automatically detect the learning styles of university students from 
their personal, academic data and use of mobile applications. The methodological design consists of 
collecting data from the students and their learning styles based on the proposal of Felder and Soloman. 
Next, a machine learning process generates a predictive model; R and RapidMiner are used for this analysis. 
A convenience sample was taken of students from the engineering and business areas. A mobile application 
was developed to obtain data in class. The study results are a model with a reduced number of questions 
that detect students' learning styles and make recommendations to teachers and managers to improve 
learning outcomes; this prediction enables rapid adjustment of teaching methods in a hybrid work 
environment.

Abstract  
 
This study aims to analyze from the comments of the Chilean media how the use of social network sites 
(SNS) is conceived in the elderly. We used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to generate a model that 
categorizes the media opinions about more senior people and SNS to analyze Twitter data.  The proposal 
was that there are stereotypes about the relationship between the elderly and SNS (for example, the elderly 
use SNS to be close to relatives, the elderly do not use SNS to start a business, among others) and that 
stereotypes are a cultural barrier to face the problem of heterogeneity in the use of these platforms. The data 
used in this study is twitter data taken is Twitter data from the official Twitter accounts of Chilean media 
between 2016 and 2020. In general, the steps of this study were 1) retrieve Twitter data using Twitter API; 
2) data pre-processing, including basic cleaning, normalization, stemming, and stopword removal; 3) 
development of the LDA model, this step includes the search for the optimal number of topics; 4) 
interpretation of the model result. The result of the analysis LDA of the Chilean media tweets will be 
compared with a future survey on the motivations for using that we will carry out with Chilean elderly SNS 
users.

Abstract 
 
Sustainability is one of the most important issues nowadays. The University of Indonesia (UI) created UI 
GreenMetric in 2010 as a result of the necessary researches on what is done in terms of sustainability in 
universities and what can be done on the university basis. In UI GreenMetric, universities can see their 
positions in the whole world by which criteria they can work on sustainability. The UI GreenMetric criteria 
helped universities to measure their sustainability in economic, social and education dimensions. 
Universities have measured their sustainability in six different areas (setting and infrastructure, energy and 
climate change, waste, water, transportation, and education. Universities that are greener and more 
conscious, giving importance to waste, water and education are ranked higher. In this study, this problem 
that includes conflicting criteria and alternatives (universities) is considered as a multi-criteria decision 
making (MCDM) problem. To solve this problem, two MCDM methods namely, Entropy Weight and 
COPRAS (Complex Proportional Assessment) methods, are applied to weight the criteria and to rank the 
universities, respectively. Obtained ranking is compared with the current ranking and the suggestions have 
been made.   
 
Keywords

1. Introduction 
In today's world, which is globalized and equipped with knowledge, universities have set students the goal of providing 
information on a wide variety of subjects and developing them through research, and aim to achieve success in their 
own social and economic field. By doing this, it enabled students to improve their social life and meet their technical 
knowledge needs. All these charts show many university rankings (Academic Ranking of World Universities, Global 
University Rankings, Performance Rankings, and Scientific Articles for World Universities, among others). The 
purpose of these rankings is to evaluate the academic, social and cultural performances of universities among 
themselves. In our life where everything flows so fast, our resources are about to run out. Years without water, food, 
and dirty air await humanity. Everything that can be done for our future depends on the present. If we want to leave a 
clean world to future generations, we need to take action today. For this, universities have a lot of responsibility. UI 
GreenMetric is a ranking of universities in the world that are planned on sustainability-based concepts of environment, 
economy and equity. Thanks to UI GreenMetric, sustainability studies have started at universities. The concept of 
sustainability has increased in importance in the last 20-30 years and has been constantly changing every time (Gok 
and Yigit, 2017; Kayapinar Kaya et al. 2019).

When the table above is examined, the rankings for the top 10 universities are similar, there are not many deviations. 
The TOPSIS method weighted by EWM has a significantly different ranking compared to other methods and weights. 
METU and ITU universities ranked first in the second place in all measurements. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Sustainability studies in universities are measured by a university ranking named UI GreenMetric. UI GreenMetric 
examines the sustainability activities of the universities and it help to universities about sustainability. Universities 
have measured their own sustainability in six different areas. Universities that are greener and more conscious, giving 
importance to waste, water and education are ranked higher. In this study, Turkey GreenMetric of 2020 data is 
analyzed and the problem is considered as a MCDM problem. To overcome this MCDM problem, Entropy Weight 
and COPRAS methods are applied to weight the six criteria and rank the 56 Turkish universities. To provide an 
alternative rank, TOPSIS approach is also applied. According to the results the most important and unimportant criteria 
for Turkey, are determined as Water and Setting and Infrastructure, respectively. When the universities are ranked 
using COPRAS and TOPSIS methods, Istanbul Technical University and Middle East Technical University are still 
placed as top two universities as in UI GreenMetric ranking. For future, (i) different MCDM approaches such as 
analytic hierarchical process and the analytic network process can be applied to consider expert opinion, and (ii) fuzzy 
approaches should be considered to reflect the uncertainty of experts’ opinion in connection with the first suggestion.

Abstract  
 
Value Engineering (VE) is the systematic approach to improving the value of a product or service. In this study, the 
authors applied the principles of VE during the design stage of Heating, Ventilating, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) 
systems using the VE job plan. The objective was to select the appropriate HVAC equipment for a project to satisfy 
the basic and needed secondary functions at a minimum cost. Different combinations of various HVAC equipment 
were generated and evaluated in terms of initial and operating costs. The type of HVAC system used is the Direct-
Expansion (DX) Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) system. These are one (1) AHU, 5 Ceiling Concealed with 2 Pre-
Coolers, 6 Floor Standing with 7 Energy Recovery Ventilators (ERV), 5 Ceiling Concealed with 7 ERVs, and 8 
Ceiling Cassette with 7 ERVs, to meet the required thermodynamic properties of the room. From the formulated 
options, it showed that the 6 Floor standing ACs with 7 ERVs at ₱69,665,391 would meet the said functions and 
deliver it at a minimum cost for an equipment life span of 10 years. However, even though the operating cost were 
considered during the selection of the equipment. The options presented should include maintenance, duct initial costs, 
and varying energy consumption.

1. Introduction  
The Heating, Ventilating and Airconditioning (HVAC) system of a typical building office accounts for approximately 
more than 40% of the building’s total energy consumption (Alptekin, 2019). Hence, highly efficient and low operating 
cost HVAC equipment are highly sought in residential and commercial infrastructures. Different HVAC 
manufacturers were relentlessly seeking a new technology that would offer the best comfort cooling and highly 
efficient low operating cost equipment. This is usually done through in-depth research and development in the field 
of HVAC. However, another way of achieving this is through conducting value engineering (VE) during the design 
stage of the HVAC system. A VE should be conducted before committing funds approval of systems, services, or 
design (Atabay & Galipogullari, 2013). 
 
In this study, the authors aimed to meet the HVAC requirements of the project by improving the function and reducing 
the operating and initial cost of the air-conditioning (AC) system using VE. VE is a systematic method of improving 
the value of a product or service that the project produces (Roseke, 2020). Numerous articles and researches about 
value engineering and analysis were published. Fermilab, (2008) presented studies regarding the value engineering 
techniques in the HVAC systems. Brahmane et al., (2020) showed how the implementation of value engineering in 
construction could be utilized to reduce the time of the project. In his study, he presented the steps on how value 
engineering can be done to achieve a lesser duration of the completion of projects. This study explained how the 
principles of the VE could be applied in construction projects. Therefore, the utilization of VE in an engineering 
project could potentially reduce the overall cost without sacrificing the functions. 
 
To ensure that the needed cost and importance of the clients on an AC system would be provided. The different value 
engineering techniques would be applied during the design stage and up to the equipment selection for the AC system 
of the project. The design and materials used to create the AC equipment such as the evaporator, condenser, 
compressor, and expansion valve and the application of the VE regarding the construction and installation of the AC 
system are not within the scope of this paper. Thus, this paper proposed steps and only discussed the VE in the 
equipment selection by evaluating the initial and operating cost of the AC equipment such as the air handling units

Abstract  
 
Toys are an important part of children life and also for their parents. In Indian, toys are also connected with culture 
and festivals, but Indian toys industries have failed to establish themselves not only globally but also locally. This 
paper focuses on Indian toy industries, which are ignored previously, and now the Indian government has taken 
multiple initiatives to boost this sector's scale. So this paper addresses the issue of the Indian toy industry with its 
solution. The current paper will address the problems of the Indian toys industry and propose solutions to those 
problems. The research is based on the field visit performed by the authors. During the visit, some interviews of toy 
manufacturers were performed, which helps to identify the problems related to the toy industry. This problem helps 
us understand why the toys industry fails in India and guide us to propose solutions for the respected issues. The data 
collection was done in India's Delhi/ NCR region, which holds the major stakeholders of the Indian toy industries. 
After the data collection, the experts' team has proposed solutions. The findings of the paper suggest that India has a 
great potential to become a world leader in the field of toys manufacturing, but lacking due to government policies, 
fewer skills, high-cost technology, less variety etc. 
 
Keywords 
Industrial Solutions, Innovation, Design. 
 
1. Introduction 
Toys are essential elements of children life, and plays a role to nurture and mould them. Toys are for entertainment in 
India and relate children to its ancient culture and traditions of festivals (Toy history, n.d.). Toys come in various 
shapes and sizes, such as animals, birds, cars, etc. They also represent gods. In India, the production methods of 
traditional toys are highly rich and diverse. Use various materials such as clay, wood, paper, plastic, leather, etc. 
Manufacturing and development of toys (India's Toy Story - An Overview, n.d.). Indian parents like it as an important 
way to educate and develop learning skills while playing with toys. Traditional toys mainly have a dual purpose. They 
are the first choice of children as a toy and a nice decoration for adults. Popular toy items are dolls, various animals, 
birds decorated with beads, buttons, feathers etc. Plastic toys and soft toys account for nearly 80% market share in 
India (Project profile on electronic remote controlled toy, n.d.). In the current scenario, the focus is more on toys due 
to nuclear family, increasing breakdown of both parents going to work, etc.  
 
The process of making toys is as old as human civilization. In the beginning, toys were made from natural materials 
such as stones, sticks and clay. A variety of materials, such as rubber, wood, paper, plastic, leather etc., are used for 
craftsmanship in the modern era. Toys unearthed in the Indus Valley Civilization (3001,500 BC) include a small cart, 
a bird-shaped whistle, and a toy monkey that could slide along a rope (India's Toy Story - An Overview, n.d.). Still, 
the toy industry was largely ignored in the past, which led to their massive business failure in India. The Indian 
government is undertaking many initiatives to promote and develop the toy industry in several ways. These initiatives 
lead academicians like us to form a panel to address the issues of this sector followed by the proposed solutions to 
those issues. 
 
The panel held a meeting regarding selecting disciplines within the selected group and allocating work to complete 
the task in an organized manner within the allotted time. Other panel members reached out to arrange meetings with 
the industry to gain practical insight into the area. The panel planned a visit to several industries in a particular cluster 
in response to industry responses. The committee prepared a questionnaire (subjective and objective) and several

178","4. Proposed Solutions for toy industries problems 
Most of the toy manufacturing industry is made up of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and small industries 
(SSI). Until 2001, the production of toys was only allowed within the framework of SSI. Non-SSI units are only 
allowed to manufacture toys under specific conditions. In response to China's aggression on the Indian toy market, the 
Indian government has taken many decisive steps to create growth potential in line with the spirit of Atmanirbhar 
Bharat. With this great initiative, the national design and production base is to come together to ensure the availability 
of different kinds of toys according to different age groups and their designs based on the characteristics and culture 
of India. Apart from the government actions, following solutions are proposed for the problems of toy industries: 
 
4.1 Labour cost as a beneficiary tool 
Labour cost is low in India, and it could be a great opportunity for Indians to use this a beneficiary tool. China did this 
multiple decades ago, and get the success in manufacturing sector. Now, some other countries such as Taiwan and 
Indonesia are doing this, which is shifting the market from China to these country. So, we also have to identify this 
potential, and use this to solve the problems of toys industry and strengthen it. 
 
4.2 Labour Empowerment 
After establishing the labour intensive toy industry, it is necessary to focus on the labour empowerment. Otherwise, 
the labour can be a beneficiary tool on the permanent basis, and success of establishing the toy industry based on 
labour cost will be temporary. 
 
4.3 Skill development 
The toy industry is lacking due to less skills in the field of designing, and mould making. So, there is a huge scope in 
the various fields associated with technology. Skill development program can lead to the low cost technology, and 
further lead to the massive change in toys industry through toy varieties. 
 
4.4 Centralization of toys industry 
Centralization of toys industry will lead to the awareness, uniform regularities, and smooth functioning for various 
small scale toys enterprises. It will also help to generalize the taxation system, and will boost the financial association 
related to the toys sector. 
 
4.5 Investing in research and development 
Research and development is the most important part for the growth of any industry. Developed countries used this 
as the most effective tool for their growth. This will help to introduce the low cost technology, and will help industries 
to boost the sector on rapid scale. Similarly, research and development will also enhance the innovation within the 
industry and will create a healthy competitive environment. This healthy competitive environment will further lead 
industries to deliver new products which are green and sustainable. 
 
5. Conclusions 
The team's visit explored several angles of the problem facing the Indian toy industry, including the design and 
innovation challenges faced by the supply chain management of the toy industry. While various issues were explained 
in the previous section of the paper, many more still need to be explored. Initially, the manufacturers were reluctant 
to talk about the lack of government support in their opinion, but they were open and talked about the possible inputs 
/ results of the government agencies concerned. After the visit, the team reported that design and innovation is an 
important part of this industry, which can lead to field scale. Visit also explores the loopholes in various government 
industry support programs, including a corporate finance affiliate that is only given to people who buy things by 
lending and not with their own capital. Likewise, fairs that promote this industry by the government are also not 
appreciated (the media do not promote, their stands are not well recognized, people under 18 are prohibited from 
entering. , etc.).  
In this way, they opened up to the following possible government outcomes-  
• 
Research and development in this area needs more attention than ever before.  
• 
There is a shortage of skilled workers, so skills development programs for this sector are very important.  
• 
Design is a major issue for these industries, particularly in terms of cost and competence. It is therefore 
necessary to focus more on qualified designers, which will make the design part more efficient in the field.  
• 
Innovation can be a better solution to material and process problems.

183","• 
Policies related to financial aid should be more flexible and easier to use.  
• 
The Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) uses globally perceived parameters, which are not always consistent 
with India's point of view, forcing manufacturers to use a more opaque process in managing the supply chain.  
• 
BIS should be applied to all types of toys, including imported toys, exported toys and domestically produced 
toys.  
• 
The toy industry is very disorganized, so a more centralized operation is needed.  
• 
Raw materials supplied by Indian companies should be more competitive in terms of cost or quality, or both, 
as this directly affects the cost and quality of the product (toys).  
• 
There are many electric toys by Indian companies pushing China to give more power to the sector.  
 
Finally, government initiatives delight manufacturers, we have found them visiting the industry. The team reported 
that manufacturers are excited about many government plans that have initiated the quantum leap for the field. 
However, it is far away and it will take some time to move the pitch forward.

Abstract 
 
In this paper, a simple methodology to obtain a reliability model for time-dependent strength is discussed. A 
conditional probability density function was evaluated considering the strength follows normal distribution with 
changing mean and variance over time. The methodology was developed taking into account the nonlinear degradation 
of strength over time. The maximum likelihood estimation method was used along with Jaya algorithm to estimate 
the model parameters. The life prediction is based on the probability that the minimum strength is less than the 
predetermined failure threshold.  The proposed methodology was applied to data of solder strengths in automotive 
circuits. It was found that the proposed model gives promising results with faster compilation time.

1. Introduction 
Reliability is defined as the probability that a component or a product will perform its functions under given conditions 
for a specific period. In today’s world, a customer is seeking products that are reliable and safe. Also, with increasing 
developments in the sectors of transportation, infrastructure, energy generation, etc there is a need for robust design 
in these areas taking into account the uncertainties present in nature. Reliability studies consider these uncertainties 
of nature giving a rigid and dependable analysis. Thus studies on reliability modeling are given much importance in 
recent times(Kapur & Pecht, 2014; Prabhu Gaonkar et al., 2011; S. S. Rao, 2016). It is a known fact that reliability 
does not remain constant and decreases over a period of time as a result of degradation(Eryilmaz, 2013; Wu et al., 
2011; Zhang & Zhao, 2017). Alternatively, it can be said that reliability decreases over a number of cycles in case of 
fatigue stress(D’Anna et al., 2017; Menan et al., 2015; Min et al., 1995; Sudret et al., 2003). Fatigue stress is a type 
of loading in which there are repetitive or cyclic loads acting on a material for a period of time. Over a large number 
of loading cycles, the materials tend to fail at a stress level much lesser than the strength of that material. This is known 
as failure due to material fatigue. Several major accidents that can be remembered in history are as a result of fatigue 
failure and natural uncertainties(Lewis, 2010; Salam et al., 1998). These accidents could have been prevented by 
robust and reliable design. Thus, failure prediction and modeling is an important aspect in material design. A lot of 
studies have been carried out in assessing the dynamic reliability of components under various load conditions. Also, 
we are aware that automobile systems are exposed to severe environmental conditions during their lifetime. The 
automotive electronic circuits face the problem of shearing of solder joints over a period of time or over the distance 
traveled. In this paper, a simple method is exhibited for evaluating time-dependent reliability by degradation modeling 
using Jaya algorithm which is a recent metaheuristic technique of optimization. The above methodology has been 
applied to a data of solder strength of automotive circuits to show its effectiveness. A plot for reliability vs time has 
been obtained in order to see the failure behavior of the components over a period of time and a plot for the

The plot for reliability vs mileage is shown in Figure 5. The reliability starts decreasing significantly after around

reliability in the existing literature may be overestimated.

5. Conclusion 
In this study, a methodology has been proposed for evaluating the time-dependent reliability of a component subjected 
to deterministic stress. A nonlinear model for the mean and linear model for standard deviation has been considered. 
The maximum likelihood estimation via Jaya algorithm has been used to obtain the estimates of the parameters. The 
method has been applied to the shear strength data of automotive circuits and a plot for reliability vs time has been 
obtained. It has been observed that the proposed methodology is simple, fast and gives very good results.

Abstract 
 
A fast and efficient method to discriminate failure modes from maintenance work orders will facilitate and 
motivate proactive maintenance development. This paper aims to propose a faster and as efficient clustering 
methodology that differs from previous text mining attempts. Text mining attempts are very dependent on 
correctly classifying text but the method proposed here is text independent. It is based on time to repair (TTR), 
time before failure (TBF) and other available identifiers. Using K-means as the clustering algorithm, the 
processing speed was greatly reduced. Singularity of discriminated failure modes were as good as previous text 
mining attempts.

1. Introduction 
Buildings are complex systems encompassing many different systems including structural, electrical, mechanical, 
safety, security, information and communication systems. These systems are installed to facilitate the business 
and social functions that occurs in buildings (Bortolini and Forcada 2020). To ensure that these building systems 
are always available for use, it is imperative that building systems are maintained.  
 
In reality, (Labib et al. 1998) states that maintenance managers tend to be efficient before being effective. Efficient 
is reacting to failures with the least amount of waste in time and effort. Effectiveness is achieved by removing 
future failures. A failure is an unintended event where the unintended outcomes are known as failure modes 
(Parrott et al. 2011). Therefore, to eliminate failures, there is a need to identify the failure modes and assign 
appropriate proactive tasks. The expectation is that the failure modes and their corresponding preventative tasks 
are known by the designers and constructors of buildings. It is then expected that this information is made available 
to maintenance managers by the constructors. However, this transfer of information is not an industry mainstream 
activity (Abdullah et al. 2019). 
 
Failing to have expected failure modes and preventative tasks, maintenance managers would have to plan 
preventative tasks based on experience and knowledge while monitoring for newly occurring failure modes that 
were not experienced before. These failure modes are recorded as work order descriptions in maintenance work 
orders whenever a failure event happens. The information recorded in work orders are shown in Table 1 (Yang et 
al. 2018).

failure prevention by both its frequency and severity (Knights, P.F. 2001 and Seecharan et al. 2018).

5. Conclusion 
In terms of processing speed, the results show greatly higher speeds as compared to previous text mining processes 
(Salo et al. 2018). However, clustering of work orders by their TTR and TBF is not a perfect solution for 
discriminating failure modes from work orders. The results were not all singular and similar. Exceptions still exist 
as in other methods (Lin and Richi 2007). However, if for every cluster, results generally are not more than 3 
different failure modes, as is seen in this clustering attempt, then the complexity of identifying failure modes have 
been simplified.  
 
The results however could be more singular and finer if more identifiers were available. It is proposed that future 
attempts add more identifiers such as asset numbers, part numbers, asset categories and others if available. 
Location and trade labelling could also be more granular. Having these nouns as discriminators, will further 
individualize the failure modes. In future, these clusters could be coded as failure codes that can be used by 
maintenance departments to tag future work orders. This would aid in making proactive and priority decisions. 
 
Added to this, is the recognition that each failure mode in a cluster have similar risks. Risks here being defined as 
the product of duration and frequency. Therefore, in terms of resource costs, discriminating by TTR and TBF has 
the added benefit of proactive task planning being prioritized by risks.

Abstract  
 
According to the United Nations and their Human Settlements Program, 7.000 to 10.000 million tons of waste are 
produced every year in all the world causing a huge air, water and ground pollution. In Cuenca, Ecuador, waste 
management is carried out by the Cuenca Municipal Public Cleaning Company, which indicates that there is a lack of 
recycling culture of the citizens due to ignorance about classification and separation of waste. Therefore, it is proposed 
a user-centered mobile application adoption as an alternative solution to separate waste properly, considering Design 
Thinking and Technology Acceptance Model. The findings of the study suggest that the app needs to be simple, 
intuitive, attractive and made up of classification, education and use. Moreover, the study shows that the attitude of 
users about this app influences the intention to use it and also that the social image within Cuenca influences the 
perceived ease of use of it.

1. Introduction 
In all the world, 7.000 and 10.000 millions tons of waste are produced every year causing a huge air, water and ground 
pollution (United Nations, 2019) as a consequence of environmental pollution and the efforts to achieve goal 12.5, set 
by the UN in the Sustainable Development Goals, which indicates that “By 2030, substantially reduce waste 
generation through prevention, reduction, recycling and reuse” (United Nations, n.d) many countries have managed 
to take measures and in many cases information technologies (IT) have been used as a mean to improve recycling 
according to the needs of each country, region and community. In Cuenca, Ecuador, since 2010, a recycling system 
was introduced by the Municipal Public Cleaning Company of Cuenca (EMAC EP). Nevertheless, in 2018, Galo 
Vasquez, landfill Technician mentioned that, in practice, there is a low performance in waste separation by the citizens 
(Aguilar, 2018).  
 
The purpose of this research is based on the development of a mobile application as a waste classification tool focus 
on the citizens’ needs. For that reason, Design Thinking (DT) is used, due to it places the developer as another user, 
allowing to understand the needs, desires, thoughts and dreams of users, and also helps to obtain ideas that catch target 
market attention (Costa Valentim et al., 2017). In order to complement the results obtained from Design Thinking, the 
servuction model is used, because it offers a set of steps and tools necessary to create, provide and manage an adequate, 
successful, quality service. 
 
The demand for the application is not predictable and can be completely random, as it will depend on the knowledge 
that users have about the classification of waste, regardless of their age, gender, ethnicity, among others. For this 
reason, the research relies on the Technological Acceptance Model (TAM), proposed by Davis, to understand how 
users accept and use a certain new technology (Davis et al., 1989).  
 
2. Literature Review  
Today, mobile applications serve important functions, Vetterli et al. (2013) mention that users look for mobile 
applications capable of integrating into their behavior and daily life. For this reason, Apps must be flexible, agile and 
above all, have a very strong orientation towards what the client wants. Several definitions of Design Thinking have

203","2010 (INEC, 2010), the 62,9% of citizens in Azuay use a cellphone, which show us that the implementation of a 
mobile application is worthwhile, due to mass use of information technologies. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The results obtained in the servuction framework and the Design Thinking methodology made it possible to clearly 
define that the mobile application must resolve doubts about waste classification, contain environmental information, 
include advice on how to reuse materials, educate users and have a section on activism. Similarly, it is recognized that 
the main characteristics that citizens want in the mobile application are clarity, simplicity and quality. There are 
significant statistical values that indicate that the social image in the target market influences the perception of ease 
of use of the mobile application; and that the attitude of use with which users use the application influences the 
intention to use it. Therefore, it is important to establish promotion strategies emphasizing the importance of 
contributing to the care of the environment and its benefits. The mobile application initially proposed will have only 
three main functions (answering classification doubts, educating and advice on reuse of materials), which have been 
the most requested by the respondents, in order to avoid information overload. In addition, the design will include the 
most common characteristics of mobile applications, the recommendations and suggestions provided in the DT; thus, 
generating a mobile application focused on users.

Abstract 
 
Diagnosis and detection of mechanical fault in an internal combustion engine at the end of line engine testing is 
very crucial to deliver customer a defect free healthy engine. Currently engine testing operator uses his subjective 
hearing expertise to diagnose and detect any abnormal noise coming out from the engine. Subjective engine testing 
leads to continuous noise exposure to operators, possibilities of defective engine go to customer due to hearing 
fatigue of the operator, there are few abnormal noises which are beyond human perception which sometime 
manifest itself when it is loaded on the vehicle and in few cases, there is bias among the operators’ perceptions as 
the testing is subjective in nature. More over operators needs rigorous training to become an expert of engine noise 
testing. The theme of the project is to convert the subjective engine testing to objective engine testing by 
developing an engine vibration measurement system and deploy a machine learning algorithm model which can 
detect the faulty engine and also diagnose the type of fault (Head noise, Gear damage, Whining noise etc.) in the 
engine with less or no manual intervention. The vibration measuring system consist of three unidirectional 
accelerometer sensors with magnetic mounting base which can be mounted on the three different locations of the 
engine. Vibration data is captured by a vibration analyzer hardware at three different engine speeds. Statistical 
method is used to extract the time domain and frequency domain features data and feature ranking method is used 
to reduce the dimensionality of the features. We have collected more than 550 engines vibration data combination 
of both healthy engines as well as 5 types of typical faulty engines occurred at the production line including 
operator’s remark. Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR) model is used to separate the faulty engines from 
the healthy engine and it will also rate the engine health on a scale of 1 to 10 where 10 stands for excellent and 
smooth engine and 1 stands for severely faulty engine. Random Forest (RF) model is used to classify the type of 
fault in the engine. We have conducted a blind test with a set of healthy and faulty engines, we have achieved 
overall accuracy of 83.7% with true positive rate of 94 % and false positive rate of 25% for the health index model. 
Engine diagnostic model yields an overall accuracy of 75.9%.

1. Introduction 
Engine is the most important component of any vehicle and maintaining its quality standard is the top most 
requirement for any automobile industries. Too much attentions are given for engine testing and inspection before 
the engine is sent to vehicle assembly. Diagnosis of engine fault and pin point of the defect in the produced engine 
at the end of assembly line engine testing is highly crucial to meet the quality standard and to ensure no defective 
engines reach to customer. There are various instances in the assembly process which leads to engine fault which 
includes wrong assembly of component, assembling of defective parts and components etc. In TVS Motor 
Company all the produced engines have to go through different engine testing process it includes engine leak 
testing, engine noise checking and visual inspection for scratches, part missing etc. Engine noise testing is one of 
the important process where structural related defects like gear damage, valve bending, Cam shaft damage etc. can 
be diagnose. Most of the manufacturing and assembly process related fault manifest itself through noise, abnormal 
noise from the engine would reduce the reliability of the engine in long run. Conventional engine noise testing 
method is totally based on subjective experience of the testing operators. Operator has to gone through rigorous 
training to become a competent noise tester. At the end of the assembly line each and every engine is loaded on an 
engine test rig where all the required electrical and fuel connection are given and the engine is started for the first 
time. Operator has to carefully listen the engine noise at different speed for any abnormality and has to certify the 
engine quality.  Subjective engine testing has its own difficulties. In some engine cases, we found that there is

4.3 Engine Fault Diagnosis Model 
After the health index model has calculated the health index of the engine and if the engine reported faulty by 
health index model (health index less than 6) then the engine data is again analyzed with the fault diagnostic 
model. The idea of the fault diagnosis model is to diagnose the type fault the engine has. For development of this 
model, we have collected more than 500 engine data combination of 5 types of typical engine fault and train the 
model. We have used random forest algorithm to classify the engine fault. Random forest is a classification 
model consists of decision trees. Decision tree is a statistical method used for classification task which be teach 
with training data set. The developed model able to classify the faults with an overall accuracy of 75.9%.

5. Conclusion 
In this paper we have addressed the one of the major challenges of the automotive industry to objectify the engine 
end of line testing with a modern vibration data acquisition system and machine learning algorithm. For our 
application we have used vibration sensor instead of acoustic sensor to get rid of the noise interference from 
neighbor machines. We have found vibration data also yield satisfactory in terms of separating the faulty engine 
from good engine. We have developed industry compatible system architecture to capture the vibration data and 
analyzed the data using modern machine learning tools. We have acquired the vibration data from three vibration

where fault can be detect. We have used statistical methods to calculate the features value from the raw vibration 
signal. Standard features selection tools fisher’s criterion and wrapper method used to shortlist the features which 
gives optimum accuracy by the machine learning algorithm. We have developed two machine learning model first 
health index model based on auto associative kernel regression algorithm which compute engine health on a scale 
of 1-10, where 10 stands for excellent and smooth engine and 1 stands for severely faulty engine. Second, we have 
developed diagnostic model based on random forest algorithm which classify the engine fault if the engine is 
reported faulty by health index model. We have conducted a blind test with a set of healthy and faulty engines, we 
have achieved overall accuracy of 83.7% with true positive rate of 94 % and false positive rate of 25% for the 
health index model. Engine diagnostic model yields an overall accuracy of 75.9%

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this paper is to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the energy sector. With 
the widespread closures of business and decrease in travels due to the pandemic, there have been significant 
falls in electricity, coal, gas, and nuclear power consumption. Disruptions in manufacturing facilities and 
pauses on construction projects bring uncertainty about energy growth in 2021. In the past, similar drops in 
emissions occurred such as the global financial crisis of 2008 but resulted in a rebound of global CO2 
emissions when the market recovered. However, the pandemic brings forth unique risks and uncertainties 
for industries and governments in having to balance safety with progress. For this COVID-19 related 
recession, governments have the chance to pivot energy consumption by incentivizing renewable energy 
sectors like wind, solar, hydrogen, and energy storage that reduce the carbon footprint. Investing in 
renewables could stimulate economic recovery and aid in the transition to a more sustainable future. 
However, we see significant declines in such investments. We investigate how the energy industry was 
affected by and could recover from the challenges set forth by the pandemic and how this recovery could 
incentivize clean energy technologies.

1. Introduction 
As the world has transitioned to working from home, social distancing measures, and meeting virtually instead of 
traveling, the energy sector has experienced significant changes. Demand for fossil fuels has taken a hit due to fewer 
people driving and flying. More people staying home means more homes to power in the most sustainable way 
possible. And perhaps above all, society has undergone a climate reckoning, with governments across the globe 
urgently enacting environmental policies to slow rapidly rising temperatures year after year. Modernizing our energy 
infrastructure will require an incredible amount of research into the economic, social, political, and environmental 
motivations and methods of doing so. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
The objective of this paper is to analyze the effect of COVID-19 on the world’s existing energy infrastructure and the 
resulting acceleration of the development of renewable energy sources. In addition, this paper aims to describe the 
pre-and post-pandemic energy policies and practices of governments around the world. 
 
2. Literature Review 
2.1 Climate Change 
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdowns were imposed across the world that resulted in interesting effects on the 
environment in addition to a reduced spread of the virus (Rumbaugh et al. 2020). Emissions from transport, industrial

226","5. Conclusion 
COVID-19 has presented the world with a unique opportunity. It has forced change that once seemed out of reach. 
The rapid reduction in emissions has laid the groundwork for transitions to occur in the way we use energy. However, 
it is unfeasible to expect energy reductions to last as the virus’s prevalence fades and people return to their “normal” 
lives. Travel will become popular again, and businesses will be able to handle a greater capacity. Due to oil and coal’s 
current low prices, there is a strong chance that we will increase our dependency on them over renewable energy 
sources.  
 
In 2008, the financial crisis resulted in greenhouse gas emission reductions of 1%, but it was short-lived. By 2010, 
carbon emissions grew 5.1%, reaching a record high (Le Quéré et al. 2020). This was the result of both the economy 
naturally returning to its previous state as well as government stimulation of the oil and gas economy. Because climate 
change is a slow process, the effects are not so immediate but pose a serious threat to human health and life as we 
know it. Yet, if we use this base of emission reductions to shift to an increase in renewable energy use and low carbon 
infrastructure, we may be able to have a greater positive impact, both environmentally and economically. As the 
economy rebuilds itself in the wake of COVID-19, increasing investment in renewable energy can increase 
employment, stimulate the economy, and, of course, lower carbon emissions. The COVID-19 global crisis resulted in 
a rapid response from the government, showing us that it is possible to induce a rapid change in a worldwide 
emergency (Khanna 2021). However, this example also solidifies that both policymakers and individual consumers 
will need to commit to the change necessary to curb climate change.  
 
As 2021 progresses, there will be many opportunities to expand upon this research as more COVID-19 pandemic 
impacts take effect. An example of such will be the projected shortage in truck drivers expected to occur this summer, 
potentially having supply chain impacts on many energy sectors such as gasoline (Isidore 2021). Additionally, a 
review of alternations in companies’ risk evaluation procedures due to the COVID-19 pandemic should be studied as 
infrastructure is put in place to avoid hazard risk. In the same vein of consideration should be a further study in 
government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and how these responses to hazard risk affect consumer demand. 
These studies, if conducted over the next year, can further the research of this paper, with the potential to lay indicators 
for future global issues such as climate change.

Abstract  
The goal of this research is to explore solutions to recent shortages in the computer chip supply chain. The COVID-
19 pandemic revealed weakness in the supply chain for computer chips. With more industries needing computer chips 
for their products, particularly the automotive industry, a shortage caused by shutdowns in China after the pandemic 
led to a rise in prices of consumer goods. In this research, we focus on the technicalities of the computer chip supply 
chain to find methods of preventing shortages and improving the overall supply chain to avoid future shortages. This 
is particularly important with the increased dependence on computer chips in products. India has shown success with 
its government incentives to encourage reshoring of computer chip manufacturing, so there is less dependence on 
other countries to obtain chips. It is recommended that the US follow India’s lead and encourage reshoring of computer 
chip manufacturing to reduce the likelihood of shortages in the future.

1. Introduction  
A global shortage of computer chips has driven the cost of several products up and has limited production in industries 
such as automotive. The use of computer chips has become widespread across different industries, with each industry 
attempting to secure its own supply. Automakers only account for 10 percent of the total volume of semiconductors, 
leaving automakers with little leverage to secure chip supplies compared to other industries. Because of this, the 
automotive industry has struggled to obtain chips during the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing production halts and 
factory closures. (Doerfler 2021). The pandemic has highlighted the fragility of the computer chip supply chain and 
the necessity of creating a stable supply chain for the future. The goal of this research is to see how companies can 
best manage their supply chain to maintain a steady supply of computer chips for their products. This research seeks 
to achieve this goal by looking into computer chip technology and the technical aspects of the supply chain, causes of 
the shortage, and methods utilized in other cases to help supply chains adapt to a shortage.  
 
1.1 Objectives  
The research done in this paper can be used to determine how microchips can be readily available in non-vertical 
supply chains. The motivation behind this is to ensure that main sources of waste like waiting and overprocessing do 
not occur due to using outdated microchips that are readily available because the newest versions are not. Also, in the 
technological world of today, everyone relies on each other for some step of the process—and the computer chip 
supply chain has over 1,000 steps just in manufacturing. This paper explains why the shortage is occurring and dives 
deep into how a few countries specifically are impacting the supply chain of computer chips. 
 
2. Literature Review 
2.1 Computer Chip Technology 
Nowadays, it is nearly impossible to get through a day without using some sort of technology, and all modern-day 
technology has a chip embedded in it somewhere. They act as the memory units and processors of information and 
are very tiny integrated circuits, also known as wafers. Computer chips are used in phones, cars, televisions, GPS 
devices, ID cards, and people are even implanting them in their hands to perform tasks around their house, like opening 
a wine cellar or accessing a safe. These tasks can occur due to the nature of how microchips are processed: transistors 
act as mini electrical switches to turn a current on or off (Kohls et al. 2020). Depending on how many microchips are

236","5. Conclusion 
COVID-19 has brought awareness to the necessity of restructuring the US semiconductor supply chain. Offshoring of 
chip fabrication has made the US dependent on other countries for production. During normal times, the offshoring 
of production has been largely beneficial to US fabless companies and IDMs looking to outsource the cost of 
manufacturing to other entities. However, COVID-19-induced supply chain issues caused US shortages in key chips 
necessary for manufacturing everything from cars to laptops. The US is strong in design and R&D but lacks the 
fabrication infrastructure necessary to ensure a steady in-country supply of chips for domestic use.   
 
The US chip shortage has halted production in industries such as automotive, even as demand is at an all-time high. 
As automobiles transfer to be completely autonomous and electric, semiconductors are drastically rising in demand, 
and the country’s supply lines heavily rely on other countries such as Taiwan, Japan, and Europe for semiconductor 
supply. This reliance is detrimental, as any disasters such as COVID-19 or increased tensions with these countries can 
completely halt the supply chain. Chip shortages have also affected the cellular industry as networks upgrade to 5G. 
Chips are necessities for developing the 5G infrastructure cellular providers need to fully roll out 5G across the 
country. In addition, consumer demand for 5G phones and laptops is increasing rapidly, and a steady supply of chips 
is necessary to keep up with this demand (Leprince-Ringuet, 2021). 
 
To ensure a steady future supply of chips, it is recommended that the US Government provide incentives for in-country 
manufacturing and reshoring of production. The US should consider following the lead of countries such as India, 
which use government policies to incentivize computer-chip manufacturers to re-shore and ramp up production. This 
will reduce reliance on other countries, as well as bring more sustainability and regulation to the supply chain and jobs 
back to the states. It is also recommended that the US explore the use of mathematical models to optimize the current 
supply and reduce the frequency of shortages. The research discussed in this paper is not exclusive and is ongoing. 
The state of the semiconductor supply chain is continuously evolving, necessitating further research on best practices 
for maintaining a steady chip supply. Future research is needed on effective government policy for incentivizing in-
country fabrication, in addition to developing methods for diversification of semiconductor supply chains. 
Furthermore, research is needed on the future of IDMs and what they can do to remain competitive with the rise of 
the fabless-foundry model.

Abstract  
 
Extension in bi-polar fuzzy set results in m-Polar fuzzy (mF) set. It is a methodology developed over the years since 
2014. Integrated with various multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques, several hybrid algorithms 
developed to improve the accuracy of the mF set algorithm used for decision making. Algorithms like mF TOPSIS 
and mF ELECTRE-I are widely used algorithms. In this paper, we aim to solve a selection of robots with the mF 
ELECTRE-I method. It is implemented in a stepwise manner and elaborated as an mF ELECTRE-I algorithm.  We 
have collected Robot selection data from a previously published research article. Results obtained using mF 
ELECTRE-I are compared and validated with the same research article. We found that the mF ELECTRE-I method 
is well resulted in getting the rank solution of robot selection. The rank obtained by mF ELECTRE-I is more consistent 
with the original research done for robot selection. Graphically presented results are with outranking relations. We 
can solve a wide range of industry problems starting from pole=1 to available subgroups to implement mF set 
techniques.

1. Introduction  
This research explores applications of mF sets in industrial selection problems and validates results with existing 
techniques. The mF set is a recent technique to solve multi-criteria group decision-making problems. It solves issues 
having uncertainty, multiple subgroups to multiple parameters, multiple parameters, multiple decision-makers, 
multipolar information, or/and limit process. Now day's mF set methodology is used in various selection problems 
where data is vague or linguistic. This research will elaborate scope of implementation of mF ELECTRE-I and 
introduce this methodology to researchers to solve similar types of issues from Industries. For example, the selection 
of robots in the Industry is one of the MCDM problems. In this paper, selected problems from the literature have five 
parameters for selecting robots from seven available robots. As the problem is not having subgroups to the parameters, 
we can consider this as pole=1.

6. Conclusions 
The m-polar Fuzzy ELECTRE-I method solves the industrial robot selection problem. Earlier researchers have solved 
robot selection problems with various MCDM techniques. Rankings of the robot selection problem are well-validated 
with ranks obtained by previous researchers. Directed graphs which explain outranking between robots are the 
advantage of the ELECTRE-I method for the preference ranking of robots. Decision Matrix normalized as WSM, 
WPM, and WASPAS form and in MOORA form shows different elements obtained. In robot selection, the way of 
normalization of the decision matrix affects the final ranking. Results obtained with mF ELECTRE-I are more 
consistent in scale compared with the original research. The current study scope of the application of mFS is broad in 
the Industrial selection of robots. In the future, there is vast scope for mFS ELECTRE-I in group decision-making 
problems.

Abstract 
 
Research about the implementation of the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model is mostly done only for 
implementation in Make-To-Stock (MTS) companies. There has not been much recent research about the 
implementation of the EOQ model to companies that use make-to-order (MTO) business production strategy. 
Therefore, by considering the research gap as well as the need of MTO businesses to reduce their costs, the 
implementation of the EOQ model is applied to PT X, which is an MTO company that produces steel wheel disc. The 
aim of this research is to discover a better order quantity planning method by comparing the holding cost between PT 
X’s production system before and after the implementation of the EOQ model. The results of analysis, calculation, 
and validation of order quantity planning using the EOQ model showed that the implementation of the EOQ model 
for order quantity planning in PT X can reduce the number of losses caused by holding costs. The research is conducted 
assuming the supplier is a make-to-stock producer that is capable of meeting production demand with at most 1 week 
lead time.

1. Introduction 
All businesses have to control their inventory efficiently to operate at an acceptable level. The objectives of inventory 
management are to provide the required level of customer service and to reduce the sum of all costs involved (Arnold 
et al. 2008). They need to prevent stockout and overstock of their supplies to optimize costs incurred by their inventory. 
To achieve these objectives, inventory managers must know how much materials should be ordered at one time and 
when should an order be placed (Bushuev et al. 2015). Several approaches to effective inventory control have been 
researched and implemented especially in the make-to-stock business sector. One of the classic approaches to effective 
inventory control is the optimization of order quantity planning using the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model. Its 
implementation has been researched since 1913 and the model has been continuously improved to be one of the most 
robust models in order quantity planning. However, research about the implementation of the EOQ model is usually 
done only to make-to-stock (MTS) companies. One of the most recent research about implementation of the EOQ 
model to an MTS company is done by Gozali et al. (2020). Another notable research about implementation of the 
EOQ model in an MTS company is done by Jiraruttrakul et al. (2017). The result of the implementation of the EOQ 
model in those research is a reduction in total annual inventory cost of a real MTS company. 
 
There has not been much recent research about the implementation of the EOQ model to companies that use make-to-
order (MTO) business production strategy. The research is also mostly done with different objectives. Based on a 
review of inventory lot sizing papers (Bushuev et al. 2015), there have not been many attempts on using the EOQ 
model to calculate the order quantity of MTO businesses’ raw materials. The survey of lot sizing and scheduling 
practices in Brazilian companies (Tomotani and Mesquita 2017) showed that most MTO businesses prefer the ‘lot-for 
lot’ order quantity decision rule. Despite this, there are a few notable researches about implementation of EOQ model 
in MTO businesses. One of the notable researches is made by Chun-hua and Xue-feng (2010). The researchers adjusted 
the classic EOQ model (Harris 1913) and developed a new, theoretical EOQ model specifically for a single product, 
multi-supplier MTO supply chain. Overall, progress of research about implementation of the EOQ model in MTO 
businesses has been focused only on the development of theoretical models. By comparing the research progress

256","Based on the P-value (asymptotic significance), it is concluded that implementation of the EOQ model significantly 
affects the amount of ending stock as the P-value is below the significance level (5%). It is also concluded that the 
effect of EOQ model implementation is the reduction of ending stock. This conclusion is based on the negative mean 
and median values of the difference between the ending stock before and after the implementation of the EOQ model 
is negative as is shown in Table 4. 
 
6. Conclusion 
With the assumption of not more than one week lead time, we identified economic order quantities of the raw material 
Steel Plate 9 mm that is aligned with PT X's technical constraint of using the MTO business production strategy. The 
results of analysis and calculation of order quantity using the EOQ model showed that the implementation of the EOQ 
model for order quantity planning in PT X can reduce the number of losses caused by holding costs. However, the 
decrease of holding cost also means there is a higher ordering cost. In the case of PT X, the increase experienced by 
ordering costs is not greater than the decrease in the amount of holding costs. Therefore, at the end of the calculation, 
it is concluded that the implementation of the EOQ model for order quantity planning delivered a higher profit. This 
is proven through the validity test using the Wilcoxon One-Sample Test. From the results of the validation test, it is 
proven that the implementation of EOQ reduces the ending stock of PT X which also means a reduction of its holding 
cost and an increase of its profit. Therefore, we can conclude that MTO companies can reduce their inventory cost 
through reducing their holding cost by implementing the EOQ model. 
 
This study was completed with various constraints. The main research constraint is constraint regarding the supplier 
limitations of only being able to do shipment once a month. To make the implementation of EOQ model to MTO 
businesses more practical, it is suggested to do further research about development of an EOQ model that can consider 
this shipment constraint. The research has also identified an opportunity for improvement that can be researched 
further if PT X changes its supplier of raw materials to a supplier that does not have such constraints. Hence, further 
research to improve PT X's inventory management and control can be done by implementing more novel theoretical 
EOQ models.

Abstract  
 
This study aims to implement the Master Production Schedule (MPS) method for the production process at BASF 
Company, especially for Softex 1097-A products. The author conducted an online interview with one of the employees 
at BASF Company regarding information about Production Planning and Inventory Control at BASF Company, which 
includes inventory records, Bill of Materials (BOM), forecast, customer orders, production plans, and capacity. From 
the information obtained, the Softex 1097-A production process was optimized at BASF Company by making a Master 
Production Schedule (MPS). Apart from interviews, the authors also collect literature from books, journals, and 
research related to Production Planning and Inventory Control. The results of the discussion show that Master 
Production Schedule (MPS) can help to adjust fluctuations in demand, reduce waste, minimize waste, prevent 
shortages and scheduling errors, increase efficiency at the site of production resources, provide more effective cost 
control and more accurate estimates of material. requirements and delivery dates, reducing waiting times during 
processing.

1. Introduction 
For a company that produces or manufactures goods, the most important element about customer service is product 
availability (Coyle, Bardi, and Langley, 1992). Product availability means that a company must prepare an amount of 
product before they release it to the market and sell it to the customer. To fulfill the availability of their product, a 
company needs to make a plan or strategy to control their production activity. That plan or strategy will help the 
company to assemble, manufacture, and buy a product with an objective to fulfill the amount that their customer wants 
based on the order. Not only the production activity that is important for this plan or strategy, the inventory planning 
also has a big contribution to support and improve it. Both production and inventory planning are important to make 
sure that the objective is to fulfill what the customer needs or make sure the product availability in the market has 
been achieved. 
 
To dive deeper and understand the importance of preparing the plan or strategy for production and inventory planning, 
we will conduct research based on real data and the company. In this research, we will take a business case using real 
data from BASF company. BASF is the largest chemical company in the world from Germany, headquartered in 
Ludwigshafen. BASF itself was originally an acronym for Badische Anilin- und Soda-Fabrik (Soda and Anilina Baden 
Factory). The company is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange, the New York Stock 
Exchange and the Zurich Stock Exchange. The company has operations in Europe, Africa, Asia, North America and 
South America. Founded in 1865 and employing 113,000 workers in 2012, with 52,800 workers in Germany. 
 
In Indonesia, BASF company has a main factory in West Jakarta. In that factory, they usually produce a lot of chemical 
substances. For this research, we will use a real data base on the production and inventory planning of one of their 
products, Softex 1097-A. Softex 1097-A is a product that is in liquid form with 50% of calcium stearate dispersion 
content. This product is produced using some material resources that BASF has and we will show the Bill of Material 
(BOM) of it below. This product is very effective as anti-tack preparation in the rubber industry, mold release agent

The last, figure 8 will show the comparison between MPS and forecast order. Based on the previous figure, the use of 
Master Production Scheduling (MPS) is a lot better than only using the forecast order. The forecast order does not use 
the actual data, so they only can calculate a value that is not too different from the customer order data last year.  But 
if we use MPS calculation, there will be another variable that can make the data that the company uses be more 
accurate in objective to fulfill customer demand. As we can see on the graph, the amount of Master Production 
Scheduling calculation is dominantly bigger than the forecast order and also more likely the same with customer order. 
That fact will make the implementation of MPS into the production activity of Softex 1097-A become the best solution 
that BASF can do. 
  
 
Figure 8. Graph Comparison of Forecast Order and Master Production Scheduling 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
After implementing the MPS, we proposed improvements for BASF Company to use sophisticated MPS method. 
Choosing a sophisticated MPS method is critical to plan feasibility, though it is less clear whether it has a generally 
important impact on plant performance. More detailed, context-related studies are thus needed to further analyse this 
relationship. The present study contributes to MPS in practice by clarifying how MPS performance can be improved. 
Sophisticated methods in particular increase plan feasibility, though the use of overly simple methods can also 
negatively impact delivery service, no matter the context.  
 
6. Conclusion 
From this discussion, it can be concluded that implementing the Master Production Schedule (MPS) in the BASF 
Company can make better use of the resource and easier to fulfill the demand from the customer to minimize the 
stored product and maximize the profit for the BASF company. This is because: 
1. There is effectiveness in the inventory allocation system, where the inventory in the previous month can be 
used as additional inventory in the following month. 
2. After the MPS is made, it is seen that there may be no stockout when the production process is carried out.

Abstract 
 
The paper aims to improve the production planning of a rack industry by implementing forecasting and production 
planning tools. The production strategy used in the manufacturing industry is a make-to-stock production approach. 
The manufacturing industry often encounters problems mostly about underproduction and overproduction that leads 
to high cost and poor performance. The problem is highly related to the quality of forecasting and production planning. 
This paper discusses the implementation of a moving average forecast method and MRP in one product of the observed 
manufacturing industry to increase production planning efficiency and effectiveness. The results show that the forecast 
of supply, production, and demand for the present year have the potential to be in condition of overproduction so 
reducing the production is necessary to get the optimum profit by avoiding unnecessary cost. Moreover, the MRP 
provides clear information about how much materials are required for production and when to order the materials. 
The forecasting method and MRP could improve the production planning in the manufacturing industry.

1. Introduction 
This research paper addresses the application of production planning and control concepts using a forecasting method 
and Material Requirements Planning (MRP) to a manufacturing industry that produces various types of household 
products such as dish rack, shoe rack, tv rack, display rack, multipurpose rack, ironing board, and plastic flour. Many 
variants of plastic coating racks have been marketed in Indonesia and several countries. With experienced 
professionals and advanced machines, the products will continue to maintain quality and stability for customer 
satisfaction. Kapuk Molek Ltd. founded by Mr. Kalim is an integrated company primarily engaged in the manufacture 
of household products. The company was founded in 1981 in North Jakarta, Indonesia. 
 
The problem faced by the company is how to forecast the production of products in the future based on historical data. 
There are still a limited number of local factories that are using scientific methods to forecast and planning their 
production (Almaktoom 2017). This problem mostly affects inventory systems in factories as well as customers 
because the demand is undefined or inaccurate (Alsaadi et al. 2016). This problem can lead the industry to be in 
underproduction or overproduction. 
 
The data recording in the company is still using manual methods by handwriting on paper. It makes the data difficult 
to read and proceed. Forms of manual reporting make it difficult for the owner to see the development of the business 
related to the addition or reduction of the stock. This research focuses on the forecast and production planning of a 
product labeled as RK-01, a dish rack product, for the present year by implementing moving average forecasting 
method and Material Requirements Planning (MRP) in order to increase the efficiency of the production system. The 
forecasting method by Moving Average (MA) is used to forecast the supply and demand in the future for production 
planning. In forecasting the estimated level of demand in order to avoid excesses and not less inventory quantities 
based on past data (Dewi and Chamid 2019). Main purpose of optimization in industry is to increase efficiency in 
production (Nurcahyo 2016). Optimization in this research is related with the implementation of moving average 
forecasting method and MRP.

280","without forecasting is 2,5 ton. The inventory cost of this material is $1 per 0,01 ton. So, cost reduction from wire 
supply inventory cost is $250. LDPE powder supply without forecasting is 6,48 ton, meanwhile the forecasting result 
for this material is 6 ton. The difference between forecasting results and without forecasting is 0,48 ton. So, cost 
reduction from LDPE powder supply inventory cost is $48. The total cost reduction from the implementation of the 
forecasting method and MRP is $2698. 
 
This study gets the results from analyzing the production planning of a product in the rack industry with forecasting 
methods and MRP, estimating the company's production efficiency and inventory cost reduction after implementing 
forecasting method and MRP. The research shows the implementation of a simple forecasting method for the industry 
and the use of MRP has a significant impact for production planning in the industry. The industry could use 
programming code to generate autoplot moving average forecasting methods in any year and computerized MRP to 
get the results immediately and automatically, also allowing easy adjustment for production planning. Future studies 
in this area could take research on production planning of other industrial fields & larger scope using another 
forecasting method. 
 
5. Conclusion 
From the result, it can be concluded that the production plan is ineffective and inefficient. There was overproduction 
in the past years and can be solved by dropping the racks production based on forecasting results. By forecasting the 
supply, production, and demand helps in making production planning more effective. The production planning using 
MRP based on the forecast provides detailed information about material requirements for a period of time so it will 
clarify the needs and prevent the occurence of underproduction and overproduction problems. Using digital 
applications to build forecasting systems and MRP tools can make the production planning accessible and integrated, 
resulting in improvement of the production planning system.

Abstract 
 
Aggregate planning has been widely used by apparel manufacturers to gain maximum profit by finding the optimal 
solution between maximizing sales and minimizing production cost. Commonly, small apparel companies use chase 
strategy, where production rates are varied for each time period to meet changes in demand. However, without an 
appropriate demand forecast and well-calculated production planning, this strategy cannot accommodate the 
fluctuating demand, causing recurring product stockouts which increases the number of unmet customer demands. To 
improve the company’s production planning, the number of demands is forecasted using Single Moving Average 
method for each week of the upcoming month. The forecasted demand is then used to plan the production quantity 
using Material Requirement Planning which helps ensure that all the demands are met while avoiding over-production 
by taking on-hand inventory into account. Comparison between the former and the improved production planning 
method shows an increase in the company’s sales, increasing profit by 8.98% or equal to Rp616.000. This concludes 
that the method proposed in this paper can be used as a simple yet effective way to improve the apparel company’s 
production planning, hence increasing the company’s profit.

1. Introduction 
Interest and consumption of ready-to-wear apparel keeps growing every year. This phenomenon encourages many 
people to start their own apparel business, offering more sustainable products at a more affordable price range. To be 
able to set business in motion and generate profits, each company must establish the most suitable aggregate planning 
strategy for their business. Maximum profit can be reached by finding the optimal solution between meeting maximum 
demand and lowering cost. Most small apparel companies use chase strategy, where the production rates are varied 
each time period to meet changes in demand. This strategy is deemed most suitable for small apparel businesses since 
this strategy requires lower capital requirement and the resources needed are flexible and inexpensive to change. 
 
Forecasting and planning play a huge role in determining the production rate to balance the customers’ order. Good 
forecasting and planning will lead to on-time delivery, minimum waste, and minimum production cost. To optimize 
the chosen strategy, the company needs to have a well planned production as well as raw material stock schedule. 
Delay in the supply of materials and inappropriate storage of materials can result in delays in the completion of a 
project or even stopping the project, resulting in complaints and customer dissatisfaction that will decrease the 
competitiveness of the company (Rahmat et al., 2020). 
 
Some studies have revealed the impact of demand forecasting implementation to prevent out-of-stock situations in 
apparel companies (Rachman, 2018). Demand forecasting has been proven to be an important factor on supply chain 
improvement, resulting in an increase in the companies’ responsiveness to actual customer demand (A. Ross, 2004). 
Furthermore, Maria et al. (2013) discussed the actual state of the context in the fashion industry compared with the 
demand forecasting approaches developed over the last few years to understand which forecasting methods are more

result in an increase in the company’s overall profit.  
 
5.4 Validation 
Based on comparison below (see Table 8, Table 9, and Table 10), it is found that cost calculation using MRP can 
increase the company’s profit in May 2021 to Rp 7.476.000,‐ or equal to adding 8,98% more profit than its original 
value which is Rp 6.860.000,‐. This validates the hypothesis mentioned in the objective of this paper which stated that 
by applying inventory planning, profit of the company will increase.

failure of the business. 
 
By using the simple moving average (SMA) as the forecasting method, it is found that in the upcoming month, May 
2021, the company’s production capacity cannot satisfy customer demand due to limited stocks. To answer this 
problem, an implementation of Material Requirement Planning (MRP) is performed as the proposed improvement 
method. This method was chosen because it provides a schedule showing the components required at each level of the 
assembly and calculates the time when these components will be needed based on lead times.  
 
In comparison data, it can be seen that in May 2021 demand, Whycotton can increase their profit by 8.98% if the 
company has applied the MRP on their production planning. Results generated from calculation of the incremental 
profit obtained are relatively small in percentage. However, in its capacity as a small company, the application of 
MRP method in the purchasing planning of raw materials resulted in the company to gain a significant amount of 
profit. Judging from the size of this small company, this increase has a considerably big impact. 
 
In addition to the terms of increase in profit, the application of this method also resulted in companies being able to 
fulfill the customer demand schedule on time. Other than that, this method implementation helps the company in 
minimizing the possibility of the production capacity not meeting the customer demand, and an ease in analyzing how 
much raw materials to be purchased to meet demand.

Abstract  
 
Micro enterprise is one of the drivers of the nation's economic growth. There are many micro enterprises that have to 
provide many various products because of public demand and also industrial competition. Many of the micro 
enterprise owners run their business ignoring production planning that contributes mostly to the company's profit. We 
have to improve the micro enterprises production planning methods to get more profit.  This paper examines 
production planning methods in a micro enterprise at Surakarta, Indonesia. The purpose of this paper is to compare 
the use of planning and scheduling strategy. We explore challenges associated with planning strategies, and lastly, we 
consider a functional model of developing a planning system.

1. Introduction 
Development of technology impacts increasing industrial competition. People with their creativity, being innovative 
to make money. One of the activities is developing their own business and its start from the small or micro scale one. 
This is why Indonesia has a large number of micro-small-medium enterprises. It also contributes to the value of gross 
domestic product. Micro-small-medium enterprises have a big impact on national economic growth (Lamazi, 2020). 
If we can gain a little profit from all micro enterprises, the increase of regional GDP may become quite big.  
 
However, many micro enterprises do not pay attention to production planning because they think their business does 
not yet need it. In fact, production planning plays a very important role in a business (Sutrisno, 2017). Proper 
production planning will help companies to implement efficiency. The higher the efficiency, the greater the profit 
received by the company. The opposite effect can also occur with poor production planning. Low efficiency will cause 
production costs to swell, thereby eroding profits. It supported by a statement in a journal that there is significant 
positive effect between production cost and net income (Wulandari et.al., 2016) 
 
Managerial systems in small-micro enterprises are considered good and micro enterprises have minimal skill to 
organize (Suci, 2017). In some micro enterprises, production planning and inventory control is not one of their 
concerns. The inventory is mostly in idle condition because inventory tools are not as big as in the big company. 
Although it has little cost, the income is also little.  The order of material usually recorded by general treasure in 
financial reports. It means, the order material note recorded mixed with another cost beside material. In the other 
words, most micro enterprises don't use any planning tools in production or inventory management. It leads them to 
ignore how effective the material is utilized. 
 
To improve this to get more profit, we must have ideal conditions that make efficiency on the production process by 
improving the method of production planning (Kulikova, 2016). Planning production tools may help the enterprises 
to control the material and supply the product to customers. Schedule is an output from planning production 
implementation. From a research before, schedule can increase the value of customer satisfaction (Nurcahyo, 2020)

The P-value that we got is more than 0,05 (Figure 5). So, we can conclude that the normality assumption is fulfilled. 
The object of the test is same and the different conditions are already implemented. All the assumptions are fulfilled, 
so the t-test can be done. There are 2 hypotheses when doing paired t-test. Null hypothesis is that there is no significant 
difference between 2 conditions (H0: μ1 - μ2 = 0) and the alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant difference 
between 2 conditions (H1: μ1 - μ2 ≠ 0) with a confidence interval 95%. The descriptive statistic of current and

6. Conclusion  
Micro enterprises are one of the drivers of the nation's economic growth but many of the micro enterprises owners run 
their business with ordinary people point of view or without helicopter view methods. They ignore production 
planning. In fact, production planning plays a very important role in a business. Proper production planning will help 
companies to implement efficiency. The higher the efficiency, the greater the profit received by the company. 
 
The objective of the study is to improve the method of production planning and implementing tools to compare each 
strategy in micro enterprises. The objective is also to gain more profit in micro enterprises. We contribute by providing 
a proposed improvement of production planning for the company, chase strategy. Even though in the statistical test

Abstract  
 
The first step in optimizing the overall planning process is to develop a reliable forecasting process. In this 
paper we discuss the implementation of forecasting in the printing industry, forecasting the timing of 
demands is one of the critical issues. Time series is a collection of observations made at regular time 
intervals and its analysis refers to problems in correlations among successive observations. A Simple 
Moving Average model is a time series constructed by taking averages of several sequential values of 
another time series. To support the research, data collection from the firm is needed. In order to find the 
best model, the research will be supported by graphic visualization, analysis, and the accuracy of the Single 
Moving Average model for demand forecasting with data obtained from the firm over the course of 1-2 
years. The demand products are provided by CV. Mitrakom Bintang Kemilau firm. In this paper we 
calculated 3 different data, two of the three are based on the types of product which have the most sales 
percentage within 2 years of production, shelf talker and wobbler, the other is total products produced by 
the firm. Based on the three types of data we gathered two years in advance, we found evidence that 
forecasting data using the Single Moving Averages model results in 30%-50% errors using the error 
standard of  Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) supported by Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) and 
Mean Squared Error (MSE).

1. Introduction 
Demand forecasting helps companies make choices about how many goods they can manufacture in the future. Good 
forecasts should provide useful information to help with decision-making (Murphy 1993), and they should be reliable 
enough that different forecasts will not affect the decision (Voulgaris 2019). The two main causes of quantifiable 
uncertainty in travel demand forecasts are: model inputs and the models themselves in their specification and 
parameters (Hugosson 2005). Forecasters can combine either approach with Monte Carlo simulation, which uses a 
probability distribution of the input variables and constructs a distribution of outputs (Lemp and Kockelman 2009; 
Aldrete et al. 2010; de Jong et al. 2007; Manzo, Nielsen, and Prato 2015a, 2015b). Others are exploring ways to 
efficiently define the scenarios to run (Knaap et al. 2020).  
 
The printing firm, CV. Mitrakom Bintang Kemilau, produces many products to their customers based on the orders. 
The firm uses MTO (make to order) standard policy. In a make-to-order environment, manufacturers usually wait 
until an order is received from a customer before starting to make the goods. Based on the products sold by the  CV. 
Mitrakom Bintang Kemilau, we can see that some of the products are seasonal and in trend, others are in random 
variations. Other characteristics are the customer usually willing to wait while the order is being made and the products 
are quite rare to find in the market. The customers of these products are dominated by convenience stores from 
Indonesia such as Alfamart, Alfamidi, and Lawson. The place of this production and its customers are limited around 
JABODETABEK (Jakarta, Bogor, Depok, Tangerang, and Bekasi) and not all convenience stores included in those 
areas are buying from the same supplier.

averages method 
 
 
 
From the three graphs and tables shown above, our finding indicates that there are some irregularities in the 
productions that are eventually visualized from the differences between the actual productions and forecasting model 
using Single Moving Average Method on the  interval 3 and 4 months. After plotting the averages and the errors, we 
can analyze that the smallest error using fMEPE is the data from all productions in the firm. Based on these findings, 
we can briefly  analyze the trend, fluctuations,and irregularities by looking up at the graphic visualization and conclude 
that the smaller errors occur when the data have a fairly linear trend and definite rhythmic pattern of fluctuations. 
Thus, when we have smaller forecast errors, the better the model will work. In this case we are using a simple moving 
average model. Referring to the degree of accuracy we calculated before, with relatively high errors, we can conclude 
that both techniques present high error predictions in the 3 types of data along with the graphs we presented in this 
study.  
 
5.2 Validation  
For the validation, we use the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute 
Percentage Error (MAPE) methods to determine the error of the forecast. We get the average of each method as shown 
in Table 6. 
 
 
 
Table 6. Error summary of the forecasted data and the average of actual data  
 
We chose to refer to the error value shown by MAPE, MAD, and MSD, since these accuracy measures being the most 
common measure of forecast error. Table 6 shows that among the other data being measured, the output of all goods 
has the smallest number of MAPE with the differences between two methods is 6% which indicates there are 6% 
differences if we went for one approach than the other for all types of product, whereas the differences of MAPE in 
shelftalker and wobbler between two different intervals are less than 6%.  However, based on the number of MAPE, 
we can conclude that forecasting individual types of products (shelftalker and wobbler) are not better than forecasting  
the total products. As seen in Table 2, the probability of a high percentage of error MAPE from all forecasted goods 
can be influenced by missed revenue or zero demand within the ten products. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In this project, given that time series forecasting enables predicting the future through understanding the past, time 
series modeling and forecasting are important in a variety of practical domains. In the printing industry, forecasting 
future productions depend on capability to make predictions of significant products. After analyzing the graphic for 
both forecasted and actual data, error standards are calculated  in measuring the differences between forecasted data 
in two different techniques and actual data are conducted. From the previous  graphical and numerical results, we have 
concluded that the 3 different types of data itself are not in a regular state with some numbers of fluctuations occurring 
within the 2 years period of 2019 and 2020.  
 
Analysis of the data for the number of products differ in 3 ways has resulted in strong irregular components. This can 
happen as a result of the standard policy which the firm used in producing and selling the products to the customers.

321","The firm is using the MTO (Make To  Order)  method and as a result, production demand does not always follow a 
predictable pattern.When data has a reasonably linear trend and a definite rhythmic pattern of variations, a moving 
average model works well. However, perhaps due to the MTO method  used by the company, our data does not reveal 
any linear or rhythmic patterns as moving average models simply smooths out the variations in the results. 
 
The accuracy of various statistical techniques as well as the MAPE predictor were investigated in this paper. For that 
purpose, 2 years of sales data were collected. Based on the number of MAPE, MAD, and MSD  estimated with the 
number of MAPE more than 30% but less than 50%  for two of the three types of data provided in this paper, we 
cannot say that the number of errors represents a high inaccuracy model. We can compare the calculated MAPE or 
forecast accuracy among companies or industries while we look at the nature of the demand they are trying to forecast. 
We can conclude that the forecasting method using a single moving average model for our data that has most irregular 
patterns resulted in 30%-50% errors. As a result, if the errors we have are relatively high based on all of the firm 
considerations, the paper suggests that there is no point in proceeding with a strategy focused on weak forecast data 
without any changes both to the forecasting system we used and the production  approaches used in this firm. However, 
there are some methods used in forecasting data for more desirable forecasting results also with different results in the 
degree of errors.

Abstract 
 
PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) is a prominent state-owned cement producer in Indonesia. As a leading company, PT 
Semen Indonesia needs to keep improving its activity strategies, starting from the production planning. Therefore, this 
research discusses the appropriate production forecasting method. The production data is collected in an annual period 
which is collected from PT Semen Indonesia operational overview in the annual report. Steps of PT Semen Indonesia 
production planning forecasting are literature study, data collecting, identification of forecasting methods, comparison 
of forecasting methods, and result analysis. Based on the data characteristics, Single Moving Average and Exponential 
Smoothing Method were chosen to predict the production in the year 2021. The accuracy level of the method was 
measured by using MAD, MSD, and MAPE with Single Exponential Smoothing as the best production planning 
forecasting result.

1. Introduction 
PT Semen Indonesia (Persero) is one of the leading companies in the cement industry of Indonesia. In order to maintain 
its position as one of the leading companies, PT Semen Indonesia needs to have solid planning in its key activities, 
which starts in the production planning. The lack of accuracy in production planning may result in losses, such as 
overstock or out-of-stock. Therefore, it is required to have an appropriate forecast method that can be used in 
production planning. 
 
In order to have an accurate forecast, the availability of data about real production in previous years is crucial. Previous 
research related to production forecasting with several different methods has been conducted. We found that most of 
the time, the moving average method gave the least error to the forecasting. Therefore, since these methods depend 
on the type of data that is used, we’d like to approach this case with two different methods; single moving average 
and exponential smoothing. By comparing two different methods, it best provides which one is more suitable and 
realistic in this particular case of PT Semen Indonesia. 
 
1.1 Objectives 
This paper aims to provide more information as reference in forecasting a more realistic target of cement production 
in 2021 by using two different methods; Single Moving Average and Exponential Smoothing based on the historical 
data of 2011 - 2020. 
 
2. Literature Review 
In the present associations, which are subject to abrupt changes and where all requirements of the business sector need 
accurate and practical reading into the future, the forecasts are becoming exceptionally crucial since they are the 
indication of survival and the language of business (Bozarth et al, 2016). Forecasting refers to the activity of predicting

5.4 Proposed Improvements 
To provide more information as a reference in forecasting a more realistic target of cement production in 2021, we  
proposed PT Semen Indonesia to use a single exponential smoothing method. By implementing a single exponential 
method, it is believed that it will provide a more realistic baseline and approach in forecasting, based on past historical 
data. Thus, it is still required to compare and analyze the forecasted numbers with the actual data once it has been 
implemented. 
 
6. Conclusion 
With the completion of analyzing the best production planning forecasting methods to be implemented in PT Semen 
Indonesia, it can be concluded that: 
1. The result of production forecasting from the year 2011 until 2020 using Single Moving Average is 35.439 
with MAPE amounting to 8.779, MAD 2.7211, and MSD 15.1864. On the other hand, the forecasting result 
using Single Exponential Smoothing is 33, 409 with MAPE amounting to 8.6495, MAD 2.5852, and MSD 
14.029. 
2. A method with the smallest error level can be assumed as the most appropriate method to be implemented. 
From the information and data processing above, it can be determined that Single Exponential Smoothing is 
the best reference to forecast the production target of PT Semen Indonesia in 2021.

Abstract 
 
Information technologies play an important role in companies, as they are a fundamental pillar in the process’s 
management and automation. Thus, the purpose of this research is to evaluate an adoption guide for ERP computer 
systems through the deployment of the inventories management module. As a result, it was evidenced that successful 
software adoption requires considering aspects that are not necessarily technical, such as commitment and business 
culture, or properly defined processes. We conclude that the successful implementation of this ERP module in the 
warehouse will serve as a starting point for its deployment in other business areas.

Costs: Avoid hardware and software purchase costs. 
• 
Resources: Avoid hiring more staff to maintain the system. 
• 
Visualization of the information and results daily 
However, the following disadvantages were cited: 
 
• 
Internet speed: Dependence on the internet service on the computer where the system is accessed. 
• 
Security: They consider that, when accessing through the internet, it is a vulnerable system. 
As can be seen despite the negative aspects, the reception of the program was positive for the store employees, 
however, work must be done to reinforce the idea that it is safe to use the system even when linked to the Internet. 
The ERP system is a fundamental support for micro, small, medium, and large companies, because it promotes 
production processes and allows improving control over them. With ERP software, adopted, installed, and running, 
companies are forced to organize efficiently to take advantage of the different modules, allowing to dedicate more 
time to planning the organizational future. Quinde (2017) indicates that 48.62% of the companies evaluated by the 
Telecommunications Ministry and the Information Society of Ecuador (MINTEL), which have IT resources, have 
optimized their operating times; 41.13% have mentioned that IT has optimized its processes; and that 36.56% have 
benefited from a cost’s reduction. 
 
Current and future trends force companies to increase their competitiveness (Brume, 2017), so they need the 
optimization and integration of the internal flow of information and their external commercial relationships to achieve 
basic objectives, such as productivity, quality, customer service and cost reduction Limantara and Jingga (2017). 
Therefore, the UDA-ERP software for SMEs is made up of several modules: in the first stage, the manufacturing and 
inventory modules were considered, where processes for managing products, structures, production routes, work 
centers are implemented, capacity planning and generation and control of the production order. In the second stage 
the accounting and costs modules were developed and in the third stage the purchasing and sales modules. 
 
For the implementation in the selected organization, only the inventory module was considered, with the guidance of 
Mogrovejo et al., (2020), who, in addition to leaving a guide for the adoption of the UDA-ERP for MSMEs, take for 
granted that the correct software adaptation depends on the coordination and collaboration between the company and 
specialists, through the support and provision of accompaniment during the gathering of information. In this case, it 
was relevant to take advantage of the first phase of implementation, however, in addition to this, it is essential to 
implement training processes before applying the system, as well as the gathering of prior information to assess the 
current state of the organization. In addition, it is important to consider the application of strategic management tools, 
since as defined (Brume, 2017) they are essential for the analysis and assessment of the current situation of the 
company. Thus, investing in ERP software should not be considered a cost, but rather should be considered as a 
strategic element that allows decision-making, considering that information is power and that whoever has it and 
knows how to use it, will obtain a clear competitive advantage Crespo et al. (2018). Finally, it can be ensured that not 
all MSMEs share the same benefits or restrictions presented by the ERP implementation guides, due to different factors 
that influence, both internal and external, however, in the collected literature, the benefit that is obtained is evident in 
most of them. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Through the gathering of information in this first stage of INVENTORIES, it was taken for granted that information 
technologies, specifically ERP as strategic management tools, are fundamental for business development and control. 
Even though software is expensive, through linking society and academia as a response to social responsibility, 
Universidad del Azuay has developed this system, considering the guidelines for improving the productive matrix of 
the region and the country, through enhancing the growth of MSMEs. UDA-ERP is adaptable to any business model 
and does not require a considerable investment. The company that served as a pilot presented deficiencies in terms of 
control, therefore the implementation of the inventory module contributed to the management processes of this 
business area. Through the identification of the groups or classifications assigned to the different products, it is evident 
throughout the work that an ERP is a scalable, flexible, and low-cost solution, and that it can be used by SMEs in 
Ecuador at a required moment. 
 
For future research, it is recommended to evaluate the results of the implementation of all software modules, which 
will allow to identify advantages or disadvantages when implementing an ERP. Thus, the information generated by

objective strategies, which will improve the contribution of other business areas. The maintenance of this tool is 
provided by the manufacturer, which will ensure its stability during its life cycle. Accessibility, security, and cost 
reduction are positive points found in its implementation and highly considered by the people who evaluated the 
system. Finally, this article reveals the positive qualities offered by the deployment of one of the ERP software 
modules in a grocery store in the MSME sector, validating the adaptability of the system and laying the foundations 
for its development within the city.

1. Introduction 
In the past, coffee shops were synonymous with stalls that were less comfortable, unattractive and had a monotonous 
atmosphere. Now the cafe is synonymous with a comfortable place, cosy atmosphere, complete facilities such as 
lounges, bars, air conditioning, Wi-Fi, even cafes with unique interior designs and combinations of functions that were 
previously unrelated, such as a library or reading room (Adirinekso. G.P., Purba, Budiono, & Rajagukguk, 2020). 
Nowadays people feel comfortable spending a lot of time with relatives in coffee shops or cafes. Coffee shops or cafes 
in Indonesia today have changed the way Indonesians drink coffee from just a daily routine in the household and 
entertaining guests, to a modern business that is growing rapidly (Budiono & Purba, 2020). Drinking coffee is not 
only a habit to reduce sleepiness, but also a lifestyle for adults and young people, both men and women in their daily 
activities. 
 
The coffee industry in the form of coffee shops has recently been started by coffee drinkers who are then interested in 
turning this hobby into a business. Many coffee lovers make their coffee drinking hobby a business to increase their 
income, or even become their main source of income (Budiono & Purba, 2019). A few years ago, most people 
consumed coffee only at simple coffee shops, but as times change, coffee shops have developed into modern coffee 
shops. The rise of the coffee shop business causes competition to become increasingly fierce. Each trying to provide 
better facilities (Rahman & Noor, 2014).

Based on the results of partial testing the brand awareness (Aw_G) variable is t-test = 5.71 and probability value t = 
0.000 states that we reject null hypothesis and accept alternative hypotheses. Brand Awareness significantly Purchase 
Intention. Subsequent partial testing of perceived quality PQ_G variable. The results of t-test = 6.67 and probability 
value t = 0.000 states that we reject null hypothesis and accept alternative hypotheses. Perceived Quality significantly 
influences the Purchase Intention. Last, partial testing of brand loyalty (L_G) variable. The results of t-test = 6.67 and 
probability value t = 0.000 states that we reject null hypothesis and accept alternative hypotheses. brand loyalty (L_G) 
significantly influences the Purchase Intention (PI_G). So, testing together or partially shows the behavioral model in 
this study has met the statistically requirements. 
 
Next, we construct the equation of the research model in this study as follows. 
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃_𝐺𝐺= 0.58 + 0.29 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴_𝐺𝐺+ 0.35 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃_𝐺𝐺+ 0.23 𝐿𝐿_𝐺𝐺 
 
All value of the parameter coefficients is positive, this show the results of this study are in accordance with the 
hypotheses and theoretical basis. The magnitude of the parameter coefficient reflects the magnitude of the impact of 
the independent variable on the dependent variable. The value of brand awareness parameter with coefficient of 0.29 
shows that each increase in brand awareness resulted in an increase purchase intention (PI_G) of around 0.29 in 5 
scale. The value of perceived quality PQ_G parameter with coefficient of 0.35 shows that each increase in perceived 
quality PQ_G resulted in an increase purchase intention (PI_G) of around 0.35 in 5 scale. At the last, The value of 
brand loyalty (L_G) parameter with coefficient of 0.23 shows that each increase in brand loyalty (L_G) resulted in an 
increase purchase intention (PI_G) of around 0.23 in 5 likert scale. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Overall, this research containing three independent variables and one dependent variable participated by 298 consumer 
respondents. Variable brand awareness, perceived quality, brand loyalty influence on purchase intention. Efforts are 
needed to increase brand awareness. Making a good condition as a picture that shows the ability of a potential 
consumer to associate and recall and recognize a brand. 
 
To increase a Perceived Quality is very important. a view of the overall consumer perception of the brilliance and 
quality of a product and service. We must do research and development to increase and secure quality of product. 
Thus, consumers will make decisions regarding purchase intention. Efforts are needed to increase the positive 
impression to costumers, which will trigger their commitment to continue to be loyal in using products of the same 
brand repeatedly, accompanied by feelings of satisfaction and pleasure after being consumed repeatedly. Therefore,

1. Introduction 
Food and beverage business is very promising industry of the many businesses that exist today, with a 
population in Indonesia in 2019 reaching 267 million people (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2019).  The existence of 
food and beverages are needed every day, so that the fulfillment is also continuous and that is what makes business 
people compete to make the business they are doing to be successful in the long term and generate the maximum 
profit (J.D. Tan et al., 2019) (Purba & Tan, 2018). According to the Roy Morgan research institute (2018) in his 
research in an average period of half a year, in the time span from April 2017 to March 2018, there are several fast 
food restaurants favored by the Indonesian people, of which Padang Sederhana is the top fast food restaurant in 
terms of visits and sales, followed by KFC and McDonald's in second and third place.

347","5. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the analysis and discussion, the conclusions that can be drawn from this overall 
study are: 
1) The results of testing hypothesis 1 mean that Social Media Marketing has a positive and significant effect 
on Purchase Intention with the acquisition of a t-value (CR) of 2.413 ≥ 1.96 and a p-value of 0.016, 
smaller than alpha ≤ 0.05, so accept H1. Thus, it can be concluded that the Social Media Marketing 
variable has a positive influence. 
2) The results of hypothesis 2 testing mean that Brand Image has no positive and significant effect on 
Purchase Intention with the acquisition of a t-value (CR) of 0.153 ≤ 1.96 and a p-value of 0.878, greater 
than alpha ≥ 0.05. Therefore, H2 is rejected. Thus, the Brand Image variable does not have a positive 
effect. 
3) The results of testing hypothesis 3 mean that motivation has a positive and significant effect on Purchase 
Intention with the acquisition of a t-value (C.R.) of 3.282 ≥ 1.96 and a p-value of 0.001, smaller than alpha 
≤ 0.05, then receiving H3. Thus, it can be concluded that the motivation variable has a positive effect. 
 
5.1 Research Limitation 
With all the limitations, this research is far from perfect. This research is limited by time, population area 
and sample and age range. This research is also limited in terms of variables where there are only three 
independent variables, namely social media marketing, brand image and motivation and one dependent 
variable, namely buying interest. 
 
5.2 Research Suggestions 
The limitations of the research make the authors hope that further researchers can expand the scope of 
research by adding variables or expanding the specified sample coverage so that it opens up more research 
horizons. The author also hopes that this research can have a positive impact on academics. The 
suggestions can be summarized into three points, namely: 
1) The next researcher can increase the number of respondents and also expand the scope of the area and not 
only focus on the Lippo Karawaci area. 
2) The next researcher can add other variables besides social media marketing, brand image and motivation.

Abstract 
 
Krakatau Steel is one of the manufacturing companies in Indonesia that has been experiencing losses for 9 years 
with the number of US$112 million in 2018. This research discusses forecasting discourse that many companies 
face while setting a new optimal strategic plan and aims to compare which method is best to use in terms of 
predicting krakatau steel demand. Data of accumulative steel products were collected from Krakatau Steel annual 
report with 14 years of historical data from 2005-2019. Double Exponential Smoothing and Single Exponential 
Smoothing methods were used to predict the demand in 2019. The accuracy was measured by MAPE, MAD, MSD, 
and MSE where the single exponential smoothing method is found as the best and more accurate than double 
exponential smoothing. Further improvements have been done to further examine the coefficient value and MAPE 
value towards the forecast results, still, Single Exponential Smoothing is the more accurate method.

1. 
Introduction 
Krakatau Steel is a state-owned enterprise headquartered in Cilegon, Banten, Indonesia and it is the largest 
company in Indonesia that produces steel products and their derivatives. Krakatau Steel has been experiencing 
losses since 2012. In the 2018 Annual Report, Krakatau Steel’s financial burden throughout 2018 reached US$112 
million or equivalent to Rp1.57 trillion (exchange rate of Rp14,038 per US dollar). The burden more than Doubled 
in 2011 to just US$41 million. This situation is further exacerbated by the invasion of imported steel especially 
from China and its corruption case in 2019.  However, there are many ways to overcome those losses such as 
restructuring debt, selling shares, or selling assets, but the most ideal way is to pay with the results of sales or profit 
which leads to the optimization of the production by doing an accurate forecasting. From all different types of 
forecasting methods that exist with different precision and accuracy depending on its case, this research paper aims 
to address the accuration between Double Exponential Smoothing and Single Exponential Smoothing of 
forecasting methods into Krakatau Steel company production in order to find the most accurate forecasting method 
between two different exponential smoothing methods to be able to solve Krakatau Steel’s problem. 
 
 1.1  Objectives 
 
The objective of the study is to know what method is more accurate to forecast estimated demand steel products in 
Krakatau Steel for year 2019 based on mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean squared deviation (MSD), 
mean absolute deviation (MAD), and mean squared error (MSE) value from each method.

Literature Review 
Forecasting is a calculation analysis technique that is done with a qualitative approach as well as quantitative to 
estimate future events using reference data in the future rather than to minimize the impact uncertainty. Forecasting 
itself can be the basis for a company's short, medium, and long-term planning. Forecasting is a very important tool

Table 6 shows the MAPE and forecast value for testing the coefficient value when α = 0,8 for forecasting demand 
of steel products between 0,1 to 0,9. The test results show that the MAPE value tends to increase when the 
coefficient value is increasing from 0,1 to 0,9. The smallest MAPE value was generated in the test β = 0,1 while 
the largest MAPE value was obtained in the test β = 0,9. However, from table 6, we can see that the closest forecast 
value to the actual data is when the β value is 0,5. 
 
6. 
Conclusion 
Based on the results of the study in choosing the most accurate forecasting method between Double Exponential 
Smoothing and Single Exponential Smoothing to forecast demand in Krakatau Steel, it can be concluded that the 
Single Exponential Smoothing shows closer forecasts result to the corresponding actual data with a difference about 
335.067 tonnes. This can also be proven by the MAPE, MSD, MAD, and MSE values that are smaller than the Double 
Exponential Smoothing so that it shows more accuracy than the Double Exponential method with the details MAPE 
value 1,23664E+0, MAD value 2,20761E+05, MSD value  9,88990E+10, and MSE value 1,1227E+11. However, as 
the deviation value is still significantly far from the actual data, improvement needed to give the most accurate or as 
close result as possible to the actual data. For single exponential smoothing, obtained that the closest forecast is when 
the coefficient has the highest MAPE value while double exponential smoothing, obtained that the closest forecast is 
when the coefficient has MAPE value in between the lowest and the highest. According to the validation analysis, the 
smallest MAPE does not always give the closest forecast result but single exponential smoothing still gives the closest 
forecast value. We encourage the enterprise to always take considerations and examine others' forecast value results 
even though the MAPE value exceeds 20%.

Abstract 
 
This study aims to determine the effect of brand image, trust perception, ease and security of transactions, 
and convenience perception on purchasing decisions at JD.ID during the Covid-19 pandemic. The 
population of this study is consumers who have shopped at JD.ID. The non-probability sampling technique 
was used in this study, namely accidental sampling with 170 respondents. The data collection method used 
a questionnaire with google forms distribute to social media. The model used in this research is Partial Least 
Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The data processing tool is Smart PLS version 3.2. The 
results show that brand image, trust perception, and convenience, have a positive and significant effect on 
purchasing decisions at JD.ID. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the security of transactions only has a 
positive but not significant effect on purchase decisions.  The other exogenous variable should be 
considered to include in the research model.

1. Introduction 
Technological advances have been attached to people's lives. Previously, business activities were only carried out 
conventionally. However, since the existence of the internet, business activities can be carried out online, which has 
led to a new trend, namely online shopping. According to data from databoks.co.id, it shows that the number of online 
transactions in Indonesia continues to increase from 25.1 trillion rupiahs in 2014 to 144.1 trillion rupiahs in 2018 or 
has increased by more than 500 per cent in 5 years. One of the factors that play a significant role in the growth of e-
commerce in Indonesia is the internet user population which has reached more than 100 million users. So it can be

365","In the security perception variable, there are 3 indicators, namely not misusing personal consumer data, providing 
safeguards and keeping personal consumer data confidential from hackers, providing confidence in security 
guarantees. Based on the results obtained from the respondents 'answers in the indicators not to abuse consumers' data, 
it was found that 134 or 79% of respondents believed that JD.ID e-commerce did not abuse their consumers' data, this 
meant that respondents believed in JD.ID in their data security. Furthermore, on the indicator of keeping personal 
consumer data from hackers, 126 or 74% of respondents agreed that JD.ID E-commerce will protect consumer data 
from hackers. This result means that most respondents believe that JD.ID will protect them from hackers. Then the 
indicator gives confidence in security guarantees, found as many as 142 or 84% of respondents believe JD.ID will 
provide security guarantees for all transaction processes and administration. It means that in all transaction processes 
in JD.ID e-commerce, respondents believe that JD.ID will guard them. However, the analysis results in Table 6 show 
that the perception of security positively affects purchasing decisions, but it is not significant. It means that security 
perceptions do not have a significant effect on purchasing decisions during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is different from 
previous studies conducted by Alwafi & Magnadi (2016), Susilo & Wardoyo  (2017), Wulandari (2018), Lestari et al. 
(2015),  Yunita et al. (2019), Rafidah (2017),  H. Rahayu et al (2020) which resulted in the conclusion that the security 
variable has a positive and significant effect on purchasing decisions. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the previous discussion, it can be concluded 
1. Brand image affects the purchasing decisions of JD.ID customers during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
2. Perceptions of trust affect the purchasing decisions of JD.ID customers during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
3. Perceptions of convenience affect the purchasing decisions of JD.ID customers during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
4. There was no effect of security perceptions of transactions on purchasing decisions of JD.ID customers during the 
Covid-19 pandemic. 
 
The following are the authors' suggestions for further research that discusses the topic of JD.ID and its derivatives 
might improve the deficiencies in this study.  a). For further research, it is recommended to use a larger sample size, 
this study uses a sample of 170. It is hoped that further research can get a bigger and better sample from this study 
with many samples.  b). For further research, it is advisable to use other exogenous variables that can influence 
purchasing decisions. When viewed from R2, the variables used in this study represent only 48.5%. The remaining 
51.5% is the contribution of the variables - other exogenous variables not included in the study.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this study is to test the impact of internet advertising and the UTAUT2 model on the use of 
Gojek application during the COVID-19 pandemic in the JABODETABEK region. The study was done by 
convenience sampling technique with 165 respondents. Respondents are users of Gojek applications that 
live in the Jabodetabek area. Based on this study, we found that: (1) Internet advertising, effort expectancy, 
hedonic motivation, and price value have a positive impact and are insignificant on the use of Gojek 
application during the COVID-19 pandemic. (2) performance expectancy, social influence, habit, and 
experience positively and significantly impact the use of the Gojek application during the COVID-19 
pandemic. (3) The facilitating condition has a negative impact and significant impact on the Gojek 
application during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the research are expected to assist the development 
of similar research, especially in the application of the UTAUT2 model. Modification of the application of the 
UTAUT2 model by adding other variables related to the context of the subject being studied is expected to be carried 
out in the future.

1. Introduction 
Transportations make humans easy to carry out daily activities, especially in terms of mobility. With the help of 
transportation, we can go from one place to another quickly and with less effort. Unfortunately, not everyone has a 
private vehicle today. The number of motorized vehicles grows yearly, as reported by Central Statistics Agency 
(Badan Pusat Statistik, 2020).  From table 1, the composition of vehicle type is still consistent, year by year.  The 
motorbike has dominated its share from 2017 up to 2019.   It shows in table 1, each type of vehicle growth was a 
decline from 2017-2018 to 2018-2019 for each type of vehicle. Along with the development of the times, there have 
been many technology-based innovations. Karya Anak Bangsa develop an online transportation application call 
Gojek. This innovation appeared at that time, of course, supported by existing opportunities. Apart from the need for 
transportation, other supporting factors are the rapid use of connected cell phones (Smartphones), internet use, and 
use of social media in the community, as shown in Figure 1.

377","5.2 Graphical Results  
The R2 test aims to determine how much variation in the exogenous latent variable (X) can explain the endogenous 
variable (Y) variation. According to Hair (2017), a model is good if the value generated by R2 is more significant than 
0.67. In this study, the value of R2 is 0.785, which means that the independent variable can explain the Y variable's 
variation by 78.5%. The measure of the R2 value is categorized as good. 
 
5.4 Validation 
Hypothesis testing is carried out using path coefficients. Path coefficient is used to determine the significance of the 
influence between certain exogenous variables and endogenous variables. In table 7, there are the results of 
bootstrapping data processing to find the value in the path coefficient test.

Internet advertising, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and price value did not significantly affect the use of the 
Gojek application during the COVID-19 pandemic. This can be seen through the path coefficient value in Table 7, 
which indicates a positive value, and t statistic value < t Table (1.97472) or the P Value> 0.05.   
 
-Performance expectancy, social influence as well as habit and experience have had a positive and significant influence 
on the use of the Gojek application during the COVID-19 pandemic. This can be seen through the path coefficient 
value which indicates a positive value because it is above the number 0 then it is said to be significant because the 
value of T Statistical> T Table (1.97472) and the value of P Value <0.05. -Facilitating conditions have a negative and 
significant impact on the use of the Gojek application during the COVID-19 pandemic. This can be seen through the 
path coefficient value which indicates a negative value because it is below the number 0 then it is said to be significant 
because the value of T Statistical> T Table (1.97472) and the value of P Value <0.05. 
 
6. Conclusion  
There are two main conclusions from this study, namely (1) There is no significant effect of exogenous internet 
advertising variables, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, and price value on the use of the Gojek application during 
the pandemic COVID-19.  (2) There is a significant effect of exogenous variables on performance expectancy, social 
influence, Facilitating conditions, as well as habit and experience on the use of the Gojek application during the 
pandemic COVID-19. The results of the research are expected to assist the development of similar research, especially 
in the application of the UTAUT2 model. Modification of the application of the UTAUT2 model by adding other 
variables related to the context of the subject being studied is expected to be carried out in the future.

Abstract 
 
Springs are a crucial part of suspension systems for vehicles. One of the largest companies that produce springs is PT 
Indospring Tbk that is located in Indonesia. In the last two years, sales volume in PT Indospring Tbk has continuously 
declined. PT Indospring Tbk needs to take action to prevent further production problems due to inconsistent sales 
volume. The action that can be taken to prevent production problems, either overproduction or below the customer’s 
demand, is forecasting the production volume of their product. This paper discussed three forecasting methods which 
are Double Exponential Smoothing, Additive Winters’, and Multiplicative Winters’ method to determine the number 
of products that need to be manufactured in the future. Data is gathered from the company's annual report and 
processed using Minitab 18. By using the same value of parameters, the results show that Winters’ Multiplicative 
method is the most suitable method for the company with the least estimation of errors (MAPE, MAD, and MSD) 
compared to others. 
 
Keywords 
Spring production, Forecasting, Double Exponential smoothing, and Winters’ method. 
 
1. Introduction  
Springs, alongside tire and shock absorber, is one of the most important parts of suspension systems in the vehicle. It 
is an elastic part that can adjust itself when the vehicle is loaded and unloaded (Poojari et al. 2021). PT Indospring 
Tbk is a company that manufactures springs located in Indonesia. This company produces two types of springs, leaf 
springs, and coil springs. In 2020, this company produced 60,759 springs, 19% lower than the previous year. In the 
last two years, the production and sales volume growth in this company has been declining. If this trend continues for 
the next few years, the company will gain lower profit and overproduce its product. That can be prevented by 
forecasting the number of products that will be manufactured. 
 
Forecasting is an important preparation step to determine the number of items that will be produced based on past 
data. It refers to a preliminary process of production planning, as the company cannot arbitrarily determine that 
(Arnold et al. 2008). If the number of productions that the company sets exceeds the customer demand, it would be 
wasteful for the company. On the other hand, if the number of productions that the company sets is less than the 
customer demand, it would decrease the company's customer satisfaction. The dissatisfied customer could decrease 
the competitiveness of the company and it could possibly disrupt the business climate with a change of demand and 
external stakeholders (Nurcahyo et al. 2020). Those effects lead to declining company profits, whereas the objective 
of the company is to gain optimum profit. To achieve that, forecasting can be applied to develop better plans to meet 
customer demands in the future (Arnold et al. 2008). Making a forecast could increase 2% of a company's shareholder 
value by increasing profit and decreasing capital investment and optimize production (Mentzer 1999).  
 
Generally, there are three techniques of forecasting to meet customer demands in the future, which are qualitative, 
extrinsic, and intrinsic techniques (Arnold et al. 2008). Qualitative techniques are subjective predictions that are based

388","There is a significant difference in estimated error value between the Double Exponential method and Winters’ 
method. The estimated error value of the Double Exponential method is higher than Winters’ method. This implies 
that the Double Exponential method is not suitable for the data and it means that there is a seasonality in the data. 
Based on Figure 1.a the season length of data is five years because the sixth year is the turning point and indicates the 
new season.  
 
5.2 Graphical Results  
Figure 2.a shows the plot of Additive Winters’ method while figure 2.b shows the plot of Multiplicative Winters’ 
method. The plot shows that both models fit with the data indicated by the turning point of the actual and smoothed 
data at the same point location. The value of MAPE from both methods is the same but the value of MAD and MSD 
of the multiplicative method is lower than the additive method. From that, the fluctuation of data is unconstant and 
follows a multiplicative time series.

Figure 3 shows the plot of the Double Exponential method. From that, the model tends to not fit the data by the 
difference of the several turning point locations. It is in accordance with the big MAPE value and indicates that the 
Double Exponential method is not suitable. 
 
6. Conclusion  
From this discussion, it can be concluded that Winters’ Multiplicative method is the most suitable method for the 
company with the least estimation of errors (MAPE, MAD, and MSD) compared to others. The spring production 
volume for 2021 until 2025 is 64413.0, 77077.3, 87173.7, 84148.6, and 71001.3 tonnes respectively. By using 
Winters’ Multiplicative method, it shows that there is a multiplicative seasonality in spring production volume. The

utilization of the company’s resources. After that, the company is expected to satisfy customers' demands and obtain 
optimized profit. Further research can be done by using more complete data and optimized method parameters.

Abstract 
 
Drivers are the foundation blocks of the transportation and logistics industries. Any damage to the foundation can 
topple the entire structure. Therefore, the well-being of drivers is of utmost priority and unfortunately, often 
overlooked. The availability of extensive literature on driver burnout and technological advancements in natural 
language programming (NLP) techniques motivated the development of the idea presented here. Multiple research 
articles on driver behaviour, driver burnout and driver fatigue are analyzed using NLP on Python to cluster the factors 
responsible for driver burnout. A burnout function is created using the controllable factors derived from NLP. This 
function is used as an objective in a multiobjective fuzzy vehicle routing problem (VRP). The problem is coded and 
solved using a genetic algorithm (GA) to derive trade-off solutions for the VRP and the well-being of the drivers. 
Incorporating a driver burnout/well-being function in a fuzzy VRP, where the burnout function is created using factors 
derived from text analytics forms the novelty of the approach proposed hereafter.  
 
Keywords 
Driver burnout, fuzzy set theory, genetic algorithm, natural language processing and vehicle routing problem.

Abstract 
 
Companies implement quality management systems to be more competitive and achieve organizational objectives 
efficiently; Quality is essential for any type of company and is present in all processes that are designed with the 
purpose of guiding the company towards a culture of continuous improvement. Because traditional cost accounting 
does not perform in-depth quality cost analysis, this research develops a methodology that allows companies to 
identify, quantify, and manage quality costs from an accounting perspective. The methodology used has a cross-
sectional approach and analyzes companies as generic entities without focusing on a specific activity or sector, as 
results a process map is proposed to identify where the main quality costs are located, considering the main activities 
that can be develop within a company, then a chart of accounts is presented that allows recording the different costs 
related to quality, and finally indexes are proposed for their management. The method and results are consistent with 
traditional accounting and operations management. It can be combined with business management tools such as ERP 
systems. This method can be of special interest to small and medium-sized companies due to the complexity and cost 
of having ERPs commercial systems that perform this type of analysis.

1. Introduction 
Organizations seek to be competitive, because markets are changing and dynamic over time, this change requires the 
development of higher quality products and services at the lowest possible cost, in this way organizations can secure 
new customers and maintain already existing ones, offering a range of products and services that seek to satisfy 
customer expectations. Meeting these expectations is of vital importance for organizations, since it allows them to 
maintain and increase their profits, preserve or improve the image of the company, and allows a better understanding 
of the reality of their processes and operations. On the other hand, poor quality is reflected internally in organizations, 
both in product and service defects and in financial statements; The mismanagement of the processes that add value

397","On the other hand, when the accounting is recorded and the costs are charged to the product or service, to calculate 
the cost of sale, the different cost items remain at zero, so the balances in the “T” accounts cannot be displayed. This 
makes a cost sheet essential to obtain the pertinent information. Consequently, a financial report directed to quality 
costs could be added, which consists of income, sales costs, operating expenses and non-operating expenses, including 
a breakdown of these according to quality costs. For certain accounts already existing in a generic chart of accounts, 
it has been necessary to change their location so that they refer to quality costs occupying the same action, but a 
different item of cost or expense. 
 
The advantage of the method proposed here is continuity and that it also operates together with traditional accounting, 
providing information at the relevant periodicity; The disadvantage is that the method when applied can be complex 
for small companies, because they do not have specialized areas or departments to delegate activities and fully carry 
out the activities associated with the method. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Quality from the business point of view refers to a basic factor demanded by customers and fundamental for the 
competitiveness of companies, which is why quality is increasingly important as time goes by. In the same way, the 
importance of competitiveness lies in having knowledge of how to manage the organization's resources, increase 
productivity and recognize market requirements on time, which is why to obtain quality it is necessary to manage it, 
since it is efficient to produce goods or services, generating greater satisfaction at a lower cost.  
 
The methodological proposal of this research work tends to be systematic and continuous, since it is complemented 
with traditional and cost accounting, providing convenience and time savings. In addition, this methodology can be 
implemented in management systems, such as ERP systems, considering that common accounting and production 
management systems do not have a tool that allows managing quality costs as part of their main functions, it is In 
other words, common systems often do not provide a means to identify, classify, quantify and help manage these costs. 
Since the method was evaluated in a general way, it is necessary that those who apply it have knowledge in production 
management and accounting; o that interdisciplinary teams are formed for greater effectiveness in the use of the 
method; Applying the methodology requires knowing and understanding material requirements planning (MRP) and 
the structure of processes, as well as the accounting structure of the organization.

On the other hand, when applying the method, organizations may face difficulties in determining which activities are 
related to quality, and consequently, in which cost classification to locate it, since internally each company is different 
and they carry out their operations according to your business needs and goals. The method has the facility of being 
able to be implemented in any type of company, because it adapts to the activities and the chart of accounts of any 
organization, that is, the method is coupled to the accounting, administrative and management structure of the 
Business. In addition, the process that must be followed to implement this methodology is continuous, since, when 
establishing the process map, the cost-generating activities are determined and after this, these are classified relating 
them to the total quality of a product, in order to In this way, it is possible to identify in which macro process and sub-
process the quality costs are found and, in turn, they can be managed in a specific way.

Abstract 
 
Higher education institutions had to deploy E-learning for all their students during the year 2020 in Chile, shifting 
from face-to-face to distance education. This change needed the adaptation of students to uncertain scenarios and 
affected the online system's outcomes. For example, there were issues with the internet connection, students got 
distracted easily, and they tend to turn off cameras so often they are losing face-to-face contact, and teachers were 
unfamiliar with the technology due to their age. This research explores the effects of online learning based on both 
technology acceptance and success models within this context. We conducted an online survey in engineering students 
belonging to Chilean universities, using five variables: information quality, system quality, user satisfaction, 
behaviour intention, and actual use of e-learning. The study used the partial least squares path modelling technique to 
analyse the measurement and structural model. We conclude that the quality dimension had a more significant impact 
on user satisfaction. Also, this satisfaction is an indirect antecedent of the use of e-learning systems. These findings 
show the importance of the system's characteristics in the final acceptance of the e-learning system by Chilean 
university students in the context of a pandemic.

1. Introduction 
The Chilean higher education system had to switch from face-to-face to online mode during 2020. Chilean universities 
needed to prioritise learning flexibility and be creative and inclusive due to the health emergency of COVID-19. In 
Chile, decisions were made to allocate resources and services to promote E-learning. The communication between the 
student and the teacher was expected to decrease concerning face-to-face mode, and it was not clear whether E-
learning was influential in the development of student's abilities.  
 
As a learning process, Chilean universities carried out contingency plans to engage students through the Internet and 
conducted E-learning in synchronous and asynchronous modes. Electronic equipment was offered to students who 
lacked the requisite resources for virtual classrooms, allowing distance education to be fully accessible. 
Synchronously, the student and the teacher interacted with each other at the same time in videoconferencing meetings. 
Because most of the evaluations were done asynchronously utilising text analysis or group work, class attendance was 
not a reason for failing a course or a requirement for taking a final exam. 
 
The educational development units at the universities enforced actions to provide tools and more information to 
teachers and students. Teachers delivered their study material to their students via the E-learning system and email 
and were trained to facilitate the use of the distance education system. They were compelled to do it as they have

408","5.3 Proposed Improvements  
The findings of the structural model show that improving the quality of the system has a significant impact on the use 
of the electronic education system. Accordingly, we propose investment in robust technology platforms. More 
precisely, the total effect of the system's quality on the intention to use is 0.715; thus, each point of improvement in 
the system impacts almost 3/4 points on the intention of use. 
 
5.4 Validation  
Regards validate the importance of both path coefficients and determination coefficients, a bootstrapping procedure 
with 5,000 subsamples was used to generate t-statistics and the confidence intervals. The results of the process validate 
the findings, as seen in Tables 6 and 7. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This research explored the effects of e-learning on technology uptake and success models in the context of the COVID-
19 pandemic in Chile. We conclude that the quality dimension has had a more significant influence on user 
satisfaction. Furthermore, this satisfaction constitutes an indirect precedent for the use of e-learning systems. These 
findings demonstrate the importance of system characteristics in the ultimate acceptance of the e-learning system by 
Chilean university students in the context of a pandemic.
