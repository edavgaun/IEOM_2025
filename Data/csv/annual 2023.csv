Abstract 
This paper aims to investigate the factors affecting the operations and efficiency of Humanitarian Logistics (HL) 
through its three main phases of preparedness, response, and recovery in the developing country context of Palestine. 
A quantitative research methodology using a survey instrument was employed in this study through which data were 
collected from 108 HL offices in government, NGOs, and other private logistics institutions operating in Palestine. 
Data were analyzed for its empirical significance on SPSS V21.0 using Pearson Correlation coefficient test. The results 
show that the most influential factor on efficiency of preparedness phase was “planning for logistics operations”, 
whereas the most influential factors on response and recovery phases were “logistics technical operations” and 
“logistics, governmental, organizational and infrastructure issues”, respectively. Furthermore, there is a positive 
correlation between factors of preparedness phase and efficiency of both response and recovery phases, and between 
factors of response phase and efficiency of recovery phase. This study provides valuable insights for HL organizations, 
NGOs, and policymakers on factors required to enhance efficiency and overall performance of HL management in 
Palestine and other developing country context with similar political and economic challenges.

1. Introduction
When a disaster hits a community, an expected instant response of rescue and evacuation operations is rapidly initiated 
to help the affected victims (Alexander  2019). To achieve the required efficiency, all parties must efficiently manage 
HL in each phase of disaster management, as this constitutes one of the most dominant factors affecting HL success 
(Koseoglu & Yıldırımlı  2015). HL is defined as operations of rescue and evacuation of affected people, utilizing 
resources and knowledge to help vulnerable or affected people by a disaster (Paciarotti et al. 2021). In fact, building 
a robust HL system is the first step in the process of effectively responding for a disaster (Shafiq and Soratana 2019). 
Therefore, HL play an important role in the management of the response supply chain (Cozzolino  2012). This means 
that the success or failure of emergency operations can be determined by logistics efficient management since aid, 
relief efficiency, and speed all depend on logistics deployment efficiency (Agostinho 2013). 
HL is a vast scale displacement operation of victims and their needs. This scale creates complex conditions with hard 
challenges (Agostinho 2013; Apte 2009; Daud et al. 2016). Complexity comes because of interaction between many 
factors, such as availability of roads and fuel, facilities for storage and transfer, people movement or evacuation,

6. Conclusions
In this study, an investigation of the factors affecting performance and efficiency of HL in the developing country 
context of Palestine was conducted. Three main phases of HL were included in this empirical investigation, namely: 
preparedness, response, and recovery phases. The results confirmed that “planning for logistics operations” was the 
most significant factors affecting efficiency of preparedness phase. Also, “logistics technical operations issues” was 
the most significant factor contributing to response phase efficiency. Whereas “infrastructure of logistics, governments 
and other organizations” had the greatest impact on efficiency of recovery phase of HL. This study is considered the 
first study to investigate factors affecting HL along the lifecycle of the logistics process, starting from preparedness, 
through response, and ending up with the recovery stage. The current study provides HL managers and policymakers 
with evidence on the need to invest more in planning for logistics operations as cornerstone factor for performance 
efficiency and success. Also, to better understand the factors identified in this study and how they impact HL 
operations, there is a need for more studies in other similar developing countries environments. Furthermore, 
conducting comparison studies on factors affecting HL operations and performance would be valuable to validate 
results of this study and to increase generalizability.

Abstract 
Lean concepts that many companies use to pursue business goals are based on key performance indicators coming 
directly from the manufacturing floor. These KPI’s such as availability, efficiency, productivity, throughput, 
capacities, and changeovers are essential in determining the performance of support and fundamental areas. Moreover, 
engineering management techniques should be applied to educate people to focus their work on these KPI’s. This will 
definitively ensure positive results to meet the companies goals. Once employees are engaged in the specific steps that 
occur between the process and result, it allows for a better understanding on how to deal with the production 
bottlenecks that can affect these key indicators. This research intends to provide detailed data about how KPI’s can 
increase after these key principles are integrated on the manufacturing lines and gain support from management and 
employees alike. This increase in performance will directly impact the organization and can assist in providing 
transparency to the areas that need improvement allowing for continuous operations as deemed necessary. Following 
this action plan, with the support from the management team, the manufacturing personnel could benefit from these 
key performance indicators thus assisting these employees with achieving the organizations goals. 
Keywords 
Key performance indicators, process development, improve, engineering management, production, manufacturing. 
1. Introduction
A vast number of manufacturing companies expand their business, especially those affiliated with the bioprocess, 
pharmaceutical, and medical device industries. In general, when a company plans to develop an expansion, it is due 
to the organizations volume of production, dwarfing the organizations maximum capacity, or they are launching a 
new product line with a forecasted high demand. These numbers must possess the capability of validation via the use 
of analytics that pertain to the market and productions performance. This is where lean concepts and key performance 
indicators take place, to ensure that the actual production behaves as expected and no waste is impacting the current 
capacity. Metrics such as downtimes, OEE, headcount, bottlenecks, and productivity should be measured to determine 
if the actual process is clean, and more capacity is required or if there are any opportunities to improve and capacity 
could me increase with simple action items. 
Manufacturing companies should focus the production process on achieving the optimal functioning of systems in 
production regarding the set goals, and above all, it is a matter of material, spatial and temporal harmonization, or 
coordination of resources involved in production processes (Rylková et al. 2021). To achieve that optimal functioning, 
many of these performance indicators should be measured, informed, and controlled. Some KPIs are connected one 
to the other because a continuous process depends on previous stations. For example, measuring downtimes will 
provide information about the total amount of time that a line was down, not performing as scheduled with unplanned 
stops and reduced capacity. Also, this number is directly correlated with available time which is one of the Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) factors to measure with this KPI. Having your process running efficiently and without 
any unplanned stops, will avoid increase unnecessary headcount and eliminate overtime work to deliver a planning 
schedule.

productivity should be measured, and a learning percentage should be applied because people will be performing 
without the projected experience. However, those hours might be taken out of the equation when calculating 
productivity and charged to a training center. Also, mid-level management needs to discuss with the new employees 
their expectations of the new line, product, or area that is under the expansion process to ensure they are aware of the 
company goals and objectives. After that, it is highly recommended to develop daily meetings with visual management 
tools that assure people know how they are performing and their continuous development as they are getting 
experienced with the new tasks. In general, this paper recommends specific information about how key performance 
indicators add value to meet company goals and how sharing this information with all employees engages them to 
meet those objectives as well. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The paper has focused on integrating key performance indicators as a new approach to understand manufacturing 
metrics, accomplish business goals, and inform direct and indirect employees about the performance tracking tools. 
By using these concepts and the examples shown previously, a new method to analyze business commitments for 
future projections and forecasts can be achieved based on the existing data collected. Looking for improvements in 
the manufacturing floor is always required for continuous operation and monitoring consistency. Once targeted goals 
are achieved, new goals must be established to always look for opportunities and boost production aspects. Using 
visual management boards provides an excellent alternative to describe the monthly performance and present a 
structured design of metrics. Further research on how implementing other factors or metrics to the process can be 
developed. Additional usage of these of these guidelines by different audiences can assist in the development of 
additional metrics’ and baselines. The strategic model of the SMART matrix gives a quick reference on what is the 
specific metric that should be tracked, if it is measurable or quantified, how the measurement will be attainable or 
achievable, the resources or requirements to focus on those goals, and the time-bound that the action will be 
implemented as a due date. Also, SQDC metrics and dashboards with monthly meetings influence positively the 
environment with employees because they can communicate with mid-level managers and make them feels like part 
of the decision-making process. For a company that is expanding their business and wants to guide step by step the 
new hires employees to drive them through the metrics tracking process, this level of understanding is required to 
ensure constructive behavior. Integrating key performance indicators into the manufacturing line is an investment with 
short-term benefits.

Abstract 
Manufacturing shops that utilize Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machines often need a way to measure the 
performance of the manufacturing process. Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is the standard measurement used 
and this paper will explore the steps required to implement the OEE metric as well as ways to improve the performance 
of a machine shop utilizing the metric. It will explain the metric itself, the various formulae that comprise it, and some 
the technologies available to implement it. Example data will be used to present a before and after scenario that shows 
the usefulness of the OEE metric and how it considers quality, performance, and availability of a single machine, or 
an entire machine shop. Expected results of this study are a quantitative review that show how a machine shop can 
increase its performance by focusing on specific aspects that make up the OEE number. As OEE gets closer to 100%, 
the machine shop should be shown to create more good quality parts faster than it had at a previously lower number. 
Automation of the calculations will also be discussed, as well as the logic that determines what state a machine is in 
during the manufacturing process.

1. Introduction
The OEE calculation “a three-part analysis tool for equipment performance based on its availability, performance, and 
quality rate of the output” (Muchiri & Pintelon  2008). A 100% OEE means that a machine shop only produces good 
parts, with no stop times, and that all machines are utilized during the available machining hours. The number can be 
calculated for single or multiple shifts, or it can be measured across a 24-hour time if the machine shop is expected to 
be producing nonstop. The most common practice is to measure across the shifts being used by the manufacturing 
company in question. 
The main components of the OEE calculation are availability, performance, and quality. They are multiplied together 
to produce overall equipment effectiveness as shown in equation 1. 
OEE = Availability * Performance * Quality 
(1) 
Availability refers to the amount of production time that a machine has during working hours to make parts or product. 
“All planned shutdown and maintenance activities reduce equipment availability” (Tsarouhas  2019) and therefore, 
maintenance should be tracked and reduced as much as possible to increase production time and OEE. Performance 
is the measurement of the ideal production rate of parts over a period. Idle time, reduced speeds, increased setup times 
and other delays during production are accounted for in the performance number. Quality refers to the number of good 
parts and bad parts made during production. Higher quantities of bad quality parts increase the amount of rework or 
scrap, costing the manufacturer money and time. By factoring in the ratio for quality, OEE can measure whether a 
manufacturing process is within statistical control.

6. Conclusions
Proper implementation of OEE can provide a consistent metric that encompasses a wide range of measurements 
applicable to engineering managers and higher management of an organization. By having a single number that 
incorporates the availability, the performance efficiency, and the quality of output of a machine, engineers will have 
the tools they need to choose projects based on the best returns. Managers and senior leadership can easily understand 
the metric and use it as a snapshot over a period to determine how their machine shop is performing. 
As seen in the above example of the Toshiba CNC machine measurements, small changes in any of the three key 
measurements can have large impacts on the final OEE number. Even with 100% in quality, the machine did not meet 
JIPM standards for world class OEE and this can be attributed to the slight underperformance in availability and the 
severely lacking performance metric. However, just because the standards weren’t met doesn’t mean that the OEE for 
that machine was necessarily bad, and many organizations would struggle to achieve the OEE numbers that Toshiba 
already has. The point of OEE is not to grade on a pass or fail, but to continuously improve upon the standards and 
processes already in place. Toshiba could even adjust their definition of quality to be more stringent, therefore 
lowering their overall quality and OEE number, but allowing them to be even more competitive in the manufacturing 
industry if they were able to improve upon what is currently considered 100% good quality products. With 
technological improvements happening at a quicker rate than ever before, the “industry moves faster, the period of 
change or innovation is shorter, the decision must be made in less time, that is why tools should be used to help identify 
losses caused during a production process” (Ng Corrales et al.2021). OEE is one of these tools that allows for faster 
communication of problems withing a machine shop, as well as identifying the specific area that needs to be addressed 
to solve these problems.

of SRAD Phases of Waterfall Development

Abstract 
The Systems Requirements Analysis (SRA) and System Architecture Design (SAD) (often combined into one 
acronym SRAD) phases of projects in the waterfall development cycle often pass-through design gates without proper 
pass/fail criteria.  In addition, completion of project designs is often put off onto later design phases (Preliminary 
Design and Critical Design) in favor of meeting schedule/budget early in the project lifecycle.  Currently in industry, 
schedule, and budget dictate project phase completion over proper metric tracking/utilization.  This is normally due 
to the fluidity of the design in early phases of project development.  This thinking can be dangerous for 
organizations/industries as it consistently leads to defects late in the development cycle where fixes are costly.  It is 
cheaper to change designs and defects as early in a design as possible. This paper will outline the DMAIC (Define, 
Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) process to help track completion of the SRAD phases for proper completion of 
design review phase gates.  By using DMAIC, projects will also be able to reduce latent defects in designs that can 
become costly to projects in later design phases such as testing, and production.  These phase gate completion metrics 
can be implemented and refined, as the DMAIC process is an ongoing methodology.

1. Introduction
This Waterfall Development Lifecycle, often called the Vee Model, is a phased approach to project management.  This 
model is broken into phases, where the phases are done sequentially.  Where the next phase cannot be started until the 
current phase is complete.  Completeness of two of these phases will be discussed in this paper.  The original intent o 
of this model was for each phase to end in a design review, where completeness would be assessed.  The phases of 
the waterfall development cycle are outlined in the Figure 1, and as follows: Systems Requirements Analysis (SRA), 
Systems Architecture Design (SAD), Preliminary Design Review (PDR), Critical Design Review (CDR), Test 
Readiness Review (TRR, also interchanged with Systems Verification Review or SVR), and Production Readiness 
Review (PRR).  This model is maintained within the following two sources: (Walden et al.2015) and (ISO/IEC/IEEE, 
2015).  The first being the Systems Engineering Handbook by The International Council on Systems Engineering 
(INCOSE, and the second being the specification ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 by the International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO), The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the Institute of Electrical and 
Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

This is often embedded in the ethics of an organization, as a good organization would not want to produce an 
incomplete product. 
In addition, the organization should keep control between a multitude of projects to maintain the statistics of defects 
found in the reviews, and especially categorize those defects, to home in on specific design problems, and use the I 
within DMAIC to Improve the process, and Measure change.  Minor defects can be things such as spelling errors, 
missing attributes, bad requirement wording, missing shall verb.  Major defects are defects that require functional 
changes to the architecture or increased/missing functionality.  Functionality can often be done via requirement 
traceability in the requirement management tool. 
5.4 Validation 
During this paper, the topics of project management for the systems engineering development lifecycle phase of 
Systems Requirement Analysis were delved into.  Regardless of industry, management of engineering teams and 
projects are within scope.  Engineering management is agnostic to disciplines within engineering whether that be 
software, hardware, quality, manufacturing, or in this case systems engineering.  Managing the requirement elicitation 
and pushing back against budget and schedule in favor of architecture/project design is something every manager 
should prioritize. 
6. Conclusion
One of the major problems a waterfall project faces starting out is moving through early design gates with an 
incomplete design.  This is a preventable problem.  As discussed, ending the SRA and SAD phases early can lead to 
defects showing up later in the design process where it is more costly to fix, as proved by (Widerman, 2001).  To 
prevent defects embedded in the design architecture metrics must be kept, by utilizing preexisting infrastructure within 
most requirement management tools.  By iterating and tracking CONOP and requirement progress and iterations, 
project teams can better understand their progress within a waterfall phase and be less susceptible to early phase 
completion from budget, or schedule pressures.

Abstract 
The renewable energy industry in the United States is growing at record rates. In the last decade, more renewable 
energy has grown in terms of capacity as well as demand because of the population growth and the need for 
environmentally friendly energy resources. Solar energy is one of the most promising renewable energy sources in 
Texas because of the climate and solar resource potential. With the continuous growth and advances in the industry, 
homeowners can install solar rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems for electricity generation instead of relying on the 
power grid. While the environmental benefits of solar energy are of importance and urgency, the economic benefits 
for homeowners are still to be determined. This research represents an economic assessment of a 7-kW residential 
rooftop solar system with a 3kW/6kW storage bank, in the state of Texas based on economic parameters such as the 
internal rate of return (IRR), the payback period (PP), and the net present value (NPV). These rooftop PV systems are 
installed on single-family residences and is economically beneficial in the state of Texas. These systems resulted in 
an NPV of $6333.01, IRR of 8.61%, PP of 13 years, which is an economic benefit to Texas homeowners.

1. Introduction
Electrical energy consumption in the United States of America is continuously increasing because of economic 
growth, population growth, rising household incomes, and the electrification of heat and transportation. Fossil fuels - 
including coal, oil, and natural gas - currently generate 79% of the United States supply while renewable energy only 
generates 12% as of 2020. The dependence on fossil fuels has caused an increase of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 
air pollution and global warming. North America is the second largest regional emitter of GHGs at 18% of global 
emissions, with Asia being the largest emitter accounting for 53% of global emissions. 
An alternative to fossil fuels is renewable or clean energy. The Natural Resource Defense Council (NRDC) defines 
renewable energy as energy that comes from natural sources or processes that are constantly replenished. Some of the 
renewable energy sources are solar energy, wind energy, hydroelectric energy, geothermal energy, and biomass 
energy. It is today widely accepted that using fossil fuels and the emission of GHGs is negatively impacting the world’s 
climate and ecosystem. Given the rapid population growth and increase in energy demands, investing in renewable 
energy is key for sustainable growth. IRENA (International Renewable Energy Agency) has put together a map called 
REmap to double the share of renewables by 2030 compared to 2010 and reach 36% in total final energy consumption 
globally. In its economic analysis of the REmap, IRENA shows that by doubling the shares of renewables in the global 
energy mix, four primary areas would be greatly impacted: the GDP, welfare, jobs, and the trade industry. The global 
GDP would increase by 0.6% to 1.1% equivalent to $700 billion $1.3 trillion. The welfare of humans will also increase 
by 3.7% due to the economic, social, and environmental impacts of renewable energy adoption. The global renewable 
energy job industry will increase by 24.4 million in 2030. Finally, the change to renewables will impact fuel importers 
and exporters by decreasing the coil imports by 50% and oil and gas imports by 70% while in parallel, the demand for 
investment goods and services such as solar panels, turbines, and construction materials will rise in trade. Thus, the

This study utilized a 7kW grid-connected rooftop PV system with 3kW/6kW of battery storage. The costs of the 
system as well as the electricity rates and energy consumption levels in household are state averages provided by the 
National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the U.S Energy Information Administration, respectively. Using the state 
averages, the study yielded a net present value of $6,333.01 which shows that a residential rooftop PV system is 
economically beneficial for homeowners. The PV system has also a payback period of 13 years, which is less than 
half the life of a PV system of approximately 30 years. The PV system also has an IRR of 8.61% and a profitability 
index of 1.31 which further shows that the investment is beneficial.  With the solar technology improving steadily 
over the years, the rooftop PV system costs are projected to further lower in costs, resulting in a lower initial 
investment, while the electricity rates are only increasing which results in higher savings in electricity rates. With the 
PV system costs focused on the 2020 costs, and with the assistance of federal, state and utilities incentives, the 
adoption of a rooftop PV system in a residential setting proves to be economically beneficial for the single-family 
homeowner in the State of Texas. 
6. Conclusions
This study examines the financial performance of a rooftop PV system in single-family homes in Texas. The costs 
and parameters used in this paper are only intended to represent the state of Texas and are not valid for other states 
within the United States due to the changes in costs, average residential energy consumption, electricity rates, and 
availability of solar resources. The environment impacts of the PV systems is not taken into consideration into this 
study, the profitability of the rooftop PV system is investigated from a purely economic perspective.  
The results of this study can be used for other types of homes and other PV systems sizes by using the average PV 
system costs provided in the analysis, as well as the average electricity rates in the state of Texas only. It can be used 
as a basis of financial or economic analysis for homeowners interested in adding a residential PV system to their 
residential properties to ensure their addition will be economically beneficial.

Manufacturing Setting

Abstract 
Capacity planning is one of the most challenging yet important activities for manufacturing companies. Several 
different forms or resources are required for operation, including both humans and equipment. Each of these resources 
has a finite capacity and must be allocated to address various projects. Spikes and lulls in resource usage result in 
inefficiencies, timeline delays, and reduced profitability. Understanding a manufacturing company’s resource 
capacities, planning their upcoming work, and strategically allocating those resources are essential for optimizing its 
production. This becomes an even more daunting task in a contract manufacturing setting because the company is 
reactionary to its customers’ placement of orders. It is rare to foresee the exact amount of incoming work, so how can 
contract manufactures improve their capacity planning to avoid drastic lulls and spikes in resource utilization? 
Customers may provide a demand forecast to the manufacturer, but this is not frequently available. The manufacturer 
may also attempt to draw insight from customer order patterns, but this can only usually be attempted on a few high-
order products. Multiple departments must be involved and provide input into forecasting, and the results affect 
multiple departments as well. However forecasting is accomplished, this expected workload must be systematically 
added to existing workload to understand the best way to allocate resources, take on or refuse new projects, and invest 
in resource capacity expansion. This paper aims to advise contract manufacturers on methods and metrics to effectively 
level-load their shops and increase their productivity levels.

1. Introduction
For a manufacturing company to run at its most efficient state, it must ensure that its resources are being allocated 
appropriately across all active projects. However, this is far easier said than done, especially in a contract 
manufacturing environment. Contract manufacturing is entirely dependent on customer orders. Traditional contracting 
involves a supplier detailing the payment scheme for a good or service depending on the customer’s choice of various 
parameters, such as quantities, lead-time, etc. (Bolton & Dewatripont 2005). Customers place purchase orders for 
desired parts and assign due dates based on their demand needs and the manufacturer’s quoted lead time. Beyond the 
initial quote, these quantities and due dates are typically independent of the manufacturer’s current workload and 
rarely involve input from the manufacturer prior to the order. The assumption by the customer is that the manufacturer 
will schedule this new order into its existing workload and deliver accordingly. 
Naturally, given that the work is entirely order-dependent, there will be spikes and lulls in a contract manufacturer’s 
workload. These spikes and lulls cause inefficiencies for the company and can result in late deliveries, quality issues, 
and reduced profitability. Various resources are required to accomplish any project. Some examples of common 
resources required in manufacturing are machines/equipment, machine operators, raw material, CNC programmers, 
engineers, inspectors, etc. Regardless of whether a resource is human or not, it inherently has a finite capacity. As 
work is brought in, these resources must be strategically allocated to accomplish each project. Once the amount of 
work on-hand exceeds the capacity limit of any given resources, the company must prioritize.

Executive-level engineering managers primarily focus on business strategy and growth. These individuals will be 
involved in the decision making of whether to invest in new equipment and capabilities. If future demand shows a 
consistent increase in turned product, the executives must investigate purchasing more lathes. If there appears to be a 
lot of potential work requiring a capability that is not currently done in-house, they may also investigate adding that 
capability to the company’s arsenal. These investments are risky to the business because they require substantial 
capital but are necessary for company growth. Having the foundation of an aggregate future demand forecast will help 
mitigate the inherent risks of investment and provide insight to the worthy investments to make. 
6. Conclusion
Capacity planning is a highly beneficial, but equally difficult exercise for contract manufacturing companies. Given 
that the manufacturer is typically in a reactionary position, it can often be a scramble to allocate the necessary resources 
required to accomplish tasks with the customer’s timeframe. This reactionary position can result in drastic lulls and 
spikes in workload. An inconsistent workload will cause inefficiencies that negatively impact productivity, 
performance, and profitability. Preemptively allocating those resources to anticipated incoming tasks would allow a 
company to better level its workload. 
Forecasting of incoming work can come directly from a customer. A customer-provided forecast is not always 
provided. However, when available, it can be assumed that the forecast is fairly accurate due to the customer’s insight 
into projected product demand. A manufacturer may be able to devise its own forecast of incoming orders by reviewing 
order history of certain products. Especially when referring to products that have a substantial order history, routine 
purchasing frequencies, and low market demand volatility, patterns may be noticed. These patterns can be used to 
anticipate future customer orders. A salesperson may also be able to provide insight to future demand fluctuations 
based on their market intelligence and customer interactions. A vendor-managed inventory system can be 
implemented for high-demand products. This allows a manufacturer to strategically utilize its resources to meet future 
product demand. It can choose to maximize efficiency by reducing setups and teardowns, or level-load its resources 
by making the product during lulls in other work. 
Once forecasts are devised, they must be effectively utilized. Adding anticipated workload to existing workload in an 
enterprise resource planning system is the most effective method of visualizing the expected resource demands. 
Engineering managers can then make decisions to strategically allocate these resources or invest in resource capacity 
expansion. Department managers can offer overtime or training sessions to account for spikes and loads in workload. 
New employees made be added to support a permanent increase in demand. Executive managers can mitigate the risks 
of investment in new equipment, resulting in sustainable company growth.

Abstract 
The aim for this research is to improve the mathematical abilities of young children through the internet-based program 
i-ready. The relevance of these comprehension skills for elementary school students is imperative. The abilities of
these students to interpret these mathematical theories and acknowledge the systematic approaches affiliated with the
processing of these essential ideologies are significantly improved with the use of mathematical coaching. These
students can utilize these comprehensive skillsets to decipher shapes, patterns, and numbers, while offering them a
means of processing this information and assisting them with their cognitive development. The process from which
the data was collected is through an observational online assessment tool i-ready. This software tracks and records the
student’s mathematic benchmarks. These benchmarks are the i-ready software’s mechanism for highlighting the
importance of analyzing student data to increase comprehension levels. This formative assessment was used to
measure these students’ comprehension, and with the assistance of analytical data, there was a strong correlation
between statistical analysis and increased comprehension levels. This statistical analysis was verified with the
assistance of both quantitative and qualitative inputs. This research will display that with the use of the i-ready
software, as a problem-solving technique, the student’s mathematical deficiencies could significantly decrease

1. Introduction
Math skills have taught us how to decipher our environments and surrounding. For children, the abilities affiliated 
with developing he competence to calculate, reason and problem solve can be challenging. Mathematics assists 
children in understanding the relationship between patterns and shapes in both a visual and cognitive sense. 
Mathematics can assist in the conveyance of thoughts, concepts, knowledge. This information is delivered via the use 
of numbers, diagrams, and charts. The young minds appreciation of these analytical, scientific, and numerical 
principles has been expressed in ways such as children’s music, literature, and art, thus providing another realm to the 
importance of mathematical cognition. There are several principles that surround mathematical computation in 
elementary school these include: 
•
The ability to count and understand basic numbers.
•
The ability of knowing when and where to use basic mathematical formulas.
•
The ability to perform basic mathematical calculations.
•
The ability to understand basic mathematical shapes.
Building on these required elementary level skills is imperative as it construct the foundation for mathematical literacy 
(Nagahi et a. 2019). The development of this mathematical knowledge directly correlates with the fundamentals and 
principles of critical thinking, problem-solving, and logic. With the use of i-ready these children could gain the 
cognitive mathematical skillsets to: 
•
Understand and decipher basic mathematical language
•
Understand and recognize and recreate basic mathematical patterns and shapes.
•
Understand, develop, and recognize numbers.
•
Understand basic mathematical computations.

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
This study should be replicated with different groupings of students to further validate the use of data analysis to 
increase student and comprehension levels at the elementary level. Further research could investigate daily or weekly 
changes in growth amongst students.  
In this study, data analysis was shown to have an undeniable impact on the increase of student achievement and 
elementary math comprehension levels. The data analysis gave the teacher an opportunity to see who her students 
where academically and meet them where they were.  
5.4 Validation 
Educational leaders take on duties such as overseeing team members, providing leadership, identify areas of growth 
and improvement, and inspecting processes (Hossain et al. 2020). Powerful educator’s layout curriculum and manage 
tasks all through the faculty 12 months. These initiatives are created specifically for students’ needs and are detailed 
and controlled in step with insanely strict guidelines. The pressure to conform to federal legislative requirements and 
district and state mandates have created a stressful situation for teachers (Jacobson 2016). One individual teacher will 
typically have a diverse group of students with a wide variety of skills and abilities. They must use differentiation 
techniques to guarantee a lesson or project is adapted to each student. They must communicate effectively with not 
only the students, but parents, administration, and colleagues. Educational leaders are the backbone of these students’ 
educational successfulness, and with the use of utilities such as the i-ready system, the students’ futures are endless. 
6. Conclusion
It is important to express that the i-ready software should only be utilized as a supplemental educational program to
assist teachers and encourage students, and this tool is not a resource for grading students. The mathematical skillsets
of the elementary level students are analyzed, observed, and corrected as deemed necessary by the educator. The use
of data analytics to decipher the deficiencies affiliated with our youth’s cognitive mathematics skills is the driving
force behind their growth and improvement. This information is not only privy to individuals who work in the technical
fields it is available as a resource for all whom have an interest. The same methodology and technologies utilized to
improve technical processes, can assist in improving a student comprehension levels, and promote student academic
growth. Data analytics is a tool that can and should be utilized in the classroom for cognitive growth, our students’
futures and the fate of mathematical cognition relies on this process. Mathematics and is principles are monumental
in our elementary aged children’s futures, and with programs such as i-ready, their cognitive mathematical skills can
flourish.

Abstract 
Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is being adopted worldwide by electric utilities because of the benefits 
offered by the automated meter data it provides. The utility industry has been exploring methods to best leverage the 
abundance of AMI data now available to maximize customer power quality and develop delivery efficiencies to reduce 
customer electricity rates. Utilities are required by regulations to provide power at voltage levels within a set 
bandwidth of the nominal delivery voltage to the customer. Variances in the voltage delivered by utilities can cause a 
multitude of issues for the individual customer and for the entire distribution grid system. AMI meters are capable of 
providing voltage data at frequent time intervals, a 1-hour interval sample and 15-minute interval sample are quite 
common. A DMAIC process can be developed to allow an electric utility to appropriately review and act upon the 
AMI voltage data available. In this paper the voltage specifications will be defined (D) and measurement (M) of data 
explained. Analysis (A) of the abundant data is an area of significance. Suggestions are made from the analysis to 
improve (I) the utility management of voltage issues and control (C) the distribution grid to better maintain within 
specifications.

1. Introduction
The electric utility industry has been aware for decades that significant benefits could be recognized from automating 
the reading of customer electric meters. The expected benefits included reduction of labor in reading meters, increase 
in accuracy of read data, and an increase in amount of data for electrical consumption and power quality analysis. 
Industry meter manufacturers developed Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) technologies to provide automated 
meter information to utility head-end servers (Ashok, et al., 2019). Another term that is commonly used to refer to 
AMI technologies is smart metering. Electric meters with AMI technology have the capability to measure parameters 
and variables with frequent reporting intervals. 1-hour intervals and 15-minute intervals are common for AMI (Ashok, 
et al., 2019). Smart meters record real-time data and allow for real-time pricing and distributed control of customer 
equipment (Joskow, 2012). Manual methods of meter reading provide only one data point per month and some utilities 
only read manually once per quarter or semi-annually. 
The utility industry has been exploring methods to best leverage this new abundance of data made available by AMI 
(Kemal, et al., 2020). The larger datasets are intended to be used to maximize customer power quality and satisfaction, 
while also improving delivery efficiencies to reduce customer electricity rates. Utilities are required by regulations to 
provide power at voltage levels within a set bandwidth of the nominal delivery voltage as measured at the point of 
delivery to the customer, typically +/- 5% (Fehr, 2005). The typical point of delivery is the electric utility meter. 
Variances in voltage delivered by utilities can cause a wide variety of issues for the individual customer. Voltage 
excursions can also cause macro level disturbances and excess costs.

6. Conclusion 
This paper presents a method to implement a DMAIC process for an electric utility to make use of AMI data to detect 
and improve voltage deviations in customer service voltage. Several potential causes for the voltage issues are 
presented, along with discussion of future grid modernization efforts that are expected to increase instability, 
magnifying the importance of a good detection and improvement program. A universal method is presented to use 
AMI data to initially locate problematic areas and then use meter recording devices to show confirmation that a voltage 
deviation of regulatory duration has occurred. Statistical methods are employed to allow for a practical understanding 
of the relationship between the AMI and field recorder data. The validated data is then used to continue with the 
DMAIC process to analyze the causes of the deviations. The improvements available range from equipment setting 
changes, to physical removal and reinstallation of transformers. Removal of services from overloaded transformers 
has proven to eliminate voltage problems. Industrial distribution problems may be more involved and problems from 
unstable modern devices like EV charging and renewable power contribution may require major distribution system 
redesigns and significant capital investment. The process recommendation is to implement KPIs to monitor 
effectiveness and maintain process gains into the future. Engineering management is an ideal field to lead the 
implementation of such a program and the methods used in an engineering management program are used in this 
paper. A program to detect and improve voltage violations will result in improved customer satisfaction with the 
utility, less risk of damage to equipment, and cost savings as the utilities deploy systems to reduce overall system 
peaks with frequent monitoring intervals ensuring customers remain in specification. A clear improvement in overall 
customer voltage quality is seen one year after implementation of this proposed program at an electric utility.

Abstract 
The objective of this paper is to outline a project path for the construction of a new parking lot in an Air Route Traffic 
Control Center (ARTCC). A conceptual framework is presented to guide the discussion based on how different Project 
Management (PM) tools were used throughout the project. A detailed explanation highlighting the challenges that 
were faced during the project execution phase and some of the lessons learned from the project are presented in this 
report. This article shows how PM principles were used to find the solutions for different problems during different 
stages of the project. It shows how a parking lot construction project can be managed by using different PM tools such 
as Scheduling, and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). It highlights on some of the most used terms in the construction 
industry that includes scope of work, change orders, Request for Information (RFI), etc. This article reflects that with 
the use of Project Management techniques it can assist with an efficient yet goal-oriented project.

1.Introduction
According to the US Bureau of Labor Statics, construction sector has a huge contribution in the economy. In 2020, 
4.3% of the GDP were attributable to this sector according to the Bureau. Construction projects like any other project 
have a set of objectives and constraints associated to these projects. These projects can range from a small home 
renovation to the construction of a very large highway or the airport. This report will delve into a construction project 
where the scope was to replace the entire parking lot in an ARTCC. The report will not address the design and 
procurement process of the project which was done prior to the contract being awarded and the construction was 
scheduled. Therefore, in order to achieve better management of complex systems problems, we need to adopt a more 
'systemic' approach ( Nagahi et al. 2019)A critical aspect pertaining to this project is management of the traffic flow 
in a 24-hour facility while the construction continued. Project management today is a flexible method for managing 
large or small endeavors (Meredith et al.  2017).  
The experience of project management must be analyzed in detail to understand the methods that corresponds to the 
specifics of these projects and can be used to effectively manage such projects under modern risks. The most common 
problems in managing a project include staying within budget, within time constraints, and within scope of the project 
(Meredith, Shafer & Mantel 2017). Weather is also an important factor that needs to be considered with this project. 
This project has specific limitations which state that this work must be performed under specific weather conditions. 
Communication with the stakeholders is another important aspect of this project since it is required to provide a two-
day notice before closing any area within the facility for construction purposes. These avenues of communication are 
imperative as a means of avoiding unforeseen circumstances that can arise during the construction process.

were starting to crack, these concrete sleeves had to be demoed and replaced. A flood test was performed to test the 
drainage of the water in new pavement. There was some insignificant ponding of water found in different locations 
which was not included in the punch list. But one location in phase 3 had a huge ponding of water during the flood 
test. This was a major issue and had to be fixed before closing out the project. About 20 sq. ft of the pavement in this 
area was milled and repaved. The grading of new pavement was carefully observed and as a result the issue of ponding 
was resolved. There were some rough surfaces mostly in the seam where two runs of asphalt came together. These 
spots were burned and coated with gator pave for smooth finish. In phase 5 area parking spaces were shown to be 10 
ft wide in the drawing but the striped parking spaces were only 9ft wide. These parking spots were pressure washed 
and new striping was painted with 10 ft wide parking spaces. Most of the manhole covers were covered with tack coat 
and asphalt which had to be cleaned off. After all the deficiencies listed in the punch list were fixed, the project was 
closed out and both parties signed off on the closing documents.  
5. Conclusion
It can be concluded from the study that the principles of PM used during each step of the project life were very helpful 
in the successful completion of the project. A team of qualified individuals having proper planning and resources in 
place were able to achieve the project goal successfully. These principles of PM can be used on any type of project 
but in the case of this construction projects it could’ve been the deciding factor in whether the project was deemed a 
success or a failure. It is important to formulate ideas and communicate them with other team members. Having a 
documented plan can help move the project in the right direction as this plan can be effectively communicated and the 
goals and objectives are easily identifiable. The study made it clear that the objectives can and will change during the 
life of the project. The goal should be to follow the plan as close as possible with the knowledge that adjustments will 
be made. This research suggests that when considering any changes to the objectives, this change should be analyzed 
and discussed on how it will affect the overall success of the project. This study also recognizes the value of each 
member of the team and the importance of teamwork in obtaining the projects goals. With the successful application 
of project management techniques, any project can be orchestrated flawlessly and with high standards.

Abstract 
The rapid adoption of increasingly affordable and capable unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) has highlighted their 
current value and future potential in a wide variety of applications across many different industries. Most study to date 
has focused on the most affordable and prolific class of small UAS which are legally restricted to flight in the limited 
low-altitude uncontrolled portion of the National Airspace System. Larger and more capable Group 3 and 4 UASs, as 
defined by the U.S. Department of Defense, are capable of operating in expanded flight envelopes, but current 
regulations prohibit unmanned flight in controlled airspace under the more dynamic visual flight rules that require 
independent deconfliction referred to as “sense-and-avoid”, which are required for the maturation of future civil and 
commercial UAS applications. This paper quantitatively analyzes the safety concerns and current mitigation efforts 
surrounding the proposed incorporation of larger group three and four UASs into controlled airspace under visual 
flight rules and concludes with recommendations for additional measures required to safely allow for future ubiquitous 
operation.

1. Introduction
The genesis of the UAS has deep militaristic roots, but ample opportunities exist for future commercial use (Banik 
2022). Much of the history of aviation has been related to its utility in transportation where the act of flying by itself 
is largely unimportant—a teleportation device, if available, would quickly supplant this segment. Meanwhile, 
significant opportunities exist that require persistent airborne presence. The lack of persons onboard means that sortie 
duration for a UAS is limited only by fuel load and not human factors such as fatigue (Shappell et al. 2007). A wide 
range of potential uses for UASs have been identified from aeromagnetic surveying to aiding search and rescue 
operations by locating persons lost in mountainous terrain (Cunningham et al. 2018; Karaca et al. 2018; Kerr 2020). 
As commercial UAS technology advances and becomes more attainable, larger airborne platforms will be required to 
carry the additional weight and supply adequate electrical power to more capable and complex payloads. Current UAS 
operations in the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS) are restricted by 14 C.F.R. § 107 to naked eye visual line-of-
sight (LOS) operations in uncontrolled airspace below 400 feet above ground level (AGL), and only apply to small 
UAS systems weighing less than 55 pounds.  
No current regulations allow for the systematic inclusion of UASs weighing more than 55 pounds, flight above 400’ 
AGL, or beyond line-of-sight (BLOS) operations. In order to achieve better management of complex systems 
problems, we need to adopt a more 'systemic' approach ( Nagahi et al. 2019). The vast majority of civil general aviation 
flights are typically conducted under flexible visual flight rules (VFR) that rely on visual navigation as the primary 
means of deconfliction, a concept termed by 14 CFR § 91.113 as “see and avoid”. With no certifiable means to either 
sense conflicting aircraft or avoid them, the issue of safely integrating larger unmanned aircraft into the NAS becomes 
quickly evident (Melnyk et al.  2014). However, recent changes implemented as part of the Federal Aviation

as successful avoidance maneuvering is deterministic and verifiable in nature. In their study, Tabassum and Semke 
found that ADS-B message drop-out to presented a hazardous or catastrophic outcome with ≤ 120 second look-ahead 
time at an incidence rate of 1.7935×10-5 to 1.5140×10-6 (Tabassum & Semke, 2018). A proposed pulse-Doppler radar 
for detection of non-cooperative aircraft with a beamwidth of 140° would provide for a probability of failed detection 
of non-cooperative aircraft of 3.88×10-3 in a head-on scenario. It is reasonable to assume that the probability of 
cooperative (ADS-B) message drop-out and failure of non-cooperative detection are independent events. Therefore, 
the probability of a UAS equipped with a traffic avoidance system using data from both ADS-B messages and a pulse-
Doppler radar for non-cooperative detection would be on the order of 10-8 to 10-9, an improvement on the historical 
VFR near-MAC incident rate by two to three orders of magnitude. 
5.4 Validation 
Studies and simulations are critical in convincing regulators to allow for progressively permissive regulations. The 
development and testing of experimental mechanisms to safely integrate UASs among manned aircraft is surely a 
laborious and profit-scarce journey. Should regulators be convinced of their safety, however, countless market 
opportunities exist for a variety of technical companies who exhibit prowess in the little-explored market of large 
commercial UAS platforms and payloads. Business leaders need to be convinced of the largely untapped burgeoning 
market surrounding large commercial UASs and numerous technical challenges, as discussed in part in this paper, 
surely serve to occupy the professional lives of numerous engineers from many disciplines. Engineering mangers are 
distinctively positioned to bridge the gap between government regulators, company executives, and engineering-
intensive research and development teams required to bring the large commercial UAS into safe, ubiquitous operation. 
Their reach into both the realm of technical and organizational uniquely situates the engineering manager to serve as 
a necessary catalyst for many future technological and pecuniary achievements. 
6. Conclusion
As the backbone of the FAA’s NextGen program, ADS-B provides a promising primary means of near-real time 
telemetry data for use in autonomous DAA systems in UASs. However, an avoidance system solely reliant on ADS-
B data presents an unacceptably high frequency of incident due to failed or untimely message delivery. To mitigate 
this risk and bring the probability of incident under the historical VFR near-MAC incident rate, a pulse-Doppler radar 
is proposed with a beamwidth of 140° degrees for the detection of non-cooperative aircraft. This proposed dual-source 
DAA system would safely allow for the integration of UASs into dynamic controlled airspace under VFR with an 
estimated probability of incident well below historical rates. 
It is important to highlight the criticality of a rigorous certification process for any UAS collision avoidance systems, 
analogous to current avionics certification processes. Where in a manned aircraft when all mechanical and electrical 
systems fail the pilot presents a final level of safety, a UAS is wholly dependent on constant successful operation of 
its avoidance systems and sensors to avoid other aircraft and not cause undue risk to persons or property. Redundancy 
is therefore vital in a UAS to ensure that any singular system or sensor failure does not cripple its ability to sense and 
avoid. As a last resort, standardized procedural deconfliction measures, such as having the UAS fly to a predetermined 
safe location and loiter indefinitely upon critical system failure, would further reduce risk.

Abstract 
Raw materials are the key to every manufacturing process, without raw materials or with inadequate quantities the 
entire production system could be in jeopardy. This is true for continuous manufacturing processes because the entire 
production system may be in a chemical manufacturing facility the packaging materials are equally if not of more 
importance than the raw material inputs since without adequate packaging materials to package the finished product 
there is no need for process inputs. The goal of manufacturers is to produce a maximum quantity of finished goods 
while ensuring customer satisfaction, which in turn maximizes profits. An efficient inventory management program 
is critical to maximizing production capabilities of a continuous production process, while minimizing production 
deficiencies. The objective of this study is to ensure proper levels of onsite supplies and/or materials while eliminating 
the issues that arise with the overstocking and/or under-stocking of these required inventoried items. Although there 
are several aspects that contribute to the controlling of onsite inventory throughout the production processes, the 
uncertainties affiliated with the supply chain, unprecedented inventory costs, and fundamentals of inventory are the 
greatest variables that effect any inventory management system. These components are analyzed and optimized to 
create an adequate program for inventory management within the manufacturing environment.

1. Introduction
Chemical manufacturing facilities are faced with constant production demand from customers and stakeholders. Often, 
the production demand becomes the focus of all personnel within the organization, however the focus must swing 
back to the initiation of the processes which involves the system inputs. Without proper levels of management 
pertaining to the material inputs there will be no production (Suwandi et al. 2018). The raw materials of any 
manufacturing facility are more important to the day-to-day operations then the production capacity regardless of the 
production demand. For every ounce of finished product that is produced by a manufacturing facility, there are likely 
a few if not hundreds of raw materials which must be sourced and inventoried for that process. With the increase in 
the individual raw materials that are used in any manufacturing process, each one is a potential source of non-
conformance which could eventually impact the final product and thus the production demand (Rajeev 2008). The 
packaging department of any manufacturing facility is often undervalued due to its critical aspect pertaining to the 
production process. Proper inventory management is required for packaging materials since it directly affects the 
management of finished goods.  
A continuous production chemical plant which has been in operation for more than fifty years will be used as the 
model to develop an effective inventory management program for raw packaging materials. This plant began operation

using raw materials (Rawat 2015). The basic key factors to improving inventory management include a positive 
management attitude, adequate training for employees, and effective communication with vendors (Norazira et al. 
2018).  The site currently employs SAP as an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to manage the production 
and inventory of raw materials and finished goods. Although this system has been quite effective in the raw chemical 
and finished product inventories, the management of packaging materials has not been as effectively managed through 
this system, and the availability of the functionality alone is not enough to make an effective system (Rawat 2015). 
Ideally a system such as SAP would maintain an exact inventory, however SAP is only as effective as it is allowed to 
be, if inventory is used or disposed of and SAP is not updated with the change in inventory, the information in SAP 
will not be correct. To address this, the site must define a process to ensure all inventory is always accounted for in a 
way that is easily managed by all site employees. Ideally an inventory management system, such as SAP, would be 
used and inventory would theoretically be properly accounted for and planned for which would take all factors into 
account to essentially “know” when to reorder. However, there is often a gap between the inventory management 
system and the production planning system and when these systems are not seamlessly integrated, there is an increase 
in opportunities for errors and inaccuracies in the data (Lee 1992). Because of the increased potential for errors, it is 
often unreasonable to forecast production for more than a month at a time to prevent over or under stocking packaging 
material inventories (Lee 1992).  
 
Costs affect every aspect of a manufacturing company and is often the value by which success is measured, it is always 
ideal to optimize cost efficiency in any way possible. Inventory is often overlooked as a source of cost savings; 
however, it is often a key point in need of optimization. For a system to increase in cost effectiveness, identification 
of each component and how much of an impact they have on the inventory levels would be the best starting point.  
Often production quality problems create unplanned uncertainty in inventories, especially for packaging materials as 
work in process materials may be created and then reworked, which then incurs the cost of packaging twice. 
Additionally, forecast and production uncertainty always increase costs of raw packaging material inventories, either 
by increasing holding costs of inflated inventories or of costs associated with stockouts. Finally, inadequacies of 
supplier lead times or production times are a major driving force for inventory levels and can be very cost ineffective, 
as the investment costs and holding costs of inflated inventories can be quite large and offer no return on the 
investment.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The supply chain issues are the most difficult to overcome due to the number of players involved in the chain, upstream 
and downstream from the manufacturer. Additionally, supply chain is maintained on a global scale and must be 
addressed likewise, leading individual sites to have to adjust to allow for the variable lead times and other supply 
chain impacts when managing inventory. Although the site cannot directly affect the supply chain, the impacts of it 
can be seen directly at the site, from inconsistent lead times to delayed delivery of products to customers.  
 
These things can be exceedingly difficult for the company since the cost of the raw materials has already been spent, 
however the raw materials may not be received until several months later affecting the company’s cashflow. Some of 
the key components that contribute to the uncertainty associated with the supply chain include, lead times, delivery 
conditions, transit times, demand, and manufacturing production delays or rework (Lee 1992). The initial step that 
must be made to reduce these supply chain issues would be to identify the exact sources of variability and to track the 
extent to which each of these variables affect the site specifically (Lee 1992). The site currently maintains and responds 
to supply chain uncertainty well by adjusting inventory levels to prevent potential stockouts, to make a more effective 
inventory management program the site must directly address the root causes of the supply issues starting with the 
addressing suppliers directly (Lee 1992). Although this may be easier said than done in an industrial manufacturing 
facility, every step in the right direction can only help move away from the current ineffective system. An improved 
inventory management system, or an improvement in the integration of an existing inventory management system 
could provide cost savings, overcome an unreliable supply chain, and increase sustainability of the production system.

Abstract 
ForecasƟng sales revenues for global airlines is challenging in pracƟce because the pandemic since 2019

spread of coronavirus. Recently, several countries reopen their borders to fully vaccinated travelers and 
allow their business or leisure travels. In pracƟce, sales forecasƟng for airlines is closely related to market 
demand and capacity planning for ﬂeets. To the best of our knowledge, rare studies addressed the 
selecƟon of key predictors composed of domesƟc economic indicators, global market condiƟons, and

mulƟnaƟonal airlines composed of CEA and CSA in China, CA and EVA in Taiwan, and JAL and ANA in Japan. 
Industrial cases show internaƟonal passengers and oil price are two common factors to aﬀect sales 
revenues. Due to the emerging demand for cargo shipping, CA and EVA perform the best in operaƟonal 
eﬃciencies during the pandemic. The required reducƟon of full-Ɵme employees and operaƟng expenses 
are respecƟvely suggested. Increasing revenue and RPK (revenue-passenger-kilometer) are speciﬁcally

Abstract 
Given the increasing concerns about the adverse effects attributable to climate change, two imperatives of the 
sustainability paradigm are to reduce pollution and CO2 footprint, especially in the energy-intensive mining, mineral 
processing and beneficiation sectors of industry. Thus, a major challenge in minerals processing is to optimize the 
energy consumption of unit operations. In principle, this requires the utilization of all data and information that fully 
characterize the dynamics of all material and physical elements which constitute the organization that operates an ore 
crushing and screening process. By analyzing available data and information, this paper highlights how the variability 
in ore quality influences the energy of crushing and screening operations in a case study comminution facility. The 
empirical findings reinforce the need to apply robust models based on implementation of 4IR technologies to provide 
better information for decision making; in this case, towards continuous optimization of energy consumption to lower 
pollution and the CO2 footprint of comminution unit operations.

1.Introduction
A pragmatic approach to dealing with increasing concerns about the adverse effects attributable to climate change is
to reduce pollution and the CO2 footprint of industrial activities, especially in energy intensive mining and mineral
processing operations. Iron ore mining is typically characterized by hard rock and the mining process creates pollution
in the environment and ecology. The hard rock has to be comminuted (re: Dixit et al. 2018) in order to extract the
mineral content from the run-of-mine (ROM). The collateral pollution arising from the comminution facilities
represents a complementary issue to the challenge of CO2 footprint.
The aforementioned complimentary issue to the challenge of CO2 footprint in hard rock mining operations is attributed 
to the dry crushing and screening comminution processes that produces excessive quantities of dust pollution that is 
released to the immediate environment due to processing variable paramagnetic ore which further contributes to poor 
crusher energy efficiency. Kameristaya and Basamykina (2021) defines crusher energy efficiency as the utilization of 
less energy for the same activity to achieve similar output. It is important to note that crusher energy efficiency and 
comminution energy efficiency terms are used interchangeably in this report. 
Although comminution facilities are typically established taking into consideration the nature of the ore (Connelly 
2013), however, a primary challenge is to continuously optimize energy consumption coupled with reduction in CO2 
footprint during minerals processing operations. In the processing of ROM ore, the effectiveness of operations strongly 
depends on the energy efficiency of crushing. Crushing is foremost to ore comminution unit operations and contributes 
significantly to mining operational costs, pollution and CO2 footprint. The energy consumption of a comminution 
facility is influenced by factors such as the type of crusher design and the type of run-of-mine (ROM) material 
processed through the crushing circuit (Napier-Munn 2005). Thus, it is important to invest in methods that improve 
the energy efficiency of crushers concurrently with reducing and minimizing operational costs, pollution, and CO2 
footprint during minerals processing operations.  
Curiously, the continuous variability in ROM ore is often taken for granted in programs that seek to optimize the 
energy efficiency of crushers in comminution facilities. With a focus on the crushing process, the case study discussed 
in this paper examines how the continuous variability in ROM ore influences energy efficiency of a comminution 
facility. The research study objective is outlined in section 2, the literature review is briefly articulated in the following

Abstract 
The study aims to understand how collected data from the Assembly Wire Bond manufacturing line and enterprise 
systems can lead to insights regarding the relationship of overtime rate to manufacturing KPIs: output attainment, 
utilization, and absenteeism. Using CRISP-DM as the data mining methodology, approximately 3.8 million records 
for attendance, 25.7 million for lot transactions, and 546.2 million for machine utilization were extracted, transformed, 
and summarized into weekly buckets, resulting in three hundred fifteen (315) samples from the five (5) selected 
packages, representing 97% of the total volume. The samples were subjected to Multiple Linear Regression and 
Pearson Correlation to determine whether there was a significant relationship between Overtime Rate and the 
manufacturing KPIs. Results show that Overtime Rate exhibits a statistically significant relationship with all the 
variables (P < 0.05) for the overall setup. Violations of the regression assumptions are probably due to model 
misspecification: other variables can more effectively explain the behavior of the overtime rate, as indicated by the 
low R-squared values. In contrast, only selected variables are considered significant across the results by package. 
These differences can be attributed to the different environmental conditions of semiconductor processes and 
manufacturing lines.

1. Introduction
Globalization and highly competitive business environments are pushing many organizations to realize numerous 
productivity improvement efforts to continue to survive. With stiffening global competition, companies strive for ways 
to gain a competitive advantage by optimizing and improving their production (Huang et al. 2003). To stay 
competitive, manufacturing companies must have productive facilities (Fleischer et al. 2006). This would be possible 
if the production losses were identified and eliminated so that the manufacturers could bring their products to the 
market at a minimum cost (Muchiri and Pintelon 2008).

For OVERALL, Attainment exhibits a POSITIVE relationship, while AbsentRate and Utilization show a NEGATIVE 
relationship. The P-values for all predictors are less than 0.05, implying that their correlation with OTRate is 
statistically significant. 
 
For PACKAGE A, Utilization exhibits a POSITIVE relationship, while AbsentRate and Attainment show a 
NEGATIVE relationship. The P-value for AbsentRate is less than 0.05, implying that its correlation with OTRate is 
statistically significant. 
 
For PACKAGE B, Attainment and Utilization exhibit a POSITIVE relationship, while AbsentRate shows a 
NEGATIVE relationship. The P-values for AbsentRate and Attainment is less than 0.05, implying that their correlation 
with OTRate is statistically significant. 
 
For PACKAGE C, Attainment exhibits a POSITIVE relationship, while AbsentRate and Utilization show a 
NEGATIVE relationship. The P-values for AbsentRate and Attainment is less than 0.05, implying that their correlation 
with OTRate is statistically significant. 
 
For PACKAGE D, All of the predictors exhibit a POSITIVE relationship. The P-value for Utilization is less than 0.05, 
implying that its correlation with OTRate is statistically significant. 
 
For PACKAGE E, Attainment and Utilization exhibit a POSITIVE relationship, while AbsentRate shows a 
NEGATIVE relationship. The P-values for AbsentRate and Attainment is less than 0.05, implying that their correlation 
with OTRate is statistically significant. 
 
The relationship between the response and predictor variables fluctuates across packages. This can be attributed to the 
different semiconductor processes and manufacturing line environmental conditions in producing the specific 
packages. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Research 
Using three hundred fifteen (315) samples gathered from the five (5) selected packages, representing 97% of the total 
volume, the authors have performed Multiple Linear Regression and Pearson Correlation to determine whether there 
was a significant relationship between Overtime Rate and the following manufacturing KPIs: Absenteeism, 
Attainment, and Utilization.  
 
With the results obtained from Multiple Linear Regression, it can be concluded that Overtime Rate exhibits a 
statistically significant relationship with all of the aforementioned variables for the overall setup. In contrast, only 
selected variables are considered significant across the regression models by package. Pearson Correlation also 
revealed that each setup resulted in various behaviors between the response and the predictors. These differences can 
be attributed to the different environmental conditions of semiconductor processes and manufacturing lines. 
 
Violations of the regression assumptions are probably due to model misspecification, which indicates that other 
variables can more effectively explain the behavior of the overtime rate, as indicated by the low R-squared values. To 
properly model the Overtime rate in the OSAT manufacturing industry, the authors advise looking into additional 
production KPIs and process environmental factors, such as the man-machine ratio (MMR), machine output rate, cycle 
time, or machine count. In order to adequately normalize the data and provide more reliable statistical modeling, it is 
also advised to incorporate additional samples.

1. Introduction
The University of the Philippines Diliman Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research (UPD 
DIE/OR) is a regional and national leader in providing world-class industrial engineering education, research, and 
development toward continuous improvement in productivity, quality, and robustness in manufacturing, service 
industry and information systems. It is one of the eight departments and institutes in the UP Diliman College of 
Engineering that offer undergraduate and graduate programs recognized by universities around the world. 
The department was started in 1965 offering the degree of B.S. Industrial Engineering under the supervision of the 
Department of Mechanical Engineering. In 1971, the DIE/OR was officially established, becoming the newest 
department of the College. In line with its goal of maintaining and exceeding expectations as the Center of Excellence 
in Industrial Engineering education and research in the Philippines, it continues to produce highly qualified global 
industrial engineering professionals, to conduct continuous and progressive research and development outputs and 
publications, and to create productive institutional linkages with industry, academe, and the government. Today, the 
DIE/OR offers three programs namely, the Bachelor of Science (BS) in Industrial Engineering, Master of Science 
(MS) in Industrial Engineering, and the Master of Engineering (MEngg) in Industrial Engineering. 
With a yearly average intake of 110 undergraduate students and 10 graduate students, the DIE/OR is still susceptible 
to a lower average of BS and MS/MEngg graduates compared to its number of intake. The BS program experiences 
an average of 91 graduates per year contrary to its intake while the MS/MEngg program suffers an average of 4 students 
per year. Based on further student interviews (Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research 2021), 
it is revealed that for the graduate students, reasons vary from not being able to complete their thesis and special 
projects because of insufficient exposure to conducting research.  
During the 1st Semester Academic Year (AY) 2022-2023, 32.65% of the BS IE students suffered failing grades for 
courses which prevented them from taking the next step of their program. It was observed that such a high failing 
percentage was due to students lacking access to various learning resources, supplemental materials, adjustment to

The responses are described by Figure 9. Overall, respondents say that knowledge contents of DennIE are indeed 
useful, has potential in helping in studies and can be supplementary to the current learning system (at least 80% of 
respondents). Other observations are as follows: 
•
90% of the respondents say that they at least agree that the information content of DennIE are
indeed relevant to what they do in their current studies.
•
However, it is important to know that a significant 7.50% and 27.50% at least disagree and
neither Agree nor Disagree that the information content are timely. This may indicate that the
information content may not be needed at the current time and that the initial knowledge
uploaded are not current or new knowledge. The researchers agree that time and user contribution 
is need for DennIE to have more knowledge.
•
Lastly, 15% say they at least disagree that information content is currently accurate. When asked, 
the corresponding respondents stipulated that system should have reviewers on the knowledge
to be uploaded. It was furthered suggested that these reviewers are credible and preferred to be
faculty members. The researchers, at the time of testing, included a faculty member who reviews
and approves the knowledge uploaded. This may have to be further enhanced and include more
credible and expert reviewers.

6. Conclusion
This paper proposed a low-cost knowledge management system (DennIE) that enables supporting and 
supplementing higher learning education particularly, in the Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
Research. DennIE’s goal is to assist the department in enabling in and out of class knowledge be accessible to the 
IE community. Knowledge such as technological, procedural, and conceptual can be submitted, approved, stored, 
and shared. This helps in supplementing student education by further enriching and widening educational resources. 
DennIE was designed and built using a relational database management system and Python programming language 
for its user-interface. DennIE was deployed in Heroku which proved to very cost-effective by taking advantage of 
the free-tier packages. 
A group of users were asked to test and use DennIE for a period of 1 month. A customer satisfaction and 
effectiveness survey were conducted and generated promising results in DennIE’s functionality, information

needs to have a lot of active users to increase the number of knowledges uploaded. This recommendation is 
expected to foster the sharing of knowledge to its intended audience. Future improvements based on the feedback 
are planned and will be implemented by the proponents.

Abstract 
Along with the evolution of information technology, various types of data can be gleaned with new methods. These 
comprise satellite images, Internet log information, text information exchanged through IoT (Internet of Things) 
devices, SNS, among others. Collectively, the gleaned data are called ""alternative data."" While a large amount of data 
is available, the characteristics of most of these have yet to be determined. Here, the characteristics mean survey errors 
intruded by the survey method and biases due to the sampling method from the sample population. Statistical data and 
settlement data generally announced by governments and companies are corrected on the basis of these characteristics, 
and the analysis is conducted taking into account this limitation. In this study, the impact of information from SNS on 
the market is assessed, followed by the nature of ""alternative data."" During this analysis, the characteristics of 
alternative data are focused on. We analyze the correlation between the appearance rate of keywords that frequently 
posted on SNS and the stock indices of industries. Whether or not SNS can be a market sensor is a primary interest. 
This motivates to implement the following methods: a program code is implemented to collect messages automatically 
related to specific keywords posted on SNS. During the period from April 18 to June 23, 2022, texts are collected 
associated with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine including the keyword “Russia,” along with the corresponding 
posting date and time. The total number of data with this condition was 2,513,610. A multi-dimensional scaling is 
applied to the obtained data. The words that often appear simultaneously side by side are visually significant. Relying 
on this, clusters are identified to these words, then several words emerged as key features. The aforementioned data 
are first classified into two types; ""war"" and ""economy."" Then 2,000 data are selected from these to categorize as 
either 'positive,' 'negative,' or 'neutral.' A supervised learning on the neural network is applied to these data. On this 
network, the remaining data are classified into three categories. The accuracy of this classification appeared mostly 
accurate. The preliminary experiments yield the following implications: 1: Information retrievable from SNS impacts 
economic indicators in real time, 2: The approximate time-lag from posting on SNS to the market is some one hour. 
These results may conclude that SNS is useful as a market sensor. The proposed method realizes the analysis of big 
data obtained from SNS. This devised method is cost-effective and would be handy for small business owners.

Abstract 
As the world recovers from the pandemic, the demand for air travel is also slowly recovering to 
pre-pandemic levels. However, complaints are filed here and there regarding the inefficiencies in 
different aspects of the aviation industry. One of them is the hassle in the proximity of the boarding 
gate assignments. There are several factors that affect boarding gate assignments in airports, such 
as availability, capacity, location, turnaround time, departure and arrival time, operating costs, etc. 
When mistakes happen, delays and difficulties follow, also causing a domino effect in the airlines’ 
flight schedule as a whole. In this study, a mixed integer linear programming model is developed 
to minimize waiting or idle times for the airplanes, as well as passenger walking distance. In 
decreasing these idle times, associated costs can also be lowered and flight schedules can be made 
more stable and efficient. This could increase the customer satisfaction from the passengers, which 
eventually leads to customer loyalty, good word-of-mouth, and returning customers. An 
hypothetical case study is solved to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed model. A goal 
programming approach is used to efficiently optimize the system’s objectives simultaneously. 
Finally, a scenario analysis is performed to understand the behavior of the system under varying 
conditions.

Abstract 
Dry ports play a significant role in the overall supply chain by functioning as a gateway for inbound (import) and 
outbound (export) cargos dominantly for land-linked countries. Dry port sustainability helps to reduce waste and 
costs, to shorten lead time and to ensure economic, social and environmental sustainability in the trade supply chain. 
This paper presents a bibliometric analysis of 386 published articles in the last 15 years to analyse the overall scope 
of research conducted in the areas of port sustainability. The study uses bibliometric analysis to identify some of the 
top authors, journals, and key research topics. Finally, network analysis is used to pinpoint crucial study subjects and 
potential areas for future studies.

Abstract 
During the COVID-19 pandemic. the Online Food Delivery Service Applications (OFDSA) has grown tremendously. 
The applications facilitate online ordering and delivery of food to the users’ doorstep. This research investigates the 
determinant factors that affect the continuance intention to use the OFDSA in the new normal era. The data was 
collected from an online questionnaire distribution on a sample of 200 OFDSA users in Manila. The collected data 
was analyzed with the Structural Equation Modeling technique using SmartPLS 3 software. Findings reveal that habit 
and perceived use of use were significant in determining users’ OFDSA attitudes. While the variety of food choices 
and perceived usefulness do not contribute to the attitude toward behavior. The attitude toward behavior has a positive 
and significant to continuance intention to use OFDSA. This research contributes to the body of knowledge on 
consumer behavior toward the continuance intention of OFDSA in the new normal era and also insights for online 
food delivery service providers to enhance their business and retain users with the support of the application even after 
the COVID-19 pandemic.

Major Challenges to Formal E-waste Management Systems 
in Developing Countries

Abstract 
Most third-world nations struggle mightily to establish functional e-waste management systems. Electrical and 
electronic equipment (EEE) surpluses from developed countries are easily exported to developing countries and 
largely populated countries. After its end of life (EOL), the transported and their own generated EEE becomes e-
waste, a growing source of concern for developing countries. Because of the serious consequences to people's health 
and the environment, informal e-waste management techniques have emerged as a major challenge for authorities and 
other interested parties in developing countries like India. In developing nations, there are few formal recyclers and 
legislation to manage e-waste, which gradually reduces the harmful impact on the environment. Nonetheless, there 
have been various impediments to the endeavour to embrace a formal e-waste management system. The research aims 
to catalogue and rank the most significant challenges (impediments) faced by the formal e-waste management system 
in developing countries. A DEMATEL (MCDM) approach is applied to eleven impediments which are identified by 
extensive literature review and institutional experts’ opinions. The study determined that ""Lack of awareness of the 
harmful effects of unregulated e-waste recycling,"" ""Low incentive package for formal e-waste recovery,"" ""Lack of 
Training empowerment,"" ""Insufficient funds for a formal e-waste recycling management system,"" ""Lack of corporate 
social responsibility initiatives,"" and ""Lack of awareness of the cost of returning in formal e-waste recycling"" were 
the most significant and influential causes of the problem. Also, the factor found to be most effective for the current 
formal e-waste management system is the “Large Ideal duration for formal e-waste value recovery.” This research has 
the potential to help policymakers in a developing nation with a large population create an effective e-waste 
management system.

1. Introduction
As a consequence of alterations in cultural norms and technical advancements, our dependence on electronic and 
electrical gadgets has risen. Numerous electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) obsolescence rate has grown as a 
result of the rapid and intelligent improvements and changes in technology that have shortened their lifespan (Garg 
2021). In recent years, population increase, technological enhancement, and consumers' ravenous want for new 
products or gadgets directed the rise of e-waste (Qu et al. 2019). It is difficult to collect, transport, sort, treat and 
dispose of electronic waste because it comprises both hazardous and non-hazardous components (Wang et al. 2017). 
Numerous industrialized countries have devised and implemented e-waste management processes since it has been 
recognized that unofficial e-waste management activities are the main reason for the release of hazardous substances 
(Wang et al. 2017, Schumacher and Agbemabiese 2019). The institutionalization of e-waste management methods is 
elaborated as the utilization of trained employees, cutting-edge technology, innovative systems, and processes that 
may recover valuable elements from discarded electronic devices without compromising human health and the 
environment (Qu et al. 2019).  
According to the report ""Global E-waste monitor"" (Forti et al. 2020), the world will create around 74.7 million metric 
tonnes of WEEE by 2030, up from 53.6 million metric tonnes in 2020 and future, it will increase exponentially (Kumar 
et al. 2022). The most discouraging aspect is that just one-fifth of all e-waste is handled and recycled, and the remains 
are sent to open burning and landfills. The developed country has successfully developed sustainable solutions for the 
expanding mountain of electronic waste while simultaneously assuring the effective recovery of vital metals and 
minerals without upsetting the delicate environmental balance (Garg 2021). Developing countries have failed to 
establish appropriate policies to address the issue of e-waste reduction and management. Electronic waste is one of

5.2 Graphical Results 
The cause-and-effect relationship diagram is shown in Figure 4, where Y-axis and X-axis represent Ri-Cj and Ri+Cj. 
The interconnectedness of the different challenges has been evaluated with the help of expert opinion. Three 
respondents, including academics and domain experts, have been consulted for their knowledge. 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The management and practice implications of these findings are enormous. The study begins by laying the framework 
for the understanding of the key factors that influence the effective and efficient formal e-waste management sector. 
The conclusions of this study regarding possible impediments to e-waste management may serve as a thorough 
checklist for tackling all the most significant issues in this field. Second, our study illuminates the several dimensions 
of e-waste management that policymakers must consider. This will assist policymakers in examining all important 
aspects and their impacts, so enabling the establishment of enhanced and long-term strategies for formal e-waste 
management. The structural decision model proposed, which is based on DEMATEL, enables the discovery of these 
tangential relationships between distinct impediments. 
The ramifications of these findings for management and practice in formal sectors are significant. The study begins 
by identification of the impediments to the understanding of essential characteristics that have an impact on formal e-
waste management systems. The conclusions of this research regarding possible impediments to formal e-waste 
management may serve as a full checklist. Second, our study illuminates the multiple aspects of e-waste management 
that policymakers must consider. In order to fulfil the requirements of formal e-waste management systems in 
developing countries, this will also assist policymakers in examining all relevant aspects and their impacts so they 
may make educated, strategic decisions. The proposed structural choice model, which relies on DEMATEL, facilitates 
the identification of causal links between diverse impediments. The research also provides a framework for 
policymakers to consider the many obstacles to formal e-waste management. 
The primary objective of the e-waste management system is to minimize costs, ensure that waste is properly used to 
develop resources, reduce environmental contamination, and increase e-waste recovery operations and revenue. The 
following suggestions are made for the improvement of formal e-waste challenges in developing nations, based on the 
aforementioned findings: 
•
The government must organize, at regular intervals, campaigns to raise awareness of e-negative waste's
environmental impact.
•
Collectors of formal e-waste should recruit local garbage pickers/collectors to improve the supply of formal
e-waste to formal recycling services. The integration of existing informal e-waste management collectors
and recycling facilities may lessen the environmental impact.
•
The government should give appropriate incentives for e-waste management methods and collectors so that
a motivating atmosphere may be maintained via them.
6. Conclusion
This research aims to identify and analyse the impediments to successful formal e-waste management in developing 
countries. Key impediments to the proper management of electronic waste have been identified by analysing the 
existing literature and inputs from domain experts. Their interaction strengths were analysed using the DEMATEL 
framework, and the resultant e-waste impediments were categorized according to their natures (cause and effect). The 
study determined that ""Lack of awareness of the harmful effects of unregulated e-waste recycling,"" ""Low incentive 
package for formal e-waste recovery,"" ""Lack of Training empowerment,"" ""Insufficient funds for a formal e-waste 
recycling management system,"" ""Lack of corporate social responsibility initiatives,"" and ""Lack of awareness of the 
cost of returning in formal e-waste recycling"" were the significant and influential causes of the problem facing by the 
formal e-waste management system. For successful formal e-waste management, governments must pay greater 
attention to the obstacles. Due to the influence, it might have on the overall structure, the establishment of a barrier 
between cause groups is essential. Moreover, this study's results have consequences for the infrastructure of e-waste 
management. From effect segment, “Large Ideal duration for formal e-waste value recovery,” “Limited human 
resources for formal recycling centres,” “Insufficient supply of e-waste at formal recycling centres,” “Less formal e-
waste collectors/Pickers,” “High setup and operational cost” are found effective for the management of formal e-waste 
sectors.

The framework was formulated by considering India a country with similar circumstances to all developing countries. 
Also, the impediments were identified by overviewing the overall system and supply chain of the formal e-waste 
system, particular network research can enhance the system from the root level, consider as the limitations of this 
study. The fuzzy or grey-based MCDM technique as the opinion and decision are uncertain in such a complicated 
management system. There will be various challenges and arguments throughout the implementation of each of these 
requirements. In future studies, researchers may investigate these difficulties.

Abstract 
Key performance indicators (KPIs) are the mainstream performance measurement methods for enterprises nowadays. 
The results measured by KPIs provide a key point for enterprises to improve strategically and operationally as well as 
highlight an analytical basis for decision-making. By quantifying the key parameters defined by the enterprise itself 
within a certain period of time, the indicators that are able to reflect the current state and performance can be obtained. 
This study aims to provide a tree-like KPI structure with a clear definition and hierarchical relationship for enterprises 
to identify and analyze performance. Through a comprehensive literature review, a multi-level KPI structure that 
combined a group of 34 KPIs that was introduced in ISO22400 and other important indicators in related literature is 
proposed. Besides, the supporting elements used for calculating KPIs are also defined in this study for investigating 
the relationships and connections between different KPIs. Such a study can also enable enterprises to implement a 
hierarchical intelligent dashboard to visualize a real-time situation based on the proposed KPI structure.

Lowering Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) in Responding to 
System Downtime or Outages: An Application of Lean Six 
Sigma Methodology

Abstract 
The longer a software or computer system service is down, the more it costs the IT organization and the more frustrated 
users become. The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that are responsible for the high-resolution 
timekeeping capabilities in responding to System Downtime or Outages. A Lean Six Sigma DMAIC framework is 
often used in large software companies to improve the speed at which incidents are resolved. This framework follows 
the DMAIC methodology, which stands for Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control. The study discusses the 
potential use of the Six Sigma methodology to improve the efficiency of an IT incident management process. 
Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used to analyze the results obtained from the company's case 
study. The analysis showed that the use of both methods was beneficial. Results show the main reasons for the high 
MTTR are the availability of the Engineers or Specialists for functional escalation and the skill set of these individuals. 
This constraint gives a major factor for the delay in the acknowledgment of paging alerts, leads to subsequent 
reassignments of the critical ticket to another person until someone is available to go online and respond, and 
contributes highly to resolution time. To improve the high-accuracy time and identify the influencing factors, a cause-
and-effect diagram and data analysis were performed using recorded incident tickets that were flagged as a critical or 
system-wide issues. The statistical analysis of the obtained results showed which factors influence the effectiveness 
of the process. A predictive model of the DMAIC methodology was developed to help predict the resolution time of 
incident tickets at a company. This model helps to quantify how other factors (such as the severity of the incident, the 
number of involved parties, and the amount of information available) affect the length of time it takes to resolve an 
incident.

1. Introduction
Six Sigma is a system of quality management practices that aims to identify and eliminate defects (items that are not 
part of the intended population). It has been widely adopted by businesses as an essential component of quality 
assurance programs. The process of reducing defects below 3.4 per million opportunities was pioneered by Bill Smith 
at Motorola in 1986 ( (Smith & Mobley 2008). The Lean Six Sigma methodology is a data-driven process used in the 
design, improvement, and management of processes and systems. It helps to improve the efficiency and effectiveness 
of these systems by identifying and correcting problems early (Dasig  2017).  In this paper, a case study of an IT 
company that is known for providing computer-based financial data and analysis for financial professionals requires 
the Technology experts’ personnel or Technical Solutions Engineers (TSE) to meet the demands of clients’ queries 
reaching out on the helpdesk for technology-related assistance. Technical Solutions Engineers (TSE) primarily cover 
24/7 support in handling calls, emails, and internal tickets from the client’s all around the world. One of the most 
crucial scopes of support that the TSE team handles is to respond to and monitor the System Wide Emergency or 
outage incidents or tickets. Once the ticket has been tagged in a Critical status, it means a serious issue is defined as a 
problem (e.g., bug or incident, not an enhancement request) that is impacting a client or trial’s company workflow to 
the point where existing or new revenue is at risk, typically totaling at least $100,000 (USD) ASV. The goal of the

5. Summary and Conclusion 
Six Sigma DMAIC methodology has been successful in improving the overall process to reduce the MTTR. This 
methodology focuses on continuous improvement and strives for continuous improvement. This continuous 
improvement leads to a shorter MTTR, which in turn leads to a more efficient and effective process. One important 
point to note in this case is that simple solutions were successful in achieving the desired results, without any additional 
cost or investment required from the company. The Ease of Doing/Impact Matrix table shows the ease of performing 
different actions and the impact those actions have. It is a helpful tool for decision-makers who want to know which 
actions are easiest and most effective. Having clearly defined roles and responsibilities is key to managing incident 
response and reducing MTTR in this study. The EOC is responsible for managing incidents and adapting and 
improving the process as necessary. ECT1 is a single point of contact for end users reporting service outages. This 
group is responsible for classifying incidents and routing them to the appropriate second-line support personnel if the 
first-line support is unable to resolve the incident. They also monitor repair activities and update users on the incident 
status. ECT2 technicians typically have more advanced knowledge than first-line support staff. This is because ECT2 
technicians have undergone additional training in the field. First-line support staff, on the other hand, are typically 
less experienced than ECT2 technicians. Therefore, frontline support personnel may be enlisted to help with incidents 
that first-line support can't resolve. And the Product Specialist and Software Dev Support responders are the main 
ones responsible for interacting with third-party software or hardware vendors to help quickly restore normal service. 
 
From the Statical Data Analysis, it was proven that the selected factors can diminish the hours in resolving system-
wide incidents tickets and their impact are significantly relevant in lowering the MTTR. Further, through formulated 
Ease of Doing/Impact Matrix and Failure Modes and Effects Analysis, we can assure that the implementation plan 
will be successful as highlights the prioritizing of actions, and risks, and develops countermeasures. Refresher training 
can help prevent one of the most dangerous incident-response risks: situations in which only one person knows a 
particular system or technology. Overall, the long-term sustenance plan in lowering the MTTR for this study is to 
continuously improve the quality monitoring, Leverage AIOps capabilities, Create Centralize SOPs, and Random 
reviewing and follow-up on previous Critical tickets, this will contribute to maintaining lowering the MTTR and 
creates best-in-class incident response process of the company.  The forecast gives the overall possible MTTR of 
4.7102. This is 1.55 lower than the Fiscal Quarter and the desirable value was met as the MTTR is lower than 5.

Abstract 
The research objective is to evaluate the use of the lean and agile methodologies and highlight the implications for 
addressing the project management gaps within non-profit organizations (NPOs) by using clustering algorithms. The 
rationale behind investigating this study is to demonstrate the importance of lean methodology practices for the none-
profit organizations, which faces difficulties and issues due to the limited resources, to provide managerial tools to the 
project managers who are required to make decisions that can reduce the costs and errors of the project and ensure the 
successful completion of the projects.

1. Introduction
The first significance of conducting this research is exploring the topic of agile and lean methodologies to cover project 
management gaps in nonprofit organizations since it is a relatively specific topic that has only just begun to acquire 
people's attention. This research will contribute to the present body of knowledge about project management gaps in 
nonprofit organizations. Moreover, the study's next prominent aspect is developing recommendations depending on 
the fundamental analysis and conclusions found using clustering algorithms. Managers of nonprofit 
organizations may turn these recommendations into firm strategies and employ them to gain a competitive advantage. 
The suggestions focus on using lean and agile methodologies to solve project management gaps in nonprofit 
organizations by using clustering algorithms. This research is being conducted to give managerial implications to 
project managers who are expected to make decisions that will decrease project expenses and mistakes and ensure the 
successful completion of projects. Furthermore, at an operational level, the results of this study will promote the use 
of lean project management and/or agile methodologies as a substitute or complementary to traditional project 
management, which could have a favorable effect on nonprofit organizations. This study can benefit academia and 
industry circles by establishing the foundation for further research into advising and project management philosophy 
usage 
2. Literature Review
The agile method refers to the continuous reexaminations of the project’s basic requirements or the product and
making the changes required by the project (Rasnacis and Berzisa 2017). Concerning the application of the agile
method in the non-profitable organization, that is necessary to describe the least possible viable product. After that,
bring together the cross-functional group and then motivate the group members (Špundak 2014). According to the
research study conducted by Obradović et al. (2018), agility denotes the state of mind while an individual deals with
a project. Agile methodology in project management prioritizes easiness, flexibility, and face-to-face interaction.
Nusraningrum and Thamrin (2020) state that the agile management strategy to project development is still a

4- Management defines clear work Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs), procedures, and instruction to team 
members that ensures task and responsibility sharing  
5- Management formulates a specific plan towards the understanding of project’s long-term vision and clarity in goals 
that helps team members to stay on shared goals.  
6- Lean methodology helps in proper scheduling of the project  
7- Management steadily study and review the primary project procedure to make improvements in the project which 
helps in evaluation, control and risk management.  
 
The same analogy will be used to join the respondents’ answers based on their level of similarities by applying single 
linkage clustering method as seen in figure 2. The highest similarity is between answer 4 and 6, which indicates that 
lean methodology helps in proper scheduling of the project while management should define clear work 
standardization to team members. The second highest similarity occurs between answers 2 and 7. This indicate that 
the continuous improvements directed by the management is directly related to the cost of the project.

5. Conclusion  
The research has suggested that Non-Profit organizations should adopt an efficient resource utilization model aligning 
with organizational goals and objectives. Also, it is found that the level of implementation of management 
commitment in organization dimension of agile process effect delivering a good working product. The level of the 
commitment of management in organization dimension of agile process impact total projected cost and effort. The 
implementation of lean management and agile practices in the non-profit organization has proven successful in 
providing effective administration, resource utilization, and cost management. Both of these approaches are helpful 
and aligned with the goals of NPOs, which leads to significant improvements in finances.

Abstract 
This study utilized Machine Learning (ML) models to analyze and predict customer churns in the context of web-
based collaboration platform. Secondary data was used in the study, containing 109,740 observations and 12 
predictors. This was divided into test dataset and out-of-time (OOT) dataset where the prior was used for model fitting 
and the latter is to test performance stability in unseen data. Furthermore, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling 
Technique (SMOTE) was performed to resolve the data imbalance, hence, preventing bias and distortion in the 
models’ performance. These 3 ML models were assessed based on Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall and F1- 
Score. Given the business context’s applicability, F1-score and Accuracy were used as bases for performance, leading 
to the selection of Decision Tree Classifier as the ML model in this study, with Accuracy of 92.1% and F1-Score of 
63%. Furthermore, hyper-parameter tuning was performed on Decision Tree Classifier to prevent overfitting. To 
reinforce the model selected, Survival Analysis was implemented, specifically, Kaplan-Meier (KM) Estimator and 
Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) were utilized to analyze the rate and timeframe of disengagement to the platform, 
revealing that beyond 72 months, it was projected to retain only 60% of its user base. Hence, these multidimensional 
results and insights derived from both Decision Tree Classifier and Survival Analysis were anchored in the formulation 
of customer retention strategy, proactively target customers who are predicted to churn.

1. Introduction
The rapid growth of technology, as brought by the Fourth Industrial Revolution, advances the adoption of game-
changing technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing and Analytics. 
This also pushed the massive digital transformation across industries in the Philippines. As reported by the World 
Bank, 56% of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have adopted technology, although this was 
described as still “at the basic level” of adoption rate compared to other Southeast Asian nations. From the user 
adoption standpoint, the country’s internet penetration rate at the start of 2022, has grown to 68% of the population, 
as reported by DataReportal. This only shows the growing traction that the digital transformation in the country has 
gained and is expected to sustain its momentum in the next few years.  
While the massive digital transformation has stimulated the formation of new business models, especially at the height 
of Pandemic, it was proven that communications and collaborative platform were able to sustain various and crucial 
activities such as the implementation of distance education, and Telecommuting. This only proves the promising value 
of adopting and implementing such technology in helping to sustain various business activities.

As for the direction of this paper, the low dimensionality of the dataset used in this study might be an opportunity for 
future researchers to delve further into similar study. This paper also paved way to the application of Predictive 
Analytics, not only in the context of web-based collaboration platform or software, but also, to other domains. At 
present, there were only few Predictive Analytics research papers on the realm of web-based collaboration platform. 
Furthermore, future researchers can drill further into this domain using other methodologies. Given the 
recommendations and directions for future researchers, this only shows the great potential of Predictive Analytics in 
solving real world problems.

Abstract 
 In Malaysia, the population is increasing rapidly, reaching 32.8 million in 2021, generating a 
tremendous amount of solid waste, estimated to be 38,427 metric tonnes per day in 2021 (1.17 
kg/capita/day). Of these, 82.5 percent are disposed in landfills. On top of that, households’ 
electronic waste estimates– from 463,866 metric tonnes in 2011, almost doubling to 832,692 
metric tonnes in 2020. The use of electronic devices has proliferated in recent decades, and 
proportionately, the number of electronic devices. Electronic waste, or e-waste for short, is a 
generic term embracing various forms of electric and electronic equipment that have ceased to 
be of any value to their owners. Managing WEEE or e-waste from the source, i.e., households 
is quite complex and requires a strategic approach from the waste operators. Therefore, it is the 
epitome for the local authorities to design the WEEE flow from the source so that the waste 
material is not cross-contaminated with the solid waste residual (general households’ bins). 
The study used a mixed-methodology approach to addressing the fundamental questions and 
objectives for the sustainable approach to managing WEEE from the source. It is expected to 
address the underpinning concept of the feasible solution in handling this waste stream. The 
method of inquiry was a qualitative and quantitative approach suitable for a multidisciplinary 
study (Waste; Logistics and Behaviour). Investigating situational and personal factors in 
tandem to seek the overarching values in addressing human behavior in e-waste recycling from 
the source. Therefore, a holistic framework of the e-waste recapture model (Recycling E-Waste 
Framework) could be a reference point for stakeholders, including Local Authorities and E-
Waste Collection Operators, which currently was vague and not conclusive.

Abstract 
Several studies have highlighted the impact of technostress and physical discomfort on employees' productivity. With 
the advent of virtual and flexible learning in the Philippines due to the Covid-19 pandemic, teaching and non-teaching 
employees became susceptible to physical discomfort and technostress. The study uses partial least square structural 
equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the interplay of technostress and physical discomfort to employees' 
productivity at MSEUF campuses. The study’s participants were the employees of MSEUF, including department 
heads, faculty, and non-teaching employees. The study employed quantitative research with a causal research design 
to measure the relationship between technostress, physical discomfort, and productivity. Using WarpPLS 8.0, the 
study measured the sampling adequacy using the Inverse-square root method and Gamma-exponential. Also, the 
measurement model and structural model were evaluated using reliability and validity tests like convergent and 
discriminant validity. The result shows that technostress positively affects physical discomfort with a moderate 
coefficient of determination (R2) level. While technostress and physical discomfort significantly and negatively affect 
employees' productivity, with a moderate level of R2. Furthermore, the result implies that during this shift in the 
educational systems in the Philippines, employees must be given enough support and assistance to perform at their 
full potential to deliver and be productive, despite the different challenges.

1. Introduction
Technology has altered the world, made living easier, and is now so ingrained in people's lives that it is nearly 
impossible to imagine life without it. The advancement of humanity had enabled by the advent of digital technology 
and the growth of the Internet (Chiappetta 2017). Information and communication technology (ICT) is becoming a 
rapidly changing and renewing technology for higher education. Social media evolved as an essential communications 
tool and was discovered to be a facilitating tool for teaching and learning, particularly in higher education, as ICT 
tools and techniques advanced. 
The Covid-19 epidemic rocked the country in early 2020, and the first day of the Enhanced Community Quarantine 
has changed everyone's life. Manufacturing, banks, hotels and resorts, entertainment, BPOs, and even academic 
institutions all came to a halt. From Basic education to colleges and Universities, everyone shifted to flexible learning 
and work-from-home (WFH) setup, a new condition that everyone is not ready for.   
The community quarantine imposed in the whole of Luzon forced every industry and organization to fast-track its 
digital shift. Digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation – these buzz words became household names to 
us. What we have been forecasting for years happened in just one snap of a finger. Suddenly, everything became 
virtual and online. 
Today, following the swift changes experienced in technological devices, especially in Information and 
Communication Technologies (ICTs), bring convenience to our lives and take us under their control. These 
developments give us some opportunities in business life, but on the other hand, they create some disadvantages for

Finally, predictive relevance was also evaluated using the Stone-Geisser test or simply Q2. To say that the 
measurement model has predictive validity, the values of Q2 should be higher than 0 (Kock 2019). The predictive 
relevance for physical discomfort is 0.192, and productivity is 0.106. Hence, the Q2 values are all greater than 0, which 
means that the model has the ability to predict. 
 
 
Framework of Technostress, Physical Discomfort, and Productivity 
 
 
Figure 3. Framework of Technostress, Physical Discomfort, and Productivity 
 
Figure 3 shows the framework of the three constructs, technostress, physical discomfort, and productivity. The 
framework was supported by the result of the structural equation model using WARP-PLS, showing the connections 
of each construct and dimension. Technostress, in general, is significant to the physical discomfort and productivity 
of teaching and non-teaching employees, which is composed of 5 stressors, techno-overload, techno-invasion, techno-
complexity, techno-insecurity, and techno-uncertainty. Likewise, physical discomfort is significant to employees' 
productivity. Physical discomfort manifests in back pain, shoulder, fingers, thumb, wrist, and arm pain, Neck pain, 
Headache, eye and chest pain, tiredness, and voice impairment. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In general, the majority of the respondents were teaching personnel from the Main campus; most of them belonged to 
generations Y (millennials)  and Z (iGen), with eight years or less tenure at the University. The respondents are mostly 
WFH and flexible working arrangements, and the majority are working about 8 hours and below every day. Among 
the five techno stressors, techno-overload is primarily the concern of the employees. While on the other hand, the 
majority of the workers experienced lower and central back pain during the WFH. The path analysis revealed a 
significant relationship among the three constructs, and technostress positively correlates with physical discomfort. In 
contrast, technostress and physical discomfort have a negative impact on the work productivity of MSEUF employees.  
 
The study will prove useful to institutions as they decide how to design nuanced strategies that address technostress 
and its impact on employees. The findings suggest that reducing technostress effectively reduces physical discomfort, 
thus improving productivity and job performance in general. However, studies also show that technostress has a good 
impact; therefore, institutions should aim to understand what each specific type of technostress is ideal for employees 
to perform well. The results suggest that institutions benefit from using tools such as MS Teams and Zoom Meeting 
to encourage employee innovation when it comes to techno-overload. Institutions can use education and training to 
help employees approach techno-overload as a challenge rather than an interference to function positively rather than 
negatively.

The researchers also found that techno-invasion can lead to a positive impact under the right set of conditions. 
Employees may see technology stealing from their personal life detached from the workplace. However, techno-
invasion can be advantageous for employees with the right precautions. In order to break techno-invasion-causing 
technostress, employees should know their boundaries and learn when to be disconnected. When it comes to techno-
complexity, the researchers recommend that institutions provide opportunities for mentoring. The transfer of 
knowledge should happen in both directions. The senior employees will be the mentors and the junior employees who 
have advanced knowledge of new technologies.

Abstract 
The difficulties encountered in the solution processes and automation regarding the bus driver problem, has brought 
mathematical approximations and solutions in real life applications, especially when the system requires those kinds 
of implementations to find the response in shorter times and less computational effort. The high mathematical 
complexity found in each mathematical representation of the real problem used by the operating system calls for a 
novel application of each mathematical representation in one structured algorithm, one that supports the driver 
scheduling and rostering problem, giving the optimal solution based in good quality factible basic starting points found 
by the search algorithm to reduce the amount of time and computational memory used. In this work, a first 
approximation of the combined mathematical model is proposed to analyze the driver scheduling and rostering 
considering a schedule classification, considers the necessary conditions to fit the bases of 3 different types of 
approaches to the BDSP problem. The proposed model considers characteristics and especial behaviors found in 
solutions shown in previous works published in the specialized literature and real-life problems, such as the Integra 
S.A bus driver problem, to create the necessary changes in the mathematical representation to adapt the new valid
inequalities to the real problem behavior and ensure its only used when the problems consider it necessary for the real
problem. This being the focus point to implement disjunctive valid inequalities in the final proposal. The improve
model is solved with a genetic algorithm to start the solution process and reduce the search space. Since the proposed
disjunctive valid inequalities can be activated or deactivated depending on the variables value, the amount of
constrains is reduced to improve the computational behavior and ensures the solution of medium type problems. Then
the found solution is given to a Branch and Cut technique to find the optimal solution, considering all the reduce
conditions found before. To prove the efficiency of the proposed model and algorithm, two test systems were use,
starting with small test systems to prove test the mathematical model and its new representation, then it is tested with
a medium type of problem, which can be found in the specialized literature, to test the computational efficiency. In
each test the algorithm can find the optimal solution of each problem and reduce the time-effort ration when compared
with previous works.

Abstract 
Puskesmas must be a reliable health service, so paying attention to its readiness to provide health efforts for the 
community is necessary. This research aims to compare the readiness of Puskesmas in providing services for 
infectious diseases of HIV/AIDS, TB, Malaria, and STIs before the pandemic (2019) and during the COVID-19 
pandemic (2021). This research was conducted in August-September 2021 in 12 health centers in Papua, NTT, 
South Sumatra, and DIY provinces. Data before the pandemic was obtained from Rifaskes 2019, and during the 
pandemic, it was collected through direct data collection in the field. The data collection tool is in the form of a 
questionnaire with an adaptation of the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA). SARA guides 
the analysis to produce domain values and traceability indicators of the availability and readiness of health 
services. Data were also analyzed by statistical calculation of wilcoxon-signed-rank t-test (non-parametric 
dependent T-test). The results showed that the average tracking indicator that had decreased was malaria services 
(9.4%). Meanwhile, the average of other traceability indicators has increased, such as HIV/AIDS services (6.9%), 
tuberculosis (9.3%), and STIs (8.3%). The results of the Wilcoxon test showed that there was no significant 
difference in service readiness for malaria (p=0,144), tuberculosis (p=0,533), and STIs (p=0,227); while the 
readiness of HIV/AIDS services showed a significant difference (p=0.046). The government can use SARA as a 
basis for monitoring the availability and readiness of services by adapting several tracking variables that are more 
in line with the Indonesian context.

1. Introduction
Since being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, efforts to prevent 
transmission and slow the rate of new infections have been the main goals of handling Covid-19 cases.1Since it 
was announced as a pandemic, this infection has continued to spread throughout the world, including Indonesia. 
COVID-19 cases have spread to all provinces in Indonesia, and to date (update February 8, 2022), there are 
4,580,093 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 233,062 active cases and 144,719 deaths.2  
As the front line in primary health care, Puskesmas must have a solid system to provide quality responses to public 
emergencies. With the readiness of health services at the Puskesmas, it is hoped that it will significantly reduce 
morbidity and mortality in the community. Therefore, Puskesmas must become a mainstay health service facility 
in various situations, both before the outbreak and when facing emergencies such as the Covid-19 outbreak.3The 
provision of quality health services cannot be separated from the need for the readiness of these service facilities 
in providing health efforts for the community.

6. Conclusion 
1. The average malaria service has decreased from 2019 by 9.4% in 2021. The indicators of malaria tracking 
that have decreased are the administration of Artemisinin injection, Artemisinin tablet, Quinine/Kinin 
tablet/inj, and Primaquinin tablet. The decrease in average occurred in Ogan Komering Ilir Regency and 
Jayapura Regency. 
2. The average HIV/AIDS service at Puskesmas has increased from 2019 to 6.9% in 2021. However, several 
indicators of HIV/AIDS tracking such as guidelines for the management of HIV/AIDS opportunistic 
infections, guidelines for Counseling and Testing HIV/AIDS, guidelines for preventing HIV/AIDS 
transmission AIDS from mother to child, the HIV drug Nevirapine, and HIV CD4 devices have decreased. 
The decline in the average occurred in the city of Yogyakarta. 
3. The average TB service has increased from 2019 by 9.3% in 2021. However, several TB tracking indicators 
have decreased, such as TB Drugs Isoniazid + Rifampicin tablets and TB Drugs Isoniazid + Rifampicin + 
Pyrazinamide tablets. The decrease in average occurred in Ogan Komering Ilir Regency, Yogya City, and 
Southwest Sumba Regency. 
4. The average service for sexually transmitted infections has increased from 2019 by 8.3% in 2021. The 
indicator that has decreased is the administration of injectable procaine penicillin. The decline in the average 
occurred in Ogan Komering Ilir and Southwest Sumba districts. 
5. The Wilcoxon test between the domain mean in 2021 compared to 2019 shows no significant difference in 
malaria service readiness, tuberculosis service readiness, and STI service readiness. Meanwhile, the 
readiness of HIV/AIDS services shows significant differences.

Abstract 
Production scheduling affects the cost of production. Hence, it is one of the important problems for operational 
problems. Especially for productions that require assembly precedencies, an inappropriate production schedule may 
be the reason for overtime decisions for a finite planning period. An inappropriate production schedule may lead to 
tardiness in assembly jobs as subassembly parts may not be ready on time. To meet the deadline of products, tardiness 
must be compensated using overtime. In this study, we considered an assembly job shop scheduling problem for multi-
group jobs with sub-assembly precedence’s from a real-world application. Our aim is to determine the production 
schedule that minimizes overtime for a finite planning time interval. We developed a mixed integer programming 
model that minimizes the overtime complying with the delivery dates for the problem.  We conducted a case-study on 
a construction machinery industry in Thailand. Construction machines have several welded body parts with sub-
assembly processes. Welded body parts with sub-assembly processes have cutting, bending, machining and pre-
welding processes. The readiness of the welded body parts before the machine assembly is critically important for the 
continuity of the machine assembly line.

Abstract 
Managing the inventory of blood products is a crucial operation in hospitals owing to the significance of blood in 
medical treatment. At the same time, blood is characterized by unique attributes, such as perishability and the 
unpredictable nature of its supply and demand. While mathematical models have been developed to optimize the 
complex process of blood inventory management, gaps in literature exist in terms of considering the possibility of 
variable pricing and extensively accounting for uncertainties in the supply chain. In this light, the present study 
proposes a stochastic multi-period mixed integer linear programming cost minimization model that determines the 
optimal inventory plan for a hospital purchasing platelets, assuming that prices fluctuate along with the blood center’s 
supply. To implement uncertain supply and demand, the model considers a discrete set of scenarios for each parameter 
and decides based on expected values. A hypothetical case study was performed on the model, and the results indicate 
a promising direction for the research as total inventory costs decreased relative to models without the new 
considerations. To further improve the proposed model, future studies may view the blood supply chain from a 
macroscopic perspective and provide a more accurate model of price fluctuations.

Abstract 
South African banking institutions are transitioning from the conventional banking operating system to a more 
automated and digitalised one. Banking institutions compete against one another to take control of the market share 
available in the banking industry. The adoption of automated and digitalised-driven practices has become the norm 
for banking institutions to serve more customers with fewer resources. The Covid-19 pandemic significantly 
accelerated the rate of adopting automation through digitisation and digitalisation. This paper aims to understand 
whether the adoption of bank automation is coupled with the trend of the banking institutions' physical footprint. Thus, 
a conceptual research framework was developed to streamline the banking institutions' footprint regarding the interest 
in adopting automation within the banking industry. The descriptive statistics of the banks' annual integrated reports 
and fact sheets revealed an overall decrease rate of 19 percent countrywide in the number of banking outlets/branches 
from early 2015 to the end of 2021 for the five prominent banking institutions in South Africa, known as Absa, FNB, 
Nedbank, Standard Bank and most recently Capitec Bank.  
Keywords

1. Introduction
Banking institutions in South Africa traditionally rely on the physical presence through branches to bring banking 
solutions to their valued customers nationwide, known as traditional or conventional banking (Weichert 2017). Five 
players mainly dominate the South African banking industry, predominately named the 'Big five', made of Absa, 
Capitec bank, First national bank (Fnb), Nedbank and Standard bank. The categorisation is based on the market share 
of the five players within the whole South African banking industry (Writer 2020). The big five control a market share 
of more than 85 percent; this demonstrates why they are the entities of interest in the industry. These banking 
institutions were once conventional and are now entering an age dominated by automation or technology-driven 
practices to serve their customers more efficiently and cost-effectively (ICC 2020). As competition rages, banking 
institutions strive to remain relevant in the market by adopting automation-driven practices. In other words, banking 
institutions have significantly invested in automation to further transcend from a conventional banking system to a 
more automated and digitalised landscape to provide convenient solutions as well as cost-effective platforms for 
banking transactions (Forest and Donya 2015). The technological approaches adopted by the South African big five 
to position themselves to make the most of the emerging opportunities are essential. Because, going forward, banking 
institutions have to compete among themselves, therefore having an automated operating system that meets or exceeds 
customers' needs would permit these banks to have the upper hand in the competition within the banking industry 
(Masocha et al. 2011). However, the adoption of automation by the big five tends to have a drastic effect on the 
physical presence of these banks countrywide, meaning that the adoption of automation seems to influence the decision 
to reduce the number of branches established across the country in order to bring banking solutions to (even less-
privileged) customers. 
1.1 Problem statement 
South Africa's big five possesses the largest market share in the banking industry. These banking institutions have 
integrated automation into their service delivery chain to accommodate the norm of advanced technologies in the

Abstract 
The paper discusses a practical School Bus Routing Problem (SBRP) considering interscholastic transport in 
university contexts. This study focuses on the incorporation of a mixed load composed of multiple schools, to 
emphasize the need to provide collaborative transportation SBRP solutions in university contexts. A Systematic 
Literature Review was developed with the purpose of exploring the mathematical optimization models that have been 
elaborated in the last decade, showing the research opportunities on mixed load situations. Henceforth, the paper 
presents a real case scenario in a Mexican city to highlight the need for a mathematical model that optimizes the 
transportation offer of two universities on a common urban zone, that can be replicable in similar conditions. This 
study exhibits the development of two of the SBRP subproblems: Bus Stop Selection (BSS) and Bus Route Generation 
(BRG), through the Operations Research Methodology, to construct a solution that maximizes coverage by sharing 
resources within schools. A sensitivity analysis that focuses on the demand, capacity and time windows variations is 
conducted to prove the robustness of the approach and to propose an optimal solution for the schools of the specific 
case.

1. Introduction
The transport sector is facing a complex challenge to carbon dioxide emissions from mobility, and, at the same time, 
many cities still have low accessibility to public transport services (Wimbadi et al.  2021). Consequently, researchers 
have pointed out that population growth and the agglomeration of economic activity will continue to gradually increase 
the demand for mobility and CO2 emissions in cities. Therefore, urban transport would be needed to turn its socio-
technical system around by implementing energy-efficient modes of transport and increasing the modal share of public 
transport. 
Serrano (2021) points out that motor transport is the sector that consumes the most energy in Mexico, being the main 
source of CO, CO2, and NOX particles, which causes respiratory and cardiovascular problems, chronic diseases, and 
early mortality. Similarly, INEGI (2022) establishes that the number of automobiles in the Mexican State of Nuevo 
Leon has increased substantially, so the entity currently has 1,800,000 cars, generating a 45% increase in polluting 
emissions. This has led to the positioning of Monterrey as the city with the second largest carbon footprint in the 
country, 16.6 MT CO2, according to Salazar (2022).  
Wimbadi, Djalante & Mori (2021) state that urban experimentation for sustainability transitions has been evolving 
over the last decade, especially being influenced by universities to obtain feedback from users, learn how new 
technologies work, and exercise different possible ways of using technology to address sustainability issues.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 outbreak has unpredictably disrupted the operations of numerous museums. Museum visitor 
experience has a physical, personal, and social context, which are not achievable during the pandemic. Despite the 
depreciation during the Circuit Breaker period, the disruption also presents an opportunity for local museums to 
develop new strategies of audience engagement to accommodate the altered audience behavior. This exploratory study 
analyses data from six Singapore-based museums to understand the visitorship patterns across different ages and 
genders. The impact of COVID-19 is also analysed. Using R-studio and relevant packages, we conducted statistical 
tests such as hypothesis testing, Chi-square testing and regression. It was concluded that overall, museums attracted a 
younger demographic compared to the general Singapore population, and male visitors were more likely to visit more 
than once. Furthermore, the average number of visitors in the second half of 2020, after a nation-wide COVID-19 
stay-home order, was found to be statistically greater than the average number of visitors before. An interactive R 
Shiny app was also designed to allow users to explore the visitor profile of each museum.

1. Introduction
Despite its small size, Singapore boasts a rich, diverse, and thriving museum environment that includes public and 
private museums that feature collections in the arts, culture and community, healthcare, national history, military, 
science, and technology. The National Heritage Board (NHB), a statutory government board in Singapore, is 
“responsible for telling the Singapore story, sharing the Singaporean experience and imparting Singapore spirit”. NHB 
manages a suite of museums and heritage institutions that collectively aim to “preserve and celebrate” shared heritage 
of diverse communities, “for the purpose of education, nation-building and cultural understanding”. The NHB also 
sets policies relating to heritage sites, national monuments and the national collection. 
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on museum attendance has been severe. As the COVID-19 pandemic spread 
over the world, on 3 April 2020, in response to the Singaporean government's implementation of stay-home orders 
and a more severe set of safe distancing procedures, all museums in Singapore shuttered to prevent the disease's 
spread. According to the results of the survey, close to 75% of museums in Singapore suffered a significant decline in 
revenue. The remaining 25% consisted of museums that were already closed for renovation prior to COVID-19. The 
Singapore Tourism Board announced the reopening of all local museums on 28 June 2020 after nearly three months 
of closure. However, the museums were only allowed to operate at 25% of their full capacity at any given time in the 
first phase of reopening. 
Following the end of the stay-home-order and the progressive relaxation of safe distancing measures in Singapore, the 
national broadsheet Straits Times stated that there were around 80,000 museum visits between August 2020 and 
233","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Manila, Philippines, March 7-9, 2023

Additionally, the chi-square statistical test was conducted to further understand the strength of association between 
gender and repeat visits. The output is shown in Figure 7. The p-value was smaller than the significant level 10%. We 
can conclude that there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. As such it can be inferred that there is a 
positive association between male visitors and repeat visit. This is an interesting insight given that females made up 
the higher proportion of museum visitors compared with their population proportion.  
Here, we observe that there are some limitations of the current work due to accessed dataset. Some possible future 
research work that can be considered are listed below: 
•
Given the data available, visitor ship was examined as an individual activity only. It may be useful to find a way
to study visitors by the social groups that they were in during the visit, for example as a family, a couple, school
trip or tour group.
•
Variables that could potentially be better predictors than demographics e.g. income levels of visitors, the type of
exhibition attended, and whether the ticket was paid or unpaid could be gathered to build a better predictive model
for repeat visitor ship, extending from the logistic regression performed. Further studies can also be conducted into
more specific characteristics of the male and female visitors that influence their probability of being repeat visitors. 
•
While the dataset provided a useful view of the impact of the early stages of COVID-19 in 2020, visitor ship
patterns from the endemic phase (2022 onwards) might yield more stable results.
•
To address the difference between the age distribution of museum visitors versus the national demographics, and
assuming that the programming intent of NHB museums is to appeal to the broad spectrum of society, more studies 
and experimentation can be conducted to increase the appeal of specific museums to the lagging age groups.
6. Conclusion
Over 3.5 years, from June 2017 to December 2020, the trends in Singapore museum attendance have shifted. This 
study examines consumer behavior and identifies the factors that drive museum-goer demand. This includes the time 
from the commencement of COVID and the reopening after the stay-at-home measure. The scope of this paper was 
restricted to museums managed by the NHB. The findings of this study are helpful for comprehending local museum 
attendance trends by age and gender, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. In this regard, it has provided 
us with crucial new information based on museum data in Singapore. 
According to the study's findings, museums tend to draw a younger audience. This could represent Singaporeans' 
preferences or targeted programming. Female visitors predominated. Female visitors chose the museums C2, H2, and 
H3. While male visitors were underrepresented, they were more likely to return. The data also demonstrates a 
difference in museum visitor ship trends before and after the Circuit Breaker measure. Following a Circuit Breaker, 
the average number of visitors in the second half of 2020 was determined to be statistically greater than the average 
number of visitors prior to the COVID-19 start, particularly among teenagers and females. This suggests a growing 
preference for in-person museum visits following COVID-19 in Singapore. 
On the basis of the findings of this article, museums could examine measures to increase their interaction with the 
young and female visitor segments, hence increasing their accessibility to neighboring tourist segments. Possible 
extensions of this work could include the addition of similar data from other museums and tourist attractions in 
Singapore to determine whether Singaporeans tend to visit the same destinations as part of their local tourism during 
the epidemic.

Abstract 
Numerous projects study the factors that have an impact on the efficiency of public procurement systems. 
The main objective of this research is to use the South African context to identify some of the factors that 
are critical for better performance and efficiency of public procurement. The research then used Structural 
Equation Modelling to test the relationships between the identified factors and efficiency, as well as the 
strength of those relationships. Structured questionnaires were sent to selected respondents in public 
organisations in South Africa and the responses obtained were utilised to test the research hypotheses 
developed. The research found that excessive bureaucracy, compliance, and supplier relationship 
management have a strong influence on efficiency in public procurement. This study contributes to the 
understanding of various factors that influence public procurement and the impact of that influence. 
Understanding such factors will assist entities with controlling such factors and improving the efficiency 
public procurement processes.

Introduction. 
Public procurement is a process through which public authorities acquire all services, goods, and works. 
Public procurement is regarded as one of the critical undertakings in any country’s economy. It is for this 
reason that Grega et al. (2019) believe that public procurement warrants the sustained attention it receives 
from academia and the public at large. Significantly improving the effectiveness of public procurement can 
result in savings, or even increase the quality and quantity of procurement. Eyaa and Oluka (2011) credit 
the intense scrutiny, that public procurement is under, to political and public expectations for service 
improvements, program reviews, and technological advances. With regards to political expectations and 
due to South Africa’s political history, public procurement is used as a policy tool address some of the 
socio-economic imbalances of the country. Cane (2004) noted that procurement is critical to the state’s 
service delivery mechanisms and is used to promote objectives that may be secondary to the fundamental 
objectives of procurement. The example of secondary aims that public procurement is used to promote are 
environmental, social, and industrial goals.  
Kumar et al. (2015) posited that public procurement functions under significant political pressure and has 
to manoeuvre in a space of friction between compliance and performance. This makes the task of fulfilling 
public expectations of efficiency and transparency more difficult. If one focuses more on compliance in 
transactions, it can lead to a distraction from paying the necessary attention to outcomes and containing 
fraud and corruption. Measures to reduce transaction cost must be traded off with the requirements for 
accountability and transparency. Kloot and Martin (2000) emphasise the demand for consistency in public 
administration as well as the obligation to create a balance between accountability and service delivery and

Abstract 
With its multicore technology designed for intensive computation, graphics processing units (GPUs) have advanced 
tremendously in recent years. The GPU is a multicore coprocessor with dozens or even hundreds of cores designed 
for intensive computations, unlike a central processing unit (CPU), which has a limited number of cores available. 
However, CPUs have large caches for accommodating large amounts of data, whereas GPUs have smaller caches but 
use a massive amount of threads. In order to achieve the best performance from both CPU and GPU, GPU-CPU 
heterogeneous computing architectures have emerged, resulting in a paradigm shift in parallel computing. Data 
parallelism, also known as SIMD (single instruction, multiple data), is realized through this paradigm, which allows 
multiple threads to execute the same task simultaneously on different subsets of the same data. When data parallelism 
is used to program, it is particularly relevant when there is a lot of data to process, as is often the case in scientific 
computing. Due to their inherent nature as intensive computing, data parallelism is ideally suited for meta-heuristics. 
As part of this research, data parallelism is introduced to meta-heuristics, as well as a particular optimization technique 
called ""tiling"" in parallel computing. ""Tiling"" refers to grouping threads into tiles to share access to programmable 
caches on GPUs in order to improve computation speed, particularly for programs that use the same data repeatedly. 
We introduce the ""tiling"" technique to ant colony optimization, a meta-heuristic for solving quadratic assignment 
problem (QAP). A heterogeneous computing architecture is expected to provide benefits in speed, quality, and 
efficiency over a CPU alone.

Abstract 
In a study conducted by INRIX 2021 Global Traffic Scorecard, it is said that Surabaya occupies the first largest city 
in Indonesia and number 41 cities in the world with a total duration wasted during peak hours in Surabaya reaching 
62 hours / year and an average speed of 20.9 km / hour. In addition, according to IQAir data in January 2022, the value 
of air pollution levels in Surabaya is unhealthy with an air quality index of 180 US AQI and PM2.5 concentrations in 
the city of Surabaya air are currently 22.3 times above who's annual air quality guidance value. To overcome this, the 
Surabaya city government plans to plan the construction of Autonomous Rail Rapid Transit (ART) as one of the 
solutions to overcome the congestion and pollution problem. In this study, the identification of significant variables 
on the effectiveness of ART transportation modes will be carried out, measuring the level of customer loyalty when 
implementing ART transportation modes and providing several policy alternatives to regulators to achieve the desired 
level of effectiveness. The created model will consist of 10 scenarios. This simulation will be supported by data 
obtained through a questionnaire that will be distributed to the public to measure how interested the community is in 
supporting this policy. The method used is a simulation of a dynamic system. The results obtained are significant 
variables to the effect of ART modes of transportation are the percentage of increase in fuel prices, the percentage of 
public support and the reduction in transportation travel time, the rate of change from customer loyalty as measured 
from quite high, and to increase the effectiveness of the application of ART transportation modes, the researchers 
proposed to use a policy of increasing fuel prices accompanied by a reduction in travel time from public transportation. 
in 2023, 2025 and 2026, using the policy of reducing travel time from public transportation accompanied by 
community support in 2024 and using the policy of increasing fuel prices in 2017.

Abstract 
To explore reverse logistics in the context of the Indonesian food and beverage manufacturing industry and examine 
the effect of the effectiveness of reverse logistics activity on TBL. Performance and operational performance. By 
applying the method of Structural Equation Modeling based on Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS). Recommendations 
are made to improve the implementation of sustainable reverse logistics. The hypothesis related to the effectiveness 
of reverse logistics activity, TBL performance, and operational performance is developed. Based on data collection, 
as many as 123 respondents were involved in collecting data by distributing online questionnaires to company 
stakeholders. Findings based on the results obtained show that internal factor capability has no significant effect on 
the effectiveness of reverse logistics activity, while external factor capability has a significant effect on the 
effectiveness of reverse logistics activity. The effectiveness of reverse logistics activity has a significant impact on 
economic performance, environmental performance and social performance. In contrast, the effectiveness of reverse 
logistics activity does not have a significant impact on operational performance. However, economic performance and 
environmental performance have a significant influence on operational performance. Therefore, the implications of 
the research results can be input for companies to continue to improve the implementation of reverse logistics in 
companies. 
1. Introduction
Producers are parties that have activities to produce output, both in goods and services, but in the process and finished 
goods will generate waste in packaging, therefore producers have a big responsibility in solving packaging waste made 
of plastic they produce as stated in the regulation. Reverse logistics as a related process, starting from the point of 
consumption to the point of origin with the aim of creating value or proper disposal of products/goods in a cost-
effective manner includes planning, implementing and controlling efficiently the flow of raw materials, goods in 
process, finished goods, and information. Environmental concerns form the basis for legal pressures, and 
environmental regulations that steer companies towards sustainable reverse logistics management. But it requires 
practices that are environmentally and socially sensitive. Moreover, environmental applications include investment in 
pollution control and prevention as well as the implementation of environmental management systems. Previous 
researchers said to address this increasing global concern, Gaustad, (2018) that economic policy can be considered as 
an effective solution that allows by leveraging a circular economy consisting of end-of-life management of a product 
only so that the product can be brought back into the supply chain by a mechanism that once it has completed its 
functional life, instead of being considered waste. 
This research also considers the factor of reverse logistics activities as a main objective, which analyzes what is 
interfering with the wider adoption of reverse logistics among manufacturers in the Nigerian manufacturing sector 
(U-Dominic et al. 2021) . Research in Bangladesh that reviews perspectives and barriers to adopting green supply 
chain management practices in the textile context (Tumpa et al. 2019) . Meanwhile in Thailand addressing 
performance bottlenecks by focusing on identifying and ranking solutions on reverse logistics adoption in the palm 
oil industry using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision making method (Phochanikorn et al. 2020) . Research aimed at 
implementing reverse logistics in finding solutions for the Thai electronics industry using structural equation 
modeling (SEM) (P Sirisawat 2019) . SEM is also used to measure the effects of the three pillars of the triple bottom 
line (TBL) which include: economic, environmental and social by identifying the antecedents of sustainable product 
innovation performance (Muñoz-Pascual et al. 2019) .

objectives and provided empirical justification for a positive and significant relationship between EVP and OPP, with 
ERL mediating the relationship in manufacturing companies. In this study it was found that a significant relationship 
between EVP and OPP obtained a higher t-value than significant relationship between ERL and OPP. Yu et al. ( 2018) 
in Pakistani context research and found that the ECP of companies can be improved by adopting recycling, 
remanufacturing activities, which are part of the reverse logistics operations. Huang et al. (2010) stated that in addition 
companies can increase their profitability in terms of ECP and productivity by reducing costs and investing in 
inventory. The company also avoids the pressure of caring for the environment and environmental regulations. 
Because the essence of reverse logistics is to reduce harmful effects on the environment and use recycling and 
remanufacturing techniques, which not only reduces solid waste but also increases process efficiency Fleischmann et 
al. (2000) the relationship to social performance is pressure to handle product returns at the end of their useful life due 
to government rules and regulations, environmental concerns, and corporate social responsibility. One way to deal 
with both types of returns is to adapt and implement reverse logistics practices (Agrawal 2019). 
 
Hypotheses (H7, & H8) show a significant relationship to the hypothesis of economic performance and environmental 
performance to operational performance. This means that the more companies manage waste or manufacturing scrap 
or repairs produced by the company will have an impact on operational performance. But operational responsiveness 
in lead time and capacity utilization decreases when implementing reverse logistics . Masa'deh et al. (2017) stated that 
ECP significant effect on OPP. This is associated with several context-specific factors that are very important for 
reverse logistics , namely labor costs, disposal costs, the market value of the goods or products salvaged . Based on 
these results, it can be concluded that . This study found variables with high relative importance but performance 
scores below other variables in the model. Previous studies had the same conditions as these indicators (Agarwal et 
al. 2018; Fernando & Tew, 2016; Yu et al. 2018). 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the data processing and analysis that has been done previously, the conclusions that can be drawn are in 
accordance with the research objectives set at the beginning that the research aims to test the hypothesis. In the research 
model developed using 7 variables, namely: IFC , EFC , ERL , ECP , EVP, SCP, and OPPs . The 7 variables of the 
research model produce the 8 research hypotheses that are tested. In this study, recommendations were obtained as an 
effort to improve companies that can be carried out by companies by increasing the company's reward system for 
implementing reverse logistics. This study explores that EFC heavily influences ERL . Factor This identified will help 
managers and academics in decision making . This study relates the TBL aspect where ERL has the highest influence 
on ECP after EVP and SCP. OPP is not significantly influenced by ERL variables so it must be mediated by ECP 
variables and EVP variables. It can be concluded that the variables that can drive operational performance in 
implementing reverse logistics in companies are ECP and EVP. 
 
Based on an analysis of reverse logistics activities using the TBL approach, researchers found that there were 
hypotheses that were not significantly different from previous studies. Researchers found that the IFC hypothesis on 
ERL has no significant relationship. In contrast to previous studies stating that IFC has a significant relationship to 
ERL. Researchers found that the ERL hypothesis against OPP has no significant relationship. In contrast to previous 
studies stating that the ERL variable has a significant relationship to OPP which can be a driving force for improving 
reverse logistics in companies. This study incorporates the conceptual model from previous studies. But there is no 
conceptual model or hypothesis directly or indirectly linking IFC and EFC to OPP. Based on the results of the study, 
it has indirectly linked EFC and IFC to OPP. The results, researchers found that there was a significant indirect 
relationship to OPP mediated by the ERL and ECP and EVP latent variables. While IFC does not have a significant 
relationship indirectly.

Abstract 
The ready-made garment (RMG) industry is one of the largest industrial sectors in Bangladesh in terms of economy 
and employment. As the world economy moves forward, this highly people-dense industry needs to be digitalized. 
However, the importance of digital technology, particularly the Internet of Things (IoT), has just lately been 
recognized by most industries, which is also an important part of Industry 4.0. The IoT has seven important elements. 
Though IoT has the potential to grow businesses, it is difficult to implement all the elements of IoT simultaneously. 
Thus, the study aims to build a hierarchy model of IoT elements to be implemented in the RMG industry of 
Bangladesh. Through an extensive literature review, fourteen significant elements of IoT were identified. Then the 
study employs an integrated multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework to rank the elements of IoT based 
on their potential for application in the Bangladeshi RMG industry. The weights of the evaluation criteria were 
determined using a fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP), and the elements of IoT were ranked using a preference 
ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE II) based on the criteria weights obtained 
from FAHP. The study findings suggest that the Sensors are the most significant component of IoT, while Network 
Interconnection is the least significant component for IoT implementation. This study is expected to assist the 
stakeholders in the RMG and other related industrial sectors in formulating appropriate strategies and policies for the 
proper deployment of IoT.

1. Introduction
The Ready-made Garment (RMG) industry is the largest industrial sector of Bangladesh and is vital to the country's 
economic development (Kumar et al. 2020). This industry is the country's largest export earner as well, with nearly 
$27.9 billion in exports in the 2019-20 fiscal year (BGMEA, n.d.). This sector accounts for over 80% of Bangladesh's 
total export revenues. Approximately 4 million workers are currently working in this sector (Chowdhury et al. 2019). 
Therefore, these industries greatly impact Bangladesh's economy and employment. Therefore, the RMG sector should 
be properly managed and analyzed to maintain its economic growth.  
Fashion is changing every moment. Hence, this industry is more dynamic than any other sector. Moreover, in today's 
market, organizations are becoming more competitive in an ever-changing commercial climate (Banerjee & Mishra 
2017). For this reason, in the era of the 4th industrial revolution (Industry 4.0), industries are moving towards 
digitalized systems and adopting new technologies to ramp up their market shares. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one 
of the most important elements of Industry 4.0 (Tay et al. 2018).

Abstract 
Plastic wastes accumulate over time due to increased usage and improper disposal in the environment. In addition, 
plastics decompose at a slow rate, causing landfills and oceans be filled with plastic wastes, reducing the space for 
more wastes. This poses as a threat to the marine environment as oceans become polluted with plastics and harm the 
organisms residing in the ocean. With the existing plastic waste management and policies, there is a question to 
whether they are sufficient in managing wastes by reducing their presence in the environment and limiting plastic 
consumption. The study aims to develop a system dynamics model that will replicate the plastic wastes present in the 
marine environment and propose solutions on the existing plastic waste management that would limit plastic usage 
and increase the effiiciency of waste management. It will cover the supply chain of plastic wastes until the disposal 
process to replicate the system successfully. Parameters and scenarios are tested in the model to gather insights on the 
system behavior. Policies or solutions are proposed appropriate to the system that would successfully reduce plastic 
waste in the oceans. Further studies include developing policies that would reduce plastic production, as this is not 
focused on in this study.

Abstract 
Due to human induced global warming, sea levels are increasing globally. From 2006 to 2015, the rate of its increase 
has more than doubled, from 0.06 inches (1.4 millimeters) per year over the majority of the twentieth century to 0.14 
inches (3.6 millimeters) each year. The current reliance on fossil-based socioeconomic system, along with land 
subsidence and groundwater extraction, are only some of the factors that accelerate the rise of sea levels. Different 
local governments propose adaption measures to aid cities from the effects of rising sea levels but effective policies 
to combat climate change have been marginal due to the inability to properly conduct an integrated assessment on the 
different factors that influence climate change . The complexity and dynamic nature of this issue presents difficulties 
for policy and decision-making processes. System dynamics modeling has proven to be extremely valuable in a variety 
of sectors for assisting decision-makers in grasping and projecting the dynamic behavior of complex systems to enable 
the creation of successful policy initiatives. This paper makes use of a system dynamics model to evaluate different 
adaptation strategies to determine which information and evidence is seen to be relevant for policymaking. Results 
show that efforts to reduce carbon emissions depend heavily on the transition of its energy mix from carbon-rich coal 
to low-carbon natural gas. Temporarily reducing a basin’s water stress through various policy changes can also 
alleviate groundwater activities and further slow down the rise of sea levels. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were 
also conducted to illustrate “what if” relationships in relation to these policy changes. These results provide relevant 
information that can be utilized by government bodies around the world.

the System Dynamics Approach 
Charlle Sy , De La Salle University, charlle.sy@dlsu.edu.ph
Abstarct 
Despite the introduction of alternative fuel policies to reduce dependency on oil products, petroleum still plays a vital 
role in global economy with the transportation sector being resilient in shifting away. Fluctuations in the global oil 
market has been a crucial subject matter where forecasting models have been formulated and analyzed for the global 
economy. With the rise of petroleum pump price in the last three years, this study aims to formulate a system dynamics 
model to investigate the global trend of petroleum pump price. The proposed model was developed to provide a 
framework in understanding the effects of COVID-19 disruption with the decisions of the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in the production capacity. In addition, the model also seeks to understand 
the feedback structure regarding the impact of Russia’s invasion to Ukraine on the petroleum fluctuation. Three 
scenarios that depict the least, base, and best cases are examined to investigate the major variable affecting the 
feedback structures. Although in theory banning oil exports would reduce petroleum pump price in a country, the 
result suggests that limiting oil exports reduces global supply and, thus, shooting up the pump prices. The results 
indicates that policies involving global petroleum price cap, alternative resource shifting, and demand curbing from 
behavioral change are more effective pump price controlling measures.

Abstract 
The joint replenishment models usually use one type of inventory policy with several different parameters to handle 
several items. However, different demand patterns for each product can make use of all previous methods leading to 
unsatisfying performance. This study brings a joint replenishment procedure that accommodates more than one single-
item inventory policy to give more flexibility. This study fills this gap by developing a methodology that consists of 
proposed general joint replenishment problem (JRP) models, potential order estimation procedures that bridge various 
single-item inventory policies to the JRP model, implementation procedure, and simulation models for comparisons. 
Comparisons to the adaptive JRP considering non-stationary demand patterns prove the advantages of the proposed 
procedure. Finally, a sensitivity analysis gives some managerial insights.

1. Introduction
Many industries, such as retail stores and pharmacy stores, involve hundreds or even thousands of items in their 
inventory systems. The relationship between a company and its suppliers usually involves more than one stock-
keeping unit (SKU) item. For example, a supplier of dairy products can supply milk, cheese, yogurt, and the like. 
Moreover, each of these products can have various flavors, aromas, or sizes. This situation triggers multi-product 
problems in determining inventory policy (Goyal  1974). 
The approach with ABC–XYZ classification is often used for the inventory system handler to become effective and 
efficient. The ABC analysis looks at the value of an item whereas the XYZ analysis looks at the demand pattern of 
each item. The XYZ analysis often produces items from the same supplier that have different demand patterns. Items 
with various demand patterns may require several inventory policies. The X class can use inventory policies with 
constant demand rates, and the Y class can use forecast-based inventory policies (Bialas et al. 2020). This situation 
makes multi-item inventory problems need to accommodate different inventory policies. 
The situation of one supplier supplying more than one product is familiar in reality, and the existence of different 
demand patterns for these products poses a challenge for determining inventory policy. Therefore, a joint 
replenishment inventory policy is needed to accommodate various demand patterns or integrate several single-item

6. Conclusion 
The implementation of joint replenishment by accommodating various single-item inventory policies can facilitate the 
implementation of the XYZ analysis. The results of the comparison with the latest adaptive JRP show better results. 
Thus, the application of JRMIP can become a new standard for benchmarks in future studies. Moreover, JRMIP can 
work on forecast-based inventory policies, non-forecast-based inventory policies, or a combination of both. The 
JRMIP procedure can be an innovation in completing a real problem that often uses several inventory policies. 
 
Future research from this study can include the development of constraints related to an industry that can apply them 
specifically to provide better results that are more in line with the industry. The application of JRP in a supply chain 
is also a challenging topic to develop.

Abstract 
Optimizing  supply chain operations by reducing costs, increasing responsiveness, and remaining competitive in a 
dynamic environment are important things for pharmaceutical companies. Perishable products in pharmaceutical 
companies make production planning problems more complex. The quality of perishable products is one of the 
characteristics that need to be considered because perishable products are not static parameters but are very dynamic 
variables. Determining the quantity of products that must be produced in order to reach consumers before the product 
shelf life runs out is one of the challenges in industries with perishable products. Demand fluctuates between periods 
during the planning horizon requires the model used to be dynamic model in order to represent the reality. Dynamic 
lot sizing will be used in this study which developed by taking quality deterioration into account. The decrease in the 
quality of perishable products in the study was affected by time, temperature, and humidity. Perishable products and 
backorders can be considered as complementary phenomena because when an item is highly perishable, demand may 
need to be accommodated to contain costs due to damage, so that losses can be avoided. This study aims to identify 
production, inventory, and backorder decisions during the planning horizon that will affect the cost of goods 
manufactured. The cost of goods manufactured is a measure of a company's competitiveness, therefore it is one of the 
focuses of this research. The cost of goods manufactured for the optimal quantity of production will be compared with 
the cost of goods manufactured under the existing conditions of the company.

Introduction 
Pharmacy is one of the industries related to human and animal life. The business entity that is authorized by the 
government in the production of medicines and medical devices is the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical 
companies recognize the importance of optimizing their supply chain operations to reduce costs, increase 
responsiveness and stay competitive in a dynamic environment. Production planning problems faced by 
pharmaceutical companies are becoming more complex with perishable products. Perishable products include 
pharmaceutical products, where the durability of the final product is a dominating factor in production planning and 
control (Acevedo-Ojeda & Chen 2020). Perishability relates to products that cannot be stored without damage or 
devaluation (Billaut 2011). 
The quality of perishable products is one of the characteristics that needs to be considered because perishable products 
will decrease over time due to a limited lifetime, not only due to physical product changes, loss of functionality and 
volume (or quantity), but also obsolescence (Hertog et al. 2014 & Acevedo-Ojeda et al. 2019). Shelf life is partly 
determined by microbial activity and the impact of this activity is strongly influenced by storage temperature, in fact, 
freshness is almost exclusively a function of time and temperature (Aung & Chang 2014). Temperatures that are too 
high increase the rate of respiration and growth of microorganisms, which can spoil some food products within hours 
or days (Hertog et al. 2014). Perishable products such as vaccines and antibiotics, exposure to temperatures outside 
the range can cause a significant reduction in drug efficacy and also increases the possibility of spoilage (Bishara,

The number of backorders that occur can be seen in Table 6. The backorder that occurred for Condition 1 in period 1 
was filled with production in period 2 of 251 units. Then, production in period 12 was able to fulfill the backorder of 
110 units that occurred in period 11. The total backorder during the planning horizon in Condition 1 was 361 units. 
More backorders in Condition 2 are carried out compared to Condition 1 because it considers a decrease in quality 
which is affected by temperature and humidity. There were five periods where demand was met through backorders 
and the fulfillment was carried out from four different production periods. There are five periods where demand is 
met through backorders in Condition 3 and these fulfillments are made from five different production periods.  
Figure 1 shows the total cost of producing klorin gard in three conditions after numerical calculations have been 
carried out. The total cost is obtained from production costs, storage costs, and backorder costs. In Condition 1, the 
largest total cost is IDR 509,922,527. The cost of setting air, namely thermohydro, causes the total cost in Condition 
1 to be the highest compared to the other two conditions. This is done so that the supplies are in storage conditions 
with optimum temperature and humidity. The total cost for Condition 2 is IDR 500,844,651 with a low decrease in 
quality, namely 0.1950855. Condition 3 with the highest quality reduction causes the total cost to be the highest, which 
is IDR 502,502,448 over the planning horizon.

2. Conclusion 
The resulting model is the development of a dynamic lot sizing model with reduced quality for perishable products. 
Deterioration in models is affected by temperature and humidity. This decrease in quality will affect the amount of 
production of perishable products. In the dynamic lot sizing model, the objective function is to minimize the total 
costs incurred within the planning horizon. The decision variables obtained are how much production and backorders 
are made and the inventory stored in order to produce a minimum total cost. 
In numerical calculations, there are three conditions that are carried out based on inventory storage which affect 
temperature and humidity inputs and will have an impact on quality degradation. Storage in a room with an air control 
device in Condition 1 can regulate temperature and humidity in optimal conditions, namely 25OC for temperature and 
40% for humidity. The decrease in quality in Condition 1 was not significant. In Condition 1, the resulting total cost 
of IDR 509,999,900 is the highest total cost with a production volume of 7,314 units, inventory stored during the

planning horizon of 2,090 units, and backorders made to meet demand of 361 units. Supplies in Condition 2 are stored 
in a room without air conditioning, the room temperature is 26OC with 45% humidity. The total cost resulting from 
Condition 2 is IDR 500,844,600 with a decrease in quality of 0.1950855. There were 7,314 units of production, 88 
units of stored inventory from this production, and 1,288 units of demand fulfillment by means of backorders. Then, 
in Condition 3 the supplies are stored outdoors without being exposed to direct sunlight, the temperature is 29OC with 
humidity of 67% outdoors. Condition 3 produces a total cost of IDR 502,502,400 with a decrease in quality of 
0.7068451. Production that occurred in Condition 3 was 7,314 units with a backorder of 1,376 units which functioned 
to meet demand because there was no inventory stored during the planning horizon.

Abstract 
A paper making process adopts primarily a generic flow of steps across industries. This industry is one of the largest 
in the world and is touted to be growing further with incremental demand for paper and its affiliated products for its 
eco-friendliness. However, paper and pulp industry is a heavily resource dependent industry be it forest resource, 
water resource, energy or chemicals. In fact, it is said to be one of the top five leading consumers of energy. Given 
such, this industry is a major contributor to depleting natural resources and increasing greenhouse gas emission, 
adding intensively to the global warming. Against such a backdrop, it offers relevant cause to study the scholarly 
discussion and debate on sustainable issues in paper and pulp industry playing around the academic universe and 
also to poke into and discuss some of the issues of sustainability in the industry emerging out of the articles. 
Accordingly, through this article, the present state of affairs in the academic fraternity on the above topic has been 
laid out through a bibliometric analysis, while some of the common challenges of environmental sustainability 
associated with the paper making process have been identified from the literature and discussed thereof.

1. Introduction
The history of ‘Paper’ is attributed to 3700 BC ago to its Greek origin from the word ‘Papyrus’, derived from its 
formation out the stalks of a papyrus plant used as a surface or base for writing (Chauhan and Meena 2021). The 
process of wood-based paper making starts from debarking and scrubbing of wood (Corcelli et al. 2018). The 
debarked and scrubbed wood is then chipped into smaller chunks of defined range, a process called chipping. The 
chipped woods are then sent to digesters where it is mixed with chemicals and given steam-bath to dissolve lignin 
and decouple the cellulose (Corcelli et al. 2018). The resultant product is the cooked pulp and the byproduct is a 
waste called black liquor. The cooked pulp is further washed, screened and refined to remove any residual fiber, 
chemical and impurities. Thereafter the material goes through a bleaching process to remove residual lignin. The 
bleached pulp is then sent to final paper production stage, where it goes through multiple processes and ultimately 
emerges out as paper sheet. In the last stage, coating and finishing operations are carried out to produce the material 
in its consumable form (Corcelli et al. 2018). 
Being one of the largest industries in the world, the pulp and paper industry is increasingly contributing to the 
growth of world economy with continents such as North America (38%), Europe (27%) and Asia (18%) being the 
major players (Baffani 2018; Chauhan and Meena 2021). Global production of paper has exceeded more than 400 
MMT with China, USA and Japan consuming more than 50% of the production (Haggith 2018).  According to 
Haggith (2018), the global average of per capita consumption of paper is 55 Kg annually, with maximum 
consumption in the North American region, the per capita figure being 215 Kg annually. According to IEA (2009), 
the demand or world paper and paperboard is expected to increase with annual production expected to touch a figure 
between 700 – 900 MT by 2050. China, India and other developing countries of Asia are predicted to be the major 
contributing players to this growth (Kong et al.2016; Chauhan and Meena 2021). As of 2020, there are nearly 5000 
pulp and paper mills around the world (Vaez and Zilouei 2020). Primary demand for Paper and pulp industry is as 
writing and reading materials, but also has demand for other applications such as packaging, decoration, graphics, 
signage, cleaning etc. In fact, the demand for packaging accounts for more than 55% of global paper consumption 
(Chauhan and Meena 2021). Post Pandemic, due to growing preference and compatibility with digital technology, 
the pattern of demand is shifting towards paper as a packaging product. Even with the introduction of environmental 
regulations over ban on non-bio degradable items such as polyethene’s, is also expected to account for increasing 
demand for their paper substitutes.

5. Conclusion
Through the bibliometric analysis and study of the articles covered by the bibliometric collection, the state of the 
literary discourse and discussions on environmental impact of paper and pulp industry was discussed. The 
discussions on the issues of sustainability pertaining to the paper and pulp industry, in the academic world, were 
studied through the journal-wise and article-wise analysis using bibliometric tool. Further, various challenges for 
sustainable business practices in the paper and pulp industry, identified from the bibliometric collection were 
discussed. On the basis of the research outcome, few suggestions of improvement were proposed. From this paper, it 
is evident that paper and pulp businesses all throughout had major environmental and societal concerns and threats 
which are ingrained in their business models. However, with rising awareness and concerns not just amongst the 
society at large, but also amongst the customers and the organisations themselves, several measures to mitigate the 
adverse effects resulting from the business models of paper and pulp industries are being adopted. Yet, achieving a 
completely sustainable and environment friendly model of paper making is a far cry. And so, further discussions, 
propositions and actions, as proposed above, are desired to make the paper making business a net resource 
contributor to the society from a net resource consumer as per the present time.

Abstract 
Undoubtedly, supply chain operations management is becoming more demanding for product tracing due to regulatory 
frameworks and fraudulent incidents. Therefore, rapidly increasing challenges arise in transparency, tracking, and data 
storage in many product supply chains. Especially in the case of wine supply chains, timely and accurate traceability 
is vital, as this industry is plagued by frequent counterfeiting activities that pose significant risks to both consumer 
health and business viability and prosperity. Blockchain technology can serve as a crucial aid for constructing modern 
wine supply chains by offering increased security and trust between all supply chain stakeholders. This paper presents 
a framework for developing Ethereum-based Blockchain distributed applications and demonstrates a use case for 
creating such an application for a wine traceability system. The developed distributed application enables the 
participants of the wine supply chain to track wines by adding and monitoring data about each individual wine bottle's 
production, fermentation, aging, bottling, and distribution, providing full supervision of its production and 
distribution. The demonstrated use case shows the different types of users and their interactions with the system to 
fully comprehend the advantages it can offer to all supply chain stakeholders as well as consumers and controlling 
authorities.

1. Introduction
In recent years, blockchain technology has drastically advanced and begun to be implemented in decentralized 
applications (Dapps) (Wu et al. 2021). This technology enables developers and businesses to create Dapps that solve 
challenges in trust and security (Udokwu and Norta 2021). This is also why Blockchain is gradually penetrating more 
and more parts of daily life (Wang et al. 2019). One of Blockchain's more recent and valuable solutions is supporting 
product supply chain operations (Dutta et al. 2020). In particular, this technology can aid the traceability of severely 
counterfeited products such as alcoholic drinks and wines. Traceability refers to the ability to both track and trace a 
product's origin throughout its manufacturing and distribution (Hastig and Sodhi  2020; Song et al. 2019). Alcoholic 
drinks and wines are a peculiar set of products severely afflicted by persistent counterfeiting activities that jeopardize 
companies' reputations and put customers' health at great risk (Kamiloglu 2019).  
In order to survive and grow in a globally networked economy, companies have understood that the performance of 
their operations and their profitability greatly depend on effective, ordered, and efficient supply chain operations. 
However, in this global market, it is becoming increasingly difficult to effectively trace the whole journey of products 
due to the increasing complexity of their supply networks (Patidar et al. 2021). Therefore, robust supply chain 
traceability is required for improved oversight and the creation of competitive advantages. Integrating blockchain 
technology into the traceability of the wine supply chain can offer multiple benefits, as its characteristics enable it to 
strengthen the immutability of the entire process. Blockchain can also guarantee authenticity, provide timely responses 
to potential problems, and, in a broader context, enable the secure and trusty transactions between all supply chain 
stakeholders (Shou et al. 2021; Hastig and Sodhi 2020). 
Numerous advantages are realized from effective supply chain traceability. Initially, it helps the prompt and effective 
recall of products in the event of faulty batches. This helps to identify the errors that contributed to the failure, boosting 
the overall supply chain's efficiency and preventing similar mistakes in future occurrences (Razak et al. 2021).

aging conditions, and the fermentation container are disclosed. Finally, in the bottling section, information is provided 
regarding who does the bottling, its location, when the bottling company receives the wine and when it bottles it, and 
the aging barrel that proves that aging has taken place. It is worth noting that for reasons of GDPR compliance, real 
names and data are not presented in the figure but only sample data. 
4. Conclusions.
The utilization of Blockchain technology in the wine supply chain, through Dapps, can provide a solution to the 
counterfeiting problem through the digitization of the supply chain. The possibility of effective tracking of the 
respective product, throughout its production and distribution range, in minimal time and at low cost, can be effectively 
provided. Blockchain significantly reduces the processes required to identify counterfeit or contaminated products 
since only one record is kept, and traceability is much easier and more immediate. There are of course, some 
drawbacks, which concern the speed of transactions, the environmental burden, the scalability of the applications 
themselves, the training of the entities involved as well as the general regulation for data protection, that need to be 
addressed in the future in order for such a blockchain system to become mainstream.  
Despite the obstacles in implementing Dapps, it is undeniable that this technology creates a new perspective for supply 
chain operations. The results of this research include the creation of a framework that is a guide for developing a Dapp 
and deploying it on the Ethereum Mainnet. The Ethereum platform itself does not limit its functionality to specific 
toolchains, so the developer can choose from a multitude of options in order to implement their own decentralized 
application. Thus, the provided framework can be significantly diversified according to the development needs, but 
its main principles will remain unchanged.  
In the following stages of our research, the Dapp will be tested in depth in real-world operations on various 
stakeholders of the wine supply chain, and appropriate improvements will be made to the smart contracts. At the same 
time, the final Frontend UI will also be designed. Our future goals include adding the NFT concept to the Dapp. More 
specifically, as the production of wine bottles is finite, each bottle could be assigned an NFT, which the consumer can 
add to a digital collection after burning each bottle. This creates a more accessible app that may appeal to both 
collectors and non-collectors, offering an additional motive to participate in this effort to combat counterfeit wine 
activities. Thus, the role of the end consumer in the decentralized application will gain more value and, at the same 
time, create a greater incentive to burn the bottle and help maintain the wine's authenticity and traceability.

Abstract 
 
In recent years, trading of sports cards has created a great attraction among collectors and investors.  Although sports 
cards investment is considered for many a high risk, this risk could be reduced creating a long-term portfolio.  For 
example, buying rookie cards (RC) from professional sports players in the early years of his/her career and holding 
them expecting until they are considered for the Hall of Fame. However, it is difficult to predict whether a player will 
likely be nominated for the Hall of Fame since their career depends on many factors on and off the field. Therefore, 
the purpose of this research is to create a model that helps collectors and investors to predict if a professional sports 
player will be inducted into a Hall of Fame (HOF).  To achieve this aim, the authors focused their work on the Baseball 
game, used the SCRUM methodology, and analyzed current Baseball Hall of Famer players performance statistics. 
The final logistic regression model consisted of seven independent variables and predict the induction of current 
baseball players in the HOF with an accuracy of 98 percent.

6. Conclusion 
While progressing through the sprints, the metrics used got closer to the expected results of the model. When 
comparing it to the other current models we realized that our model surpassed their final results (see Table 9). 
Compared to the model of Springer we used fewer variables and got better accuracy. One important finding was not 
to use the Silver Slugger award, contrary to Springer’s model because this award was only given after 1980. One key 
factor that helped our model to be used to predict player inductance more accurately was to divide variables such as 
SB, RBI and BB by the number of games played, all of these including HRAB being new variables that were not 
present in other models.

As mentioned above, the model takes a random sample for training data and the rest for validation data, so several 
tests were carried out with these random results and these were the maximum values that we obtained an accuracy of 
90%, a precision of 95 %, F1 score of 90%, sensitivity of 86%, and specificity of 95%.  Collectors and investors could 
use this model to improve the value of their collections or assess identifying potential Baseball HOFers in the early 
stages or their careers, when their Baseball cards and autos still are in reasonable prices. 
 
In this model we found certain limitations. Among them we suppose that there must be linearity between the dependent 
and independent variables, it should be verified that our independent variables explain whether to enter the HoF. 
 
Another one is to have null multicollinearity between independent variables. Also, you must manually add the new 
players you want to predict and perform certain calculations for some variables since such information is not found. 
This is the case as for the variables SBG, BBG, and HRAB . And lastly, it can only be used to predict discrete functions. 
 
For future investigations, it is recommended to explore participation in the world series as a variable to predict the 
inductance of a player to the HoF. Another opportunity is to standardize the variables to make more accurate 
predictions for actual players, specifically for the awards received, it would likely be useful to predict how many 
awards the player will receive. There is a big area of opportunity regarding the creation of a model to predict if a 
pitcher will be inducted into the HoF, as well as exploring players that have been pitchers and batters such as Ohtani 
or Babe Ruth and analyze if their likelihood of entering the HoF is greater being a batter or a pitcher or if there is any 
way to create a model that considers both statistics (batting and pitching).

Abstract 
Currently, in the textile sector there are different opportunities to improve productivity and reduce production costs 
originating from various factors such as excess waste and waste of materials, delay in manufacturing and delivery of 
orders with negative effects on income. of the company. The objective of the research is to develop a production 
management model to reduce production costs in the curtain making process of a textile mype in the city of Lima, 
Peru, using an empirical research design, from a quantitative approach to explanatory level in the case study modality, 
presenting an engineering solution model validated through simulation techniques. A diagnosis of the situation found 
was made by applying the Value Stream Mapping (VSM) technique; accompanied by an analysis of the root causes 
of the identified problems and the analysis of research background on the subject, the System Layout Planning (SLP) 
technique was selected as a solution tool. The solution model was validated through the simulation technique using 
the Arena software, finding that production costs decreased by 3.74% compared to the initial situation.

1. Introduction
In Peru, according to estimates from the Sociedad Nacional de Industrias (SNI), the textile and clothing industry is 
the third activity with the highest contribution to manufacturing PBI, at 6.4% as of 2019, and it is estimated that it 
generates 398 thousand direct jobs per year and 900 thousand jobs; and according to the Superintendencia Nacional 
de Administración Tributaria [SUNAT] as of 2018, the sector was made up of 93,861 productive units, of which 
99.9% corresponds to micro and small companies, mype (Instituto de Estudios Economicos y Sociales [IEE] 2019). 
The production of the textile and clothing sector gradually decreased by 32.1% compared to 2012 as a result of factors 
such as increased competition with low-cost imported products as well as limiting factors in the sector such as lack of 
planning, waste of resources, reprocesses, excess movements, lack of space and others (Larios-Francia 2017); 
problems that increased between 2021 and the beginning of 2022 as the demand for their products increased and 
therefore delays in delivery were generated, which affected customer dissatisfaction (Ames et al. 2019).  
The industry with low value of added labor and intensive labor, such as the textile sector, must take certain measures 
of attention in terms of improving production, efficiency and productivity (Parida and Pradhan 2016). In this sense, it 
is important that in order to achieve lower costs, it is necessary to have a good design of facilities, guaranteeing a 
greater use of space to effectively employ labor. This also implies that the operators carry out the work determined by 
the companies in the agreed times so that they generate maximum use, taking into account that the work carried out 
by the personnel must be valued and highlighted in a good way to improve the production of the company and thus 
obtain greater profitability (Jaimes et al. 2018).

6. Conclusion 
In relation to the general objective of the investigation, it is concluded that the implementation of the production 
management model using the System Layout Planning (SLP) technique generated that production costs were reduced 
by 3.74% due to the decrease in production and use delays. resource efficiently. It is essential that the personnel in 
charge of production planning have the skills and technological support to simulate the changes that may occur in the 
operations and to carry out the monitoring and improvements necessary for the proper application of the methodology. 
In relation to the specific objectives of the research, it was found: 
 
Through the Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and the problem tree in the diagnostic phase, the most relevant problems 
of the curtain manufacturing process were identified, detailing the production metrics, to identify the improvements 
in each of the related activities; in addition, to generate an action plan that allows to solve the identified problems. It 
is advisable to review the literature proposed by other authors to have a better repository of possible problems that 
occur to companies in the textile sector. 
 
Through the System Layout Planning (SLP) technique, a better distribution of the plant was achieved, improving the 
organization of spaces to facilitate more efficient production and a higher level of competitiveness of the company. It 
is recommended to use technical sheets and interviews with the organization's staff to contemplate the entire panorama 
that the company is going through. 
 
The proposed model, when implemented, improved the initial situation of the company, achieving significant positive 
changes in the organization, thus managing to reduce the total time of operations by 15.34 minutes, travel time by 
11.18%, non-conforming products in 10%, cutting cycle time by 22.27%, raw material costs by 3.74%, and increasing 
the number of orders by 22.27%. It is recommended to carry out a pilot test of the proposed model to show 
improvements in the action plan and that the detailed metrics continue with its development. 
The validation of the improvement proposal through the Arena simulator helps to obtain future responses to the 
implemented changes without having to put the company at risk and to identify the processes that obtained a better 
performance compared to the current situation of the company. It is recommended to carry out the simulation with the 
extreme data of the range of orders to have results in all the possible scenarios that the company may encounter.

Abstract 
Company ABC is a manufacturing company and committed to providing high-quality metal stamping and plastic 
injection molding products. The main objective of the study is to reduce the black spot defects in Case Lower (68 
MB62) that occurred in the plastic injection molding process. The researcher used Lean Six Sigma Methodology as 
a technique to reduce quality problems. Applied research was used as the research design in the study. Based on the 
findings of the study, the problem occurred in the filtering process and as a result, black spot defects had the highest 
defect percentage equivalent to 7.85%. The overall current process performance or Process Z was 1.42 lower than 
the standard value of 2.00. Further validation was made using Why-why analysis and found out that filter mesh 
design was the identified root cause of the problem. To reduce the percentage of defects, improvement of filter mesh 
design was completed and after implementation, the data was collected and based on the results the defect 
percentage was reduced to 2.16%, overall process performance or Process Z increased to 2.02 higher than the 
minimum limit of 2.00. For the improvement to be sustained, a work instruction and control plan was developed.

1. Introduction
Company ABC is a manufacturing company and committed to provide high quality Metal Stamping and Plastic 
Injection Molding products. The company manufacturers various parts for different items such as computers, 
printers, cameras, appliances, automotive and other related plastic moldings, and metal stamping products. The 
company adheres to the highest quality standard to delightfully satisfying their customers with regards to quality, 
service, and delivery. The researcher observed the operations particularly the quality issues encountered in the 
production, and it was found out the top defects were present in the plastic injection molding process specifically in 
the Case Lower (68-MB62) product which accounted to overall rejection rate of 17.46%.  
Furthermore, in producing the Case Lower (68-MB62) product, the recycled raw materials were placed into the 
grinding machine to cut it into small pieces. It was observed that cutting blades are not properly cleaned before the 
next use and as a result the residue of raw materials left from the blades mixed in the new sets of raw materials to be 
processed. After which, the finished products from the grinding machine with contaminated materials will be placed 
in the filter machine to remove the very small pieces and portions with an incorrect cut and transferred into the 
mixer machine to combine the foreign and contaminated materials. The researcher found out during the observation 
that the portions with an incorrect cut do not pass through the filters and are mixed up with the materials in the 
mixer machine. The residue materials in the filter will then be placed in a storage box and to be delivered into the 
plastic injection molding machine. Then the vacuum tube will be used in absorbing the combined materials directed 
into the pellet with residue materials. The researcher found out that the residue materials get sipped first in the 
vacuum tube, turning it into black while being melted and burned. After molding, the final product is produced in 
which the black spot defects were observed.

6. Conclusion
Based on the findings gathered and concerning the objective of the study, the following conclusions were made. In 
the Define phase, the researcher was able to identify the top problem of the company using Pareto Analysis. Based 
on the Pareto chart the black spot defects were identified as the main source of the problem which was equivalent to 
7.85%. The process mapping was applied to locate the main source of the problem and was noticed in the filtering 
process. The project charter was used to present the overall target improvement of 4.50%, project timeline from 
April – July 2021, and scope of the project in the Plastic injection molding process. In the Measure phase, the 
researcher presented the breakdown of 7.85% from the month of January-March 2021. A time series was utilized to 
illustrate the details of the defect percentage versus the overall target. Using Laney p-chart, it was found out that the 
proportion of variation in control limit based on the results was out of control while process performance was not 
stable to meet the customer requirements.  
To further validate the overall process performance, the binomial capability results showed the results below the 
target of 2.00 which indicates that the process is not performing well. In Analyze phase, the researcher utilized the 
Why-why analysis to further investigate the root cause of the problem. It was revealed that the root cause of the 
problem is the filter mesh design. In Improve phase, the researcher together with a team from the company came up 
with an improvement plan to reduce the problem. The team came up with an improved design of the filter mesh. 
After the implementation of using the newly improved filter mesh, the researcher gathers data, and it was found out 
that there was significant improvement after comparing the control limit variation, process performance, and overall 
defect percentage which indicates the effectiveness of the improvement action. In the Control phase, the researcher 
developed a control plan for the filtering process to sustain the improvement and prevent the recurrence of the 
problem.

 Abstract 
Value stream mapping (VSM) is an initial and critical tool for deploying lean concepts in manufacturing and service 
sector including hospitals. Radiology department receives diverse inputs and provides vast range of services which 
make this system complex and challenging to optimize. In developing countries where hospitals are oppressed by high 
patient load, crowded receptions and waiting areas due to long patient waiting time create hindrance in other operations 
as well. Therefore, the aim of this research is to analyze the working environment of a public sector hospitals’ 
radiology department; as a case study, identify the bottleneck and waste in operations by mapping the current patient 
flow, and propose system improvements with the help of arena simulation. Use of simulation allow experimenting 
with different scenarios and make predictions about the outcomes, without changing the complex systems in reality. 
This study is based on the data collected for 15 days, through doctors and staff interviews and direct observation 
(Gemba walk). Patients requiring radiology services are classified as routine and procedure patient, with later need an 
appointment for the consultation after procedure. The research work is divided into two distinct phases: during the 
first phase waste checklist was developed using 5 why approach followed by Ishikawa diagram to identify the potential 
causes of long waiting time. The VSM tool mapped the current patient flow, with 13min processing time for routine 
patient and 59min for procedure patient. However, the total non-value adding time is found to be 188min (3hr) for 
routine and 388min (6hr) for procedure patients.  The patients waiting for the scan reports is found to be the major 
bottle neck. During the second phase of work: to develop arena model initially best fit distribution is done on the 
obtained data. Arena simulation model is developed for the radiology department to analyze the number of patients 
out, waiting time per patient and average number of patients in the system. The model is verified by a specialist and 
validated using t-test, the model is replicated 200 times in arena to give best results with minimum deviation. Total 6 
scenarios are analyzed to determine the impact on the above mentioned KPIs. Simulation results of current scenario 
showed 567 patients out of the system, with a maximum wait time of 31min/patient and average 43 patients in the 
system. The simulation results of the 5th scenario provided the optimum output, with 30% improvement in patient out, 
3% reduction in waiting time per patient and only 19 patients in the system on average. Based on it a future VSM is 
created which provided a 26% and 19% decrease in processing time, while non value added time is reduced by 73% 
and 61% for routine and procedure patients. This can lead to increase in the number of patients to be entertained by 
the radiology services without adding any new resource.

Abstract 
This research paper aims to create an integrated online platform that can address the issues faced by members of the 
supply chain of frozen processed chicken products in the Philippines during the Covid-19 pandemic. These groups 
are namely the customers, retailers, and producers/suppliers of the mentioned product. As a mixed-methods study 
consisting of a quantitative and qualitative aspect, two modes of data gathering were executed. A survey 
questionnaire was given to the group classified as the customers. For the retailer and producer/supplier group, a 
semi-structured interview was conducted. The respondents were from Region IV-A and NCR. The researchers first 
identified the significant factors as well as the direct and indirect relationships existing between the latent variables 
Covid-19 challenges, Market Opportunities, and Supply Chain Effectiveness based on the survey responses. This 
was carried out using Partial Least Squares and Bootstrapping in Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) with the help 
of SMART PLS 3. A formative measurement model was also constructed. According to the results, Closure of 
Markets, Inter-city/municipality Transportation Restrictions, Labor Shortage, and Purchases from Home all 
significantly affect and directly contribute to the latent variable Covid-19 challenges (C19C) - signifying their 
contribution to the difficulties in the pandemic supply chain of frozen processed chicken products. For Market 
Opportunities (MO) and Supply Chain Effectiveness (SCE), it was observed that Price Increases, Purchasing 
Frequency, and On-site Purchase were directly related to MO while Quality of Online Ordered. Products, Courier 
Availability, Sufficient Number of Drivers, and Price Differences of Delivery Services were all directly related to 
SCE. Indirect observed constructs were referred to as relatively important factors. As for the creation of the agile 
online supply chain platform, the researchers utilized content analysis for the qualitative aspect. Existing literature 
was used to further back up the features and functions to be included in the agile integrated platform for customers, 
retailers, and suppliers. The following are the topmost features that were prioritized as part of the design of the 
product based on the responses: Product Transparency, Shared Information on Real-demand, Order Visibility, and 
Fast Communication.

1. Introduction 
The Micro Small Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) of the Philippines have their fair share of Covid-19 disruptions that 
greatly affect their productivity. Amounting to 99.5% of the total number of business establishments in the country, 
and also employing about 63% Filipinos (Philippine Statistics Authority, 2020), it is evident that these enterprises 
contribute significantly to the Philippines’ development. Now, with the pandemic greatly affecting the whole world, 
another set of challenges are immensely being experienced by every factor involved in the business world. 
 
The Philippines is not alone when it comes to facing the onslaught of the covid-19 pandemic. In order to mitigate the 
spread of the disease, the government focused its direction on setting up lockdowns disguised as community 
quarantines. These year-long restrictions are aimed to lessen interaction between people but cause severe disruptions 
in the supply chain processes (e.g. agriculture) [World Bank, 2020a]. This led to fewer people engaging in the 
outside world resulting in the closure of service industries such as hotels and restaurants. Some businesses had to 
raise their product prices in order to compensate for the damages imposed by the lockdowns. This also puts more

Abstract 
The order’s delivery process of this Peruvian brewery generates many rejected orders and, therefore, cost overruns, 
for which the present work aims to make an analysis of the main problems, such as product quality, truck loading 
errors and non-payment of clients; and propose improvement actions to reduce refusals, operating and transportation 
costs. In addition, the purpose of the research is to demonstrate the profitability of the proposed improvements, both 
establishing a prepaid service and implementing RFIDs for inventory control, based on the current situation of the 
company and its logistics network, and analyze how these improvements affect the main KPI refusal percentage. On 
the other hand, the methodology has followed the IMRAD structure, and tools such as Input Analyzer and the Monte 
Carlo Method were utilized. The main findings of the research explain that the refusal % was reduced from 2.28% to 
1.83%, and the benefit / cost of the proposed improvement actions has a value of 1.83, indicating that for every dollar 
invested, there is a benefit of 1.83 dollars. This proposal, shows that these actions are effective and feasible, 
maintaining the service level and reducing the costs previously mentioned.

1. Introduction
The company is a beer production enterprise that sells drinking consumer goods such as beer, carbonated drinks, 
water, energizers, etc. As of now, this company holds more than 95% of the beer market share and it is constantly 
increasing. That is why it has 5 production plants and more than 100 distribution centers where the products are sent 
to be distributed in the different regions throughout Peru. In addition, there are 5 main distribution centers located 
within the same premises of each plant that have their own distribution networks, which have been located according 
to geographical convenience. From these centers, orders are distributed nationwide in trucks, thus achieving coverage 
of demand at the country level. The company relies on taking customer orders through an online application to be able 
to schedule their shipments. Likewise, it has processes that primarily include the production of beverages and their 
due shipments to the distribution centers to later transfer them to customers. Within this chain, the goods produced 
are boxed and distributed by trucks to previously specified distribution centers. Boxes of 12 and 6 units are used for 
the customer’s order presentations. During these activities, refusals may occur along the process. Refusals are orders 
(classified as Not Delivered) for beverages that have not been delivered as planned or that have been delivered 
incorrectly due to logistical, customer, or sales reasons. 
The company has agreed to share their organizational and historical data for research purposes in this investigation, 
which means that every numeric data collected is reliable and true. According to historical data of 2022, 6.44% of the 
orders are refusals due to poor quality presentation, and this percentage is higher than the one obtained in 2021 which 
is 6.13%. This problem involves having dented products, broken tags, ripped tags, between others, caused by wrong 
product manipulation by workers. This poor quality presentation is visually determined the workers’ observations. 
Likewise, 3.86% of the orders are rejected due to a product truck loading error, obtaining an amount of 19,042 boxes 
rejected by customers. This percentage has increased in comparison with the year 2021, where these rejections 
happened in 3.42% of the orders. This is caused by controlling incorrectly the traceability and the identification of 
products, which makes them be loaded, by workers, into the wrong trucks with different destinations from the desired 
ones. Since past years, the company has had to deliver orders to final customers at an increasing rate because of the

has used the information collected by the company to forecast average results using the Monte Carlo method, which 
ensures greater reliability because it makes 10,000 runs of the model. This is an additional limitation because it all 
starts from the theory and conditions that we have presented. If one wanted to obtain more exact and demonstrable 
results, it would be necessary to physically implement the proposed proposals and carry out studies of the new physical 
processes. 
On the other hand, there was also the limitation of not being able to measure the reaction to change by the company's 
collaborators, in the face of changes in the processes, nor was it possible to evaluate their capacity in the use of the 
technologies that are being proposed. These are also part of the limitations that could in some degree affect the results 
on the % of predicted refusals. We recommend that studies that have the facility to evaluate these criteria take it into 
account. 
Comparing based on the research by Xiao et al. (2017), the values used in this research with the results of their study 
are similar, because they found a reduction in the time used by operators over time in distribution centers of 65% after 
implementing the RFID system. This value is contrasted with that used in the present investigation, which is (Chen 
et al. (2013) which is 60%, which shows a similarity in the amounts. It should be noted that RFID system costs based 
on their research in China, so the value for Peru could differ. 
Likewise, in comparison with the research of Chen et al. (2013), they highlight in their study that the accuracy with 
the reading of RFIDs is 99.5%, which is similar to 98.78%, which was used in the present investigation. However, 
when working with large volume quantities of products, this difference in accuracy could mean considerable variance 
in inventory recording. It should be noted that they used lean manufacturing, which are techniques that help eliminate 
waste of time, inventory, materials, among others, and this would contribute positively to any distribution center. 
They also found that the use of cross-docking as a distribution and storage strategy further favors operating times. 
The results obtained show a benefit-cost ratio of 1.83 in total for the 2 improvements implemented. On the side of 
RFIDs specifically, this ratio is 1.84, and it is contrasted with the value obtained by Tsai & Huang (2012), who 
achieved a ratio of 2.5 for their system in their study with RFIDs. This complements the viability of this improvement 
and its positive effect on cost savings. This study deals with a port in Taiwan with container trade of more than 1 
million annually to achieve greater container security, eliminate manual inspections and reduce fees. 
5. Conclusions and Future Research
The company effectively has the capacity to reduce the refusals % due to non-payment by customers, loading errors 
and poor quality, which generates a better rate of orders delivered correctly and generates efficiencies in transportation 
and distribution centers. There is a total positive benefit-cost ratio of 1.83, so the proposals are viable and beneficial. 
The flexibility in policies must be aligned with the objectives and planning of the company. It is necessary to analyze 
the client portfolio and formulate strategies for the different segments to ensure profitability. 
Some differences with other investigations include the SKU numbers of the companies, since in this case there are 
not as many codes as in others. Also, some involve supply chains with ocean shipments of products. On the other 
hand, the investigations are assimilated to the studies of companies with high turnover products, especially in the 
warehouse areas, and because the sources of efficiency are focused on eliminating the waste of operating time, 
resources, and unnecessary transfers, which are converted into costs. 
The novelty of this research was the focus on a problem not so commonly analyzed, which represents refusals, which 
cause less customer service and money losses from various sources. The 3 specific reasons investigated, and the 
improvements not only fulfilled the main objective of reducing rejects, but also show a correlation with efficiency in 
distribution centers. Likewise, the Monte Carlo Method was used to foresee probabilistic cases that model reality. It 
is recommended to expand this research with analysis of physical operations and time studies in the different 
distribution centers to further reduce times, routes and further automate processes. Inefficiencies due to waste of time, 
products and operations were eliminated. For this reason, the implementation of lean manufacturing techniques, 
analysis of routes and increase of technology in DCs for other operations would surely generate lower costs.

Abstract 
High-quality education is required for a sustainable society, particularly in the engineering profession, where future 
global leaders play a critical role. To accomplish this, sustainability must be integrated into Higher Education 
Institutions (HEIs). As people's concerns about the environment's impact on them grow, so does the importance of 
sustainable development. It is critical to assess students' knowledge and efforts in engineering courses in order to 
communicate an institution's strategic direction. The purpose of this research is to better identify the level of 
sustainability implemented by students, who constitute a sizable number of HEI stakeholders. The research was 
conducted in a HEI in Manila, Philippines, using a mixed methodological approach with a sequential explanatory 
design. A survey was created to collect and analyze quantitative data, which was then supplemented with qualitative 
insights from a focus group discussion. The study's findings show how HEIs may improve sustainability by 
understanding the dynamics of change and acting as change agents. We can develop a more sustainable and 
responsible engineering profession by including sustainability into education, ultimately contributing to a more 
sustainable global future.

1. Introduction
A sustainable world requires high-quality education that incorporates sustainability principles, especially in the 
engineering profession, where future global leaders play a critical role (Žalėnienė & Pereira, 2021). Higher Education 
Institutions (HEIs) are responsible for shaping undergraduate engineering programs and preparing students to apply 
sustainable practices (Leal Filho et al., 2019). With growing worries about the influence of the environment on persons 
and organizations, sustainable development has grown in importance around the world (Mensah, 2019). In order to 
encourage responsible and sustainable engineering practices, it is critical to include sustainability into engineering 
education (Miñano Rubio et al., 2019). 
To effectively address the difficulties of sustainability in the engineering profession, it is critical to analyze 
undergraduate engineering students' present level of sustainability knowledge and practices (Beagon et al., 2022). 
HEIs can integrate their educational methods and curricula with sustainable development goals by understanding 
students' perspectives and evaluating their sustainability efforts (Ferrer-Estévez & Chalmeta, 2021). This evaluation 
will be used to promote sustainability integration in undergraduate engineering programs and to shape future 
engineering professionals. 
1.1 Objectives 
The primary goal of this research is to assess undergraduate engineering programs' sustainability knowledge and 
practices at a Higher Education Institution (HEI) in Manila, Philippines. The study's specific goals are as follows: 
•
Determine undergraduate engineering students' level of sustainability knowledge and understanding.
•
Evaluate how well sustainability principles are integrated into engineering courses and projects.
•
Identify the obstacles and challenges that students experience when implementing sustainability practices.
•
Investigate potential sustainability techniques and efforts in undergraduate engineering programs.

reasons as the most difficult. These findings point to the need for focused support and interventions to help students 
make sustainable food choices. 
3. Perceptions of the institution: According to the examination of students' opinions in Table 3, the institution was 
perceived positively in terms of incorporating sustainability into research and student organization activities. 
However, topics such as offering sustainable transportation options and preserving electricity were noted as possible 
areas for improvement. 
4. Importance of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Figure 2 shows that students ranked SDG 4 (Quality 
Education), SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), and SDG 8 (Decent Jobs and Economic Growth) as the most 
important SDGs. This data can help influence curriculum development and link engineering programs with the SDGs 
that students care about. 
5. Student Interests and chosen Learning Resources: Students' interests in certain sustainability themes (Figure 3) 
provide useful insights into the topics that are most appealing to them. Furthermore, students believe that attending 
in-person activities and using social media are the most effective resources for learning about sustainability (Figure 
4). These findings highlight the necessity of providing different learning opportunities and employing digital platforms 
to communicate and promote sustainable practices. 
 
The findings of the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) revealed additional reasons and expectations among students 
for participating in sustainability events or activities. Advocacy and relationship building, support for sustainability, 
taking action and responsibility, setting an example, and a sense of fulfillment were among the themes that arose. 
Students expected information and enlightenment, self-development, a broader perspective, interactions and acts, and 
support and advocacy. 
 
The following recommendations are made in light of these findings: 
 
1. Improve Sustainability Education: Engineering programs should integrate sustainability principles throughout their 
curriculum, incorporating concepts and real-world applications into courses, projects, and research activities. 
2. Improve Infrastructure and Practices: Universities should prioritize the improvement of sustainability-related 
infrastructure and practices, such as offering sustainable transportation options, optimizing energy usage, and 
implementing environmentally friendly policies. 
3. Encourage Collaboration and Advocacy: Institutions should foster collaboration among students, professors, and 
external stakeholders to promote sustainability-focused programs, allowing students to advocate for sustainability and 
effect positive change in their communities. 
4. Expand Co-curricular Activities: Provide a variety of co-curricular activities, such as student clubs and programs, 
that focus on sustainability, allowing students to participate actively and get practical experience in adopting 
sustainable practices. 
5. Encourage Digital Engagement: Use digital platforms and social media to disseminate information on sustainability, 
boost student engagement, and encourage participation in sustainability events and activities. 
6. Professional Development for Faculty: Provide faculty members with training and resources to improve their 
knowledge and comprehension of sustainability concepts, allowing them to effectively integrate sustainability 
principles into their teaching and research. 
 
By applying these recommendations, undergraduate engineering schools may develop a sustainable culture, enable 
students to become responsible practitioners, and contribute to a more sustainable future.

Abstract 
There isn't enough research on people with disabilities (PWD), despite the rise in the number of PWD. Although the 
amount of information concerning disabilities in the workplace is growing, more research is still needed in this field. 
This study uses bibliometric analysis to discover the most recent publications. Bibliometrics analysis aids in 
quantitative and graphical analysis, which offers a better understanding of the literature. The authors conduct a 
bibliometric analysis of the author's publication, country, topics evolution, and keywords. This will be done using 
Biblioshiny and a web interface for bibliometrix analysis based on the R package. This program was selected because 
it creates and presents bibliometric networks more skillfully.The most influential articles and journals are also 
identified in the study. This article will help the future researchers in identifying the authors for collaboration and 
important journals for sending novel articles.

1. Introduction
Despite growing the numbers of people with disabilities (PWD), there is a lack of research in “organizational 
behavior”, “Human resource management,” and “Industrial and organizational psychology” (Stone & Colella 1996). 
The body of knowledge about disability in the workplace is increasing but still needs more research in this area. This 
study aims to find the current literature using bibliometrics analysis. Bibliometrics analysis helps in analyzing 
quantitatively and visually, which provides better insight into the literature. A literature review is done using 
Biblioshiny and a web interface for bibliometrix analysis based on the R package (Moral-Muñoz et. al. 2020); authors 
will do the bibliometric analysis of the author's publication, country, themes evolution, and keywords. This software 
is chosen because it generates and visualizes bibliometric networks more effectively. The study produces a co-
occurrence network with a higher keyword score and changing trends over time and a co-citation network of authors 
to find the common themes on which authors have worked.  
Despite the passing of Anti-discrimination laws and ratifying the CRPD, the representation of PWD in the workplace 
is negligible because of stereotypes, prejudice, and myths (Heera & Maini 2019). The main barriers to their 
employment are the cost of workplace accommodations, the nature of employment, co-workers’ attitudes, discomfort 
and unfamiliarity, and a lack of understanding of disabled people's effectiveness (Houtenville & Kalargyrou 2012). 
PWD in the workplace face discrimination like not being able to appoint due to disability (Shier et. al. 2009); rigid 
performance standards (Graffam, et. al. 2002), unwilling supervision, and rejection or delay in promotion (Schur et. 
al. 2005).

The table 1 shows the most relevant articles on the topic of disability inclusion in the workplace based on the citation. 
The most important article is Stone & Colella, 1996; published in Academy of Management Review, citing for 26 
years with highest 427 citations and per year citation is 15.815. This article is significant because it was the first article 
in disability studies that explains how disabled are treated in the workplace and the factors affecting their treatment. 
The second most cited article is (Von Schrader et. al. 2014), published in Employee Responsibilities and Rights 
Journal with 94 citations, and per year citation is 10.444. The first two most cited articles both talk about the factors; 
the first one discusses factor that affects the treatment of the disabled, and the second one discusses factors that 
influence disability disclosure. Dwertmann & Boehm  2016; is the third most cited article with 69 citations, and per 
year citation is 9.857. (Scott et. al. 2019) and (Stephens et al.,2005) both have the exact citations, 51 each and per year 
citation are 12.75 and 2.833, respectively, which shows (Scott et. al. 2019) has high TC per year than (Stephens 2005). 
(Scott et. al. 2019) is the fourth most cited article published in Autism and (Stephens  2005) is the fifth most cited 
article published in Research in Developmental Disabilities. After fifth most cited article the total citations of articles 
are not very high; the reason could be that articles have published in recent years. 
6. Conclusion
Disability inclusion in the workplace refers to creating an environment where individuals with disabilities have equal 
opportunities to succeed and thrive in their careers. This involves making accommodations, implementing policies 
and procedures, and promoting a culture of diversity and inclusiveness. The goal of disability inclusion is to remove 
barriers to employment and ensure that people with disabilities have the same access to job opportunities, benefits, 
and career advancement as their non-disabled peers. Effective disability inclusion practices can benefit both 
employees with disabilities and the organization as a whole, leading to increased productivity, employee engagement, 
and a positive company culture. 
7. Implications of the Study
The policy-makers could frame policies that could help in (i) providing a physically accessible workplace and using 
assistive technology to support employees with disabilities (ii) Making changes to the workplace to enable employees 
with disabilities to perform their jobs effectively. (iii) Having clear policies and procedures in place to support 
employees with disabilities, such as flexible work arrangements and leave policies. (iv) Providing training to 
employees on disability awareness and inclusion to promote a positive and supportive work environment. (v) Ensuring 
that the recruitment and retention practices are inclusive and accessible to people with disabilities. (vi) Regularly 
measuring and monitoring the progress of disability inclusion initiatives to identify areas for improvement. (vii) 
Providing support and resources for employees with disabilities, such as mentorship programs, counseling services, 
and wellness programs. 
By implementing these practices, organizations can foster a culture of inclusion and create a supportive workplace 
environment for employees with disabilities. This not only benefits employees with disabilities, but it also leads to a 
more diverse, productive, and successful workplace.

Abstract  
 
The rail industry is starting to focus on the improvement of the overall experience of their passengers which is not 
just limited to the ride experience but also includes their experience while in the line's facilities such as their rail 
station. To improve passenger experience, improving the facility's design and configuration based on the quality 
dimensions and factors affecting it will be vital. This study aims to assess one of the busiest stations in the 
Philippines, the Taft Station of the MRT-3 line along Epifanio De los Santos Avenue based on its quality 
dimensions. The quality dimensions identified through literature include accessibility, navigation, and comfort & 
convenience. The passengers' perceived experience of the station's quality dimensions was assessed, rendering 
unsatisfactory results. Gaps observed include the lack of standard and visible signage, information boards and 
markings, repair of equipment, physical obstructions on the walkway, and no proper infrastructure for persons with 
disabilities and the elderly. Design alternatives were then generated to improve the current facility in the aspects 
concerning quality dimensions. The study recommends implementing the generated design alternatives to improve 
the passengers' experience in MRT-3 Taft Station. A similar assessment method can be used for other train stations 
as well.

1. Introduction 
Railway transportation is one of the preferred means of transportation in urban areas due to its reliability, convenience, 
and efficiency. It is also one of the sustainable means of mass transportation which is why a lot of countries are focusing 
on expanding their rail network, especially in their urban areas and city centers. In the Philippines, there are currently 
four operational rail lines, LRT-1, LRT-2, MRT-3, and PNR with a total railway footprint of 77 KM that serve Metro 
Manila and neighboring provinces. 
 
One of the busiest line transits in the Philippines is the Metro Manila Transit Line 3 (MRT-3), placing second to Manila 
Light Rail Transit Line 1 (LRT-1) in having the greatest number of train passengers in 2021 (Department of 
Transportation 2022). In recent years, the operations of this line transit have become problematic. Hundreds of service 
disruptions and unloading incidents from 2012 to 2017 occurred due to lack of good maintenance practices and failure 
to undertake scheduled works on overhaul and upgrading (Dela Cruz 2019). In previous years, the administration 
rehabilitated the MRT-3. One of its upgrades includes increasing the number of trains leading to reduced waiting time 
between trains (Parrocha 2022).  
 
While improving travel time and train operations reliability can help satisfy passengers’ needs, it is not enough to 
create happy customers or to improve the quality of their travel experience. It is equally important to know the 
expectations of passengers as customers and to define and provide these qualities to improve their overall travel 
experience (Hagen and Oort 2019). Hagen and Oort (2019) suggest that the dimensions of passenger quality 
expectations can be ranked in the form of a pyramid, wherein the primary expectation is safety and reliability, followed 
by speed, and then by ease. These first three dimensions form the prerequisite needs and expectations of passengers, 
that when not provided will cause their dissatisfaction. On the other hand, passengers also expect a certain degree of

6. Conclusion  
One factor that affects the experience of passengers in their railway commute is their experience in and with the 
rail station facility. Hence, if passenger experience is aimed to be improved, a vital component of the improvements 
that should be done is with the facility. 
 
The Design Qualities of a railway station are factors that can be considered in improving the passenger experience. 
It includes accessibility, comfort, convenience, and ease of use among others. These are qualities that a rail station's 
facility must have to provide a positive customer experience. 
 
However, in the case of MRT-3 Taft Station, there are gaps and issues in terms of congestion, lack of facility 
features, and poor facility arrangement/maintenance which could negatively affect the experience of passengers. 
To address these, solution alternatives were developed. These alternatives aim to Improve Station's accessibility, 
navigation, and passenger flow, and provide comfort and convenience to passengers – that if all implemented well, 
will help contribute to the improvement of passenger experience and help with the achievement of the company's 
goals. 
 
For the areas of future study, other researchers may consider the impact of passenger volume in the station in 
determining the appropriate quality dimension features of the facility that will be improved. This should cover the 
study of the appropriate spatial and capacity requirements (ex: number of ticket booths, dedicated lanes for 
queueing, size of the platform, etc.) given the current and future passenger demand – which was not covered in this 
study. A similar assessment method can also be used for other train stations as well.

Abstract 
The benefits and application potentials of artificial intelligence in controlling are widely known. Contrary to 
expectations, an in-depth interview study of Austrian industrial companies shows that the use of AI in controlling is 
only just beginning. In order to make controllers fit in this area, in-depth knowledge channels are required. In addition, 
several other aspects need to be considered for implementation. This paper presents the results of a qualitative pilot 
study from Austria on the use of artificial intelligence in the controlling departments of Austrian industrial companies.

1. Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is of great importance for the economy. The effects will benefit society as a whole. Business 
processes will be optimized, the basis for decision-making will be improved, new sources of revenue will be opened 
up and productivity will be enhanced. These benefits demonstrated by the EU and the assessment of the potential 
ensure that the position in the EU in global competition should be improved and thus AI should be increasingly 
promoted so that it benefits the economy and its citizens (European Parliament  2019).  
AI is seen as a game changer in the corporate world which create additional value in the company (Wamba-Taguimdje 
et al. 2020; Plastino and Purdy 2018; Chamoni and Gluchowski 2017). For this purpose, AI covers a wide range of 
different technologies, such as translation programmes, chatbots or image classification. Many different methods and 
algorithms are now being used in the field of AI or predictive analytics such as neural networks, support vector 
machines, decision trees and forests, naïve bayes, linear and logistic regression, cluster analysis, k-means, k-nearest 
neighbour classification just to name a few (e.g. Chamoni & Gluchowski  2017; Athey & Imbens 2019). 
AI can be used to optimise products or services, processes and many other areas in a company. In the business sector, 
a lot has happened with regard to the use of artificial intelligence (Mertens and Barbian 2019; Koropp and Treitz 
2019). Machine learning algorithms have become increasingly common on the stock exchange and in banks in recent 
years. They are used, for example, to analyse stock market prices, valuation of real options or to identify fraud (e.g. 
Han & Kim 2021; Andreou et al. 2006; Bao et al. 2022). 
Another area of application of AI is the use of these technologies in administration, especially in the controlling 
department, but also in the finance department, there are several task areas that can be processed with AI technology.

• 
Use cases should be presented in the form of videos, video tutorials, or webinars, combined with a forum for 
exchanging experiences, so that it is easy to replicate the solutions or transfer them to one's own use cases. 
 
In general, it can be stated that most controllers have problems with AI, as they have not had any contact with this 
topic to date. It is also apparent that graduates of universities with courses such as programming have a more open 
and receptive approach than those graduates who have to familiarize themselves with the topic for the first time.  
 
Even though the replacement of controllers and accountants by machines is still a future scenario, Peng and Chang 
(2019) already provide further recommendations for the future role model of the profession when the profession is 
replaced by the machine. Their recommendations in this regard are continuous education, building communication 
skills, seamlessly connecting and living with AI, advancing informational Information capability and development of 
professional skills. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The results of the survey show that the benefits of artificial intelligence in controlling are seen by industrial companies, 
but are not yet in use or only to a limited extent. Due to their operational activities, controllers usually do not have the 
time to deal intensively with AI technologies. In addition, there is often a lack of acceptance at employee level to deal 
with new topics such as computer skills in programming. At the organizational level, there is usually a lack of data 
quality and resources. In order to demonstrate the potential of AI, best practice examples or use cases are best suited, 
which show the facts, a solution, and ideally also the benefits such as time savings. In this respect, knowledge can be 
acquired through various information channels. Video instructions, ideally combined with demonstrations of use 
cases, are very frequently mentioned in this regard.

Abstract 
Farmers have a huge role in providing food security for any country. However, in some regions in the Philippines 
where farming activities are still done manually, farmers experience muscle and bone stress and strain, leading to 
work-related musculoskeletal disorders. The initial ergonomic assessment for farmers that do manual farming 
indicated that the farmers have a “high” risk of injury due to long hours of squatting and sitting with a twisted upper 
body and neck. Hence, this study involved designing and developing an ergonomic chair that would help farmers do 
their work more efficiently while reducing the risk of musculoskeletal disorders. A prototype of the ergonomic chair 
was constructed and pilot-tested with some farmers. REBA was used to assess the risk level of farmers before and 
after using the prototype. Paired t-test was used to determine significant changes in REBA score before and after 
intervention. Using the prototyped ergonomic farmer’s chair, the risk level for musculoskeletal disorders was 
significantly reduced from “high” to “medium.” Aside from this, the farmers observed an improvement in the overall 
well-being of their bodies.

1. Introduction
The dilemma between work production requirements and health and safety in different industries are getting more 
serious day by day. With this, the agriculture sector cannot be ignored because it is a huge part of society and has a 
big role in the economy. According to Nankongnab et al. (2019), agriculture is often regarded as one of the world's 
most important industries, not just in terms of food production but also in terms of employment. Agriculture plays a

Results of the paired t-test from Table 6 indicate a significant reduction in the postural risk level of farmers when 
using the ergonomic chair. The research team believes that this improvement can make a huge difference that can still 
be improved further through chair design enhancement. According to the Ergonomic Solutions for Farm Workers by 
Barron, et.al. (2001), prolonged kneeling and squatting to harvest, transplant, or weed puts farmers at one of the highest 
risk groups for occupational injuries, but harvesting from a seated position eliminates knee strain and is less tiring for 
the back, hamstrings, and torso. The designed ergonomic chair promotes a better sitting posture, so injuries can be 
prevented, while fatigue and discomfort can be lessened. Through informal interviews, the research team was able to 
get feedback from the farmers regarding the chair. Some of their feedback are- the chair is comfortable, they do not 
get tired easily when using the chair, the seatbelt is very helpful in their mobility and the adjustable backrest and seat 
height are very useful features for them. 
  
6. Conclusion  
Farmers in Regions 1 and 3 suffer from body pain, particularly in their hip, shoulder, hand/wrist, legs, knees, thighs, 
neck, elbow, arm, waist, feet, head, and back when manually planting and harvesting crops. Furthermore, their Rapid 
Entire Body Assessment (REBA) scores fall into the high-risk level of injuries when doing their manual farming 
activities without the use of any chair. This indicates the need for an intervention and a change in a short period. 
 
The farmer's ergonomic chair design was based on the body measurements and movements of the farmers, specifically 
the seat height, backrest height adjustments, and overall chair dimensions. The chair's features were also based on the 
needs and environment of the farmers. The research team made three prototypes specifically designed for farmers. 
Prototype 3 is the final chair design and is the farming instrument that could help the farmers improve their awkward 
posture and reduce body pain when planting and harvesting crops. 
 
The use of ergonomic farming instruments like the designed ergonomic farmers' chair relatively reduced the risk of 
acquiring Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WRMSDs). The intervention allowed a REBA score improvement 
from 9.7, which is at a high-risk level, down to 6.4, at a medium-risk level, indicating a lesser burden of 3.3 units. 
However, a medium risk level still needs further measurement and analysis. Thus, utilizing an ergonomic farming 
instrument can be an effective farming technique to reduce the risk of WRMSDs.  
 
A further improvement in the design could involve using the originally intended frame material of aluminum alloy to 
decrease the weight of the chair and increase the length of the seatbelt until shoulder level for more stability. 
Furthermore, correct sitting posture is just as important as correct posture while standing. Hence, farmers must 
consider ergonomics when performing farm work such as when planting or harvesting, whether they are seated or

standing. With that, the research team concludes that the ergonomic farming chair is an effective farming implement 
in reducing the risk of acquiring Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders.

Abstract 
In today's global business context, high competition forces companies to operate in highly uncertain conditions. 
Whenever these uncertainties convert into risk, and the risk becomes reality the companies may face profitability loss. 
Moreover, if the company is dealing in the healthcare sector, a loss is not limited to profitability instead, it may lead 
to the loss of lives. Resilient Healthcare Supply Chain (RHSC) could be an answer to the uncertain disruption 
challenges. Although various studies have proposed a resilient supply chain, this research paper addresses the partially 
filled gap for RHSC. This research assumes that all medicinal products supply chain does not require the same level 
of resilience. 
Moreover, it is challenging to achieve resilience free of cost. Hence, this research uses a vulnerability-capability 
framework to map the resilience requirements as a function of vulnerability and corresponding capability. 
Furthermore, it uses Total Interpretative Structural Modelling to establish a hierarchical relationship among various 
factors to better explain the relationships. In addition, this study uses MICMAC analyses which helps classify variables 
as drivers, linkages, and autonomous and dependent variables. This research concludes with interesting findings about 
the ""what "" and ""how"" of the theory and some future research directions with limitations of this research.

1. Introduction
Pharmaceutical supply chains (PSCs) are amongst most critical supply chains. They can be considered critical due to 
their inherent function of supplying critical medicines to the patients. PSCs involves all activities from raw material 
acquisition management, to production, to packaging, to distribution (Warehousing and transportation), to last mile 
delivery. Since PSCs are accountable for ensuring accessibility, availability, affordability of quality medicine to the 
consumers, it becomes critical ensuring the efficient, effective, and smooth functioning of the PSCs in the highly 
complex and competitive business environment. However, maintaining the smooth functioning of PSCs has always 
been difficult for supply chain managers due to various risks and vulnerabilities that may get exposed during disruptive 
events(Creazza et al. 2022), (Pettit et al. 2010). 
Supply chain vulnerability can be defined as a “function of certain supply chain characteristics and that the loss a firm 
incurs is a result of its supply chain vulnerability to a given supply chain disruption” (Wagner and Bode 2006a, p.304). 
Various vulnerabilities can be present with-in the supply chain. According to Pettit, Croxton and Fiksel (2013) “Forces 
of change create supply chain vulnerabilities”. Peck (2005) concludes that there is no system, however well managed, 
invulnerable. Even capabilities can bring vulnerability together with them. For example, new IT infrastructures 
provides agility in information flows. And information sharing can be an enabler to resilient supply chains. However, 
this IT infrastructure comes with cyber threats that, if ignored, can disrupt the supply chains (Sazvar et al. 2021).

Abstract 
This paper investigates the interaction between flexibility practices, sustainability practices, sustainability 
performance, and operational performance metrics of manufacturing companies.  A survey of domestic 
automotive manufacturing companies in the United States (U.S.) was carried out with 101 responding 
facilities in a face-to-face interview from 101 different manufacturing plants (19 different Automotive 
manufacturing companies).  The model-hypothesized relationships were tested through a partial least square 
structural equation model (SmartPLS).  The paper provides insight into the positive mediating 
role/influence of flexible manufacturing systems practices on the relationship between sustainability, 
supply chain, and operational performance.  Data indicate a significant correlation between flexibility and 
supply chain dimensions. The following research is one of few that investigates comprehensive flexibility, 
supply chain, and sustainability dimensions and interactions based on what is currently applied by the 
automotive industry in the U.S.    The results indicate that flexibility practices implantation is critical for 
maximizing the outcomes of sustainability implementation in the US automotive facilities.  The findings 
provide an important guide for practitioners and researchers implementing supply chain and sustainability 
dimensions in the manufacturing industry and the effect of flexibility dimensions implementation levels on 
such practices.

1. Introduction
Deloitte Inc., in its 2019 report on manufacturing, identified twelve drivers of global manufacturing competitiveness 
(Deloitte 2019). Innovation and Talent was the most crucial global manufacturing driver. According to Deloitte 
(2019), the primary driver component of innovation is flexible manufacturing systems (FMS). The increasing 
competition among organizations in addition to the fluctuating market forced many organizations to start 
implementing FMS. Sethi and Sethi (1990) explained that very few studies practical/theoretical investigated the 
concept and dimensions of flexibility and its impact on improving operational performance. Slack (2005) and El-
Khalil (2009) explain that flexibility implementation is a critical component to achieving competitiveness in today’s 
manufacturing industry.  Shah and Ward (2007) consider flexibility as a primary driver for any organization that seeks 
to improve its performance.  Geyi et al.  (2020) indicated the importance of flexibility and the need for more research 
investigating the impact of flexibility on manufacturing systems and processes.    
Driven by globalization, economic, political, and social uncertainties, and to stay competitive, manufacturers are 
forced to be creative and innovative.   According to the IMD 2020 report on manufacturing competitiveness, increasing 
awareness by several international organizations on the issue of climate change led many companies to implement 
new philosophies such as flexibility and sustainable practices. Accordingly, many manufacturing organizations started 
to consider sustainability as an essential driver for survival (Bevilacqua et al. 2007). Sustainability is the ability is to 
create long-term value while taking into consideration the social, economic, and ecological environment (Vinodh

1. Introduction
The Village of Gempolklutuk, located in Tarik district, Sidoarjo regency, is a village with a large landscape of rice 
fields where most of the people work as farmers. The crops obtained from Gempolklutuk Village are rice, sugar 
cane, and soybeans. Gempolklutuk Village so far has a website portal that provides information about village 
activities. The development of the village towards a digital village has started to be carried out by the village head 
by creating a new official page belonging to Gempolklutuk Village. The development process towards digital 
certainly requires collaboration between the community and the government to make a digital village. According to 
Simpson (2020) the digitization process must be supported by adequate infrastructure such as internet networks, 
computers, smartphones, and their accessories. The existence of infrastructure support helps a village become a 
digital village that is able to develop so as to have a positive impact on the country's development. Empowerment of 
MSMEs in Gempolklutuk Village using digital marketing which can later increase marketing and especially sales of 
MSME products which are expected to have an impact on the welfare of village communities. 
 Gempolklutuk Village has several MSMEs, namely Cultivating Catfish, Salted Eggs, Makaroni, and Samiler 
Crackers. The MSME of Gempolklutuk Village products are also marketed outside cities such as Surabaya, so that 
the products owned by Gempolklutuk Village can also compete in the community. To make it happen, the challenge 
currently faced by all marketers is to increase/create consumer loyalty. Converting consumers who used to be 
indifferent to consumers who can be loyal and build long-term relationships is very important for the success of 
Gempolklutuk MSMEs (Kaur & Bhardwaj  2021). Digital Marketing has the meaning of marketing or promoting a 
brand or product through the digital world or the Internet. Technological developments are increasingly fast causing 
MSME competition to become more stringent. In this era of globalization, companies must be able to adapt to 
existing technological developments so as not to be left behind in competition with competitors. One way is to

5.2.3. The effect of Instagram on YouTube 
The results of the study show that the influence of Instagram on YouTube is significantly positive. This 
means that the higher Instagram visits, the higher YouTube visits. This is in line with research by Rinarto, 
D. L. (2021) and Renata Cut, D. (2021). Field findings also show that Instagram visitors to Gempolklutuk 
village also watch Gempolklutuk village YouTube. 
 
5.2.4. The effect of Instagram on product sales 
The results of the study show that the direct effect of Instagram on product sales in small and medium 
enterprises in Gempolklutuk village shows a positive and significant influence, this is in line with the 
research of Latief N. (2019), Pramudita, A. S. (2019). Some findings in the field also show that the 
Instagram of Umkm in Gempolklutuk Village is often visited which in turn makes contact and sales 
transactions. 
 
5.2.5. The effect of Youtube on product sales 
The results of the study show that direct effect of YouTube on product sales in small and medium 
enterprises in Gempolklutuk village shows an not significant effect, this is not in line with the research of 
Nurwidiyanto, F. & Lutfie, H. (2020) and Galang, T. (2021) . Some findings in the field also show that 
the existence of Gempolklutuk Village YouTube is not optimal in marketing products from SMEs so that 
it is not yet effective in generating sales transactions.. 
 
5.2.6. The effect of the website on product sales through YouTube 
The results of the study show that the indirect effect of the website on product sales via YouTube in small 
and medium businesses in Gempolklutuk village shows an not significant effect, this is not in line with 
the research of Hendrawan, A. (2019) and Fanreza, R., & Shilvana, R. (2021. Some findings in the field 
also show that the village website which has a special menu for the Gempolklutuk village umkm website 
is frequently visited which in the end also watches Gempolklutuk village YouTube, but because the 
YouTube content has not advertised MSME products specifically, it has not had an impact on product 
sales. 
 
5.2.7. The influence of Instagram on product sales through YouTube 
The results of the study show that the indirect effect of Instagram on product sales via YouTube in small 
and medium businesses in Gempolklutuk village shows that the effect is not significant, this is not in line 
with the research of Hendrawan A. (2019) and Fanreza, R., & Shilvana, R. ( 2021). Some findings in the 
field also show that the village website, which has a special menu for the Gempolklutuk Village Umkm 
website, is frequently visited which in the end also watches Gempolklutuk Village YouTube, however, 
because YouTube content has not advertised MSME products specifically, it has not had an impact on 
product sales.

Abstract 
The high number of Muslim consumers and a large number of Micro-Small and Medium Enterprises in Indonesia 
should be in line with the increase in the number of halal-certified products. Thus, it is necessary to formulate the right 
strategy to increase the number of Halal certifications in Indonesia. The purpose of this study is to provide strategic 
recommendations to policymakers in increasing the number of halal certificates in Indonesia. The Strategic 
Assumption Surfacing and Testing (SAST) method were adopted in this study through focus group discussions and 
interviews with selected experts covering 1 academician, 2 Halal practitioners, and 2 business actors. This study found 
that there were 20 strategic assumptions formulated to increase the number of halal certifications in Indonesia. The 
results of the SAST method cluster the strategic assumptions into 4 quadrants. There are 10 items that assume the 
strategy is at a high level of importance and certainty in quadrant 1 and is a priority to be implemented. Then, the 
research has limitations in the form of determining the priority of the assumptions that will be applied. Further research 
is suggested to carry out weighing and ranking in the selection of the best strategic assumptions by policymakers.

to advance science and technology; establishing a system that coordinates between halal raw material providers and 
commercial players to assure the availability of halal raw materials; increasing programs and support from both the 
government and private companies through CSR funds to help finance the halal certification of business actors; The 
Halal Inspection Agency (LPH) helps direct the parties facilitating the financing so that they are not misdirected; Halal 
Inspection Agency (LPH) provides guidance and assistance to business actors related to halal products; performing 
cross subsidies to facilitate MSMEs in making payments for halal certification; Making regulations that are clear and 
easy to understand for business actors in conducting halal certification; The existence of traceability (traceability) and 
transparency in a halal product and can be accessed by all people; and creating a trading network of domestic and 
foreign halal products through halal certification, such as establishing international cooperation in the halal product 
business. 
 
Following this are strategic assumptions with levels of importance (7) and certainty (6). Then, there is level of 
importance (7) and certainty (6), which is in quadrant 1 and is the second priority assumption of the proposal following 
the levels of importance and certainty (7:7). The two strategic presumptions mentioned at level of importance (7) and 
certainty (6) are to make halal certification one of the requirements in circulating products both inside and outside of 
the country and to simplify the process of making prerequisite documents (IUMK, IUI, P-IRT permits) for that 
certification by implementing online. Determining halal certification as a requirement for items to be distributed both 
domestically and internationally will become a requirement and offer value to halal certification providers. On the 
other hand, the validity period of halal certification is 4 years, and it is not an assumption of the right strategy. A study 
argues that the validity period of halal certification for business actors is not a major concern because consumer 
confidence in business units that have received certification tends to maintain their services (Sahir et al. 2021). 
 
6. Conclusion  
The Strategic Assumption Surfacing and Testing (SAST) method in this study has succeeded in classifying strategic 
assumptions for increasing halal certification in Indonesia. There is a distribution of 20 strategic assumptions in 4 
quadrants of this method. Thus, policymakers can consider strategies for increasing halal certification in accordance 
with factors of importance and certainty. Besides, the main strategy assumptions in this study were selected as many 
as 10 assumptions. Thus, this research is limited in determining the priority of the assumptions to be applied. Further 
research is recommended to conduct weighting and ranking for the selection of the best strategic assumptions that will 
be recommended to policy makers in increasing the number of halal certifications in Indonesia.

Abstract 
Some of the factors that contribute to project failure include poor cost planning and inaccurate initial cost estimation. 
The purpose of this research was to identify factors in the construction industry that affect construction projects' ability 
to meet budgeted costs and to make recommendations for meeting budget cost criteria. In this study, the survey 
research strategy was used. According to the research findings, the main challenges that caused construction projects 
to fail to meet their budgeted costs were project scope changes, project design changes, unexpected site conditions, 
pre-tender cost underestimation, insufficient resources due to a lack of capital, and poor site management and 
supervision. To overcome these obstacles, some strategies for ensuring compliance with budgeted costs were 
identified. Cost control strategies included, among others, acting when deviations occurred during the implementation 
stage, ensuring accurate project cost estimation, regular cost checking against the planned budget, and regular cost 
reporting to stakeholders as the project progressed. The study recommended, among other things, that all changes to 
the project scope go through the approved change request process, and that if there is a change, all other project 
elements such as cost, time, and quality must be amended to reflect the change to ensure that the change is within the 
allocated project budget.

1. Introduction
Modern societies create value by building assets that are used for social and economic purposes, such as factories, 
schools, hospitals, office buildings, and highways. These assets are built through construction projects (Conradie et 
al. 2016). Through project management, the construction industry provides economic and social infrastructure such 
as residential spaces, roads, airports, electricity, and communication facilities (Ibrahim et al. 2010). A project is a 
short-term attempt to create a unique product or service or to achieve a specific result (Shinde and Mata 2016). Each 
project has a formulated purpose to address a unique problem or to develop a unique idea (Van-Rijn 2016). Using the 
project, the construction industry positively impacts national economic growth and employment creation (Berk and 
Bicen 2018). El-adaway et al. (2020) investigated the relationship between Chinese building investment and gross 
domestic product (GDP). They discovered that, while economic growth had a long-term effect on construction 
spending, construction investment had a significant short-term impact on economic growth.   
By 2030, global construction output is predicted to increase by 85 per cent to $15.5 trillion (Jawad and Ledwith 2021). 
According to Shinde and Mata (2016), the construction sector is crucial to both global and national economies, since 
it offers a wide range of employment opportunities to the population. South Africa is currently faced with a crisis, as 
it has one of the world’s highest rates of youth unemployment (Von Solms and Nel 2017). The construction industry 
employs many unskilled workers and therefore, it is the sector which increases the employment rate fastest (Berk and 
Bicen 2018). A study conducted in 2019 indicated that the construction industry in the United Kingdom (UK) 
accounted for about 10% of the total employment (Fulford 2019). In many developing countries, the construction 
industry makes an estimated contribution of between 6% and 9% to the gross domestic product (GDP) (Pooe and 
Pillay, 2019). GDP refers to the goods and services produced by the national economy, excluding the value of the 
goods and services used up in production (Killingsworth et al. 2020).

Abstract 
The South African rail network is under increasing pressure to transport commodities reliably, but poor substation 
performance makes it difficult for the system to meet its mandate. The primary goal of this study was to provide the 
engineering communities with the factors affecting the reliability of traction substations. The bathtub curve theory 
was used in the study, along with Weibull analysis, to assess the lifecycle phase of the substations. A questionnaire 
and the operational data of the 3kV DC section were used to collect a mix of qualitative and quantitative data. Using 
the Weibull distribution model, the study discovered that the substation equipment was in the wear-out phase in terms 
of the bathtub curve. Most failure causes are due to protection equipment, circuit breakers, and telecontrol. According 
to the financial data, most of the maintenance cost is attributed to corrective maintenance. The study suggested that 
the organization look into implementing predictive maintenance and training maintenance personnel in order to 
improve plant performance.

1. Introduction
The South African rail network is under increasing pressure to transport commodities reliably, but poor substation 
performance makes it difficult for the system to meet its mandate.  It is critical to manage, upgrade, and maintain these 
networks to achieve economic growth. Because of its complexity, the rail transportation system must operate under 
adverse weather conditions and meet stringent client requirements. The study focused on the reliability of traction 
substations owned by a national South African railway company. The majority of existing substation equipment has 
outlived its design life of a traction substation (40 years) and has reached obsolescence. South Africa is experiencing 
increased commodity demand, which means increased demand for freight logistics. To ensure that the country and 
company meet demand and remain competitive, reliability and asset lifecycle management practices must be effective. 
Previous studies into the reliability of railway infrastructure have investigated the factors that influence, and affect 
reliability (Mukwena 2018; Shihlomule 2019). There are existing reliability and asset lifecycle management practices 
such as corrective and routine maintenance (Sprong 2008). However, the South African railway systems still 
experience outages due to asset failures. This necessitates research to establish the effectiveness of the existing 
reliability and asset lifecycle management practices. This will present an opportunity to identify the gap in the current 
practice and opportunities for improvement (Nichols and Matusheski 2000).  
1.1 Objectives 
This study was aimed at providing the engineering community with information on the factors that influence the 
reliability of South African railway traction substations. The goal is to 1) examine where South Africa's traction 
substations are on the bathtub curve, 2) compare the reliability and asset lifecycle management practices used to world 
best practices, and 3) identify the causes of substation failures. This will be accomplished by analyzing substation 
performance data, maintenance policies in place, maintaining financial records, and seeking expert advice.

consider the formalization of a lifecycle management plan (Chilwane  2011) to provide an effective long-term planning 
tool aimed at minimizing unplanned losses and optimizing maintenance programs and capital investment. The plan 
will incorporate all phases of the product lifecycle where maintenance, replacement or redesign issues will be 
addressed. This way the organization will manage ageing, obsolescence, and system maintenance. The company is 
recommended to investigate the application of artificial intelligence in the lifecycle management of substation 
equipment (Khalyasmaa et al. 2020). Also, it is recommended that the organization consider the involvement of 
maintenance in all phases of the product lifecycle (Okoh, Schjølberg and Wilson 2016).   
 
The organization makes use of traditional corrective and predictive policies in the form of routine and corrective 
maintenance. It is therefore recommended that the organization investigate introducing predictive maintenance as a 
proactive approach considering these research findings. Furthermore, the organization should investigate the 
introduction of Time-Based Maintenance (TBM), Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and Reliability Centered 
Maintenance (RCM) to extend the equipment life and reduce the frequency of service interruptions. The 
recommendations towards the best practice of reliability and asset lifecycle management include but are not limited 
to 1) systematic management 2) staff development and 3) technology advancement (Dzulkifli et al. 2021). Security to 
curb the rate of theft and vandalism so that resources are focused on maintenance activities thus adhering to the 
maintenance schedule is recommended. The organization should investigate the use of IoT and AI in the condition 
monitoring of substation equipment (Khalyasmaa et al. 2020; Mitsuhiro et al. 2020). 
 
7. Conclusion 
The traction substations of the South African rail network are in their wear-out phase and require intervention in the 
form of a change of maintenance and replacement of aged equipment. The reliability and asset management lifecycle 
practices should be updated to include predictive maintenance to improve the reliability of assets. The causes of failure 
were identified as main equipment failure due to the age of the equipment. This research will assist the south African 
railway company and engineering community with identifying the phase of the existing fleet, factors that affect 
reliability and the effective implementation of reliability and asset lifecycle management practices.

Abstract 
The fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, and its underlying digital transformation advances 
exponentially each year. People's lives and workplaces are radically changing due to this digital revolution. By 
methodically identifying specific sustainability roles of Industry 4.0, this paper adds to the existing corpus of literature 
on the subject. The study first explains the architectural design of Industry 4.0 and reviews key design concepts and 
technological trends. The Internet of Things (IoT), Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), cloud-based manufacturing, 
and smart manufacturing are the four driving forces behind Industry 4.0, and they all contribute to manufacturing 
processes becoming totally digital and intelligent. Manufacturing processes of separated and improved cells will be 
transformed into a fully integrated, automated, and improved production flow attributed to nine Industry 4.0 pillars; 
(1) Big Data and Analytics (2) Autonomous Robots (3) Simulation/Digital Twin (4) Industrial Internet of Things
(IIoT) (5) Augmented Reality (6) Additive Manufacturing (7) Cybersecurity (8) Cloud Computing (9) Horizontal and
Vertical System Integration. As a result, conventional production connections between suppliers, producers, and
customers, as well as between people and machines, evolve and become more efficient. This study also uses
interpretive structural modeling to illustrate the relationships between the various Industry 4.0 sustainability roles in
their environment. The findings show complex precedence relationships between several Industry 4.0 sustainability
functions. The manufacturing sector and the economics of value creation are being transformed by Industry 4.0. The
advantages of Industry 4.0 technology for sustainable development have received much positive attention in recent
years. Expectations for the opportunities that Industry 4.0 technologies offer for smart manufacturing are very high,
but a significant roadblock for companies pursuing digitalization and sustainable thinking is the need for a more
accurate understanding of how Industry 4.0 technologies enable sustainable manufacturing. This current study fills
that knowledge gap by creating a road map that shows how Industry 4.0 and its underlying digital technologies may
be exploited to support and enable the triple bottom line of smart manufacturing.

1. Introduction
One of the primary industries that has a significant impact on a nation's economy and development is manufacturing.
As a result, new technologies are always being developed to alter manufacturing procedures and enhance the output
and quality of the final product. Recently, a new technology known as ""smart manufacturing"" has entered the
manufacturing sectors. This technology can precisely predict product requirements and promptly identify faults,
improving manufacturing processes and ultimately leading to the innovation of new products and services (Kusiak,
2018). Nowadays, this technology is essential for achieving better results with less human involvement, enhancing
the efficiency and sustainability of production processes, and doing so at lower costs. The Internet of Things (IoT),
which creates cooperative communication among machines and products and efficiently incorporates personalized
instructions straight from clients, is used in the smart manufacturing process. This technology, known as a cyber-
physical system (CPS), uses computer-based algorithms that combine and coordinate numerous physical and
computational aspects to monitor the manufacturing process (Lee 2015).
Due to considerable decreases in sensor costs, improvements in sensing technology, and the use of highly effective 
analytical programs that study the data for subsequent decision-making, this technology uses smart devices and sensors 
to manufacture items, which is highly advantageous. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is the name used to 
describe this use of sensors in industrial applications. Smart manufacturing, in its broadest sense, refers to the full

Moreover, because mobile cobots are powered by batteries, they could run out of power mid-task, seriously disrupting 
production for the manufacturer (Kadir et al. 2018). 
 
4. Discussion 
 
4.1 Future prospects of smart manufacturing in the global market 
Manufacturers have shown a strong need for remote work and increased supply chain agility since the COVID-19 
epidemic, which can be accomplished by deploying smart manufacturing technologies. In a recent poll conducted in 
2021 with about 300 manufacturers, 83% of them stated that implementing smart manufacturing technology and 
processes is their top goal, and more than 60% of them intended to start doing so within the following year. Employers 
in the manufacturing industry would prefer candidates with the necessary technical expertise and adaptability to new 
technologies to effectively manage smart factories (Plex and Hanover Research Group 2022). The most crucial 
abilities are adaptability, critical thinking, teamwork, communication, and knowledge of cutting-edge technologies. 
SMEs are likely to use smart manufacturing technology in the near future.  
 
The adoption of the smart manufacturing process will be much simpler if it adheres to a framework that includes 
(i) identifying the manufacturing data that the SME has access to, (ii) evaluating the SME's readiness for smart 
manufacturing among the data-hierarchy steps, (iii) creating custom smart manufacturing goals for the SME, and (iv) 
identifying the appropriate tools and practices that will help the SME reach the custom goals. Using this paradigm 
would encourage SMEs to develop a culture of data-driven decision-making. Yet, many modern factories still lack 
the key elements of smart factories, such as self-optimization, self-configuration, predictive maintenance, and 
decision-making. Big data analysis and cloud manufacturing will undoubtedly benefit from edge computing and 5G 
technology. End users can directly request services based on their own needs with the aid of IoT. Networked 
manufacturing services thus facilitate wise choices. Big data analytics will also hasten the extraction of pertinent 
information and knowledge from voluminous production data in order to enable targeted decision-making. Deep 
machine learning (DML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are examples of advanced technologies or algorithms that will 
be crucial in the same. Also, in the era of climate change, manufacturers are dedicated to reaching carbon neutrality 
because it is one of the key characteristics of smart factories to be ecologically friendly. Companies should run their 
facilities with smart management, computer simulation/modeling, and highly effective manufacturing processes to 
reduce carbon emissions. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The fourth industrial revolution carries the promise of customization according to the end user, greater product quality, 
and increased factory productivity, and smart manufacturing is a key paradigm in this movement. In this article, we 
examine how industrial manufacturing technologies have developed through time as well as the state of smart 
manufacturing today, which is a key component of Industry 4.0. We have also gone into detail about several smart 
manufacturing technologies and shown how AI technologies have an impact on the entire manufacturing process. 
Also, current issues are explored, which can give academics and practitioners ideas for future study directions. To 
eliminate the need for human labor and speed up production, manufacturers are choosing complete factory automation. 
AI-driven quality inspection solutions are also essential for enabling the highest caliber products to be sold. Moreover, 
innovative ideas like CPS, IIoT/IoT, additive manufacturing, and immersive technologies have had a big impact on 
improving manufacturing processes that use smart manufacturing systems. The majority of manufacturing sectors do 
not, however, use these technologies frequently, leaving a significant gap between the theoretical smart manufacturing 
system and the actual manufacturing system. This may be a result of the challenges and lack of understanding involved 
in integrating smart manufacturing technology, as well as the potential returns on those investments. Smart 
manufacturing can be difficult to adopt at first, but once it has been implemented, both businesses and end consumers 
can greatly benefit from it.

Abstract 
Six Sigma methodology has proven itself to be effective tool for organizational performance 
improvement. Critical to its success is the project selection and assigning suitable team 
members for project execution. Though, this task appears to be quite simple and obvious, casual 
selection and imprudent assignment of team members to the carefully chosen projects may turn 
futile. In this work, we present a two-stage approach to carefully select Six Sigma Projects 
(also called as critical to quality) and later, assign the best team members for the projects 
execution. In the first stage, we select the projects by mapping those with the organization’s 
vision and mission. Here, we use the balanced scorecard approach and the classical Eisenhower 
matrix. A balanced scorecard approach of evaluating the projects, provides management a 
valuable insight to their service requirements, and hence, provides clear image for 
quality/performance improvement. An Eisenhower matrix also called as Urgent-Important 
matrix, helps decide and prioritize projects by its urgency and importance. This help 
shortlisting the projects to be delegated to the employee/s.   
In the next stage, we consider assigning of the team members to the shortlisted projects. Here, 
the skill sets of the team members are mapped with those required for selected projects. An 
extension of Gale-Shapley algorithm is used for this purpose. Gale-Shapley algorithm, also 
called as stable-matching algorithm, helps in allocating the team-members to the selected 
projects according to their choices and to the best of the project’s requirements. Here, we 
present an extension to the classical Gale-Shapley algorithm where more than one team 
members are assigned to a project.  The entire approach is presented with an illustration.  We 
hope that this work will not only help the Six Sigma practicing managers but also to executives, 
involved in shortlisting the key projects for their organization, and also formulating the best 
possible team given the availability of team members.

Abstract 
Supply Chain Digital Transformation is urgently needed in light of the profusion of unforeseeable global events, such 
as political, economic, and climatic changes. Issues like supply shortages, inventory stockouts, supply-demand 
mismatch, and lack of coordination and transparency are troubling most modern supply chains. This study explores 
how smart technologies can be better used to accomplish digital transformation across various supply chain stages and 
stakeholders. In order to provide a comprehensive knowledge base, this paper reviews 210 of the most significant 
research articles to scientifically examine the relationships between smart technologies and their strategic role in 
supply chain digital transformation. This is attempted through literature review, bibliometric analysis, descriptive data 
analysis, and visual representation. The core contribution of this paper is to highlight the untapped potential of supply 
chain digital transformation, with a special focus on applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning 
technologies. Another novelty of this study is a detailed mind map that facilitates visualizing, comprehending, and 
simulating the broad range of results obtained from the bibliometric study. Research gaps, consequences, and future 
research directions are also highlighted as a further point of reference for academicians and practitioners.

Abstract 
The complexity of the hospital supply chain results in numerous unfavorable outcomes, including out-of-stock 
situations, excessive inventory levels, product expiration, and medical errors. SPD, which refers to supply, processing, 
and distribution, has come to light as a solution for mitigating some complexities-related burdens. Nevertheless, the 
SPD is still immature and has limited applications. Adopting supply chain management approaches successfully 
implemented in other industries with the desired outcomes to strengthen the SPD’s capabilities is therefore promising 
for the hospital. This study’s objectives are to examine the third-party logistics (3PL) model functioning as SPD and 
to enhance its performance by incorporating it with vendor-managed inventory (VMI) and inventory policies in 
managing the SPD of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) service. Therefore, this research proposes 
four logistics models, including an SPD with VMI (SPD-VMI) and three SPD-VMI models integrated with three 
different inventory policies, which include average inventory level and out-of-stock (OOS), are analyzed using 
discrete event simulation (DES). The results show that integrating the SPD with VMI improves inventory levels and 
out-of-stock incidents. When three inventory models are implemented, the results indicate a comparable out-of-stock 
reduction for all three policies. Additionally, the SPD-VMI with an order-up-to policy has the best performance in 
minimizing inventory and out-of-stock occurrences.

1. Introduction
Whereas the supply chain retains many positive attributes in the healthcare setting, it is paradoxically lagging behind 
other sectors and requires urgent consideration. The slow progress is attributed to the unique characteristics of the 
healthcare supply chain that makes supply chain concepts from other industries cannot be simply applied to this 
context (de Vries and Huijsman 2011). The dimensions of supply chain management (supplier’s relationship, 
standardization and specification, delivery, and post-sale support) also substantially impact service quality (Jamal Al-
Saa’da et al. 2013). In addition, the unique characteristics of the medical profession have aggravated the issue. 
Although hospitals are the official purchasers, physicians choose which items will be acquired based on non-cost-
related reasons. Therefore, there may be a misalignment between hospitals’ cost management targets and the 
preferences of the healthcare profession (Montgomery and Schneller 2007). Despite these peculiar natures, current 
conceptions and research support the premise that the healthcare industry can benefit from the knowledge obtained 
from other sectors(de Vries and Huijsman 2011). Therefore, to leverage the potential benefits of supply chain tools, 
healthcare practitioners’ perspectives toward the use of supply chain principles must evolve (Kwon et al. 2016). 
Existing supply chain concepts, management philosophies, and the advancement of supply chain technologies allow 
for myriad opportunities to enhance the healthcare supply chain.

6. Conclusion 
In this study, the effect of inventory policies that are applied to the SPD-VMI models is investigated to establish 
whether or not these policies will assist in improving the performance of the SPD. The average inventory level and 
the number of occurrences of “out-of-stock” (OOS) are both measured throughout the simulation for the purposes of 
this study. In light of the findings of the simulation, the following research question and conclusion are drawn. The 
combination of 3PL and VMI operations as an SPD (SPD-VMI model) results in improved performance in terms of 
lowering average inventory levels and reducing the number of instances of out-of-stock conditions. The SPD is able 
to effectively manage the PD fluid inventory thanks to real-time monitoring and stock replenishment that is based on 
the most current data. Incorporating inventory regulations into the SPD-VMI model produces interesting results for

future investigation of appropriate models. Utilizing inventory policies further reduces the burden of out-of-stock 
situations (OOS). In this context, the OOS reduction capabilities of the SPD-VMI models with three alternate 
inventory policies are equivalent. Nonetheless, concentrating on the SPD-VMI (s, Q) model, eliminating OOS comes 
at a cost as the average inventory level increases significantly. This is mostly owing to the inspection process’s high 
ordering cost, which causes the economic order quantity, Q, to be extraordinarily large. Positively, the analysis 
demonstrates that the SPD-VMI (s, S) has the best performance in both metrics since the SPD’s monitoring of real-
time information allows it to refill its supply at any moment. 
 
There are some aspects of CAPD management that are worth further studying. Firstly, this study investigates a way 
to reduce the amount of inventory that must be carried and the number of out-of-stock incidents throughout the year. 
The task transfer from the hospital to the SPD, which is part of the ordering process, is a step that needs deeper 
investigation. Because of this development, a new policy is required, which in turn will call for extra study. 
 
Secondly, information technology (IT) initiatives can aid supply chain practitioners in enhancing the hospital supply 
chain (Beaulieu and Bentahar 2021). IT systems would be a vital aspect of the proposed solution, as such a system 
would facilitate the exchange of GPO, SPD, patient, and hospital information. IT systems can be quite expensive, and 
the cost of the project often increases substantially once it has begun. It would be prudent to determine how much 
automation and complexity a solution would entail, as well as the type of IT system that could manage it. If no system 
is available, it is necessary to estimate the expenses associated with implementing one. In terms of quality control, 
monitoring the state of PD fluid will be the focus of future studies, given that a faulty product might affect inventory 
levels. Real-time updates of the PD fluid’s defect enable the system to determine the incident’s missing inventory. 
This will increase the inventory calculation’s precision. Third, in this experiment, the total demand for all PD fluid 
types is determined and used to run the simulation. Therefore, studying the studying type of PD fluid may give more 
ideas and a more effective inventory control policy for each item. Given that there are two suppliers of PD fluid, the 
same principle would apply. 
 
Lastly, to be fully integrated, the hospital’s supply chain must be entirely transparent and founded on the basis of trust. 
With a more holistic view of the hospital’s supply chain, the 3PL provider can accurately assess demand and 
proactively refill inventory. Establishing an integrated system necessary for data collecting is the first step of the 
process. The next crucial step is professional analysis to determine the demand volume for various patient conditions 
and inventory level-influencing trends. With this information, the SPD can accurately predict demand and successfully 
manage inventory. Regulations and key controls can obscure visibility, making it difficult to anticipate inventory 
levels and lowering the provider’s capacity to respond to swings in order volume. Vendor-managed inventory systems 
offer real-time demand forecasting and supply level changes if comprehensive transparency data is provided and the 
inventory management tools are integrated. This presents an opportunity for suppliers to manage inventory more 
efficiently since PD fluids are either quality-sensitive or have a short shelf life.

Abstract  
 
This paper presents the outcomes of an ongoing project carried on in a manufacturing company. This company 
manufactures aluminum parts for the suppliers in automotive industry. Due to higher quality standards expected by 
their customers, company is currently applying POKA-YOKE approach for quality improvement. However, the 
company is facing high return rates for some of the orders sent to their customers as they are facing some challenges 
in their quality control processes. Recently 2800 items from an order of 4000 parts are returned and this incident has 
led us to propose a project to improve their quality control levels. Currently Industry 4.0 approach has been widely 
accepted in the automotive industry as well as many other industries. Industry 4.0 provides an underlying theme for 
this project.

As in Figure 1, the numerical results are given. The conclusion can be made that the quality control results are not at 
the desired level which negatively affects the next steps. The project aims to improve this on the other hand, production 
efficiency will be increased by making facility arrangements.

Figure 2 Graphics of production reports for part 2215/17-10 of the factory 
5.3 Proposed Improvements  
As it is an ongoing project, there is not a definite result, but the aim is to send a defect-free product to the supplier at 
the end of the project with 0 or 1, that is, full efficiency, which is also a requirement of our approach to the project, 
Poka-Yoke. As a result of the work done, it has an important place in both gaining the time allocated for production 
and preventing the factory from making a loss. 
 
5.4 Validation  
The statistical data in Figure 1 and Figure 2 are the data from the last controls and it is not at the desired level. After 
integrating the project into quality control and with the new arrangement in the facility, we aim to take advantage of 
both sending the wrong product to the supplier and a new arrangement to be made in the factory.

Abstract 
Since its inception in 1860 till to date, the South African rail transport sector has had a mixed fortune history. The 
historical events are separated into different phases, the early development phase, the South African Railways and 
Harbours (SAR and H) phase, and the current pre-revitalization phase. The primary objective of this study is to identify 
factors that can be optimized and gaps to ensure execution of maintenance of the railway infrastructure is conducted 
effectively. This study used a mixed-method approach to collect the information needed to answer the research 
questions. To collect primary data from the organization, an electronic questionnaire was distributed to 53 
practitioners, and South African company maintenance documents were used to collect secondary data. The study 
identified material availability, skilled person availability, rail track availability and traffic delays, a lack of a properly 
scheduled maintenance and asset renewal program, a lack of maintenance history data, asset age, and weather 
conditions as factors influencing maintenance execution. Infrastructure investment, regulations, monopoly protection 
in the railway sector, and a lack of management training were identified as gaps that require special attention. 
Furthermore, the organization provided procedures and policies for maintenance execution, according to the research; 
however, these procedures and policies do not appear to be followed.

1. Introduction
Maintenance of railway infrastructure is critical to have an efficient functioning transportation system (Liden, 2015). 
Lack of maintenance can cause deterioration of the infrastructure which results in the unavailability of the rail network 
having a detrimental impact on the business revenue. A maintenance strategy is a systematic approach to equipment 
upkeep that includes identifying, researching, and carrying out repairs, replacing and inspecting equipment, and 
formulating the optimal life plan for each facility in collaboration with other departments (Bhebhe and  Zincume, 
2020). A maintenance strategy is seen as an organization's overall direction, which includes one or more maintenance 
approaches. One or more maintenance strategies are seen as part of the maintenance methodology. It includes tools 
that can be used to put maintenance initiatives into action. 
The historical events that have shaped South Africa's history have had a considerable impact on the rail industry's 
development, and this, together with other external forces, has resulted in a railway industry that currently faces 
numerous challenges (Department of Transport  2015). These challenges include ageing, deteriorating, and obsolete 
conditions of the rail infrastructure and rolling stock, perceived underutilization of parts of the existing rail network, 
and a capital investment backlog. The associated need for investment funds is a preference by logistics service 
providers and shippers for transporting many categories of natural rail freight by road. According to George et al. 
(2018), given South African Company anticipated capacity and volume increases, the freight rail network, particularly 
rail infrastructure, is expected to be heavily strained. Due to that, adequate rail infrastructure performance is critical 
for guaranteeing safe and dependable rail operations, tracking the frequency of operational incidents can provide 
insight into the condition of rail infrastructure (George et al. 2018). In order to address the poor state of the rail

organization does have an asset management procedure although in the 
checklist it was indicated that there are data integrity concerns as records 
of other months were not captured in the maintenance system.   
Lack of maintenance

The results (M=3.488, Std=1.142) suggested that people agreed that lack 
of management training does have an impact on the execution of 
maintenance in the railway sector. In the checklist, it was indicated that 
the depot engineering team needs training for infrastructure measuring 
vehicles for condition assessment and some department personnel did 
not attend the rail incident commandeer training.

6. Conclusion 
 
The primary objective of this study is to identify factors that can be optimized and will ensure execution of 
maintenance on the railway infrastructure is conducted effectively. It will also identify gaps in the optimization of the 
railway infrastructure maintenance execution in South Africa. This study used a mixed-method approach to collect 
the information needed to answer the research questions. An electronic questionnaire was distributed to the chosen 
participants in order to collect data from the organization's various sources and South African Company maintenance 
documents analysis was used as a case study. 
 
The literature revealed various factors and gaps that affect the implementation of maintenance execution in the railway 
sectors as; material availability, skilled people availability, rail track availability and traffic delays, unavailability of a proper 
scheduled maintenance and asset renewal program, lack of infrastructure investment, weather conditions, asset 
age is not always recorded in the asset system, lack of maintenance history data, lack of management training and 
regulations protecting monopolies in the railway sector. 
 
People had mixed views that flawed traffic information, common technical standards regulations between public and 
private railway sectors, lack of management knowledge and open access to infrastructure for third parties as factors 
or gaps affecting the execution of maintenance on the railway infrastructure in the South African context. The 
organization provided procedures and policies for maintenance execution, according to the research; however, these 
procedures and policies do not appear to be followed. It is recommended that the organisation develop strategies to 
ensure compliance with the set rules and procedures.

Abstract 
Due to the innovative business model and the digital platform's crucial role, the sharing economy appears to be a new 
entity in the business world. However, companies rake in by providing both parties with a common platform. This 
paper focuses on utilizing Blockchain technology (BCT) in the sharing economy. A theoretical model has been 
suggested that does away with the existing incentives system and permits transparency end to end. By fostering 
flexible networking architecture with openness and equality at its core, the sharing economy departs from the pre-
existing economic system and focuses on ownership. While sharing has evolved from a collaborative practice to a 
viable business model, it goes far beyond blurring the line between paid employment and uncompensated 
volunteering. Literature suggests that transportation and accommodation are the most promising domains of sharing 
economy. However, to ensure trust and transparency across the platform, BCT can be used. The proposed model uses 
tokenization and gamification over the underlying Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to provide a real peer-
to-peer network that challenges the current model. The nodes and validators earn tokens as a reward, while the 
gamification process allows the service to scale and get better incentives.

Abstract 
This research proposes a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework to investigate the impact of supply chain 
capabilities toward turnaround performance. In this study, supply chain capabilities are determined by internal supply 
chain capabilities, supply chain integration and supply chain collaboration. A Japanese car manufacturer in Thailand 
used as a case study. Data collection was conducted by in-dept interview with six qualified experts focusing on relevant 
supply chain activities between Tier-one suppliers and the case company. CRITIC method is deployed to compute the 
relative importance weights of supplier chain capabilities. Thereafter, CoCoSo approach is used to rank the turnaround 
performances. The findings in this study helps the scholars and practitioners in logistics field better understand the 
relationship between supply chain capabilities and turnaround performance.

1. Introduction
Due to internal and external uncertainty factors such as Coronavirus disease (Covid-19), changes in the environment
and technology, if companies do not adapt or improve their performance or service. It may impact to financial and
operation performance. There are many applicable strategies to manage with these troubles such as Turnaround, which 
is considered as one of the remarkable interesting approaches for organization, especially under a crisis. The objective
of turnaround is to alleviate firms’ deterioration and recover business performance, during recession or lower profits
(Chathot et al. 2006). Many researches show the benefit of supply chain capabilities toward firm’s performance but
there is very rare research to examine supply chain capabilities factors that enable firm to turnaround its business
during crisis. Therefore, this research attempts to develop and propose as an integrated conceptual model between
supply chain capabilities and turnaround on the operation level. 
1.1 Objectives  
There are two purposes of this study as follow: 
- To investigate weight of supply chain capabilities' criterion.
- To prioritize Automotive industry turnaround that affected from supply chain capabilities.

Secondly, this paper provides turnaround ranking results which are presented in table 5. Based on scores (𝜹𝜹𝒊𝒊), the 
ranking of turnaround is T6>T1>T4>T5>T3>T2>T7 which have scores 0.211, 0.206, 0.198, 0.196, 0.195, 0.194, 
0.187 respectively. Demand management (T6) is the most business turnaround that was affected from supply chain 
capabilities. Organization can provide right product, right time to the right customer and avoid bullwhip effect. 
Demand management can create balance between production and customer’s need in order to occurring few mistakes, 
reducing production loss and waste as well as enhance competitiveness.  
All of these things result to business turnaround outcome in term of increasing business operation and financial 
performance (Tikici et al. 2011). In addition, the study of Scherrer (2003) claimed that the causes of deteriorated 
business are misunderstanding customer’s requirement which company must do turnaround immediately. In contrast, 
productivity (T7) has the least scores. Productivity is the way that organization can maximize output while minimizing 
input, hence lowering capital expenditure. The capital of manufacturing consists of equipment, inventory, purchase 
items and labor (Finkin, 2019) which is difficult to control. Organizations are unable to continuously monitor the most 
efficient working step while spending minimal labor time. When workers are able to produce nearly enough to meet 
the demand, workers may take a break during the day or end their shifts early. Moreover, organization may lose time 
to repair or set up machine due to problem. This is resulted to work interruption. However, Ong et al. (2021) explained 
that productivity can help organization survive the competition and it is also significant factor that generate revenue 
to organization which considered as a part of operational turnaround (Tikici et al. 2011).

6. Conclusion
According to this study, the top three supply chain competency factors with the largest weights respectively are skills/ 
talent management capabilities, performance measurement (PMS)/ prioritizing supply chain improvements 
capabilities and supply chain knowledge management. Moreover, supply chain capabilities can impact to business 
turnaround because it can create operational and financial efficiency. Demand management is considered as the 
turnaround that is most influenced by supply chain competence. Therefore, knowledge of the supply chain is crucial. 
Organizations can use this study to be a guideline to improve their operations if they are in a crisis. For, future research 
should concentrate on other nationalities car manufacturer in Thailand, or in other business contexts since this study 
only examines Japanese car manufacturer in Thailand.

Abstract 
Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) projects are complex endeavors involving multiple stages, 
stakeholders, and activities, which require coordination and management of various technical and non-technical 
aspects. Literature has shown that EPC projects are also subject to various risks that could severely impact project 
performance. This paper reviews the literature in regard to the critical success factors (CSFs) of EPC projects, 
particularly in the fertilizer industry. CSFs are important for EPC projects as they determine the likelihood of the 
project being successful. CSFs provide a roadmap and guidelines for project managers and stakeholders to follow and 
ensure that the project is delivered on time, within budget, and to the expected quality. The objective of this paper is 
to identify the CSFs of the EPC projects and to identify the potential for future research that could overcome the 
project’s failure.

1. Introduction
Construction projects are forced to improve their performance, and research is needed to understand the characteristics 
of high-performing construction projects (Unterhitzenberger  2019). Traditionally construction projects involve 
stakeholders such as owners, consultants, and contractors who all have different opinions and interests, but they all 
strive to ensure the success of the project. The project success is measured a cost, schedule, and quality performance 
output. Although previous research has mapped out the factors contributing to success and failure, project managers 
still have difficulties achieving project success (Lindhard and Larsen  2016). Several variations of success and failure 
factors can occur in different projects, so it is impossible to obtain universally applicable success or failure factors (Toor 
and Ogunlana  2009). 
Construction projects are often influenced by success factors that help the project team to achieve their goals as planned 
or delay factors that can prevent or delay project completion (Salleh  2009). Construction project failures are 
increasingly being reported worldwide and achieving construction project success is becoming very difficult in today's 
turbulent environment (Susil 2015).

Abstract 
Inventory management is essential for all businesses because raw materials in stock inventories are current assets that 
require significant investment. Having too few or too many raw materials also creates problems for the company, such 
as stock-outs, deterioration, or disappearance due to an excessively long storage period. Therefore, this study examines 
the order quantity of raw materials in group A derived from the ABC classification method of the case study company. 
The 112 items represent a group of raw materials requiring strict monitoring supervision and having the highest annual 
inventory turnover value. Then, the Coefficient of Variation (CV) of demand for raw materials used to determine the 
ordering volume of raw materials was analyzed. Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) method determines the stable 
demand for raw materials. An unstable demand is determined using two heuristic methods which are Silver-Meal 
(SM) and Part-Period Balancing (PPB) methods. In addition, safety stock levels were analyzed to avoid shortages. As 
a result, in comparison to the actual total inventory cost of the company in the case study, the total cost of raw materials 
in group A decreased by 44.58 percent in 2019, 44.52 percent in 2020, and 45.55 percent in 2021.

1. Introduction
Thailand's automotive parts industry is one of the world's most important automotive parts production areas. In 2019, 
Thailand ranked first in ASEAN, fourteenth in the world, and sixteenth in automotive parts as an exporter of all types 
of automotive parts. The main export markets are America, Japan, and Indonesia (Thai Auto-Parts Manufacturers 
Association (TAPMA) 2022). However, Thailand's automotive parts industry has over 1,800 manufacturers 
(Yongpisanphob 2020), making it a highly competitive market. 
The case study company is a factory that produces brakes and aluminum parts for vehicles, as well as the production 
and assembly of 2- and 4-wheeled parts that are sold to domestic and international customers. They have 2,564 raw 
materials used to manufacture products and orders from domestic and international suppliers. According to the 
logistics performance measurement of the case study company, it was found that the time management of raw material 
inventory is poor and has a lengthy inventory holding period. In other words, the company had an inventory stock of 
approximately 17,453,026 units in 2019, 14,737,539 units in 2020, and 13,210,881 units in 2021, which is an excessive 
amount of inventory and causes a low rotation of raw materials stored in a warehouse. As a result of having too many 
materials, there is a problem with unsuitable raw material inventory management, which is one of the reasons for the 
high cost of raw material inventory management. Inventory management is one of the primary activities of logistics, 
which is a crucial objective that every organization uses to gain a competitive advantage and focus on operational 
costs by finding a way to minimize costs and increase competitiveness.

Figure 5. Comparison of annual material quantity in 2019 to 2021 
 
The inventory methods can reduce the total inventory costs of the case study company from $130,290 to $72,211 by 
44.58% in 2019, in distinction to $86,851 to $48.184 by 44.52% in 2020, and $66,704 to $36,321 by 45.55% in 2021, 
as shown in Table 3 and figure 4. Due to figure 5, we annual ordered a similar number of raw materials as materials 
demand of the case study company; however, by using these inventory management methods, we can reduce our total 
inventory costs below what the case study company actually incurred. It should be noted that once we have the amount 
for determining inventory quantity by methods, we will define it based on the condition of suppliers' terms being 
subsequent to the fact that the company placed an order, and the inventory methods are used to minimize inventory 
costs. However, not every method is suitable for every raw material, and each material has its appropriate technique. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study aims to minimize the total inventory cost of raw materials group A in the case study of an automotive parts 
manufacturer by determining the order quantity method for each item and rechecking the technique that can be used 
from 2020 to 2021 using ABC classification, Coefficient of Variation (CV) of demand, Economic Order Quantity 
(EOQ), Silver-Meal (SM) and Part-Period Balancing (PPB) methods. It can be summarized as follows:

We classified raw materials into three groups using the ABC classification method to establish the annual usage value 
due to their widespread practical application (Teunter et al. 2010) and we analyzed only group A with 112 items of 
raw material lists since it was the most important of the materials due to its highest annual usage value. Then, using 
the Coefficient of Variation (CV), the optimal ordering method and stability demand for 112 items in group A were 
determined. Employing the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) method, we discovered a stable demand for 86 raw 
materials. For 26 items that are unstable in demand, we compared the total costs for the appropriate items with two 
heuristic methods, the Silver Meal (SM) and Part-Period Balancing (PPB) methods, and examined the method that 
resulted in the lowest total inventory costs. 
Finally, based on the application methods of raw materials in group A, and calculated Safety Stock (SS) to avoid the 
risk of product shortages, we can reduce total inventory costs by 44.58% in 2019, and by 44.52% and 45.55%, 
respectively, from 2020 to 2021. This study determines the order quantity based on the method analyzed according to 
the specified supplier raw material order conditions. According to studies, not all methods are suitable for all raw 
materials, so the appropriate technique for each raw material should be assigned to minimize total inventory costs as
much as possible. According to the research of Uansamer and Kittithreerapronchai (2014) and Thavornwat and 
Kanchana (2013), each method has its strengths for determining order volume, as described previously. For further 
study, more than three methods should be analyzed in this study because each material has its own appropriate 
technique. Consequently, multiple techniques that minimize total inventory costs should be compared.

Abstract 
In this paper, an outer rotor electric bike brushless DC motor of 200 KW for Electric Vehicles is investigated with 
different magnet topologies. Magnetic angle and Halfbach arrangement are varied to evaluate their electromagnetic 
torque, forces, and temperature distribution. The power and torque density and efficiency performance have been also 
studied and compared with IPM motors with the same geometry and power drives. This study for applying an auto-
design program is to find out suitable permanent magnetic parameters and winding size after iterations. This program 
allows us to estimate the magnetic flux density, electromagnetic torque, and ripple torque via a finite element magnetic 
method (FEMM). To reduce the cogging torque ripple and harmonic order of Back EMF, the magnet angle and 
Halbach topology will be validated by the FEM simulation. The simulated results are also compared with the measured 
results from the experimental test system.

1. Introduction
An external rotor brushless (BL) DC motor for the electric vehicle has been proposed by many publications about the 
maximum efficiency, and torque performances. Such as the Raymond (2002) proposed the Response Surface 
Methodology that is process and product optimization using designed experments; the Annette (2007) developed  
performance evaluation BLDC for electric bicycles: the power, torque, and speed characteristics  have been 
investigated by a function of load, speed;  the Yang with an optimal design procedure for a rim motor would make 
electric powered wheelchairs foldable, light, fuel-efficient;  Xie (2012) developed the optimal design of transverse 
flux machine for high contribution of permanent magnet; Lee (2015) has a design and comparison of multistage axial 
flux permanent magnet machines, Chung (2015) developed the method of a 20-pole- 24-slot with consequent pole 
rotor. This paper aims to provide an optimal design of an outer motor 200kW as an electric vehicle. The objective of 
the optimal design of this Outer rotor BLDC motor is to improve the output characteristics of the motor and to have a 
stator form to facilitate automatic winding. The response surface methodology is developed for the optimal design 
and the 2-D model is used for electromagnetic field analysis. It is designed to have cost-effective fabrication. For the 
rotor part, a solid core is used to save cost according to the lamination process. For the stator part, an optimal design 
is performed to form a stator core and to facilitate automatic winding. The finite element method (FEM) is applied to 
the required electromagnetic field analysis during the design process. 
2. Specification of in-wheel motor
The design specifications of the in-wheel motor are summarized in Table 1. They are considered as meeting the 
requirements of the battery and the controller as well as the own performances of the E-bike. The rated output power 
of the in-wheel motor was experimentally settled as 150kW by considering the weight of the E-car and the capacity 
of the battery.

    The maximum efficiency of the BLDC motor can obtain 98% at the speed of 5000 rpm and torque of 255 N.m. The 
maximum power is 152kW. The output power, efficiency, current and speed vs torque are reported in the below tables

The maximum efficiency is about 98%. The input and output power, speed, and DC link current vs torque have been 
carried out by FEM simulation. The load torque is increased by 5 N.m for each step, and the power meters are recorded 
at all palters for further analysis.  
 
5. Conclusion 
The results of power, torque, and efficiency performances obtained by the FEM are successfully checked to be close 
to the measured results. The BLDC motor has been also successfully manufactured and tested by the dynamic test 
bench. This is very difficult to test the dynamic performance of the full torque, current, and power for starting mode 
because of the mechanical coupling of the E-car and torque sensors. This design can be improved after doing the 
experimental test. For this application, the torque needs to be increased by 10% to improve the starting torque.

Abstract 
Lean manufacturing is a management approach focused on operational improvements. Lean concepts are being 
utilized by industries to improve the performance of current processes. The purpose of this paper is to uncover the 
significance of lean manufacturing concept implementation in the mining industry, especially in coal barge loading 
conveyors. Bottleneck analysis, process standardization, and process balancing has been utilized to improve the coal 
barge loading conveyor facility. Results indicated the productivity of the barge loading conveyor improved 161% 
from 372 to 971 tons per hour by implementing the lean principle. Productivity improves significantly after 
implementing lean manufacturing techniques in a case company. This article demonstrates the practical application of 
the lean technique in coal barge loading conveyors showing how it can bring real breakthroughs in productivity 
improvement in the coal mining sector.

1. Introduction
Productivity is defined as a ratio between the output volume and the input volume. In other words, it measures how 
efficiently production inputs, such as labor and capital, are being used to produce a given level of output (Kulkarni et 
al. 2014)., Production is concerned with an increment of output over a given period; productivity is concerned with 
more output and less time consumed. Considering the high demand for the product in a short of given time has pushed 
the production team to think of a way to improve productivity. One way to improve productivity is by implementing 
lean manufacturing. The concept of lean manufacturing originated in the automotive industry and is widespread in the 
manufacturing industries. The lean concept has often been successfully implemented in companies to achieve 
considerable savings in production by improving the efficiency and productivity of the production process 
(Manikandaprabu & Anbuudayasankar 2019). The lean objective is to minimize waste and to add more value to the 
existing process so that the system performance gets improved significantly. Lean manufacturing tools and techniques 
mainly focus on reducing waste within the process which will reduce the process lead time, improve productivity, and 
also the product quality.  
To improve efficiency and productivity lean concept has been implemented in various manufacturing industries 
(Duran et al. 2015), (Rangrej et al. 2015), (Zaidi et al. 2021), (Edwin  et al. 2020). However, its application in the 
mining sector is still little studied. The purpose of this study is to increase the productivity of coal Barge Loading 
Conveyor (BLC) using the lean concept. Implementing the lean concept in the mining environment are very 
challenging since the lean concept originated from manufacturing where the environment in manufacturing is 
controllable. However, the mining operation is different, characterized by an uncertain, dynamic, volatile, and risky 
work environment (Wijaya et al. 2009).  
In the automotive industry, production and assembly take place in relatively small areas, with little variation between 
companies. Therefore, customization of the implementation of lean methods in one of them is usually the same as in 
other companies. However, mines are very large and wide areas. In some cases, the development takes place over

If we compare the situation before the improvement the BLC productivity is only 372 TPH on average, after 
improvement the capacity improved becomes 971 TPH. There was 161% improvement.  The improvement 
contribution came from the hauler and loader standard matching factor as described in Table 4, and process 
standardization that reduced hauling cycle time. Hauler and loader standard unit numbers are very significant to 
increase hauling productivity and increasing the hauling trip per hour, thus impacted to total BLC capacity. 
 
5. Conclusions and Future Research 
This study has shown how the lean principle is applied in a non-manufacturing environment. Defining bottleneck, 
eliminating waste, process balancing, and process standardization has improved BLC system capacity. Balancing the 
capacity of the hauler and loader has improved the total trip and total BLC system capacity, it enables the company to 
increase barging volume to meet delivery demand. Besides that, it shows us the implication of the study to the practical 
contribution that evaluating BCL capacity must consider the coal intake as a total system. Further study needs to be 
performed to evaluate the truck hauling cycle time variation and the total trip per hour. Combining lean and 
digitalization to reduce waste and improve productivity of BLC system need to be tested in real operation.

Abstract 
Due to demand for Indonesia to minimize pollution effect from transportation modes, the use of electric vehicle 
especially electric motorcycle is expected to reduce pollution to the environment in operational of online based 
transportation. For this reason, online based transportation needs information about how the electric motorcycle will 
reduce emissions and the impact on operational activity related to cost, quality and maintenance. This paper shows 
that relative to conventional motorcycles, electric motorcycles have more capital and operational cost than the 
conventional motorcycle, but electric motorcycle has better values on specification, energy consume, energy cost, 
carbon emission, purchase cost, and tax that give benefit to online-based transportation to accelerate the use of electric 
motorcycle in online-based transportation.

1. Introduction
The demand for electric motorcycle is rising in Indonesia due to increased traffic congestion (Chong et al. 2018). 
Electric motorcycles are preferred by the Indonesian over other electric vehicles modes and other traditional ways of 
transportation. Electric motorcycle is an environmentally friendly transportation mode compared to the conventional 
motorcycle. According to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM), more electric motorcycle will be 
used in Indonesia in the next few years. Electric motorcycle production in the nation is projected to reach 1.34 million 
units in 2021. The quantity has grown to a maximum of 11.8 million units, which nearly achieves the 13 million 
electric motorcycles target in 2030 (Rizaty 2022).  
Since electric motorcycle is more environmentally friendly for its operational use, online-based transportation 
company who has operate more than 2.5 million drivers in Indonesia, plan and implement little by little the conversion 
of conventional motorcycle in their operation to use the electric motorcycle. However, to implement this plan on a 
large scale, it is necessary to carry out further analysis related to the comparison of the use of electric motorbikes and 
conventional motorbikes in online based transportation activities, so that the implementation of changes in the type of 
vehicle does not only have a positive impact on the environment but still pays attention to aspects of efficiency and 
effectiveness of operations. This paper will discuss the comparison of energy consumption and carbon emission 
between conventional and electric motorcycles in online-based transportation.

aspects, electric motorcycle has more torque compared to the conventional one. This could give advantage to electric 
motorcycle, since the traffic in Indonesia is stop and go traffic, so having more torque is more beneficial than having 
more top speed. 
Based on Table 2 shows that conventional motorcycle has more durability in fuel consumption which conventional 
motorcycle can go farther using 1 liter of fuel than electric motorcycle using 1 kWH. But based on the cost, electric 
motorcycle has less cost compared to conventional motorcycle due to the fuel cost for the conventional motorcycle. 
Based on Table 3 shows the comparison of carbon emission for conventional motorcycle and electric motorcycle. 
Electric motorcycle has less 2% carbon emissions than the conventional motorcycle and have a significant 
hydrocarbons emission than the conventional motorcycle. 
The results of calculation of capital and operational expenditure of conventional and electric motorcycle on Table 4, 
shows that purchasing electric motorcycle cost more than conventional motorcycle, but operational expenditure 
electric motorcycle less than conventional motorcycle. Another option is to purchase an electric motorcycle without 
battery and rent the battery on Table 5. 
Total capital expenditure costs less a lot than to purchase electric motorcycle, but the operational expenditure is twice 
as much as to purchase electric motorcycle along with battery. Based on the comparison tax between conventional 
and electric motorcycle on Table 6, electric motorcycle has less cost on tax due to Minister of Internal Affairs 
Regulation No. 82 Year 2022, which electric motorcycle only pay 10% of total tax to boost the use of electric 
motorcycle in Indonesia. 
6. Conclusion
Electric motorcycle may cost more on total capital expenditure or total operational expenditure, with low production 
on carbon emissions. While conventional motorcycle cost more on several points, such as total capital expenditure, 
energy cost, and produce carbon emissions. It can be concluded that electric motorcycle has better values on 
specification, energy consume, energy cost, carbon emission, purchase cost, and tax. But there are still room for 
improvement for the regulation and the production of electric motorcycle in Indonesia to compress the cost of capital 
expenditure or operational expenditure to accelerate the adoption of electric motorcycle in online-based transportation.

Abstract 
Since logistics service quality has become a key strategic weapon for omnichannel success in the business-to-customer 
(B2C) retail sector. Therefore, it is essential that retailers have a deep understanding of customer satisfaction with the 
quality of logistics service and benchmark them with the best competitors. This study proposes a systematic framework 
to evaluate customer satisfaction with omnichannel logistics service quality (OCLQ) using revised importance–
performance analysis (IPA) approach. One of an e-commerce retail companies in Thailand is used as a case study. In 
this study, twenty logistics service attributes are identified throughout the customer’s shopping journey. The research 
survey is conducted using a sample size of 411 clients. Revised IPA is applied to analyze the survey data, and then 
categorized the OCLQ in to 4 groups as “Keep up the good work”, “Possible overkill”, “Low priority”, and 
“Concentrate here”. The customer satisfaction benchmarking is performed with the best competitor of the case 
company. The findings of this study can help the case company enhance the customer satisfaction with OCLQ in order 
to maintain a competitive advantage.

1. Introduction
The retail sector has continuously expanded from the past to the present in recent years. Customer satisfaction is a 
metric for measuring competition, allowing technology to become an essential component in preserving a competitive 
advantage. In particular given the serious issue that exists right now as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic threat. 
There have been constraints on interpersonal interactions, travel, consumer movement, and physical contact in public 
spaces, leading to restrictions on people's liberties (Schreiner and Baier 2021). As a result, numerous retail stores had 
to close (Akhtar et al. 2020). However, consumers' buying habits have started to change over time as technology has 
advanced. E-commerce is expanding quickly because it allows customers to purchase products limitlessly (Jena and 
Meena 2022). Companies and organizations must become more competitive by expanding their customer-reach 
channels by adding more options for goods purchase. Omnichannel Logistics (OL) is a new retail model that combines 
physical stores with online stores. Customers can research the information about items and services before making 
purchases or requesting after-sales care from many channels both online and offline without the need to restart the 
purchase process every time they change channels (Mosquera et al. 2019).  
The customer experience, which offers customers a more convenient purchasing experience, also influences brand 
satisfaction, loyalty, and sales (Yin et al. 2022). The main purpose of omnichannel service is to facilitate the consumer, 
improve and enhance the quality of all omnichannel channels. This ensures that cross-channel integration results in 
increased customer satisfaction and building loyalty (Adivara et al. 2019). To develop marketing strategies, marketing 
professionals must comprehend how consumers feel about brands (Yin et al. 2022). In the study by Li et al. (2022) 
retailers are required to regularly monitor customer satisfaction with the quality of service of omnichannel so that 
customers have a good experience from buying products, and examining customer satisfaction helps spot the 
weaknesses of the business foundation, which assists in the real development of marketing. Studying customer 
satisfaction with Omnichannel quality is not yet very widespread. As a result, this study provides an evaluation of the

iv. 
A5, A6, and A8 are the attributes belonging to the IV quadrant; they are defined as "" Concentrate here "". 
Therefore, these attributes need immediate improvement in order not to negatively affect customer 
satisfaction. 
 
Figure 4. Implicitly Derived Importance – Performance Ratio Analysis Matrix 
5. Results and Discussion 
The parameters influencing customer satisfaction with the caliber of omnichannel logistics services were identified 
from the examination of the literature review's findings of 20 factors in total, broken down into 3 customer journey 
channels, which were examined using Benchmarking, Traditional IPA, and Revised IPA. All of the results presented 
above allow us to draw the conclusion that A1 Information Quality is the most significant factor from direct customer 
questions, while customer satisfaction and OCS have implied significance. It has been determined that A2 Information 
Availability is the most crucial factor. Even if there are various factors in the findings, however, if you consider them 
in terms of channels These two elements play a part in the pre-purchase funnel and are factors that have to do with 
product information; it denotes how important the information is to the customers. The benefits provided by the search 
funnel are more important to consumers than the costs realized when searching for the funnel. This is in line with the 
study by Verhoef et al. (2007) which found that the pre-purchase funnel was highly important, especially in the field 
of information when customers use the Internet to find the best products. Singh and Jang (2020) discussed the 
importance of the pre-purchase funnel as it made customers aware of the benefits to be received and the cost of 
expenses. Therefore, the service quality of this channel is the most important channel. From Figure 3. Implicitly 
derived importance – Performance Analysis Matrix, it shows that there are 3 attributes in Quadrant IV: A5 Shopping 
enjoyment from pre-purchase channels, A7 Purchase convenience, and A8 Service quality of employees/automation 
from the purchase channel while compared to the best competitor.  
 
According to Figure 5. Implicitly derived importance – Performance ratio Analysis Matrix, it can be seen that three 
attributes, also in quadrant IV, are defined as "" Concentrate here "" A5 Shopping enjoyment, A6 Compare the prices 
from the pre-purchase channel, and A8 Service quality of employees/automation from the purchase channel. When 
comparing the results from the two matrices, it shows that the factors A5 Shopping enjoyment and A8 Service quality 
of employees/automation from the purchase channel are two factors in Quadrant IV, defined as "" Concentrate here "". 
Hence, the case study company should prioritize improving these two attributes in order to increase customer 
satisfaction and increase competitiveness. While in Quadrant I ""Keep up the good work"", there are duplicates of the 
two matrices, A1 Information Quality and A2 Information Availability from the pre-purchase channel and A12 
Purchase Effort from the purchase channel. These three factors are the factors that customers expect and pay attention 
to. The performance of these factors of the case study company meets the expectations of customers. These three 
factors are key strengths for companies to maintain their service quality levels in order to maintain competitive 
advantage. As for the purchase channel, these two factors in Quadrant IV are defined as "" Concentrate here "". 
Therefore, the case study company should prioritize improving these two attributes in order to increase customer 
satisfaction and increase competitiveness. While in Quadrant I ""Keep up the good work"" has duplicates of the two

matrices, A1 Information Quality and A2 Information Availability from the pre-purchase channel, and A12 Purchase 
Effort from the purchase channel. These three factors are the components that customers expect and pay attention to. 
The performance of these factors of the case study company meets the expectations of customers. These three factors 
are key strengths for companies to maintain their service quality levels in order to maintain competitive advantage. 
6. Conclusion  
This research offers guidelines for assessing satisfaction with the service quality of Omnichannel Logistics by using 
a three-factor theory relevance model, a benchmarking model that gauges the value of customer satisfaction and 
overall satisfaction, and a traditional IPA tool developed as a tool to facilitate the setting of priorities for improvement 
and resource allocation. It overrides the limitation of Traditional IPA out. Moreover, Performance Ratios were used 
when comparing with the best competitor to increase the chances of strategic planning to beat the strongest competitor 
in the market nowadays (Deng et al. 2011). This is to increase customer satisfaction. The findings of this study provide 
a way to improve and develop factors of the quality of services of Omnichannel Logistics throughout the customer 
journey. The prioritization of factors that need to be developed is divided into two types: development to increase the 
capability of the company itself to be superior to competitor by focusing on the factors that fall into Quadrant IV "" 
Concentrate here "" developing or improving those that fall into Quadrant IV will definitely increase customer 
satisfaction and also reduce the focus on factors that fall into Quadrant II ""Possible overkill"" as it wastes resources. 
At the same time, the standard of factors that fall into Quadrant I ""Keep up the good work"" must be maintained; this 
is because these factors are to become the strengths of the organization (Martilla and James 1977). There is, however, 
no research on how to spend resources to enhance and enhance the factors that fall into the Quadrant IV ""Concentrate 
here"". In addition, if one of the factors has been improved, the question raised is that ‘will it affect the priority or order 
of factors that need to be improved or not?’. Therefore, in future research, it may be necessary to study how resources 
are allocated and the implications of the relationship between other additional factors.

Abstract 
There are four types of motorized vehicles in Indonesia. The enormous population is motorcycles, which have become 
Jakarta's primary transportation mode for daily activities. Currently, it is divided into two types: conventional and 
electric motorcycles. Conventionally, it runs on refined fuel oil. In terms of environment and sustainability, it leads to 
air pollution and a high fuel consumption rate. Besides those aspects, because of the raised fuel price, there is also a 
problem from the owner's perspective. Due to this condition, people have begun to move to an electric motorcycles. 
This study aims to make a comparison of life cycle cost (LCC) for both motorcycle types. Apart from this, a life cycle 
impact assessment (LCIA) is also carried out. Based on the Regulation of the Minister of Environment and Forestry 
of the Republic of Indonesia Number 01/2021, the impact that must be analyzed include cumulative energy demand 
(E), global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), and ozone layer 
depletion potential (ODP). In this study, we focus more on GWP as a measure of carbon impact. Three scenarios will 
be analyzed: low, medium, and high mobility commuters in Jakarta. People can determine which type gives more 
benefits by analyzing and comparing LCC and LCIA for both types. As there is incentive policy from government for 
electric motorcycles, they have the best LCC compared to the conventional ones.

1. Introduction
Indonesia is one of the countries that cannot be separated from motorized vehicles in carrying out mobility activities. 
Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 22/2009 defines motorized vehicles as any vehicle that is driven by 
mechanical equipment in the form of an engine other than a vehicle that runs on rails. The population of this vehicle 
ownership is changing all the time. In 2021 the growth was 6%, while in 2020, it was only 2% (Figure 1). The number 
of total motorized vehicles on November 15, 2022, is 151.36 million units (Korlantas Polri 2022). Motorcycle has a 
significant proportion. The population is 82.9% as of November 14, 2022 (Korlantas Polri 2022). 
Based on a survey by Badan Pusat Statistik (2019), the motorcycle has become dominant as a primary mode of 
transportation for daily activities in Jakarta (Figure 2). Motorcycle in Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 
22/2009 is defined as a two-wheeled motorized vehicle with or without housing and with or without a side carriage or 
a three-wheeled motorized vehicle without housing. One factor that drives the large proportion other than any other 
vehicle is the lack of public transportation. Therefore, it makes private vehicles preferred to be used by most people 
(Murtiningrum et al. 2022). Conventionally, the Law of Republic Indonesia Number 3/1963 runs by fuel, other oil, or 
gas. But right now, it also runs on battery. It is a battery electric vehicle in Presidential Regulation (Perpres) Number 
55/2019.

6. Conclusion 
Internal combustion engines (ICEs) are used in most motorcycles in Indonesia, which results in excessive fuel 
consumption and air pollution. By 2025, the Indonesian government hopes to create 20% electrified motorcycles. This 
study compares the life cycle costs (LCC) and life cycle impacts (LCIA), especially of the carbon impact of 
conventional and electric motorcycles for daily use. Average distances for people with low, medium, and high mobility 
were 19.96 km, 54.55 km, and 95.43 km. Most commuters travel five days a week, with traveling to work being their 
main activity. In this study, data from two conventional motorcycle brands and one electric motorcycle brand were 
used. 
 
The lowest LCC in all condition during the first two years of ownership is the electric motorcycle X, while the 
conventional motorcycle B typically ranks highest. In a low, medium, and high mobility scenarios, electric 
motorcycles are more environmentally beneficial than conventional motorcycles. Since they use energy at the same 
rate, single and double batteries have the same GWP. According to the findings of this study, using an electric 
motorcycle X is recommended for low LCC and carbon impact concerns. An electric motorcycle's most expensive 
maintenance cost is replacing the battery, which significantly increases the LCC. The following study can provide a 
comparison between LCC and a battery rental system. 
 
There are some limitations to this study. There is no such reference for electric vehicle maintenance. The assumption 
of a maintenance interval for electric motorcycles is the same as for ICE motorcycles except for engine maintenance. 
A more thorough study can be conducted in the following study. For LCIA, the calculation focuses on the carbon 
impact. The following study may be more in line with government requirements.

Abstract 
Decarbonization is one of the policies, strategies, and efforts the Indonesian government can take to achieve the net 
zero emissions target by 2060 or sooner. The efforts include producing low-carbon emission hydrogen, which could 
play an essential role in decarbonization in the industrial and transportation sectors. Nuclear cogeneration can be an 
alternative technology and investment strategy for low-carbon emission hydrogen production. In investment planning, 
it is necessary to design a financial model that is a stakeholder decision-making tool. This study aims to identify 
important factors, actors, stakeholders, goals, and their relationships using a systematic framework based on a soft 
system methodology. This identification is essential to ensure a better understanding of the problem’s systems, leading 
to a better model and decision-making, especially with relatively new technology and topics of its kind in Indonesia.

1. Introduction
The Indonesian government has committed to accelerating the transition to sustainable clean energy to achieve its 
net zero emissions (NZE) target by 2060 or sooner. This transition to the NZE requires sustainable and 
comprehensive policies, strategies, and efforts across all sectors, including the deployment of various applications 
of clean energy technologies. In general, there are four pillars of the transition path in the road map to NZE in 
Indonesia: energy intensity improvements, decarbonizing electricity generation, switching to low-emissions fuels in 
end-uses, and carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS). (International Energy Agency (IEA) 2022). 
In harder-to-abate sectors, where industrial and transportation sectors are the largest categories of greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions (Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources of Indonesia (MEMR) 2020), the use of renewable 
energy is not the only way to achieve decarbonization. Hydrogen development will play a strategic role and become 
the next pillar of decarbonization in both sectors. Therefore, the Indonesian government requires technological 
applications that can significantly contribute to the energy transition to produce hydrogen. 
Based on IEA data (2022), hydrogen demand in Indonesia was around 1.75 million tonnes in 2021, most of which 
is produced for the needs of the chemical industry and refineries using natural gas as fuel. Hydrogen production 
through the steam methane reforming process is the most widely used process today, with high thermal efficiency 
(~85%). However, the steam methane reforming process is highly endothermic (consumes heat), which implies the 
need for continuous large and high amounts of heat energy in the range of 750-900 0C. Renewable energy resources 
can offer opportunities to produce hydrogen with low carbon emissions through water electrolysis. However, 
electrolysis usually operates on a small scale with relatively low electrical conversion efficiency (<35%) and a 
thermal efficiency of around 25-30% (Salimy 2004). Producing hydrogen on a large scale requires continuous 
electricity, which is less economical unless electricity is available at a meager price. 
With nuclear being one of the lowest-emission fuels, switching to nuclear cogeneration offers a promising 
decarbonization opportunity for the hydrogen production process. Nuclear cogeneration is a reactor used in addition

The government (as the owner of the problem and also the board of stakeholders) can conduct the following three 
policy interventions: the establishment of decarbonization policies, investment regulations, and loan guarantees. The 
shareholder(s), as one of the board of stakeholders, planned to invest in nuclear cogeneration technology. 
Furthermore, the shareholder(s) also expect a rate of return or dividends from developing new business segments 
through establishing a Special Company Purpose. The Special Company Purpose is to be a business entity that will 
become the nuclear cogeneration project plan owner. Other stakeholders, i.e., interested lenders, can also invest in 
the project plan and expect a rate of return.  
 
The objective of the system’s transformation is making decisions regarding the application of technology and 
investment plans for nuclear cogeneration for low-carbon emission hydrogen production. Inputs to the system are 
investment costs, sales, cost of goods sold, operating costs, working capital needs, and risk identification. The 
outputs generated by the system are the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH), feasibility indicators (NPV, IRR, and 
PP), financial risk impact estimation, and recommendations for mitigation. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The designing financial model for the feasibility analysis on investment planning of nuclear cogeneration for low-
carbon emissions hydrogen production needs to be conducted as a decision-making tool for stakeholders, namely the

government, investors or shareholders, and lenders. The nuclear cogeneration investment decision is an alternative 
solution to decarbonization in the industrial and transportation sectors. 
The results of this study have identified stakeholders and their relationships as actors who need financial models as a 
decision-making tool. The systemic framework analysis using the SSM has provided benefits in this study. The use 
of SSM in the study could clarify the essential aspects that must be considered in designing a financial model in 
nuclear cogeneration investment planning following the multi-actor mapping and other variables. In future research, 
it is necessary to design a financial model to obtain analysis and indicators of the feasibility of the investment plan by 
considering risk factors for future uncertainty.

Abstract 
This paper is an ultra high-energy efficiency 2200W four-pole three-phase asynchronous motor 
which comprises a stator and a rotor. Design of external diameters, internal diameters, length of 
iron cores, number of punching sheet grooves, and shape and size of the grooves of the stator and 
the rotor is systematically optimized so that stator winding loss, rotor winding loss, and iron core 
loss are substantially reduced. Compared with existing similar products, the total energy loss 
amount is reduced from 505.5W to 291.4W, and the reduction is 42.4% under the premise of the 
same output power of 2200W. The required input power is reduced from the original 2.706kW to 
2.491kW, the energy conversion efficiency is increased from 81.3% to 88.3%, and the increment 
is 7.0%. Compared with the standard of IE3-86.7% Efficiency is improved to by changing the 
stator/ rotor slot number for 2.2kW -4 poles in this paper. An analytical program will investigate 
average torque and efficiency with different geometrical parameters of rotor bars considering the 
saturation of magnetizing current. The Squirrel Cage Induction motor-SCIM with 36 stator slots/ 
44 and 40 rotor bars are verified underrated power. Their electromagnetic characteristics such as 
electromagnetic torque, losses, and efficiency are compared in between three configurations. The 
paper contributes that the proper rotor slot number selection has a strong impact on the induction 
motor and the best design is applied for a 2.2kW induction motor with fixed stator and rotor 
diameters.

Energy-saving and emission-reduction are the topics that cannot avoid in the world today, affecting the development 
of mankind's living environment and World Economics. Industrial circle as energy-saving and emission-reduction 
emphasis. Wherein, energy-saving of the motor system has a high potential, and power consumption accounts for 60% 
of national power consumption, causes that each side pays close attention to. The motor has had nearly two one-
hundred-year histories so far from coming out, three-phase asynchronous also has more than 100 years history, be 
widely used at present all trades and professions such as each work, agriculture, woods, animal husbandry, and every 
field of life, become the essential equipment in industrial production and people's lives, but also become 
simultaneously produce and life in the maximum electric equipment that consumes energy, so how to make energy-
saving motor environmental protection just become the important topic in face of people. Vietnam is one of the most 
serious developing countries of short of electricity at present in the world.  
The energy shortage in Vietnam is because of energy waste mostly and utilizes improper causes; therefore, the raising 
of motor energy efficiency level is for Vietnam's energy conservation, and environmental protection and promotes 
economic development significantly. The national government has proposed the CO2 emission of the year two 
thousand thirty. The ultra-high efficient motor regulation is focusing on middle-size and small-size asynchronous 
machines.  According to the investigation, the motor use amount of Vietnam IE1 Class still accounts for more than 
85% of the total use amount, and more than IE2 high-efficiency energy-saving motor usage ratio only accounts for

bar designs. This work has been investigated using two methods, specifically, FEM software theoretical calculation. 
A set of simulations showed a significant improvement in the energy efficiency of the new design. The theoretical 
calculation utilized MATLAB simulations. The comparison of efficiency between the existing design and the 
proposed new design was carried out using FEM simulation. The result showed that the proposed new design was an 
increased energy efficiency of 90.55% as compared to the existing design of 86.2%. The result was proven using 
MATLAB. In this paper, a thermal analysis of  a  TEFC, squirrel  cage, three-phase induction motor has been 
performed successfully  by  approach  use  thermal  network  method  based  on  analytical  and  FEM simulation 
under full load steady-state condition.. The results obtained from both methods show a good agreement with other 
results obtained from the CAD which can be considered as a comparative software. The straight forward methodology 
for this work can assist the motor designer to obtain well thermal motor results without needing to conduct tests based 
on a costly produced prototype motor.

Abstract 
Since the conventional ABC inventory classification has major drawback that it takes consider only single criterion 
as the annual spending to classify inventory items. This leads to incorrect classification of inventory. As a matter of 
fact, there are many criteria involved in the decision making of inventory classification. This study proposes a multi-
criteria inventory classification (MCIC) model to categorize the general spare part inventories based on ABC 
classification fundamental. A cement company in Thailand is used as a case study. The inventory classification criteria 
composed of unit cost, quantity usage per annual, annual spending, lead-time, number of potential suppliers and 
product life cycle. In this study Shannon’s Entropy method is employed to calculate the object weights of inventory 
classification criteria. Subsequently, TOPSIS is used to sort and classify the spare part items. In addition, a comparison 
between the conventional ABC classification and the proposed MCIC model was performed to demonstrate the 
differences between the two approaches. The findings of this study could help logistics managers responsible for 
inventory management make rational decisions on inventory classification.

1. Introduction
Regarding the Inventory Management, ABC classification is applying the technique to develop a model for clarify 
inventory items that is significant and reflect to the amount of inventory cost. It is also affected to management and 
operation way to deal with classify item in the business. The research has approved plenty of method ABC inventory 
classification. For example, using Shannon’s Entropy and TOPSIS algorithm for multiple criteria ABC inventory 
classification. 
ABC Inventory Management always used ABC analysis base on Pareto Principle 80:20 portion practices and clarify 
classification of inventory in three group. Classified from A to C. in term of group “A” high important, middle 
important item are in group “B” and the rest for low important are in group “C” 
Generally, ABC analysis is a criterion for a yearly spending of inventory item. But to consider on price prior unit, 
minimum order quantity, lead-time, holding cost, critically parts, effect to production line when machine breakdown, 
obsolete parts, shelf-life, demand forecast, period of replacement, available stock, yearly consumption, mode of 
transportation for delivery and penalty cost and all of criteria that may affect to the item classification. The inventory 
should classify on multi-criteria to manage it properly and cover with all scenario. There are three step criteria starting 
with choosing the criteria, choose of alternatives one and weight scoring with expected to the criteria. In the research 
that we assign weight scoring and use subjective judgments or artificial complex techniques. However, the artificial 
complex techniques (AI) cannot classify and create more complexity to the employee and the subjective judgments 
disposed to take a favorable view of events. To cope with weight scoring and complex techniques, we would propose 
multi-criteria classification for classify inventory item and implement inventory policy infallibly.

6. Conclusion 
This research, calculate weight normalized base upon Shannon’s Entropy and TOPSIS to proposed the items of 
inventory classification from important criteria. The one model of inventory classification came from Shannon’s 
Entropy it makes simplify and easy to use in Cement Industry Business and in deep to general spare parts with the 
simple way of inventory management.  
 
The Shannon’s method helps to standardize the complexity of key indication of each SKU so that we can prioritize it 
at the same criteria and we ranking the score of each item. The scheme of MCIC model, indication is given to classify 
inventory on multiple factors.  
 
Compare the result of classification group between Shannon’s Entropy/TOPSIS as this method for multi criteria and 
Traditional ABC Analysis, 28 items out of the 60 items are classified difference. In term of classification group, A, 
21 of 28 classified in Multi criteria and 5 of 28 classified in Traditional ABC Analysis. For group B, 5 of 28 classified 
in multi criteria and 15 of 28 classified in Traditional ABC Analysis. The rest in group C, 2 of 28 classified in multi 
criteria and 8 of 28 classified in Traditional ABC Analysis 
 
The discrepancy in classification come from the two comparisons resulted from the weight scoring method between 
Shannon’s entropy and TOPSIS. The weight result combine with scoring result will help classify ABC inventory 
classification.

Abstract 
Collaboration between buyers and suppliers with a total commitment to the company's integrated strategy will 
ensure a successful of Early Supplier Integration (ESI) programme. The role of suppliers in a manufacturing 
company in a global environment has driven the development of strategies for the implementation of the ESI 
program. This article discusses the adoption of the ESI programme for manufacturing system strategy 
determination. This desk research uses a literature review of twenty articles on ESI published between 2011 and 
2022, which are grouped according to research objectives, result, and conclusions. The results of the literature 
review indicate that the adoption of ESI for determining manufacturing strategies can be categorized into four 
categories: the challenges and benefits of ESI for manufacturers, the role of ESI in the design process, the effect 
of ESI implementation on development costs, and the success factors of ESI. It covers a discussion of effective 
supplier management, cooperative partnerships, strategic partnerships, and supplier networks, as well as a holistic 
view of the supply chain, the creation of cooperation contracts, and shared interests and objectives. Thus, it can 
be concluded that ESI has numerous advantages and roles in the design process, which can serve as a foundation 
for the formulation of a reliable manufacturing strategy. Besides, ESI also faces its own challenges, such as an 
organisational culture that causes ESI to be rejected by the design team or insufficient resources that prevent 
anyone from devoting time to supplier collaboration, among others.

Abstract 
According to one of the most commonly acknowledged marketing principles, retaining customers is more 
profitable than acquiring new customers. Therefore, in order for restaurateurs to grow their sales, it is imperative 
that they find strategies to retain and increase the number of repeat customers. This study aims to analyse the 
factors that influence customers’ revisit intention to restaurants. The success factors critical in improving the 
repeat visits of restaurants are identified through a comprehensive literature search and the opinion of domain 
experts. The domain experts comprised experienced stakeholders associated with the restaurant industry. The 
success factors were categorized into five (food quality, service quality, atmosphere, green practices, and price 
and value) perspectives. Further, the factors were prioritized using the fuzzy best worst method (FBWM) 
approach. Later, sensitivity analysis was performed to check the robustness and viability of the model. The results 
are useful for restaurant operators to take effective actions to attract more customers to revisit.

Abstract 
In this paper, the social issues of the contemporary concept of value chain that characterizes modern 
supply chain is criticized. A background on the current social issues in value chain is presented first and 
then followed by understanding some of the structural reasons behind such issues. The concept of the 
mainstream echelons versus sub-stream echelons is introduced to capture the real value creators in the 
value chain. Furthermore, a critique of the current smile-like value curve and sad-like social burden curve 
that characterizes the value distribution in the current supply chain are presented and illustrated with a 
case study. This work and the presented analysis should add to the discourse among supply chain 
community in order to bring about a novel and more just system that will realize the sustainability 
aspiration of the 21st century.

Abstract 
With a population of 211 million, Nigeria's construction industry generates about 3 million tons of C&D waste per 
year. Recovering, recycling, or reusing over 75% of C&D waste is possible. It's widely accepted that waste 
management methods, technologies, rating systems, and policies must be comprehensive and integrated. Prevention, 
minimization, reuse, recycling, energy recovery, and disposal are waste management steps. Recycling is unplanned in 
Nigeria. This study analyses construction project MWG and predetermined materials waste causes. Abuja construction 
professionals comprise the study. The targeted population was surveyed using convenience sampling and analyzed 
using frequency, mean score, and Mann–Whitney U test. The study confirms Nigeria's construction waste causes. 
""Adjustments done without following the agreed-upon blueprints,"" ""Revisions and alterations to the design,"" and 
""Spent resources on inefficient forms"" are the main causes of construction material waste on Abuja building sites. It 
also shows that these factors affect MWG at different levels on Nigerian construction projects. Poor supervision is the 
most responsible for material waste generation, while inappropriate tools are the least responsible. To optimize 
building projects in Abuja, Nigeria, construction industry players should consider all investigated variables at each 
stage of their construction processes and waste management strategies.

1. Introduction
The world population was 7.6 billion in 2017, and it is expected to reach 9.8 billion by 2050 according to 
Luangcharoenrat C et al. (2019) . Currently, 55% of the world's population lives in cities, and this figure is expected 
to rise to 68% by 2050. To meet the demands for transportation, housing and energy supply, infrastructure, and waste 
management, urbanization will be required. The construction industry is a major source of building infrastructure to 
support city growth and contributes to environmental degradation.  
Adewuyi and Odesola (2015) defined construction waste as ‘construction materials that are lost in transit on or off 
site, discarded without adding value to the project for which it was procured including overproduction or left over 
from newly constructed facility’. According to Ikau et al. (2016), inexperience in construction waste, non-
conformance of materials with requirements, poor storage, and rework are the primary sources of material waste in 
construction projects. Mishandling and improper usage of some products, such as tiles, ceramics, and plastering 
materials, can cause them to break, as discovered by Poon (2007). 
In order to determine what factors, contribute most to construction waste in Thailand, Luangcharoenrat et al. (2019) 
did a study. They reasoned that design revisions made at the last minute, sloppy scheduling, and improper material 
storage were to blame. Researchers have been collecting data regarding waste from construction projects to gain 
insight into the status of the issues and find solutions. As seen in Table 1, In each country, the proportion of 
construction debris (by weight) landfilled ranges between 13% and 60% of total waste.

For the purpose of this research, consultants and contractors were selected as representative major players in the 
building industry with the expertise to pinpoint the issues of waste generation. The contractors are responsible for 
managing resources and waste on-site and implementing waste minimization strategies and processes, while 
consultants are involved in planning and controlling costs from the beginning of a project to its conclusion. In addition, 
the variables that were included for the research were derived from the direct participation of these two groups in the 
building process.  
Therefore, the dependability of the results is demonstrated by the fact that they agreed on how to rate the many 
elements that were stated. The same phenomena is shown in this research as well as in other studies that are similar in 
nature, where rework that is not in accordance with the specifications appears to be a major component contributing 
to the formation of material waste. 
The findings of this study are beneficial to all parties involved in the building industry in terms of their costs, waste 
management, and control approaches. 
6 Conclusion 
This study's objective was to determine the elements that contribute to the development of waste from construction 
materials on building sites in Abuja, which is the capital city of Nigeria. 
Based on the findings of the research, it was determined that "" Alterations made without following the agreed-upon 
blueprints,"" "" Revisions and alterations to the design,"" and "" Spent resources on inefficient forms "" are, in order, the 
three most important factors that contribute to the generation of construction material waste on building sites in the 
Abuja, Nigeria. It was also determined that all of the elements investigated in this study were seen as relevant by 
consultants and contractors as being involved in the generation of waste on site. The findings suggest that building 
sites in Abuja, Nigeria, make effective use of the construction equipment that is available to them. 
Moreover, it was found that consultants and contractors do not have vastly divergent perceptions of the causes of 
waste generation on construction sites, and that contractors have few difficulties acquiring work permits in Nigeria's 
capital city. 
This study advises that construction industry stakeholders take into account all the researched aspects at each stage of 
their construction processes and waste management plans to effectively optimize the performance of building projects 
in Abuja, Nigeria.

Abstract 
In Project-Based Organizations (PBOs), projects, programs and portfolios are developed by professionals with 
different profiles and capabilities. These capabilities are composed of knowledge, skills,  tools, and techniques for 
management, such as influencing, motivating, listening and enabling. Properly allocating these capabilities in projects 
allows for achieving objectives, removing obstacles, better decision-making, increasing productivity and team 
focusing. In a complex project environment, for instance, megaprojects, understanding and managing these 
capabilities could be difficult. This research proposes a tool for managing individual project management capabilities 
and facilitating their availability and correct allocation. This tool is developed through ontologies which are high-
abstraction models composed of classes and relations and computer-processable. IPMA Individual Competence 
Baseline for Project Management is a reference framework for capabilities extraction, description, standardization and 
mapping.

1. Introduction
Project management (PM) is a temporary, multidisciplinary effort to achieve agreed deliverables within pre-defined 
requirements and constraints. Personnel involved in project management can range from project management 
associates to senior project managers (PMan). The endeavour is unique to the specific project and its goals (IPMA 
2016). 
To conduct a project, organizations and people must have a range of capabilities to complete projects as planned.  
Managing project capabilities can be challenging due to limited resources, competing priorities, project complexity, 
project stage, and organizational structure (Bredin 2008; Too et al. 2014). Organizations need to develop a project 
portfolio management process that aligns project management capabilities with organizational objectives, assesses the 
availability of project management resources, and prioritizes projects based on their importance and resource 
requirements (Bredin 2008; Too et al. 2014). Additionally, investing in developing and training project management

to the relationship “is measured by”, which means “the strategy competence is measured by the strategy KCIs” 
4.7 Documentation 
After the METHONTOLOGY procedure application, the outputs are stored in Protégé. The ontology obtained is 
available in the Appendix section. 
5. Conclusion
The IPMA ICB4 framework was modelled as an ontology in this paper. The analysis of the obtained model shows 
consistency in terms of the domain modelled (in this case, the guideline selected). The model is composed of 650 
classes, which may mean a challenge in terms of how to apply all these concepts in a project and for each individual. 
The availability of this ontology – and the automatic possibilities of analysis using it – represents a building block to 
digitalize the allocation process of these competencies. However, a set of activities can be developed to improve this 
model as a future study. First, a language evaluation may be developed to verify the correct ontology language usage 
(OWL) usage. For this purpose, the OOPS! Ontology scanner is proposed (Poveda-Villalón et al. 2014). A second 
activity relates to creating the individuals and their properties in the ontology for assigning competencies. This 
development may be addressed through a case study and based on a real project environment. Finally, the developed 
ontology is publicly available for use and improvement and it is hoped that this work will promote the adoption of 
digital tools to facilitate project management.

Abstract 
The project management (PM) practices that characterize Project-Based Organizations (PBOs) are part of their core 
business processes. Moreover, some PBOs obtain their incomings by developing and delivering projects, such as 
construction companies. PBO's design and analysis have been developed from an organizational design perspective 
applying several frameworks such as Galbraiths' Star Model or McKinseys' 7S. For the same purpose, the systems 
thinking approach is also a suitable alternative for managing organizational complexity and computer-assisted 
business design and analysis. Within this perspective, the Enterprise Architecture (EA) managing tool has been widely 
applied in the information systems industry and, over time, has extended to other industries. EA is a group of 
principles, methods and models for designing and analyzing the enterprises' organizational structure, business 
processes, information systems and infrastructure. The use of EA as a management tool has the advantage of 
graphically showing the interrelationships between different components of an organization. Systems thinking has 
positioned itself as a suitable perspective for organizing PM knowledge, as shown in the last version of PMBOK 
(seventh). Following this trend, this research develops an EA model of a PBO and shows how the EA components can 
represent the specific PM artefacts displayed in a PBO. The obtained model and its completeness is evaluated using 
the Star Model framework. This work is expected to encourage analysts and project managers to opt for EA as a 
management and governance tool for their projects and the organizations that host them.

1. Introduction
Project-based organizations (PBOs) partially or completely sustain their value through projects (Atencio et al. 2022 
a). Some PBOs base their structure, processes, and strategies on the delivery of projects (Miterev et al. 2017 a;  b). 
This type of organization has captured the attention of scholars due to the growing demand for flexibility and 
innovation in the business world (Gemünden et al. 2018; Turner 2018). The importance of project development in 
every organization cannot be overstated. Projects are the means by which organizations deliver value to their 
stakeholders and achieve their objectives (Fernandes et al. 2019). They are a key driver of change organizations 
adapting to the rapidly changing business environment (Edition 2021).

Table 8. EA artefacts suitable for PM artefact modelling (The Open Group 2021) 
A formal or informal specification of agreement that specifies the rights and obligations 
associated with a product. 
A collection of services, accompanied by a contract/set of agreements, is offered to 
(internal or external) customers. For instance, a banking account can be modelled using 
this artefact. 
The passive element that has relevance from a business perspective. Represent the 
important ""informational"" or ""conceptual"" elements the business thinks about a 
domain. Example: an invoice. 
The organization's decision to implement the first EA confronted it with several definitions. There was some 
awareness of business processes; some had even been mapped out. However, a group of activities were being 
developed without recognizing them within a formal process. The adoption of APQC's PCF from BUILD-CON as a 
reference allowed the general manager to get an idea of where certain activities developed by him and other 
collaborators should be located. This also revealed the importance of establishing responsibilities, the expected 
collaboration and the artefacts produced in each process. This is why certain processes were declared in the general 
process map, and a roadmap was established to formalize them in the medium term. 
The analysis was done manually, using the models and comparing the content directly with the PMBOK 7 text and 
the Star Model. This was not a very complex task considering that the modelled organization was not very complex. 
However, analyzing more complex models and comparing them with other references could become laborious and 
perhaps difficult to perform. For this reason, automatic tools for model analysis may be useful. Future studies could 
use ontologies as an alternative, where both the EA of the business, as well as the knowledge domains of Project 
management (PMBOK 7, for example) and organizational design models (Star Model) could be generalized in an 
ontology to then perform an ontology merging to replicate the same analysis developed in this work. 
Regarding the Star Model, it can be verified in this work that all its components (strategy, structure, processes, 
behaviour and people) are present in EA, so preliminarily, it can be mentioned that EA can support the design of a 
PBO in its models. However, this work is limited to verify the relationship with the component at a general level but 
does not go deeper at a higher granularity. Similarly, this limitation is replicated for comparing the EA model with 
PMBOK7. Therefore, the suggested future study on ontology could be extended to a complex business model and to 
the general domain of EA, Project management and PBO design frameworks, such as the Star Model, and verify their 
interrelationships.

Abstract 
This paper has compared double V-shape and Delta-shape rotor topologies by different optimal 
magnet angles. The power and torque are improved by changing the thickness of the outer bridge, 
and magnetic width. Various metamodels were generated for each of the multi-objective functions 
and constraints, and the metamodels with the best prediction performance were selected. By applying 
a multi-objective genetic algorithm, several optimal solutions were compared to those of the initial 
model. The proposed multi-objective optimization method can guide the design of IPMs for electric 
vehicles with high reliability and maximum torque. This program allows estimating electromagnetic 
torque, and ripple torque by analytical MATLAB program coupling to finite element magnetic 
method (FEMM) and GA optimization. Finally, rotor lamination was stamped and assembled in the 
motor for the back EMF test and no-load test. In order to evaluate the electromagnetic characteristic, 
a 2D FEM program has been implemented to compare with a commercial IPM motor from Roewe 
Marvel X AWD.

1. Introduction
This paper will describe the design optimization of a three-phase IPM synchronous motor with double 
V-shape and Delta-shape rotor topologies. The aim of this paper is to investigate electromagnetic
torque and power with the same active volume and weight of the commercial product of Roewe
Marvel X AWD 85kW. The design optimization of the IPM motor is based on changing magnet
geometry parameters in the rotor. Multi-objective optimization of maximum average torque and
outpower is employed to design a 150 kW- IPM motor 48Slot/8poles with hairpin winding. Several
parameters of stator diameter, slot depth, air gap, and magnet angle are variables. Mid-drive motors
are known for higher performance and torque when compared to a similarly powered traditional hub
motor. This design proposal will be applied to the middle drive motor for electrical cars. Technical
parameters of this IPM have been summarized in table 1 and stator/rotor lamination in figure 1.

The transient temperatures graph shows how the temperatures of the different components in one 
hour. The plots are color coded to match the colors of the components shown in the plot, e.g. the 
yellow lines indicate the maximum winding temperatures 
5. Conclusion 
An effective analytical model is developed and verified with a prototype. To optimize the design 
process of the motor in a very short period and without any need of FEM an intelligent optimization 
algorithm is fully implemented and described. The result of optimization shows the efficiency of the 
entire approach. The analytical model and the optimization program are both implemented using 
MATLAB which makes it easier to use. To validate if the suggested motor truly meets the 
requirements and boundaries, results are verified using FEM which is also controlled via MATLAB 
and will be initiated automatically after optimization. The entire package is a very powerful tool for 
the optimized design of a permanent magnet synchronous motor. This paper has investigated and 
compared the performances of IPM with VV and delta in wide range speed for EV applications. A 
significant contribution of this study is an analytical calculation of VV magnet angle for improving 
electromagnetic torque. The simulation results can achieve the peak torque and 150 kW and 300 N.m 
at base speed of 5500 rpm for the VV model design.

Abstract 
The industrial sector globally is at the cusp of fourth industrial revolution. ""Industry 4.0"" first introduced in 2013, 
focuses on the concept of smart factory and cyber physical systems thus integrating advanced technologies such as 
automation, cloud computing, internet of things, 3-D printing, blockchain and big data analytics. As its extension in 
one of the prominent service sectors, the soul of “Healthcare 4.0” lies in the integration and convergence of real and 
virtual worlds, wherein manual appointments, in-person examinations and treatment systems can be integrated with 
software, algorithms and people. Emerging technology applications such as wearables coupled with the artificial 
intelligence and predictive diagnostics capabilities have already started getting traction, globally. However, the policy 
interventions by governments to adapt the structure of medical policies in view of evolving technologies and data 
security concerns are still lacking. The need of the policy alignment becomes imperative especially in case of India, 
which is emerging as a medical tourism hub. This paper presents a concept note while capturing the emerging trends 
in Healthcare 4.0 from an Indian perspective. Also, the mapping of possible health applications till date has been done 
to analyze the evolution of the area across multiple disciplines. Current research issues and challenges for the 
implementation are further highlighted. The research trend in this domain is expected to increase at least for the next 
decade.

Abstract 
 
At the end of life (EOL) of an asset or equipment, the failure rate and operating and maintenance costs will increase, 
so that the equipment needs to be replaced. For control and monitoring equipment, obsolescence is one of the causes 
of equipment entering the EOL phase. To reduce the growth of WEEE produced by control and monitoring equipment 
replacement activity, and limitation in capital investment cost, replacement decision making is needed with several 
sustainability factor consideration. This paper aims to study the addition of sustainability criteria in control and 
monitoring equipment decision making and implement it in a steel manufacturer industry in Indonesia. Result shown 
that sustainability can be a consideration in control and monitoring equipment replacement decision making process, 
but not as high as reliability and equipment lifecycle criteria.

1. Introduction 
Asset management for capital-intensive industries can be used to assess how effectively a company manages its 
physical assets to achieve its strategic goals (El-Akruti and Dwight 2013). Asset management activity is important to 
reach production and quality target (El-Akruti et al. 2013). At the end of life (EOL) of an asset or equipment, the 
failure rate and operating and maintenance costs will increase, so that the equipment needs to be replaced (Hannaman 
and Wilkinson 2005; Hartman and Tan 2014; Smith 2011). According to survey, 40% of unplanned downtime is 
caused by aging equipment, and to address that, 43% of the respondent are going to upgrade and replace the equipment 
(Plant Engineering 2019). 
 
For control and monitoring equipment, obsolescence is one of the causes of equipment entering the EOL phase. 
Obsolescence in control and monitoring equipment is closely related to technological changes that cause 
incompatibility problems with other equipment and the end of manufacturer support, resulting in spare part availability 
problems (Center for Chemical Process 2018). Based on ARC Advisory Survey, obsolete control and equipment that 
still used past obsolescence date in the world worth more than 65 billion USD, and more than 75% of 20 years or more 
plants still use obsolete control and monitoring equipment (Reynolds 2011). The main obstacle in replacing control 
and monitoring equipment is the relatively high investment cost (Kande et al. 2017; Kumar and Gupta 2014; Lamb 
2013; Rojas and Barbieri 2019). In a capital-intensive industry with limited investment costs, the organization must 
make a decision to choose which equipment to replace first. 
 
From sustainability point of view, replacement of control and monitoring equipment activity can produce waste 
electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). In 2019, the amount of WEEE in the world has reached 53.6 Mt or 7.3 
kg per capita (Forti et al. 2020). In Indonesia, the amount of WEEE has reached 1.9 Mt in 2020 (Figure 1.), with 
13.5% belong to the Large Equipment category (based on Directive 2012/19/EU Annex III), which includes control 
and monitoring equipment, as shown by Figure 2. (Mairizal et al. 2021). To reduce the WEEE growth, a circular 
economy concept is needed in control and monitoring equipment replacement activity (Pan et al. 2022). If replacement 
activities of control and monitoring equipment is not well managed, this can increase the growth of WEEE.

of existing equipment. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This paper aims to study the addition of sustainability criteria in control and monitoring equipment replacement 
decision making in a steel manufacturer in Indonesia. Several criteria and sub-criteria to be considered in control and 
monitoring equipment replacement decision making were selected from literature review, including sustainability 
factor. Three experts in a steel manufacturing industry were asked to rank those criteria using AHP tools. We found 
that sustainability factor can be implemented as one of the criteria in determining which equipment to replace.

2649","Based on the result, each expert has different perceived value on each criterion. In final weight, sustainability criteria 
rank third among other criteria, below reliability and equipment lifecycle, but above cost. Sustainability sub-criteria, 
reuse and repair capability, rank at fifth and sixth, under criticality, obsolescence, downtime and failure, and age of 
existing equipment sub-criteria. This means that sustainability, in terms of reuse and repair capability, can be deciding 
factor in control and equipment replacement decision making process. 
 
In the future, this study can be expanded by asking multiple experts from different background and different industry 
other than steel manufacturer that facing the same problem. This study also needs to be implemented to select which 
equipment to be replaced first among other equipment, and calculate the benefit of considering sustainability factor in 
equipment replacement decision making.

Abstract 
The objectives of this research were to determine the optimal values of the dipping temperature, the length of dipping 
time, and the dipping tilt angle in the hot-dip galvanizing process, which influence the thickness of the galvanized 
angle bar steel product, in accordance with the thickness standard of ISO 1461. This research used the Taguchi 
technique with an experimental design. The testing and validation stages were carried out based on the average 
temperature value, S/N ratio, and ANOVA test. The response factor is the galvanic thickness. Control factors consist 
of dipping temperature, length of dipping time, and dipping tilt angle of the steel during the galvanizing process. The 
results showed that the main factors that influence the galvanized thickness are the length of dipping time factor (B), 
which contributes to the difference in the S/N ratio of 85.94118%, and the dipping tilt angle factor (C), which 
contributes to changes in the S/N ratio of 13.60962%. The optimal value of the dipping temperature is 448°C, the 
length of the dipping time is 8 minutes, and the dipping tilt angle is 45°.

1. Introduction
In Indonesia, steel is one of the most important materials for both construction and non-construction activities. Steel 
generally contains more than 98% iron and usually less than 2% carbon. Steel also contains other alloying elements, 
such as silicon, magnesium, sulfur, phosphorus, copper, chromium, and nickel, in various amounts. Steel consists of 
several types, one of which is profile steel. Profile steel is a specially formed steel. The most frequently used profile 
shapes include steel in the form of pipes, blocks, C or T channel, and angle bar. Angle bar steel has a cross section like 
the letter L. Angle bar steel is often chosen because it has various advantages, including being stronger and easier to 
form, durable, and rust resistant because it has a corrosion-preventing coating. Angle bar steel can be used as a material 
for iron racks, hanging racks, door frames, windows, and garlands, as well as for the construction of stairs, water tank 
tower structures, and others.  
The strength of steel to prevent corrosion is urgently needed considering Indonesia's natural conditions, which consist 
of a large area of water and environmental factors that cause faster corrosion, including salinity, pH, temperature, and 
oxygen solubility in the media. According to the Indonesian Galvanis Association (2021), the average corrosion rate 
in Indonesia varies from 1-2 microns (in rural areas) to 8-15 microns (on the seafront) per year. The cost of repairing 
corrosion damage is a major concern, with estimates suggesting metal corrosion costs around 3% of the country's 
GDP. However, the cost of corrosion is greater than just financial, it can also lead to wastage of natural 
resources,

Abstract 
Mechanization of the agricultural sector in the Philippines is one of the policies created by the state 
to improve the systemic problems it experiences. In the largest crop-growing provinces, low 
utilization of four-wheeled tractors was observed due to their high cost and required expertise that 
the average Filipino farm worker struggles with. In 2020, a local company was licensed to 
manufacture the US-designed Ronnie Baugh Tractor (RBT) which aims to empower smaller-scale 
production with its low-cost and customizable features. However, its recency observed a lack of 
baseline benchmarking and analysis of the design, especially if its integration is fit for Filipino 
farm workers. Evaluating its usability using the Single Usability Metric, the design scored 64.69%, 
indicating marginal acceptability and an “OK” overall experience. However, the metric failed to 
show the abysmal dissatisfaction of the subjects and the unreliability of the error metric. 
Nevertheless, the design was deemed accessible to any level of operator experience and can be 
familiarized faster by more seasoned users. Further investigation into the fitting and ergonomics 
of the controls, dimensions, etc., may explain and solve user dissatisfaction.

Abstract 
As innovative digital technologies have become a key competitive weapon in the logistics service industry. Such 
circumstance has enforced logistics service providers (LSPs) to transform themselves into digital to maintain their 
competitive advantage. It is therefore essential for LSPs to understand the critical success factors (CSFs) in digital 
transformation (DT). This study attempts to investigate the causal relationships among CSFs. The logistics service 
industry in Thailand is used as a case study. Through extensive literature review, nineteen CSFs are identified. The 
questionnaire is developed to gather data from five qualified industrial experts. Grey DEMATEL approach is deployed 
to analyze the causal relationship among CSFs and categorize them into cause or effect groups. The finding from this 
study can help the scholars and practitioners in the field of logistics service to better understand the CSFs of DT and 
their interrelationships.

1. Introduction
Adopting Digital Transformation (DT) is currently a big movement in many industries. (Magnusson  et al. 2022) as 
digitalization pushes retailers and related parties to come up with new business model to satisfy the needs of their 
consumers (Hermann et al. 2020). Especially since COVID-19 that accelerate the disruption which forced the world 
to go online as government had suspended the physical marketplaces. DT is adopted in business to creating new 
business model, operation improvement or enhancing customer experiences (Vial  2019) and recently to handle the 
pandemic. DT is widely spread to all business industry. It creates chain reaction to all stakeholders to adopt DT to 
maintain the smoothness of operation management. One of the stakeholders that highly involved in most of business 
is Logistics service providers (LSPs) that plays important roles to manage the flow of tangible goods for businesses. 
Firms usually hire LSPs to manage the flow of goods so they can focus on their competencies. However, the 
complexity of DT implementation and the high cost of management has slowdown the success rate of DT in LSPs 
(Deloitte Southeast Asia Ltd  2021)). From the survey, they discover that only few firms have success their goals with 
DT, moreover the rate of DT implementation from LSPs is lower compared to other industry. Additionally, the 
competition among organization tends to get more tense every day. These forces organizations to keep developing 
themselves to stay competitive and to meet the needs of their customers, otherwise they will lose advantage then fall 
out of the market. However, adopting DT put pressure on business and operation to keep up with these rapid changes
(Rachinger  et al.  2019). Therefor the author is interested in study of success factors in digital transformation in order 
to understand more and be able to help LSPs focus on strengthen their firm.  
1.1 Objectives 
The research objectives are listed below. 
1. To identify the CSFs in DT for LSPs
2. To establish the causal relationship between CSFs and prioritize the important barriers in adopting DT

5. Conclusion 
The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that influence of success in DT for LSPs and establish the 
relationship among factors. The result from r+c, from table 8 shows the factors are determined from the highest value 
are identified as the most important factors due to the fact that results from r+c show the intensity of influences. In 
this study there are Clear Implementation Plan, Digital Strategy, and Goal Clarity, therefore the priority is given to 
this group. Especially, Goal Clarity as it gets the highest value from r+c. The second factors that has high influence 
value is Digital strategy, in this study it was explain as the way that organization will use digital transformation with 
their operation or their new products/services for more value creation. From the most important factors that are 
identified, it implies to the management need to know exactly for what they expect from this transition and then they 
are obligated to set the most suitable plan for implementations. This means that the management need to focus on the 
top causal factors in order to create a promising plan for adopting digital transformation. Meanwhile, the effect factors 
should be monitor during the process as well.

Abstract 
The Covid-19 pandemic compelled countries to conduct mandatory quarantine for incoming travelers. Due to 
shortages in government facilities, hotels have become alternative quarantine sites. The quarantine procedures adopted 
by hotels have overlooked the guests’ comfort and well-being. The objective of this study is to discover critical 
quarantine service attributes and understand quarantined guest sentiments. Fine-grained sentiment analysis was 
conducted by tokenizing and analyzing each word in each review sentence to categorize the hotel service attributes 
and detect the valence of guests’ sentiments. A database was formed using extracted data from English and Chinese 
textual reviews from TripAdvisor and Trip.Com on 23 designated quarantine sites in the Hong Kong region. A total 
of 14,023 English review sentences and 17,226 Chinese review sentences were extracted from the period of December 
2019 to November 2022. Natural Languages Processes (NLP) such as VADER Sentiment Analysis, Latent Dirichlet 
Allocation (LDA), and Skip-Grams were utilized to categorize the quarantine service attributes and gather key 
sentiments and insights. A comparative analysis of Quarantine Hotels and General Hotels was conducted using the 
Jaccard similarity index and results showed an overall similarity of only 15.79%. Managerial implications were 
suggested to improve quarantine services in the hotel industry. It is found that Chinese reviews emphasized staff, 
service, and facilities.  While English reviews emphasized the overall quarantine stay, food, and check-in procedures. 
Negative review sentiments confirmed the disregard for guests’ mental health while positive sentiments emphasized 
the importance of guest-staff interaction. The direct online interaction with staff through an app and conducting online 
group activities reflected high positive sentiment valence. Applying insights from this study to existing hotel service 
procedures may deem useful should another crisis hit the hospitality industry.

Abstract 
Queueing is a common phenomenon in manufacturing and service environments. Practitioners often use queueing 
network models to analyse these systems for decision-making processes. However, finite queueing systems with 
blocking are used to a lesser extent due to the complexity of solving the systems. Generally, closed queueing 
networks (CQN) with finite capacities do not lend themselves to product-form solutions and must be solved using 
approximation algorithms. This study considers the problem of determining the optimal buffers allocation for an 
inter-facility material transportation system in a manufacturing facility considering the blocking after service 
(BAS) phenomenon. Under BAS, a job can only reach the next node until there is space available in the queue of 
the next node. If the queue capacity of the destination node is full, the job in the preceding node, even after being 
serviced, will block that server. In a typical material flow, trucks transfer materials between the facility and 
undergo several sub-processes such as gate entry, weighing, loading, and unloading. This material flow process 
is modelled using a CQN, and each sub-process is designed as a node with a finite queueing capacity. An analytical 
model is developed within this context to determine the optimal buffer sizes to maximise the system's throughput. 
More specifically, a simulation model is developed using the Anylogic software, and the optimisation problem is 
incorporated into the model to determine the optimal buffer allocations. The Anylogic simulation-optimisation 
experiment engine uses various metaheuristics through the OptQuest tool to determine the non-dominated 
solutions of the corresponding CQN.

6. Conclusion 
This study considers the problem of determining the optimal buffers allocation for an inter-facility material 
transportation system in a manufacturing facility considering the blocking after-service (BAS) phenomenon. The 
buffer allocation problem constitutes a pivotal aspect in the design of material transfer operations, as it directly 
influences the system's overall efficiency and performance. The buffer allocation problem for a finite CQN is a 
complex and challenging task that requires careful consideration of various factors, such as the service rate, arrival 
rate, and network structure. The results of this analysis demonstrate the importance of considering buffer 
allocation in the design and optimisation of queueing networks. By answering the identified research questions, 
this study contributes to the existing literature on queueing systems by providing insights into how practitioners 
and researchers can allocate buffers more efficiently in CQN frameworks. The findings of this study have 
significant implications for various industries, including manufacturing and service sectors, where efficient 
management of queueing systems is critical for overall system performance. The results of this study show that 
organisations can make informed decisions about allocating resources, such as buffer sizes, that will lead to 
improved performance and reduced costs. Furthermore, utilising a robust tool such as finite CQN models for 
modelling inter-facility material transfer operations proves substantial value to decision-making at various 
managerial levels. The study has also showcased the advantages and effectiveness of integrating simulation 
optimisation techniques in addressing complex buffer allocation problems.

Abstract 
Nowadays, with the urbanization and  globalization of trade, companies are facing fundamental challenges,This is 
why companies seek to stabilize and increase their market share while minimizing costs and maximizing profits. 
distribution problem as a structure constructed by the participants, represents the most important part of  logistic 
expenses. Vehicle routing problem has been a growing interest as a distribution problem, it  concerns to create the 
routes of a set of vehicles in order to deliver a list of customers, In the goal to minimize the cost of delivering goods. 
Open vehicle routing problem (OVRP) is an extension of vehicle routing problem where Each route could be a 
Hamiltonian path over the route's subset of customers. In this paper we provide an extension of the open vehicle 
routing problem, called Open vehicle routing problem with fuzzy time windows, we adopt a  mathematical model for 
this type of problem, and by using alpha cut method through a decomposition of this original problem in their original 
fuzzy form into a set of crisp models (OVRPFTW)  we propose a solution of this problem. Computational results 
indicate that this model can fulfill a significant cost-saving while securing a high level of service.

Introduction  
With the increase of globalization and urbanization.  Supply chains have evolved very rapidly over the last few years. 
These new configurations have created new problems for companies, which have had to adapt. They must now turn 
to commercially available techniques and tools to better control and manage their supply chains. A lot of emphasis 
has been put on planning the different activities of the supply chains. Furthermore, logistics has invaded all areas: the 
transport of goods and people, industry, and storage (raw materials, stocks, and finished products), ...  Indeed, transport 
has an influence on the performance of the logistics system through the procurement process,  distribution production 
(product delivery and return (collection)).In the aim to keep up challenges of modern society, the organization of 
logistics processes requires processes the application of innovative technologies, and optimization effects of physical 
processes. The focus is on continuous process optimization for the aim of providing the end-user with faster, better 
quality, and more improved performance of the cost services.

Abstract 
A Permanent magnet BLDC motor has been designed with different rotor configurations based on the arrangement of 
the permanent magnets such as step skewing Halbach continuous ring/sinusoidal array. Rotor magnet arrangement 
configuration strongly influences the torque and efficiency performance of permanent magnet electric motors. This 
paper is to compare and evaluate different rotor configurations for PM BLDC motors with parallel/radial and Halbach 
continuous ring/sinusoidal array permanent magnets. Many applications for electric drives or electric aircraft prefer 
surface-mounted permanent magnet design due to its ease of construction and maintenance. A finite element method 
has been used for the analysis and comparison of different geometry parameters and rotor magnet configurations to 
improve efficiency and torque performance. This paper describes a comprehensive design of a three-phase PMBLDC 
motor with 15 kW for an in-wheel electrical drive. An FEA simulation of the PMBLDC motor has been implemented 
to evaluate their designs. In this paper, the step-skewing and Halbach magnet array are applied to the PM surface-
mounted Brushless DC Motor for eliminating torque ripples. To observe the skewing rotor effect, the rotor slayers are 
skewed with different angles and a Halbach sinusoidal/continuous ring array. With a determined skewing angle, the 
cogging torque is eliminated theoretically, and back EMF harmonics are also analyzed. After several design validation, 
a suitable design will be selected for pilot manufacture.

1. Introduction
Permanent magnet (PM) brushless DC motors-PMBLDC have been widely used because of their attractive features 
like compactness, low weight, high efficiency, and easy assembly (P. Ji 2003, Yeji 2020). Many applications for 
electric drives or electric aircraft prefer surface-mounted permanent magnet design due to its ease of construction and 
maintenance (Islam 2009, Ravi 2016, Bommadevara 2018, Anusha 2021). Two innovative designs of Outer rotor 
PMBLCD Motor have been introduced in papers (Park 2020, Yang 2021, Zhang 2021, Park 2020). However, more 
specific and detailed torque performance is still being developed more useful results in torque improvement in this 
study. The reliability of the BLDC motor is high since it easy to mount a permanent magnet and robust structure. 
Different rotor configurations are available for PMBLDC motors with surface-mounted PM design with interior or 
exterior rotors, and interior PM design with buried magnets due to specific strengths and weaknesses (Bommadevara 
2018, Anusha 2021). Among these the radial-flux motor, the surface-mounted type with different magnet 
arrangements has been used for electrical drives. This paper introduces high efficiency and low torque ripple through 
the novel design of the rotor of BLDC 15kW-Z36P12. The electromagnetic performance of the PMBLDC with 36 
stator slots and 12 rotor poles is compared and discussed in this paper.

6. Conclusion
The paper has presented a comprehensive design of a PMBLDC motor for electric vehicles. The design was calculated 
by the analytical method.  Four topology designs have been evaluated for electromagnetic characteristics by FEM. 
Particularly, radial and Halbachmanent magnet array rotors with skewed slides were carried out to compare efficiency, 
torque, and cogging torque.  The torque ripple is minimum with a skew angle of 5.6%. The best Halbach continuous 
skewing magnet array is determined by a 5-slices angle of 10 degrees. For electrical drive, the PM surface-mounted 
motor is easy to arrange Halbach and skewing structures.  A thermal analysis of a PMBLDC motor has been performed 
successfully by approach method based on analytical and FEM simulation under full-load steady-state conditions.

Abstract 
Studies have shown that Filipino agricultural operators are exposed to vibrations greater than the daily exposure limit 
values, which puts risks to the operators. Additionally, there have been various studies abroad on the effects of 
vibration on the human body. With that, this study investigated the whole-body musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) 
symptoms experienced, the mean onset and severity of symptoms, the existence of vibration-related illness specifically 
Hand-arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS), and analyzed the physiological effects of vibration and effects on functions 
of the hands and wrist to 100 Filipino farm operators from Tarlac and Laguna through a small group discussion. The 
study utilized the following questionnaires: Extended Nordic Musculoskeletal Disorder Questionnaire to measure the 
prevalence of whole-body MSD symptoms, average years before the onset and severity of symptoms; the Cold 
Intolerance Symptom Severity Questionnaire to analyze cold intolerance as the basis for the existence of HAVS; and 
lastly the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire to examine the physiological symptoms in the hands and 
wrist and the effects of vibration to the hand functions. Responses were collected and analyzed, which revealed that 
whole-body MSD symptoms are prevalent in all the covered body parts with a minimum prevalence of 12% in the 
elbows, a maximum prevalence of 38% in the lower back, and the earliest onset of MSD symptoms in the shoulders 
after a mean of 9.04 years of operating agricultural machines. Results further revealed that 13% of the participants 
have mild and severe cases of cold intolerance and that operators experience the physiological effects of vibration to 
hands and wrist which also manifested in the occurrence of diminished hand functions. The result of the study can be 
a basis for creating policies to reduce the hazards of agricultural machines to the operators.

Abstract 
Waste collection and transportation processes are accounted for more than 50% of all total waste management costs 
then there is an urgency for a waste recycling company to minimize this activities-related total cost by any means. 
Route optimization in collecting those plastics wastes can be a good solution to addressing the problem. This research 
focuses on determining waste collection routes for multilayer plastic with the objective function of minimizing total 
transportation costs. The waste collection problem is modeled as Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) with a certain 
capacity and constrained time windows but here the vehicle is allowed to travel multiple times, this model said as the 
Multi-Trip Multi-period Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (MCVRPTW). The model was 
solved by an exact method using mixed integer linear programming and a metaheuristic approach using the Genetic 
Algorithm (GA). The results showed that the exact method was able to solve problems on small data instances and 
required almost 100% higher computation time than of metaheuristic approach. The best GA solution with mutation 
and crossover rates of 0.75 and 0.1 provides savings of 30.2% compared to the total transportation cost for existing 
conditions.

More consumption means more waste plastic packaging dominating the world's pollution along with waste from these 
sectors: building and construction, textiles, transportation, electronics, industrial machinery, and others (Ritchie & 
Roser, 2018). Waste management has become a problem for all people, and Indonesia is no exception. Plastic waste 
management in Indonesia is considered unsuccessful yet where it is known that there are 4.8 million tons of them 
(National Plastic Action Partnership 2021). Regarding the potential for waste pollution, many companies are starting 
to adopt the Circular Economy (CE) business model and reverse logistics. Reverse logistics flow and process can be 
illustrated in Fig. 1. As stated by (Sureka, Bandara, & Wickramarachchi, 2018), one prominent factor some influencing 
others for efficient and effective reverse logistics is transportation, covering aspects of the driver, vehicle, road, 
geography, etc. 
Waste management can be seen as a strategic supply chain issue as it consists of activities of collection, sortation, 
transportation, processing, and distribution where tactical, strategic, and operational decision-making requires 
coordination involving the entire actors (Mohammadi et al.  2019). Waste management activities have many 
challenges such as non-integrated upstream to downstream handling, inadequate processing infrastructure, and high 
investment and operational costs (Sutana 2021). The activities of collection and transportation contribute significantly 
up to 70% to the total cost of the waste management (Boskovic et al.  2016). Little moreover big improvements in 
waste collection and transport activities will give a big acceleration in overall waste management system which can 
be seen in the greater cost savings that can be gained. (Wu et al.  2020).

search for 100 iterations and 100 number of populations. But this condition is more efficient for larger instance such 
as 10 points and 15 points. The computation time for both 10 and 15 points using GA is faster than exact with 
acceptable objective function. GA is more suitable to solve large scale problem, because its capability to solve the 
problem in an efficient time and with the near optimum solution. 
This paper contributes to solve the real world’s problem. So, we compare the cost of transportation between existing 
condition and GA result. The existing condition needs IDR 398.881 to collect the waste while GA results IDR 277.710. 
Based on these results the company can save 30.3% in transportation cost without any additional investment cost. But 
the company needs two days to collect the waste from all the suppliers. This idea can be an alternative solution for the 
company if they have no concern about collecting time within two days and does not expecting any investment in the 
near future. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Finding the optimal route for collecting MLP on the MCVRPTW model using the exact method is considered 
inefficient in terms of computation time. Determining the route on an instance of 15 points takes up to 10 hours of 
computing time but has not yet obtained a global optimal. The application of the Genetic Algorithms (GA) method in 
finding the optimal route for collecting MLP on the MCVRPTW model has a computation time of 44 seconds. The 
best parameters selected for GA to obtain the optimal solution are 100 population, 100 iterations, 0.75 crossover rate, 
and 0.1 mutation rate. The optimal route based on GA has obtained 8 routes where 4 routes are served in period 1, 3 
routes are served in period 2, and 1 route is served in period 3 with an objective function of IDR 277.710. The optimal 
solution generates savings of 30.3% compared to the existing conditions. This research has limitations so there are 
some suggestions for future research. The first suggestion is to consider other cost components in the formula of total 
transportation costs that have not been considered in this research. The second suggestion is might be considered for 
adding a new objective function such as minimizing the cost of carbon emissions.

This study examined the effects of poster design components on guilt response, the moderating 
effect of clarity of purpose between the design attributes and guilt response, and the effects of guilt 
appeals on social distancing behavioral intention. In this research, poster design attributes such as 
background color and textual components were manipulated in terms of hue, color saturation, and 
message type in creating different stimuli for the actual experiment. A 2 (hue) x 3 (saturation) x 3 
(message type) between-subjects experiment was conducted wherein eighteen (18) stimuli were 
evaluated by 162 target participants through an actual experiment measured in terms of clarity of 
purpose, guilt response, and social distancing behavioral intention. The effects of hue, saturation, 
textual components, and the moderating effect of clarity of purpose on guilt response were tested 
using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Whereas, the effect of guilt response on social distancing 
behavioral intention was analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM). Findings showed 
that red hue, anticipatory message type, and the interaction between red hue and anticipatory 
message type had significant positive effects on guilt response. However, the interaction between 
hue and saturation presented no significant effect on guilt and clarity of purpose also had no 
moderating effect between the design attributes and guilt response. Ultimately, the SEM results 
reported that guilt response had a direct significant effect on social distancing behavioral intention.

Abstract 
This study proposes a quantitative evaluation model for comparative analysis of vaccine supply chain (VSC) 
performance while considering multiple regions input real time data that is both subjective as well as objective in 
nature. Performance indicators (PIs), capable of taking subjective as well as objective inputs, are constructed to capture 
the VSC development status and categorized under different objectives. A combination of CRITIC and VIKOR 
method are used to define weights of the performance criteria and rank the alternatives regions respectively, while 
analysing objective and subjective weights. Whereas, the spherical fuzzy extension of CRITIC and VIKOR method 
was used to interpret the subjective performance information provided the VSC managers at the respective region. 
The ranks obtained are then compared for each region to identify the regions observing conflicting narratives based 
on objective and subjective information. Also, further investigation of VSC in such regions can highlight reasons 
responsible for conflicting narratives.

Introduction 
Vaccines prevent the spread of disease causing viruses, thereby reducing healthcare cost, unprecedented loss of lives, 
disabilities and stunted growth in children (Lewis et al. 2008). Vaccines are perishable in nature and experience 
loss in efficacy if not stored/transported in the prescribed environment thereafter causing direct impact on health and 
well-being of beneficiaries receiving it (WHO 2018). Hence, delivery of these vaccines to the beneficiaries through 
immunization programs is achieved through a complex and critical supply chain whose efficiency ensures equitable 
vaccination coverage. There are several dimensions of a vaccine supply chain (VSC) and monitoring their performance 
through adequate performance indicators (PIs) helps in maintaining the required efficiency (Chandra and Kumar 
2019). Also, a comparative analysis of VSC performance in different geographical alternatives helps in achieving the 
best overall outcome, for a given amount of resources, by identifying reasons of outperformance for some regions and 
pinpointing areas of concern for regions that are not performing well on a relative scale.  
The issues associated to VSC like vaccine storage and distribution, demand forecasting, vaccine wastage, managing 
vaccine stocks, creating vaccine awareness, human resource management and training, immunization financing, 
community engagement and associated costs are all dynamic in nature and interrelated. Many of these issues along 
with several other related issues have been clustered into broad dimensions and correlation between them is studied 
using empirical techniques (Chandra and Kumar 2019; 2021; Alam at al. 2021; Haidri et al. 2017). VSC managers, 
researchers and policy makers continuously strive to come up with solutins to deal with these issues. The insights

The comparison of ranks for the blocks based on subjective and objective values corresponding to the supply and 
demand criteria of VSC show that there is a significant difference for block B2. This indicates that there is difference 
in the performance narrative that is unfolding as the result of objective analysis and what the vaccine cold chain 
managers is observing in the block. Further analysis of inputs for this block suggests that X1 and X3 or PIs associated 
to capacity utilization and dose administered are areas of concern in this region and hence must be further investigated.  
 
Conclusion  
In this study we have proposed a systematic framework to monitor the VSC performance using real time subjective 
and objective information. A combination of CRITIC and VIKOR method are used to define weights of the 
performance criteria and rank the alternatives regions respectively, while analyzing objective and subjective weights. 
Whereas, the spherical fuzzy extension of CRITIC and VIKOR method was used to interpret the subjective 
performance information provided the VSC managers at the respective region. The ranks obtained are then compared 
for each region to identify the regions observing conflicting narratives based on objective and subjective information. 
Also, this paper provides a comprehensive evaluation index, containing PIs that take both subjective and objective 
inputs for measuring the performance of various components of a VSC. As an extension of this study a sensitivity 
analysis can be performed wherein different weightages shall be given to subjective and objective information type. 
Also, a more comprehensive evaluation index can be developed by including more PIs.

Abstract 
Energy, both renewable and non-renewable energy, are increasingly used in every sector of life. Manufacturing 
sectors, especially, account for the largest share of annual industrial energy consumption by 81% in which it consumes 
two general types of energy source, fuel and nonfuel. Cement industry is one of the industries that plays an important 
role in the construction process and requires a large amount of energy in its production process. The use in this process 
contributes to a different amount of carbon emission. Furthermore, this increase in energy consumption is not in line 
with the availability of energy sources. Therefore, the Indonesian government ordered energy-efficient strategies to 
maintain sustainability. A review on the implementation from secondary data was conducted and analyzed. The review 
result shows even though strategies and policies are implemented by the companies, a reduction of energy 
consumption within the past 3 years from the cement industry in Indonesia does not necessarily obtain a decrease of 
carbon emission.

1. Introduction
Energy plays an important role in human life, whether for household demand or business sectors, where almost all 
equipment that helps people requires energy to operate. There are two sources of energy in the world, non-renewable 
energy and renewable energy. Currently, the use of energy continues to increase unproportionally compared to the 
increase in the availability of energy sources (Abas et al. 2015). This raises the potential for an energy crisis in the 
future. The industrial sector is one of the largest energy users compared to other sectors. According to the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration - EIA (2022), industry or manufacturing sectors in 2021 hold accounts for the largest 
share of annual industrial energy consumption by 81% in which it consumes two general types of energy source, fuel 
and nonfuel. Fuel consumption energy is heat and/or electricity generated from the use of a combustible energy source 
for its own usage within the industry. 
Cement industry is one of the industries that plays an important role in the construction process. Cement production 
requires a large amount of energy, in which a massive consumption of energy has the potential to contribute to 
environmental problems such as carbon emissions and air pollution. To overcome the occurrence of an energy crisis 
due to the use on a large scale and continuously from the industrial sector, strategic steps from company’s management 
are needed in the utilization and saving of energy. Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) is designed so that an 
industry can contribute to overcome the global crisis, one of which is energy. 
According to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM) of Indonesia, the government ordered all 
industries to improve energy-efficient management. In fact, this obligation was emphasized in a circular letter which 
was circulated to all industries to comply to save energy. This policy will prevent non-renewable energy sources 
derived from fossils such as coal, oil and natural gas from running out quickly, and can be used by future generations. 
This study will analyze the energy consumption within the cement companies in Indonesia and its impact on carbon 
emissions. Furthermore, a discussion on implementation of the sustainability strategy of the Indonesian cement

6. Conclusion
This research provides a review and insight of the implementation in the cement industry in Indonesia. Based on data 
collected and reviewed, it can be concluded that companies within the cement industry in Indonesia have already 
implemented strategies and policies to maintain the sustainability of energy. Their programs resulted in a decrease of 
energy consumption in the past 3 (three) years. But this reduction in energy consumption does not come with a 
reduction of carbon emission as per expected. An increase is shown within the past 3 years of the industry. 
The limitations of this research lies in the lack of data collected limited from the company’s sustainability report for 
the past 3 years. This limits the research on the bigger evaluation of energy consumption, carbon emission production, 
and strategy implementation in the industry. Further research is recommended to gather more detailed data on the 
review of energy sustainability in the cement industry in Indonesia.

Abstract 
Ecological literacy provides unraveling a comprehensive understanding of environmental issues 
and problems. Nevertheless, applying this understanding often requires more than essential 
experiential learning. This study highlights a crucial, however frequently neglected, need for 
ecological literacy that allows educators and consultants of the distinct disciplines of education to 
apply methodical knowledge when encountering environmental and behavioral difficulties. The 
mixed-method research primarily intended to investigate how to promote students’ conceptual 
understanding of ecological concepts using the Place-Based Outdoor Learning (PBOL) teaching 
model. The findings showed that using place-based outdoor learning to understand ecological 
concepts is further effective than the classroom setting (CSI) approach. The student's overall 
understanding of ecological concepts has significantly improved. Thus, results are highly 
recommending that educators in different fields can develop environmentally friendly controlling 
processes and contribute effectively to integrative work groups dealing with environmental issues 
and problems; and pedagogy and curriculum development on the strengthening evidence of the 
benefits of PBOL activities that influence students, including improved connection with the natural 
situated places; exploring how the PBOL teaching model can increase explicit memory and 
retention of concepts, and how reinforcement between the affective and the cognitive influence 
help scaffold higher-order learning.

1. Introduction
Place-based outdoor learning has been conveyed in various ways that this method serves as an educational tactic used 
in a local environment and is an advantage to the teaching and learning process. This approach focused more on 
experiential learning that allows students to do significant work and encompass local difficulties and perceptions into 
the curriculum (Yavuz and Cakmak, 2018). 
Ecological science is distinctively prepared to address challenging ecological complexities in a convoluted and rapidly 
shifting world. It is supposed to promote significant awareness and focus environmental problems in entirely 
geographical levels’ occurrences. Educators and consultants have been rising to these challenges by creating 
innovations and teaching-learning development. 
Globally, the Philippines is a top priority for global conservation because it is a biodiversity hotspot and a 
megadiversity country. The high species diversity and a very high level of endemism are because it is composed of 
many isolated islands, the tropical location of the country, and the once extensive rainforest areas. Unfortunately, the 
Philippines is also one of the world's most threatened hotspots because of biodiversity loss (Castillo, 2020). This

classroom setting instruction approach. Moreover, the distribution of the student's responses to each conceptual 
understanding test on Biodiversity and interactions indicated that the PBOL model is more effective than the CSI 
approach in promoting an understanding of these ecological concepts. In most of the items, students in the study 
groups showed more improvement in understanding the concepts than in the control groups.  
 
The results stated that using the real world is the way to learn about human subsistence. In the place-based outdoor 
environment, students are attached to the situated space's activities more in the process of memorization than analyzing 
situational and hands-on activities. Nature learning also allows for direct and experiential experiences that help them 
to become critical thinkers. This study's PBOL instruction highlights evidence supporting the teacher's and students' 
positive outcomes. These could be inferred in the post-instructional assessment. 
 
The second objective of the present study is: ""How effective is the PBL teaching model compared to CSI in promoting 
conceptual understanding and retention of learned ecological concepts: Biodiversity and Interactions?"" The study's 
quantitative data revealed that the study groups obtained higher mean scores than the control groups in the posttest, 
indicating that the PBOL model is more effective than the CSI approach. These results were complemented by the test 
item facility analysis analyses, which also showed that the PBOL model is more effective than the CSI approach. Even 
when the posttest gain scores were analyzed, it was observed that the posttest gain scores ascertained that the PBOL 
model is more effective than the CSI in teaching ecological concepts. The students taught using the PBOL model had 
significantly greater gain scores than those taught using the CSI approach. 
 
However, both PBOL and CSI failed to promote the retention of understanding of ecological concepts. Students’ 
Conceptual understanding of ecological concepts decreased in the study and control groups two weeks after 
instruction. These results imply that both PBOL and CSI were not specifically successful in promoting the retention 
of conceptual understanding of the ecological concept. Post-posttest showed that many students' levels of 
understanding did not remain high or very high, revealing that the PBOL model and CSI approach did not promote 
retention of conceptual understanding for many students. Nonetheless, compared with those taught using the CSI 
approach, more students were taught using PBOL, which showed a relatively higher level of understanding.  
 
Despite the overall inefficiency of PBOL and CSI in promoting the retention of ecological concepts, the results of the 
post-posttest scores from the students taught utilizing the PBOL teaching model showed that there were higher than 
those taught through the CSI approach. This indicates that learning nature compared with learning inside the classroom 
is more effective in promoting an understanding of ecological concepts. The results of the General Linear Model 
(GLM) Univariate analysis strengthened the conclusion that the PBOL teaching model helps students to understand 
the Biodiversity and Interactions concepts better than the CSI approach. This analytical procedure was used to perform 
an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) on the post-test scores after teaching the concepts. Since the study used a 
Solomon-four-group design for the control groups for the pretest before teaching the concepts, it was assumed that 
there was no significant interaction between the covariate (pretest) and the factor (treatment: PBOL or CSI). 
 
The significance value for Treatment (PBOL or CSI) is more than 0.05, indicating it has no significant effect on the 
student's conceptual understanding of Biodiversity. The value of -3.323 for CSI indicates that, given two students with 
a similar conceptual understanding of Biodiversity before the treatment, one may expect that the conceptual 
understanding of Biodiversity after treatment among the CSI classes is 3.3 less than that of the PBOL classes. The 
significance value for Treatment (PBOL) is less than 0.05, indicating that it significantly affects the conceptual 
understanding of Interaction. The value of -4.366 for CSI indicates that, for two students with a similar conceptual 
understanding of Interaction before the treatment, one can expect the conceptual understanding of Interaction after 
treatment among the students in the CSI classes to be 4.4 less than that of the PBL classes. Parameter estimates showed 
that based on the value of -12.356 for CSI, two students with a similar conceptual understanding of Biodiversity and 
Interactions before the treatment, one can expect the conceptual understanding of Biodiversity and Biodiversity after 
treatment among the students in the CSI classes to be 12.4 less than that of the PBOL classes. 
 
""Do the study group, collaboration learning, and investigation impact on conceptual understanding?"" and ""Do the 
control group, self-directed learning, and deep questioning impact on conceptual understanding?"" are the third and 
fourth research questions of this study. Classroom observations revealed that students in the PBL classes collaborated, 
investigated, and showed retention more than those in the CSI classes. Students' collaboration and retention were 
higher than collaboration among the students taught using the PBOL model than those in the CSI approach. Specific 
qualitative observations on the students in the study groups indicated that most of the students were engaged by

listening to instructions and performing tasks required by the teacher, to become independent learners. It was also 
observed that students enjoyed their tasks and worked collaboratively to finish their work. The researcher's 
methodological, reflective, and personal notes confirmed that students' collaboration and social interactions were 
deepened by the activities embedded in the PBOL teaching model. 
  
Conclusions and Recommendations for Future Studies 
 
Understanding ecological concepts using the place-based outdoor learning (PBOL) teaching model is more effective 
than a classroom approach. Findings indicated that there is a significant difference in the statistical analysis results 
illustrating that the PBOL instruction has enabled students’ conceptual understanding and retention regardless of 
challenges posed by place-based outdoor learning, it offered supplementary teaching and learning incentives for 
teachers and students. Students’ overall understanding of ecological concepts has significantly improved. Thus, 
outcomes are highly recommending the educators in different fields can develop environmentally friendly controlling 
processes and contribute effectively to integrative work groups dealing with environmental issues and problems and 
the pedagogy and curriculum development as well as future research are offered, specifically, using PBOL teaching 
model as one of the frameworks for learning experiences should be tried for its positive effects on both learners and 
teachers; seminars and trainings should be conducted for science teachers to be fully equipped with pedagogical skills 
needed to implement the PBOL model and accurately oriented to achieve the intended results of the PBOL teaching 
model; if constructing a meaningful ecological understanding of least mastered topics on biodiversity and interactions 
requires sufficient time and planning, the science curriculum should consider the span of time for improving the 
conceptual understanding levels; infusing the PBOL teaching model into the science curriculum of environmental 
education should allow students to understand the real essence of the environment and appreciate the scientific 
explanations currently affecting nature; and although the PBOL teaching model has shown to be effective in improving 
conceptual understanding of ecological concepts, it is recognized that it should be employed only in topics that are 
appropriate for outdoor activities and when situated places are available in the school. Thus, future researchers should 
reflect on the strengthening evidence of the benefits of PBOL activities that influence students, including improved 
connection with naturally situated places; exploring how the PBOL teaching model can increase explicit memory and 
retention of ecological concepts, and how reinforcement between the affective and the cognitive influence help 
scaffold higher-order learning.

1. Introduction
Incorporating the ideas of interconnection, digitization, and automation, the 4th industrial revolution (Industry 4) 
consists of a group of definitions and technologies that industrial businesses should adopt to increase their 
competitiveness. In this context, the effective development of lean supply chains & intelligent based on adaptable and 
collaborative networks and networked companies is the aim of smart logistics. Additionally, the use of data networks, 
automatic identification, material tracking, technologies, actors, and sensors, as well as contemporary information and 
communication technologies (ICT), establishes information interchange. Additionally, transition, automated transport, 
and storage systems must allow for partial or full system self-control, assisted by autonomous transport vehicles 
(Dallasega  et al.  2020). 
Additionally, the technical concepts of internet of things (IoT), cyberphysical systems (CPS), as well as the industrial 
IoT (IIoT) as well as the physical internet (PI), can be used to create smart logistics (Zsifkovits, et al.  2019). One of 
the greatest crucial success factors in the digital transformation process, in addition to the application of technology 
principles, is the use of deep learning, artificial intelligence, machine learning. (Cioffi  et al. 2020). In this sense, (AI) 
might be characterized as the study and development of smart machines, with a particular emphasis on intelligent 
computer programmes (Carthy et al.  2006). The automatic discovery of significant patterns in datasets is referred to 
as machine learning (ML), which is regarded as a key component of artificial intelligence (AI). By ensuring that 
algorithms have the capacity to adapt and learn depending on big-data analysis, ML tools strive to boost the efficacy 
of algorithms (Shwartz  et al.  2014). 
Additionally, a lot of businesses and organizations use (AI) for a variety of tasks since it is now a much potent tool 
that may help these businesses stand out from their rivals and lower the likelihood of making errors. The system can 
now carry out duties and make sensible decisions on its own thanks to artificial intelligence (AI). Many sectors are in 
a time of manned to unmanned transition due to the advent of AI and big data, and the logistics sector is also going 
through this shift from fully manned to totally automated. More logistics organizations are attempting to apply

1. The transportation environment has to adapt for the first category. Utilize the static route planning system to create 
an initial path order, and then, in accordance with the items' environmental prerequisites (such as those for 
temperatures and humidity), utilize a platform for cloud computing. to recover the pertinent environmental variables 
of the region along on the route and segment the original route in accordance with these parameters. The suitable 
transportation instrument for several sub-section is chosen Depending on each sub-environmental section's 
characteristics (Bai  2021). 
 
2. The demands for travel time are greater for the second classification. The system resolves this issue using the 
subsequent short route planning technique. A static planning technique is used in the algorithm to determine the 
shortest path and the 2ed-shortest path, and it makes use of a platform for cloud computing to recover information on 
the convey processing times of each logistics station, the amount of goods backlogged at each station, and other 
factors. A less time-consuming transportation strategy is chosen by comparing the predicted times of the two routes 
(Lingbin  et al.  2015). 
3. The quickest transit route is needed for the third category. This kind of transport is primarily intended for the 
movement of goods and raw materials. To address these issues, the system combining the static algorithm for route 
planning along with the anti-nearest neighbor inquiry technique. In order to build the final transportation plan, the 
route planning algorithm is utilized to identify the shortest path after the technique of anti-nearest neighbor inquiry 
has been used to look for raw material sources with generally suitable conditions in many aspects (Bai  2021). 
 
4. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the large-scale system of smart logistics has a significant impact on industrial enterprises and companies 
by using the AI applications of recent innovations in communication and information technologies, for instance IoT, 
CPS, & PI. Logistics systems impact the planning outcomes of the path by consuming time as a constraint path as 
well as AI and automation technology used to analyze the data which helps in the decision-making procedure by 
giving current information, expectations based on forecasting, and predictions. Moreover, with technical resources in 
the 21st century, Supply chain logistics can be provided by AI with technical assistance that combines cloud 
computing, big data, and IoT. Therefore, AI is a significant factor behind the transformation of the logistics sector.

1. Introduction
The automotive industry is one of the leading sectors that has a quite a large contribution to the economy in Indonesia 
by contributing an investment value of Rp. 99.16 trillion with a total production capacity of 2.35 million units per year 
(Ministry of Industry 2021). It can be seen from the number of sales that fluctuate from year to year and sales increased 
in 2021 by 70.33%. Cars as one of automotive industry main transportation mode of people in Indonesia also showing 
positive trends year to year shown in Figure 1. 
Electric vehicles are one of the upcoming means of transportation and are going to be the main choice in the future 
(Dericioglu et al. 2018). The rise of electric vehicles started in the early 1970s during the first fuel crisis in California. 
In the 1980s the battery that was soon going to be utilized for EVs started to be the main focus for the concern of 
shortage of fossil fuel supply and air pollution that comes along with it (Ajanovic 2015). Electrical power is the main 
driver of electric vehicles (Ahmad, et. al. 2018) and of the most effective way to reduce the consumption of fossil fuel 
(Boulanger et. al. 2011). The measures taken to slow down climate change and developing renewable and sustainable 
energy, needs a massive transition of energy from fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy. With the slowly 
decreasing amount of fossil fuel in the near future this situation hopefully will motivate researchers, car manufacturers, 
and other stakeholders to join the race for searching alternative resources like electrical power that is used for cars 
(Mehar et al. 2015). Compared to fossil fuels-based vehicles, EV has lower noise level, high energy utilization rate, 
environmentally friendly and could reduce glass house effect in transportation (Song et  al. 2016). Not only from an 
environmental aspect, EV is also expected to reduce the dependency of fossil fuel and increase global energy resilience 
(Dawami et al. 2020).

As shown in Table 3, with the interest rate of 5% (Bank Indonesia) it shows that if we compare both options through 
PW Analysis it looks like Brio RS as the representation of ICEV is behind of Wuling Air EV as the representation of 
entry level EV.  
Table 4. Straight Line Depreciation Method Comparison 
 
Tabel 4 shows depreciation rate of both options through Straight Line Method with 10 years of asset’s lifetime. At the 
end of tenure (Year 10) Brio RS as the representation of ICEV has bigger NBV compared to Wuling Air EV as the 
representation of EV. It is also compatible with (Schloter, 2022) that show vehicles have a degressive depreciation 
relationship over the age of the vehicle, but that electric vehicles have a substantially higher depreciation of 1.16% 
per month (13.9% per annum) compared to gasoline vehicles with 0.87% per month (10.4% per annum). This conclude 
that at the end of tenure (Year 10), Brio RS Urbanite has bigger valuation than Wuling Air EV.  
EV and ICEV have different target groups regarding demographics, mobility patterns, and attitudes (Haustein and 
Jensen, 2018). For now, the entry-level EV class that is marketed is still limited, so from a sales point of view, ICEV 
is still superior in terms of sales. With government support, it is hoped that in the next few years, there will be various 
types of EVs so that people will find it easier and more interested in these vehicles. With more and more EV users, it 
is hoped that it can also reduce greenhouse gases and fossil fuels. But there are increased levels of human toxicity due 
to the greater use of metals, chemicals, and energy to produce powertrains and high-voltage batteries (Verma et al. 
2021). An important and expensive element in EVs is the battery, so future technologies and innovations are needed 
to allow higher amounts of power to be stored and charged in a shorter period of time (Sanguesa et al. 2021). 
6. Conclusion  
The development of industry 4.0 and the issue of sustainability, EVs are the automotive industry's future in reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, and limited use of fossil fuels. Currently, in Indonesia, there are still very few 
types of EV cars at the entry level. For this reason, based on the research objectives set previously to analyze the 
comparison of entry-level Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEV) and Electric Vehicles (EV) based on several 
factors such as purchase costs, ownership costs, energy, maintenance, and taxes.

In annual mileage costs, the Wuling Air EV is estimated at IDR 4,405,000.00 compared to the Brio RS Urbanite, 
which has a cost of IDR. 7,352,000.00. For the annual cost of ownership, which includes purchase costs Rp 
311.000.000,00 for Wuling Air EV and Rp 237.400.000,00 for Brio RS Urbanite, annual maintenance, and annual tax 
Wuling Air EV is superior to Brio RS Urbanite, which is IDR 5,581,366.00 compared to 12,277,000.00 this annual 
ownership costs have also included maintenance cost. Apart from that, from the Present Worth (PW) calculation, it 
can be seen that the Wuling Air EV has outperformed the Brio RS Urbanite. If we look at the depreciation of the two 
types of vehicles in the next 10 years, Brio RS as an ICEV representative, has a larger NBV compared to Wuling Air 
EV as an EV representative. 
However, the thing that needs to be considered in using an EV is the battery element. The battery is an important 
factor and must be replaced after several years of use, so it requires a fairly high cost to replace it. It is hoped that in 
the future, there will be innovations and research related to EV batteries that can be replaced in certain parts that are 
damaged, and replacements are not carried out as a whole.

Abstract 
This study presents the organizational culture and employee engagement levels of Cebu Institute of Technology - 
University, a higher education institution from the Philippines, based on the four culture types (clan, adhocracy, 
hierarchy, and market), and three dimensions of employee engagement (vigor, dedication, and adsorption). 
Respondents were employees of the university which were categorized as academic or administrative, and supervisory 
or non-supervisory. The inquiry adopted the Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument (OCAI), and the Utrecht 
Work Engagement Scale (UWES-17), and utilized PLS-SEM and PLS regression for analysis. 
Findings revealed that the overall current and preferred culture type of the University is clan culture. Employees are 
also in a good state of engagement and are highest in terms of dedication with a mean score of 5.3059 on a 6-point 
Likert scale. PLS Regression suggested that organizational culture significantly influences employee engagement. 
Furthermore, adhocracy culture positively impacts dedication while hierarchy culture negatively impacts dedication.

1. Introduction
Indonesia put Pancasila as the basic philosophy of the state where in principle number one commands to Believe 
in One Almighty God. This implies the Indonesian nation is a religious nation that believes in and pious God 
Almighty in accordance with their respective religions and beliefs(1). Six religions are recognized in Indonesia, 
and Islam holds the largest number of followers in Indonesia, around 237.53 million people or 86.9% of the total 
population as of 31 December 2021(2). Based on data from the Directorate General of Population and Civil 
Registration (Dukcapil) of the Ministry of Home Affairs, as many as 9.44 million people are followers of Islam 
based in the national capital, the province of D.K.I Jakarta, and East Jakarta have the largest number of followers 
with 2.89 million people. 
In Islam, the mosque holds important role as a place to worship. According to Rumondor (2019), in the 
millennium era, the mosque experiences reformation in order to enliven the house of God. Therefore, mosques 
are focussed for activities like religious studies, commemorating islamic holidays. Beside that, according to 
Rumondor (2019), mosque function at millennial era is included library, Al-Quran learning center, place for 
discussion, place for collection zakat, alms, and sadaqah (Z.I.S), place for congregation gathered to eat together. 
Suhono et al.  (2020) stated that all activities in mosques right now, have unique energy use characteristics when 
compared to other types of buildings such as houses, offices, and commercials.  Next is energy consumption at 
the mosque is unique because its energy usage is not utilized continuously and varies depending on the number 
of people who come and at a certain period. 
Based on the explanation above, and many muslim in East Jakarta are distributed across 1032 mosques (most 
number of mosques in Jakarta) according to BPS data, this research will try to analyze electricity consumption 
at Darul Ma’arif Mosque that located at DKI Jakarta, in Pondok Kelapa, East Jakarta..   
For reference, Darul Ma’arif mosque had a capacity of 700 people with facilities included like preschool for 
kids, house of tahfidz Quran, an house for the imam of praying, hospitality room for the ustaz, Z.I.S, and held 
some activities in the meantime. The mosque is also equipped with some air conditioners to make the mosque 
more comfortable and do activities in the mosque. Other equipment are digital sound system, multimedia 
equipment, CCTV and Internet.

Figure 7. Mosque new electricity plan saving 
 
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
After got the information, here are the solution that we proposed to reduce the electricity consumption in the 
mosque 
1. Replace all the lights used, with LED lights and regulate how the light used in the mosque 
2. Add inverter to the Air Conditioner 
3. Reducing the Air Conditioner usage in the mosque by regulating the hours it used 
4. Adding fan in the mosque as the Air Conditioner replacement 
5. Regulate the inside speaker usage, to reducing the electricity usage 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on our research we can conclude that it took a large amount of electricity to operate a mosque. The mosque 
usage frequency is one of the determining factors that determines how much electricity will be use in the mosque. 
We also learned that tools like Air Conditioner is one of the top contributors in mosque electricity consumption, 
where it happened because mosque always use all of their air conditioners to keep the temperature comfortable 
enough for the people in there 
 
There’s lot of electricity usage cause by unregulated use of electricity happening in the mosque such as fan, air 
conditioner, lamps, etc. To reduce the electricity consumption in a mosque, the mosque guardian need to create 
some sort of rules to use electronics in the mosque, that way the mosque can keep their electricity usage low and 
keep the mosque operational cost low.

Abstract 
In an educational setting, evaluation of college students' motivational orientations and use of different learning tactics 
in an online college course is crucial. Students’ ability to develop ways in sustaining motivation in learning is greatly 
affected not just by the type of environment that they have virtually, but also with the relationship that they perceive 
with their instructors.  
In this study, the impact of two independent variables faculty-student relationship (FSR) and online learning 
environment (OLE) towards the dependent variable motivated strategies (MS) among students were being investigated 
and the data were gathered using 3 different standardized questionnaires. A total of 5,312 respondents answered the 
survey and was reduced to target 250 respondents using stratified sampling needed for the Partial Least Squares - 
Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). 
PLS Regression results revealed that there is a significant impact from FSR and OLE towards MS. Descriptive analysis 
showed overall responses indicating that intrinsic goal has the highest mean under MS, while instructor anxiety and 
student autonomy were the highest for FSR and OLE, respectively. PLS-SEM results also implied that the instructor 
connectedness was proven to affect the motivated strategies sub factors such as extrinsic goal, control of learning 
beliefs, self-efficacy, and social engagement. While the instructor anxiety significantly affects extrinsic goal and 
control of learning beliefs. 
The study recommends that whenever there are activities that employ the use of prizes and rewards, it must be a type 
of reward that provides satisfaction on their psychological needs that would enhance their confidence and esteem 
rather than the use of money or grades.

Abstract 
This research studies a monthly task assignment for staff and testing equipment of a stability testing process in a 
pharmaceutical company.  A stability testing process begins with collecting drug to the system, preparing chemical, 
glassware and equipment, testing drugs on equipment and writing reports. There are three types of a stability test 
where each drug requires different type of stability test, and some drugs require multiple types.  Each testing process 
requires different types of testing equipment, which requires different set-up time and processing time.  Currently, 
task assignments are determined based upon division manager’s experience which leads to unbalanced workload.  To 
solve this problem, a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) is proposed to find the optimal solution, which 
focuses on minimizing the difference between maximum and minimum workload of staff, overtime, and penalty cost 
of postponement. The result of this model shows that the unbalanced workload among staff is reduced.  Moreover, by 
test postponement, overtime does not occur.

1. Introduction
A testing process is essential to control product quality as it helps prevent poor-quality products and increases product 
reliability.  Efficient quality control ensures customers’ satisfaction.  The pharmaceutical industry is one of industries 
that regularly requires testing.  Due to the rising of consumers’ health consciousness, pharmaceutical products have 
become one of the most effective factors in the livelihood of people in terms of treatment and prevention of diseases 
to maintain a healthy life.  After the drug production process is completed, a stability test plays a crucial part in 
providing evidence on how quality of drug substances varies under a variety of environmental factors to establish a 
re-test period or a shelf life for the drug.  This test requires specialists and advanced testing machines to test and 
validate product quality to meet the needs and expectations of people in obtaining standard safety treatment. 
Drug stability test is a part of the testing department, which is mainly responsible for testing the stability of finished 
products.  It must be conducted in accordance with the ICH topic Q1A(R2) guideline for a stability test.  In this paper, 
we are interested in three main types of drug testing.  First, “Assay” is an investigative or analytic procedure for 
identifying or measuring the present of compounds, amount, or functional activity of pharmaceutical products. 
Second, “Impurity” is a step of determining and isolating the number of inorganic impurities, organic impurities, and 
residual solvents.  Third, “Dissolution” is a step of measuring the release and extent of the pharmaceutical products 
substances.   
Each drug requires different types of stability test.  To develop a stability test, pharmacists, scientists, and testing 
machines are required.  However, each type of test requires different types of machines with different set-up time and

pharmacist and scientist in each month. The result shows pharmacist has no more than 30% idle time while scientist 
tends to more availability in the last six months, with idle time up to 51% in the ninth month due to the demand for 
drugs to be tested decreases.

In this research, we used the number of resources from Bunkerd’s study as an input for our model. The total number 
of resources was determined at the beginning of the year to be sufficient for the amount of demand and didn’t change 
within a year. Therefore, idle time occurs. The manager may reorganize the capacity planning during the year because 
the resources are not used efficiently. There is only one pharmacist in the division, therefore may not be able to adjust. 
In term of scientist, capacity usage has decreased the last six months so, it is not necessary for all scientists to the test. 
The manager should assign idle scientists to perform other tasks instead. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Work 
In this paper, a monthly task assignment of a stability test is studied.  The stability testing process of pharmaceutical 
products begins with collecting drug to the system, preparing chemical, glass and equipment, testing on machines and 
writing the report.  The objective of this paper is to propose a monthly task assignment model to minimize the 
unbalanced workload, overtime working of staff and the total penalty cost due to test postponement.  A mixed integer 
linear programming model is developed to solve the problem from a real setting.  The optimal solution for assigning 
tasks can be obtained.  Due to demand variation in each month, all tests cannot be performed in the required month.  
Test postponement can help reduce overtime and balance workload. We observe that lot splitting does not occur due 
to fixed processing time to operate tasks.  
 
In this paper, we combine the processing time of each drug required on each resource and develop a model to assign 
tasks to resources by considering resource capacity.  To implement the solution, a sequence of tasks on each machine 
must be considered.  Task scheduling should be studied in the future.

Abstract 
The electrification of transportation has been identified as a necessary aspect of climate change mitigation in order to 
limit global temperatures to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and prevent potentially catastrophic effects on the 
environment (Thorne & Hughes 2019). With the Electrified Vehicles (EVs) ventures being in the early stage, the cost-
benefit analysis of the vehicles is key towards capturing the Indonesian market. As consumers, however, pricing may 
not only be the costs they consider; they also consider the total cost of ownership (TCO) of the cars they purchase. 
The TCO model incorporated the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP), tax, fuel cost, charging cost, 
maintenance cost, and residual value including depreciation. This study aims to compare the value of total cost of 
ownership of electric and conventional cars in Indonesia related to the relevant switching cost between EVs and ICEV. 
In this study it was concluded that the TCO value in HEV is smaller than BEV and ICEV. So that hybrid vehicles will 
be the most efficient car to have when driving long distances

1. Introduction
Global warming has become a central issue in recent decades, because it poses a multidimensional threat to ecology, 
environment, economy and society (Setiawan et al. 2022). Community knowledge has an influence that can affect 
awareness of environmental impacts (Wibowo et al. 2022). So the trend of clean energy has been increasing in the 
world since the Paris Agreement which proposed that each country is responsible for keeping the global average 
temperature rising below 2 °C (Huda et al. 2019). The International Energy Agency creates scenarios that recommend 
mitigation, countermeasures and actions to reduce the concentration of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere to below 
450 ppm by limiting the use of fossil fuels (Huda et al. 2019). 
Electric vehicles (EV) have been identified as the best way to reduce emissions in the transportation sector (Ayetor et 
al. 2022). The International Energy Agency supports sales of hybrid cars and EVs which are projected to increase to 
around 40% by 2030 (Huda et al. 2019). The number EV is increasing due to rising oil and gas prices and advances 
in battery technology (Huda et al. 2018). About 22 countries in the world, such as the United States (US) and the 
European Union have promised either on the sale of complete internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEV) or a sales 
target of 100% zero emission vehicles by 2050. By 2020, the global electric vehicle fleet grew to 10 million with 
around 370 different models but only representing 1% share of the world’s vehicle fleet. Most of the EVs are 
concentrated in a few places such as China (45%), Europe (24%) and the United States (22%) (Ayetor et al. 2022). 
The annual growth rate of EVs increases significantly due to their favorable characteristics compared to ICEVs. These 
advantages include high efficiency, low maintenance, environmentally friendly, especially when combined with 
renewable energy sources. In addition, several studies have shown other benefits of electric vehicles, namely that they 
can be used as energy storage in power systems. They can release energy into the tissues when needed to balance 
tension (Huda et al. 2019). Several challenging research studies and opportunities for EV improvement when

5.3 Maintenance Cost (M) 
Mx is the maintenance and repair cost for 8 years use. For this point of view, EV’s Nissan Leaf become the lowest 
cost vehicle with Rp. 4,239,756.00. This is understandable because as newcomer type of car, it equipped by 
maintenance free cost until 43,496 miles. Fig. 3 shows comparison of vehicle maintenance and repair cost of 8 years.

5.4 Future Cost of Charging/Fuel (Ec) 
Rx is the resale value after 8 years. Fig. 4 below shows that the car with the highest resale value is Mazda CX5 vehicle 
with Rp. 357,619,621.91, followed by Nissan Leaf with Rp. 319,814,705, and the lowest resale value is Nissan Kicks 
with Rp. 212,402,493.60. However, compared to the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP), the lowest 
depreciation expected based on caredge.com is Mazda CX5 with around 40.17%, followed by Nissan Leaf with the 
depreciation around 56.07%, and car with the highest depreciation is Nissan Kicks with around 56.19%.

6. Conclusion 
We assess the total cost of ownership (TCO) of three different types of vehicles, namely ICEV (Mazda CX 5), HEV 
(Nissan Kicks), and BEV (Nissan Leaf) according to conditions prevailing in Indonesia over a period of 8 years. In 
the current situation in Indonesia, we find ICEV's TCO 7% higher than BEV and 15% higher than HEV. The biggest 
advantage that HEV has is that it costs 56.19% less cost of charging/fuel than ICEV. We found a price differential 
between fuel and electricity which shows that it is critical to keep the price differential at some level for BEVs to be 
highly competitive. The TCO of HEVs is lower than BEVs up to year 8 due to the low initial purchase price of HEVs. 
The tax cost component proves that BEV is 83.9% cheaper than ICEV. Tax waivers should extend to both new and 
used EVs to further increase their TCO advantage. In this combination it can be concluded that the total cost of 
ownership of HEV is still the lowest compared to BEV and ICEV. In other words, a hybrid vehicle will be the most 
efficient car to own for long distance driving.

Abstract 
When firms are in an information sharing alliance, the amount of information that the firms provide may vary due to 
multiple factors, such as size, technology investment capacity, and the information security environment for the firm. 
Hence, in many cases even the well-intended firms are unable to share the same level of information as they receive 
from other firms. We refer to such a situation as asymmetric information sharing. Given this setting, information 
sharing alliances are confronted with the challenges of maintaining a fair information sharing environment, which 
would ensure proportional returns for firms in the alliance. In the current practice, firms are typically charged a 
membership fee by Information Sharing and Analysis Centers for participating in information sharing activities. 
However, the application of a membership fee does not totally address the problems that may arise due to asymmetric 
information sharing. First, the level of membership fee being charged does not reflect the level of information provided 
or received by individual firms. Second, no monetary compensation to firms that share more information is provided, 
which forms a barrier for continuous information sharing. Lastly, the membership fees for ISACs do not consider the 
willingness to pay attitudes of firms that may prefer to purchase information from other firms. In this study we aim to 
address these issues by seeking answers to the following research questions: (1) What fair price should a firm pay 
participating information sharing in asymmetric sharing environment? and, (2) How would the price of information 
vary under different pricing strategies and other influencing factors? To this end, we develop analytical expressions 
of a firm’s payoffs under an asymmetric information sharing environment. We also analyze the pricing of information 
as a function of a firm’s technology investment level, its information sharing level, and the marginal cost of 
information sharing.

Abstract 
Indonesia as a muslim majority country makes the mosques plays big part of the society. Activities other than prayer 
are also held in the mosques. Therefore, the electrical energy consumption can be consumptive and inefficient if they 
are not properly managed. Also with the tropical climate of Indonesia where the humidity is high makes achieving 
thermal comfort more difficult for the air conditioner, it also makes the energy consumption much higher. In this 
particular research, we aimed to analyze the energy consumption in some mosques in Indonesia and give a 
recommendation on how to reduce the electrical energy consumption. By managing the energy and conserving the 
energy to achieve efficiency in mosques.

1. Introduction
With the climate change threat getting more and more imminent by day. The human race has been called to strengthen 
their sustainable solutions. Energy has been one of the most proficient factors in sustainable development. Effective 
energy management should be conducted in every sector in order to fight against climate change. Energy management 
itself is considered as a system that helps an organization in controlling, monitoring and managing energy related 
activities to improve energy efficiency. The need for energy management does not focus solely on the industrial sector 
but also in the public sector (Antunes et al. 2014; Thollander & Palm 2015). Public facilities such as transportation 
hubs, market, sporting venues, and also worship places also need energy management due to its variance in energy 
consumption and since it is public it also needs energy efficiency. 
In general, energy use can be minimized by saving energy and efficiency. Some examples of energy saving are 
reducing the use of some electrical equipment that is not really needed, while examples of energy efficiency are using 
electrical equipment according to a predetermined time and utilizing other sources such as the sun and so on. 
According to Ainul (2016), energy management can be said to be successful if there is a reduction in energy costs for 
operating facilities and equipment and reducing maintenance costs. In addition, energy management will also reduce 
the impact on the environment and CO2 emissions so that it will make a significant contribution to the activities and 
financing of a building or various public facilities such as mosques. 
Low energy efficiency leads to the high production costs, increasing the production costs and reducing the 
competitiveness of enterprises, also raising the expenses for public utility payment as for the population and budgetary 
organizations (Shirrime & Trubaev  2017). So the adoption of green practices into business operations becomes an 
important issue in many organizations. It is important to develop long-term strategies and to set quantifiable targets 
for energy saving (Johansson & Thollander 2018). The successful implementation of energy strategy includes a 
combination of the implementation of energy-efficient technology together with successful energy management 
practices (Cibinskiene et al. 2020). Mosque, which become the central part of Islam culture that demanded to be 
supported by high-quality building or architecture artifacts, is one of public building which needs a suitable energy

It is proven that these strategies can reduce the cooling energy consumption in mosques from 23% up to 36% of the 
total energy consumption. Therefore, these steps can be trialed in other mosques as well (Budaiwi & Abdou, 2013). 
 
Energy Saving for Lighting 
As mosque is a building to provide place for worshippers to pray and active for 24 hour, and lightings become second 
biggest energy consumption, it is necessary to conduct further study to increase efficiency for lighting system for 
mosque. The smart LED lighting systems have received attention in both research communities and industry as an 
efficient means of energy conservation. In order to provide minimal energy consumption and satisfy users’ 
requirements for illumination level, the smart LED system can control and manage the overall illumination in the 
indoor space by considering that the LED lamps have the possibility to be dimmed (Petkovic et al. 2022). Automation 
also can be applied by using LED lamps with motion sensors on the prayer area. The motion sensor has been a priority 
rather than a light sensor because the usage of the prayer area depends on the activities and not on the light conditions 
(Harsritanto et al. 2021). Energy saving in lighting can also be done by reducing illuminance with slow and limited 
dimming,  providing smaller ranges of available illuminances, having a low anchor point for manually dimmable 
fixtures, providing energy conservative default settings, like lighting automatically switched off and shading pulled 
up, providing available and tangible lighting and shading control interfaces (Gentile 2022). 
 
Water System Operational Management 
In order to reduce the energy consumption by the water system there is an option to install motion sensor in the tap 
water to reduce the water waste from the ablution activity. By installing a motion sensor in the water tap, it can 
reduce the flow of the water during the ablution (Harsritanto et al., 2021). This could prevent the water from being 
wasted during the ablution and may imply towards the energy consumption. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This paper presents an energy consumption analysis among mosques in Indonesia. Data on energy usage, active hours, 
and monthly electricity bills have been obtained from four mosque sample in certain places in Indonesia. The findings 
were evaluated to find equipment with highest electricity usage. From four mosques, equipment with highest energy 
usage is air conditioner, followed by lighting. To reduce electricity consumption, improvement can be done by 
controlling the usage hour of air conditioner according to visitor behavior and conduct automation for turning the air 
conditioner on and off. Lighting system as second highest energy usage can also be operated efficiently by applying 
automated LED lighting system and utilize direct sunlight during the day.

Abstract 
This study presents the use of collaborative intervention to reduce the depression and anxiety of students with learning 
difficulties. Specifically, it aims to find out what effective intervention could be proposed, and what factors could 
differentiate the status of the students’ depression and anxiety after the collaborative intervention has been conducted. 
The depression and anxiety were measured using the 25-item Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCAD) 
short version. The quantitative method was used for the numerical facts gathered through the child’s self-assessment 
and parent observation rating reports. On the effectiveness of the conducted intervention, the Quasi-Experimental was 
used with the pre and post-test design. Contextualized intervention lessons were made and conducted collaboratively 
by the teachers and parents with the support of the barangay health workers. Results of the students’ self-assessments 
and parents’ observation ratings were found to be higher for both depression and anxiety before the conduct of the 
intervention and found to be lower after the intervention has been conducted. The gain revealed in the posttest has 
proved that the use of collaborative intervention has a significant impact on reducing the depression and anxiety of 
students with learning difficulties.

1. Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a tremendous effect on education. The two-year implementation of blended 
learning modality – modular, online, and radio-based has been found to be wanting for the students to acquire 
proficiency in the learning competencies expected of them. Thus, when face-to-face classes for the school year 2022-
2023 resumed, students at all levels have been found to have learning gaps making them feel unprepared to enter their 
next grade level due to their lack of readiness academically. Jiang et al. (2022) found that the stress brought to families 
by the COVID-19 pandemic has a significant adverse effect on children’s education because it caused depression 
among them and ultimately affects their academic performance.  Rao et al. (2021) highlighted the report of the 
American Psychological Association which states that “nearly 81% of Gen Z teens, ages 13 to 17, experience more 
intense stress in schooling due to COVID-19.” They further stated that several recent investigations have confirmed 
the technological challenges and psychological impact of the pandemic on students in different countries (p.9). With

6. Conclusion  
The manifestation of depression and anxiety is common to learners at the secondary level, more so to those with 
learning difficulties. Schools should have a way of helping them and providing them at once with appropriate and 
effective interventions. Valid and reliable tools to assess the symptoms of depression and anxiety among students are 
necessary. A school’s harmonious working relationship with parents and the community is a good way of knowing 
what the students are going through in life and how they could work together to help them overcome their depression 
and anxiety.  
 
The gain revealed in the post-self-assessment of students and-parent observation ratings have proved that the use of 
collaborative intervention has a significant difference in reducing the depression and anxiety of students with learning 
difficulties. The participation of students in class discussions and social skills were also improved as reported by the 
teachers. In addition, interviews with the school heads, parents, and barangay health workers revealed an improvement 
in the working partnerships of the school, family, and community. They confirmed that they were able to establish 
good camaraderie and with that, they feel more comfortable working with one another. Parents likewise reported that 
their relationships with their children improved, and their family bonds become stronger after their engagement in this 
study. In conclusion, the objectives presented in this study are achieved. The proposed and conducted intervention is 
effective. Valid and reliable tools, appropriate intervention, systematic processes, and strong collaboration are the key 
factors for this undertaking.  
 
It is hoped that more students will be benefited from this study not only those with learning difficulties but all students 
in general. The Department of Education, along with the Department of Health and the Local Government Units 
should work together in providing necessary psychological support and services to schools. Necessary funds from the 
government should be allocated for this purpose. Institutions or offices should establish a caring and family-like 
working environment to promote mental wellness among workers and employees thus, creating an impact on the 
quality of services and wholesome dealings with the clientele. This mental health practice, in a way, would create a 
ripple effect in the community and the family where the adolescents belong. Further studies on reducing and managing 
depression and anxiety among other groups of students or individuals are encouraged.

Abstract 
Organizations suffer economic losses from operational disruptions (see Rice and Caniato 2003, Chopra and Sodhi, 
2004 Greising and Johnsson 2007, Essuman et al. 2020, Haraguchi and Lall  2015, Pettit et al. 2013). Thus, there is a 
pressing imperative to determine alternative modalities of enhancing the operational resilience of organizations that 
will allow firms to become “naturally” more tolerant to operational disruptions. In ecosystem research, functional 
diversity, functional redundancy, response diversity and adaptive capacity have been argued and proved to promote 
ecosystem stability, resilience and tolerance against natural and anthropogenic perturbations (see Nystrom and Folke, 
2001; Folke et al.  2002; Mouillot et al. 2005; De Bello et al. 2007; Naeem 1998; Galland et al.  2020; Walker 1995;

Owing to ecological thinking which supposes that organizational ecosystems function similarly as biological systems 
(Mars et al. 2012), it is hypothesized that firms can similarly leverage on functional trait diversity to enhance their 
potential operational resilience. To substantiate such postulation, this paper presents a biomimetic framework for 
qualifying and quantifying the functional trait diversity and adaptive capacity of organizations for the purpose of 
drawing insights that may prove useful in fortifying a firm’s posture against operational disruption.

1. Introduction
The financial impact of operational disruptions 
Operational Disruptions refer to events that interrupt the regular delivery of goods and services within a system 
(Blackhurst et al. 2011) The estimated daily economic loss due to operational disruption ranges from $50 to $100 
million (Rice and Caniat 2003). Ericsson reported a $400 million loss due to a 10-minute fire incident in one of the 
plants of its chip supplier, Philips (Chopra and Sodhi 2004) while Boeing 787 Dreamliner program lost roughly $2.5 
billion loss due to the inability of Advanced Integration Technology to deliver supplies (Greising and Johnsson, 2007). 
(Essuman et al.  2020) cited that Honda, Toyota, and Nissan halted their operations due to a Tsunami that hit Japan in 
2011 (Haraguchi and Lall, 2015) where Toyota lost an estimated $72 million per day (Pettitet al. 2013). Similarly, 
Tesla, Ford, and Nissan had to halt production in China in 2020 due to the COVID-19 outbreak where Apple suffered 
a US$34 billion loss in its market value during the same period (Essuman et al. 2020). This paper recognizes the 
debilitating impact of operational disruption on the financial viability of firms and hereby proposes an approach to 
evaluating a firm’s potential operational resilience based on its functional trait diversity—a characteristic exemplified 
by ecosystems to withstand natural and anthropogenic perturbations. 
The Research Imperative: An Ecological Approach to Examining Operational Resilience 
To readily react to operational disruptions, incidents, crises and disasters, many organizations have made Business 
Continuity Management (BCM) an integral part of their resilience planning (Charoenthammachoke et al. 2020). 
However, business continuity plans (BCP) are not infallible and are susceptible to all forms of failure (see Grimaldi, 
2002). It is therefore worth investigating, what alternative modalities of enhancing operational resilience can firms 
employ that diminishes their dependence on BCP? More specifically, what can firms deliberately alter to improve 
their posture against operational disruptions? Considering that for centuries mankind has mimicked nature to solve

Abstract 
The Manufacturing Industry is not only required to continue to increase productivity but must fulfill products that are 
environmentally friendly both in terms of raw materials, processes and finished products must produce impacts that 
do not damage the environment. The purpose of this paper is to explore and present the relationship between lean 
manufacturing and sustainability manufacturing. Specifically focusing on identifying and analyzing existing literature 
to see gaps and see future research opportunities. This paper also looks at lean manufacturing from a TBL (Triple 
Bottom Line) perspective, namely an economic, social and environmental perspective.

1. Introduction
Over the past few years, there has been increasing pressure on organizations to manage production
processes responsibly to improve their environmental and social performance (Siegel et al.  2019). In the
manufacturing industry, almost all manufacturing industry players are now taking steps to commit to
sustainability, especially in operations and following their own methodologies to achieve their respective
company's sustainability goals (Gupta et al.  2018). To eliminate waste, streamline processes, and increase
added value, it is important for contemporary manufacturing organizations to implement lean
manufacturing and of course this concept is beneficial for achieving sustainable benefits (Ben Ruben et al.
2019). Company leaders are also not only required to increase financial strength and social benefits but
there is an urgent need to reduce the negative environmental impact of manufacturing industrial activities,
one of the systems for implementing quality improvement, namely lean manufacturing (Yadav et al. 2020).
Lean manufacturing has proven its positive effect on operational and economic performance in many cases
and there is awareness about sustainability with the Triple Bottom Line approach, namely economic growth,
environmental preservation, and social responsibility (Henao et al. 2019). In the context of lean
manufacturing and sustainable manufacturing as the chosen topics, it is necessary to conduct a literature
review to see the linkages and help guide future research. The concept of lean manufacturing has been
carried out from various previous studies to analyze issues related to sustainable manufacturing, for this
reason this paper aims to see and describe opportunities for future research.
2. Methods
The aim of this article is to get an overview of the interrelationships between lean manufacturing and
sustainable manufacturing in the future. Specifically focusing on identifying and analyzing existing

Abstract 
Driving safety is the driver's top priority when traveling. This is often done by using a means of transportation, 
namely a car, meaning that cars often have accidents in traffic, especially on freeways. This study aims to identify 
what variables were used by previous researchers in measuring the relationship between variables related to 
driving safety on the freeway; this is very closely related to driver habits and can be examined using the Driver 
Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ). The preparation of each question in the questionnaire has followed the standard 
questions in the preparation of the DBQ. This is what researchers hope to be able to do to analyze the variables 
needed for driving safety more quickly. The method used is a statistical analysis method that aims to provide an 
overview of the appropriate variables when researching driving safety cases. The results of the study show that 
there are 4 variables that are often used in research on driving behavior: aggressive violations, ordinary violations, 
errors, and deviations. These variables are often used in driving safety research.

1.Introduction
Accidents in driving are one of the causes of loss for those who experience them. This causes physical losses and 
can hinder the country's economic growth. Traffic accidents, especially on toll roads, are increasingly the main 
cause of death. One of the causes of accidents is driving behavior with a driving attitude that is not in accordance 
with applicable regulations, one of which is driving a vehicle at a speed that is not in accordance with the 
regulations. Accidents can be reduced by looking for factors that cause them. Studying these factors really helps 
drivers prepare for driving and is what is needed for researchers to find out how to reduce the occurrence of 
accidents. One tool that can be used is to measure the components of the accident by using the Driver Behavior 
Questionnaire (DBQ), which focuses on finding relationships between the involvement of the driver and the 
accident that occurred, namely by analyzing several characteristics of the driver and several variables related to 
accidents such as violations, errors, and irregularities (Jadaan, K et al. 2021). 
Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) is the most well-known tool for assessing road user behavior; it is a tool in 
the form of a questionnaire for assessing risky road behavior. Recent research has raised several variables related 
to driving behavior. The Driver Behavior Questionnaire (DBQ) is known to assess risky road behavior among 
vehicle drivers. Problem behavior is a major determinant for safety outcomes in traffic. There are several findings 
that support the development of an instrument in this questionnaire that has been validated to assess at-risk drivers. 
taking into account drivers' task conditions before they drive, as per previous research supported by occupational 
researchers working in various corporate industries (Sergio, A et al. 2021). 
Several studies have been carried out previously, including research on aggressive drivers. Behavior like breaking 
the rules on the toll road becomes a driver's habit, and this can certainly increase the risk of an accident, for 
example, intentional driving violations or driving skills that are not in accordance with driving rules, where both 
of these factors can endanger road users. Besides these two factors, there are also factors of irregularities and 
driving errors (Davey, J et al. 2007). 
Of all the accidents that have occurred on highways, the driver behavior factor is the highest factor among several 
factors, namely vehicle speed, driver behavior, and perception. For that, one of the intervention programs to reduce 
the number of accidents in the group is to run public service ads that aim to increase the perception of fear.

test was carried out using the split-half method. Both of these values can indicate that the questionnaire is reliable 
if the results of the questionnaire assessment have a value of more than 0.7 (Reason 2000).  
This study was conducted using the DBQ Driver Behavior Questionnaire, which is widely accepted for analyzing 
driving behavior and has been recognized by the same researchers. Conducting surveys and asking how they 
behave is the simplest way to measure behavior effectively. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on the surveyed 
data showed that the categories of violation, error, and ignorance gave high scores for driving behavior. 
Furthermore, the reliability and validity of the model were tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), which 
is also suitable for predicting behavior. The findings of this study emphasize a closer look at the DBQ as a popular 
and suitable instrument for analyzing accident rates.  
The results of the analysis show that violations, errors, and ignorance can be significantly influenced by the nature 
of road users and driving experience. Drivers are younger and have less driving experience; they report 
inappropriate behavior. As we get older, the tendency for aggressive offenses increases, and the adrenaline rush 
also increases. However, drivers over the age of 45 showed the best driving maturity of any age. Male drivers 
reported significantly more violations, errors, and ignorance than female drivers. This is due to the experience of 
male drivers and the higher percentage of female drivers. Professional men who travel long distances per year are 
more courageous in their rides. The study also revealed that women are relatively safer drivers than men because 
they commit more mistakes than violations. Long-distance trips by drivers often result in fatigue problems such 
as difficulty focusing, little attention, drowsiness, loss of concentration, and constant yawning, which can 
significantly harm the driver. This greatly affects the mental processing and decision-making abilities of the driver. 
Workers and business people make more mistakes and violations; this needs to be addressed in further studies 
(Gupta  et al.  2021). 
6. Conclusion
The conclusions obtained from the results of the research that has been carried out are in determining the variables 
contained in the DBQ obtained from several initial studies including: there are actions that are most often carried 
out by motorists, namely sounding the horn when disturbed by other road users, overtaking / overtaking other 
motorists from left lane, and realized that I don't really remember the path I just walked which was categorized as 
lapses, ordinary violations, and errors respectively. While the actions that were rarely performed were getting 
angry at other drivers and chasing the drivers to scold them and driving while drunk were categorized as 
Aggressive Violation and Error respectively. 
Another result is that the most common driving violations are ordinary violations or intentional violations. While 
the highest form of violation committed is exceeding the speed limit on the road, Based on correlation analysis, it 
was found that driving experience has a moderate correlation with driver behavior in the form of violators, while 
the number of accidents experienced by drivers has a low correlation with traffic violations by drivers. 
Differences in distance characteristics also affect the level of alertness when driving, while driver behavior has 
almost the same character. Shorter mileage sometimes creates a less alert effect, but the reality is that drivers with 
closer mileage are more alert than those with longer distances. The level of fatigue in driving can be one of the 
factors that can reduce the level of alertness. Longer distances with work that is done repeatedly can cause fatigue 
more quickly. 
 Determining the factors and aspects that influence driver behavior in driving with DBQ based on research and 
information regarding the factors that influence risky driving behavior are as follows:  
a. Aggressive violations: have a relationship with aggressive interpersonal opinions.
b. Ordinary violations: These violations do not have an aggressive purpose but are still intentionally committing
opinion violations.
c. Errors or mistakes are deviant behavior or mistakes made unintentionally.
d. Lapses or deviations are a reflection of behavior related to memory problems and attention to opinions.
In the calculations using the DBQ, it was found that the results showed that the driver's assessment of their driving 
skills was reflected in their driving behavior, namely deviant driving. Additional studies can be conducted using
qualitative methods such as focus group interviews to gain greater insight into thinking and behavioral motivation. 
In practice, research findings can support the development of a targeted DBQ aimed at addressing factors
contributing to accidents. Leveraging DBQ and other assessment tools can provide a proactive organizational
method to investigate the types of behavior exhibited by drivers and identify specific behaviors associated with
violations. Significantly, the use of these measures can help develop a DBQ suitable for professional drivers that

aims to reduce the likelihood of an accident before it happens. Improvements to DBQ items can also make it easier 
for researchers to find out the basics and reasons for drivers to commit violations (Gupta  et al.  2021).

Abstract 
The prime essence of this paper is to identify the drivers of Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM) and 
determine the barriers to its implementation in the Ethiopian manufacturing sector. Studies related to SSCM mainly 
from 2010 onwards are reviewed, analysed and discussed using exploratory and meta-synthesis analyses. The findings 
indicate that there is an absence of a clear connection between SSCM practices and performance among the 
manufacturing industries in Ethiopia. This creates a hindrance for manufacturing firms in Ethiopia seeking to 
implement SSCM.

1. Introduction
In the past few decades, manufacturing firms are greatly concerned about sustainability due to the immediate impact
on their performance (Ortas et al. 2014a). Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) helps businesses raise
productivity, enhance product quality, comply with regulations, achieve competitiveness, gain access to new markets,
boost employee satisfaction and motivation, enhance public relations, and enhance brand recognition (Hsu et al. 2013).
Ortas et al. (2014a) argue that the usefulness of SSCM practices in financial terms promotes the implementation of
sustainable practices in companies’ supply chains. Ortas et al. (2014a) further highlight a conflicting assessment of
the relationship between sustainable supply chain performance and companies’ financial performance. One of the
assessments is that the best financial performers have more resources available to invest in improving their sustainable
supply chain performance. Another differing assessment is that companies that increase their sustainable supply chain
performance through their commitment to environmental, economic, and social concerns improve their financial
performance. This assessment validates addressing environmental, economic, and social issues as part of corporate
strategy can generate new opportunities for competition, as well as new ways of adding value and improving long-
term financial performance.
For supply chain participants or actors to stay part of the supply chain, environmental sustainability and empowerment
(social) sustainability criteria must be met, while competitiveness is expected to be the outcome of satisfying consumer 
wants and doing associated economic sustainability actions (Seuring et al. 2008). SSCM performance is highly
dependent on the provision of dedicated leadership and employees (Pandey et al., 2021). Support from the managerial
level, as well as employees’ motivation, drives internal organizational procedures to implement effective SSCM
strategies (Emamisaleh and Taimouri 2021). The study from Emamisaleh and Taimouri (2021) shows that if SSCM
practices are amalgamated with the strategies of a company it yields positive impacts on the firm’s operational
performance.
According to Nayak and Dhaigude (2019) financial constraints, organizational management support, competition,
culture, infrastructure, and planning and execution are the most influencing independent variables while people,
customer acceptance, government support, supplier acceptance, and external stakeholder are identified as outcome
variables in the implementation of SSCM. Govindan et al. (2020) examined the Natural Resource Based View
(NRBV) on the supply chain and argues that environmentally sensitive operations and practices in the supply chain

Abstract 
Machine learning models have shown high prediction accuracy as a result of their freedom from the limitations of data 
distribution assumptions in classical statistical methods, non-compliance with which leads to incorrect and inaccurate 
results. One of the most important applications of machine learning is to predict the severity of traffic crashes according to 
a number of independent factors related to the crash. This paper aims to compare four machine learning methods: logistic 
regression, k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, and random forests. More than 40,000 crashes occurred in Riyadh, Saudi 
Arabia, during 2012-2016 were used. It was found that Decision Trees and Random Forests are the best algorithms in terms 
of accuracy, and the logistic regression is the weakest. The type of crash was the most important factor to the crash severity, 
followed by the time of crash. On the other hand, the number of parties involved in the crash and the lighting condition 
were the lowest.

1. Introduction
The interest in studying traffic crashes and their consequences has grown in recent years as the number of traffic crashes 
has increased due to increased urbanization and car use around the world. According to a World Health Organization report 
from 2018, the number of people killed in traffic crashes has risen to more than 1.35 million (de Groot 2018). These 
statistics prompted traffic specialists and decision-makers to look for analytical methods to improve road safety. One of 
which is identifying factors related to the risk of injury to the parties involved in the crash (Santos 2021). Predicting the 
severity of crash can be used by three main parties: transportation safety engineers who want to predict the costs of crash 
in the coming years, hospitals and emergency health care providers who need to anticipate the severity of the injury so that 
they can provide appropriate medical care in advance, and insurance companies whose customers' premiums are determined 
by a number of factors including the costs of the traffic crash (Iranitalab and Khattak 2017). 
Traditional statistical methods have been widely used in traffic safety research, in which models provide good indicators 
of collision probability and facilitate results interpretation (Iranitalab and Khattak 2017). However, main attributes of crash 
data frequently lead to methodological limitations that are not fully considered, and these techniques are subject to strict 
assumptions about data distribution and predetermined relationships that may not be valid, resulting in erroneous estimates 
and incorrect conclusions (Iranitalab and Khattak 2017, Chakraborty 2021). Machine learning techniques have emerged as 
a new method for analysing traffic crash data to address this issue. Machine learning techniques are distinguished by their 
computational power and the absence of the need for assumptions about the fundamental relationships between variables. 
Public authorities are the primary source of traffic crash data used in the development of predictive models (Al-
Mistarehi,2022). However, some of these data sets have an imbalance problem because the number of crashes resulting in 
death or serious injury is much lower than the number of crashes resulting in minor injuries or property damage, and thus 
it influences negatively the accuracy of the model (i.e. increases the bias). 
1.1 Objectives 
This paper makes use of four machine learning algorithms in predicting the severity of traffic crashes: logistic regression, 
K-nearest neighbor, decision trees, and random forest. In Section Two, the paper presents some highlights of previous

As can be seen, both Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms scored the highest accuracy at all levels of crash 
severity, compared to the other two algorithms. The K-nearest neighbor ranked second in the levels of injury and 
death, while it was last in the level of PDO. The Logistic Regression ranked last in the levels of injuries and deaths 
while it was ranked second in the level of PDO. The most important depended variables were found for the type, 
timing, and cause of the crash. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Classification of crashes based on their severity is critical in order to use appropriate data in a crash cost analysis. 
Moreover, in crash severity analysis, accurate prediction models are necessary to classify crashes based on their 
severity. In this work, statistical and machine learning algorithms are used to build models that predict crash severity 
at four different levels such as PDO, minor injury, severe injury, and fatality. Four models were implemented: logistic 
regression, K-nearest neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forests on crash dataset for the city of Riyadh covering four 
years 2012-2016. 13 independent variables were used in the four models. Each mode gives different results. The 
findings can be summarized in the following: 
 
1- Based on statistical testing, we may deduce that accidents with significant injuries are the most common patterns 
of accident severity, and that most accidents with serious injuries occur on straight highways. Fires in vehicles are the 
greatest cause of fatalities and serious injuries. In exchange for a minimal impact of these factors on accidents resulting 
in mild injuries. 
2- Although the logistic regression model had the lowest accuracy rate of the four models, the confusion matrix test 
revealed a high number of positive correct hypotheses, indicating that the model's forecast of the selected hypothesis 
was right. 
3- K-nearest neighbor was the second lowest model in term of accuracy with 0.974.The test data recorded a relatively 
stable accuracy level from the fourth neighbor to the eighth neighbor, with a slight decrease at the fifth and sixth 
neighbors. 
4- Both the decision tree and the random forest recorded the best accuracy of 0.976. Entropy and Gini measures were 
used to construct the decision trees. Using the significance scale, the type and timing of the incident ranked first. 
In conclusion, this research provides valuable insights into the application of machine learning algorithms in crash 
severity predictive models. The findings of this research demonstrate that the proposed models outperform traditional 
statistical methods and achieve high accuracy in predicting crash severity. Furthermore, this research provides a novel 
approach to predicting crash severity by incorporating multiple factors, including weather, road conditions, and 
vehicle type, into the prediction process. This makes the proposed models a valuable contribution to the field of road 
safety and offers a potential solution for reducing the number of fatal crashes on our roads. The results of this research 
will serve as a reference for future studies and can be applied in real-world situations to reduce the risk of crashes and 
improve road safety. In comparison to previous related work, this research provides a more comprehensive and 
sophisticated approach to predicting crash severity and makes an additive value by offering a data-driven solution for 
mitigating road crashes.

Abstract 
Disassembly process in reverse supply chain is one of crucial stage due to this process could change returned products 
into raw material that could be re-used on manufacturing process or sold to third party. This paper will be explained 
how aggregate planning is used to planned disassembly process. Aggregate planning is considered with an objective 
on how returned product is disassembled with manpower allocation to fulfilled demand of raw materials. Classical 
aggregate planning strategy was implemented either level or chase strategy. A case study in small medium enterprise 
that dealing with electronics device waste was observed. Phone and tablets as one of electronics device was considered 
as products to be examined. The disassembly process will be evaluated and some aggregate planning scenarios will 
be introduced to maximize disassembly units as well as minimize the disassembly process costs. The optimized 
scenarios where all returned product could be disassembled at minimum cost will be presented.

1. Introduction
A circular economy has pushed the frontiers of environmental sustainability by emphasizing the idea of transforming 
products in such a way that there are workable relationships between ecological systems and economic growth 
(Genovese, Acquaye, Figueroa, & Koh, 2017). For an example, resources are kept in use for as long as possible, 
extracting the maximum value from them whilst in use, then recovering and regenerating products and materials at 
the end of their life. In this context the concept of Reverse Supply Chain (RSC) has been developed as an adaptation 
of the circular economy principles to supply chain management (Butar Butar & Sanders, 2016). RSC also mentioned 
as the collaborative responsibility of both the producers and consumers to reduce the waste by recycling, 
remanufacturing, reusing, and properly disposing unacceptable products or items to enhance the environmental 
sustainability (Bouzon, Govindan, Rodriguez, & Campos, 2016; Govindan, Palaniappan, Zhu, & Kannan, 2012). 
Increasing attention has been given to the RSC due to the increasing value of products and technology at the end of 
direct supply chains as well as the impact of green legislation.  
The RSC is an essential part of sustainable supply chain management. It helps in reducing the quantity of waste sent 
to landfill by extracting maximum value out of the end of life/use products. It is essentially specifically in case of 
electronics returns, as there is a steady increase in the number of e-waste due to fast paced growth in technology 
(Mathiyazhagan et al., 2020). Collection of E-waste for reuse, recycling, remanufacturing and proper disposal of E-
waste has become a European law in 2003 (Georgiadis & Besiou, 2010). Product returns and their reverse supply 
chains represent an opportunity to create a value stream, not an automatic loss. Then, RSCs should be managed

6. Conclusion 
From an investigation of Company X, it was realized that returned products were received at shops or stores from 
customers. Entire returned product stored at the Company X to undergo disassembly process. The mathematical 
function described the total cost of disassembly in Company X. From the aggregate planning calculation, Company 
X still having available source for returned product. More returned product can be disassembled in company X, hence 
company X should collect more returned product. 
 
In the future, capability of worker concentration should be consider in the aggregate planning calculation.

Abstract 
Port logistics is a complex process involving numerous interconnected activities. Port logistics are inherently volatile, 
uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA). Due to VUCA, it is necessary to enhance port logistics performance in 
order to remain competitive on the market. Recently, the digital revolution has facilitated process improvement across 
all industries. In the age of Industry 4.0, this study also seeks to identify and analyze the barriers affecting the 
performance of port logistics. The research offers a novel strategy for developing an analytic hierarchical model for 
analyzing and ranking the barriers. Reviewing existing literature and conducting semi-structured interviews with port 
managers during the field visit helped to identify barriers. Further, Fuzzy Set Theory (FST), Stakeholders Theory, and 
Analytical Hierarchy Process were utilized in this study to rank the identified barriers. The framework categorizes the 
barriers as strategic, tactical, and operational. In addition, it assists managers in understanding the barriers, making 
informed decisions, and addressing the barriers that require immediate attention.

1. Introduction
Seaports have an impact on virtually every aspect of people's daily lives. It is evident by the fact that approximately 
90 percent of the world's goods are transported by sea. Using bulk carriers, container ships, and tankers, more than 8 
million tons of goods are transported by sea. The Marine Transportation System is comprised of six components: 
navigable waterways, terminals, vessels intermodal connections, and ports and shipping networks (Sarkar  et al. 2022). 
Figure 1 depicts a maritime transportation system with an interface between land and water. The fourth Industrial 
Revolution can increase port logistics' overall throughput. Simulation, autonomous robots, cybersecurity, 3D printing, 
the Internet of Things, big data, cloud computing, system integration, and augmented reality are the nine pillars of 
Industry 4.0. Numerous European nations have begun integrating their ports with Industry 4.0 (Sarkar and Shankar, 
2021). Due to the existing system's barriers, port industries are confronted with numerous problems and obstacles. 
Thus, it becomes vital to address the barriers which hinder the performance of port logistics in Industry 4.0 by 
categorizing and ranking it.  The study develops a model to identify, rank, and categorize port logistics barriers in the 
era of Industry 4.0. 
Port logistic barriers are responsible for disrupting the entire process and incurring enormous losses for port 
authorities, shipping companies, 3PL providers, etc. Due to its significance, the paper attempts to investigate the 
barrier and ranks them hierarchically. The research creates a framework to assist managers and port operators in 
overcoming the identified obstacles. The purpose of this study is to identify the barriers facing port logistics in the age 
of Industry 4.0. Multiple Stakeholders theory has been incorporated into the process of identifying barriers. Using the

5. Conclusion
In the global supply chain, port logistics play an important role in the transfer of goods. In the era of the fourth 
industrial revolution, ports are confronted with a number of obstacles during its implementation, which hinders the 
overall performance of port logistics. In the era of Industry 4.0, the research develops a hierarchical framework for 
ranking the port logistics obstacles. The study consists of two phases. In the era of Industry 4.0, the first phase entails 
identifying the various port logistics barriers. By conducting a field visit in one of India's major container handling 
ports and analyzing the available literature, barriers were identified. A workshop was held to collect the opinions of 
multiple port logistics stakeholders and to finalize the port logistics obstacles. In the second phase, Fuzzy-AHP was 
used to rank the barriers. Findings aid decision-makers in determining which obstacles require immediate attention. 
In addition, it facilitates the classification of barriers into three distinct categories based on their decision-making 
properties. In future research, subfactors of the obstacles could be identified and investigated. It is possible to conduct 
a sensitivity analysis of port logistics obstacles in the era of Industry 4.0.

Abstract
 
The presented research focuses on examining the influence of interruptions in online learning on student's 
perceptions and comprehension. We conducted an experiment with 45 participants. Each participant watched one 
lecture that belonged to one of the two experimental groups, a lecture with interruptions or a lecture without 
interruptions. While watching the lecture, the eye movements of the participants were recorded using an eye 
tracking device. After watching the lecture, the participants were asked to answer two questionnaires, knowledge 
questionnaire and subjective questionnaire. We found that interruptions do harm the comprehension of the 
delivered material when they occur and moreover, they cause an ""after affects"", harming the comprehension of 
the studied material even at times they do not occur at all. In addition, we found that interruptions attract the 
student's attention when they occur and at the same time causing a feeling of aversion and a desire to avoid 
focusing on them. Which may eventually cause negative subjective perceptions and to harm the understanding of 
the studied material. The world of online learning has developed a lot in 2020 and in fact the whole world has 
been forced to switch to online learning. Therefore, this technology must be optimized and improved.

Introduction 
A major global change happened during COVID-19 crises. The world population was required to maintain social 
distance, following medically instructed quarantine process. This situation had influence on many aspects, 
including the field of learning and the academic education. Face-to-face learning has been replaced by online 
learning, and educators need to change their setting (Katz & Kedem-Yemini 2021). The online learning is the new 
world's mode of learning and despite the new problems, there are lucrative sides to online teaching and learning 
(Dhawan, 2020). With the help of online teaching modes, educators can reach a large number of students at any 
time and in any part of the world, thus it increases accessibility, diversity and bridges gaps in world’s population. 
There is no doubt that online learning and teaching will remain with us long beyond the period of COVID-19. 
Therefore, it is important to examine the quality of online teaching and learning at this stage. 
Nowadays, in the context of education, there is a wide use of video conference software (VCS) such as Zoom, 
WebEx and Google Meet. These platforms enable participants to see each other and communicate orally though 
they are in separate locations. In these online learning environments, students watch and listen to the lecturer with 
presentations’ assistance. The level of knowledge and understanding of the material delivered in an online lecture

reflect the understanding of the studied material. This is contrary to the findings of Zhang et al. (2020) who found 
that the understanding of the studied material decreases when students do not know where to look and as a result 
they look more at the lecturer and less at the presentation. Zhang et al. (2020) believed that the students do not 
follow material delivered in the lecture and they may lose concentration in the lecture and their mind may be 
distracted from the content of the lecture. In addition, the findings of the linear regression contradict the findings 
of Sharafi et al. (2015) who found that a greater number of fixations on a certain stimulus indicates that the attempt 
to understand the information presented or explained in it is ineffective. It is possible that the differences between 
the findings were obtained due to the nature of dividing the screen of the lecture into AOIs. The division is 
reflected in the size of the area allocated to each area and its position on the screen.  
 
Accordingly, larger areas of interest cover a larger portion of the screen and as a result will be accompanied by a 
greater number of fixations. This possible explanation suggests that the size of the AOI has an effect on the number 
of fixations devoted to it. However, the linear regression findings consistent with the findings of Dupont et al., 
(2014) who found that a greater number of fixations on an AOI will increase the viewer's ability to understand 
and remember the material conveyed or explained there. This finding reinforces the claim of Dupont et al., (2014) 
because they suggested a linear relationship between the amount of fixations on the lecturer and the knowledge 
gained. As the number of fixations on the lecturer increases, a better understanding of the studied material is 
achieved, and the knowledge gain increases. This is in line with the Media Richness Theory (MRT) that claim 
that the ability to convey different types of communication cues simultaneously makes the communication richer 
and more effective (Daft & Lengel, 1986). Seeing the lecturer’s facial expressions adds to the understanding of 
his or her utterances.  
Summarizing the presented results brings us to the conclusions that interruptions during online learning have a 
negative effect on student’s attention. We can add to that that interruptions during online learning have a 
detrimental effect on the understanding of the course material. Another conclusion is related to the Zoom lecture 
setting. We can show that looking at the lecturer increases the understanding of the topic.  
 
5.4 Validation  
The validation process to the analysis shown in the Results section included the following steps: examination of 
missing values and errors, preliminary descriptive and frequencies statistics, reliability analysis (Alpha Cronbach), 
as 
needed 
grouping 
of 
variables 
and 
recoding.  
 
6. Conclusion  
In our study, we examined the way in which disturbances affect the students' subjective perceptions of learning 
and the understanding of the studied material. This research has theoretical and practical contributions. 
Theoretically, this research attempts to analyze new teaching setting with eye tracker device, and to join this data 
to the students’ understanding and satisfaction. This research also has developed measurements model that can be 
used in another similar research. It seems that the research in this field has only begun (Kedem-Yemini & Katz, 
2021). Mishra et al., (2020) claim that the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has led to a pedagogical shift to online 
learning that is gradually expected to replace the formal face-to-face learning system. Through a solid 
understanding of student's attitudes and the challenges they face in online learning, educational institutions will 
be able to develop different strategies to assist and optimize the learning system (Aguilera-Hermida 2020).  One 
of the main negative aspects of online learning mentioned among students is the occurrence of interruptions during 
learning (Hussein et al. 2020).  
 
In addition, we can specify practical recommendations, supported by our research findings. We will present three 
main practical applications emerged to optimize online learning.  
 
The first conclusion is that interruptions during online learning have a detrimental effect on student’s attention.  
Zhang et al. (2020) claim that most students are not even aware that they are distracted during a lecture. Lecturers 
teaching online must ensure a physical environment free of distractions and interruptions. They should close the 
door of the room where they are giving the lecture, and make sure that there are no unnecessary noises (for 
example by closing windows or devices that make noises). It is better to sit in an environment where there are not 
many objects in the background (such as decorations), and if there is no such area, lectures can and should use a 
minimalist digital background that does not overload visually. If there was an unplanned interruption during the 
teaching, the utterances said must be repeated.

The second is that interruptions during online learning have a detrimental effect on the understanding of the course 
material. We have found that there is a negative effect of interruptions in an online lecture on the understanding 
of the material being studied throughout the entire lecture and not only on the materials being studied while 
interruption occurs. Being aware that interruptions harm comprehension of the studied topic, we recommend that 
lecturers provide students with additional ways to understand the material taught in the lecture such as writing a 
lecture summary and opening a forum for questions. On top of that, if a background interruption occurred, the 
lecturer should ask the students if the utterances during the interruption are understood, and based on their 
feedback, he or she will know whether to repeat the things or move on with the rest of the lesson. 
The third is that it seems that looking at the lecturer increases the understanding of the materials he or she conveys. 
It is important that the students see the lecturer's face during the lecture. Lecturers are recommended to turn on 
their camera. Of course, it is not equivalent to the richest face-to-face communication, but certainly comes close.

Abstract 
Global energy consumption continues to grow, and the combined residential, commercial and industrial energy 
demand is projected to rise significantly in the future due to population and economic growth. There are many factors 
affecting the amount and timing of energy consumption. Climate and physical building characteristics (e.g., total floor, 
window type) are among the most critical factors that impact energy consumption. In terms of residential energy 
consumption, daily usage of different household appliances, demographic, and socio-economic factors such as family 
composition and income lead to different consumer profiles. Consumers’ daily life routines, habits, social life and 
energy-saving actions also shape energy consumption profiles in identical houses and over different times of the day.  
Additionally, trends in people’s lifestyles and the rise in remote working after the COVID-19 pandemic results in 
variations in overall residential energy consumption. From the commercial building and industrial energy consumption 
perspective, building characteristics, and type of commercial and industrial activities are driving forces of energy 
consumption dynamics. The aim of this study is to explore the main factors influencing residential, commercial and 
industrial energy consumption. A holistic approach will be utilized to draw a comprehensive picture by covering 
physical, social, demographic and environmental perspectives. This study will provide a basis for the researchers 
working on energy data analytics, energy consumer segmentation and energy-efficient solutions.

Abstract 
This research aims to find out the effect of green logistics practices on multinational firms' operational performance 
in Rwanda. The research aimed to evaluate the effect of a green warehouse on operational performance, determine the 
impact of green packaging on operational performance and estimate the impact of transportation methods on 
multinational company operational performance. The researchers used a quantitative research design to analyze the 
effects. Data were collected from 65 employees using a questionnaire survey and documentary review. To assess 
quantitative data, descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized to analyze data using SPSS. The findings reveal 
that green logistics methods are positively and significantly related to multinational construction operational 
performance. Furthermore, according to the correlation coefficients r=0.728, r=0.796, and r=0.841, there is a 
favourable association between green warehouse management, inventory management/green packaging, and 
operational performance in logistics practice. Furthermore, the study discovered by practicing green logistics, the 
firms boost efficiency and improve service quality, labor quality, and productivity. Given the importance of green 
logistics management practices in multinational corporation construction projects, stakeholders' risk analysis also is 
required to limit environmental and social damage to the local community caused by project activities.

Introduction
In recent decades, there has been an increase in demand for products and logistical services, resulting in a dramatic 
increase in the consumption of resources and energy as well as the emission of ecologically harmful gases and waste 
into the environment (Yingfei et al. 2022; Akyelken 2011). Globally, logistics and transportation service emissions 
account for 13% of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions (Yingfei et al. 2022). Green logistics is part of an 
organization's activities that aims to measure and reduce the environmental impact of logistical activities. Such 
measures are determined by the possibility of gaining a competitive advantage in the market required by clients (Larina 
et al. 2021). Traditionally, the main objective of logistics was to have the right amount of materials or products in the 
right place (Tian 2008) mostly in a linear way. However, a more contemporary concept, the circular economy 
incorporates logistics into reuse, remanufacturing, recycling, and trash disposal by developing a closed-loop supply

of supplies at scheduled intervals eliminated uncertainty and regular stockouts among the firms studied, thereby 
improving operational performance and productivity. 
 
Conclusions and Future Research Directions 
The purpose of this research was to determine the influence of green logistics practices in supply chains on the 
operational performance of multinational corporations in Rwanda between 2016 and 2021. The research explores the 
NELSAP-CU Rusumo project as a case study, with green Logistics Management practices as the independent variable 
and operational performance as the dependent variable. 
 
The research was led by three specific objectives: assessing the impact of green warehousing, determining the impact 
of green packing, and calculating the impact of green transportation methods on MNC operating performance in 
Rwanda. Green Warehouse Management (GWM) refers to a collection of activities that improve warehouse operations 
that protect the environment. Additionally, green logistics practices in supply chains may improve operational 
efficiency, promote cleaner production, and reduce environmental degradation. There is a need for firms, whether they 
are service or manufacturing to include green processes into their operations to cut costs and increase competitiveness. 
 
There is consequently a need for firms, whether they are service or manufacturing to include greening processes into 
their operations to cut operating costs and increase competitiveness. 
 
Not all organizations implement green logistics in warehousing, packaging, transportation, and distribution. 
Companies that do so do not completely embrace it due to the start-up expenses associated with establishing green 
logistics processes. Firms should consider green logistics as a potential benefit to maintain current and future success. 
The government must ensure that green logistics is followed and implemented in every organization by reinforcing 
existing environmental protection policies to all stakeholders. Researchers can conduct additional studies and research 
on various green logistics dimensions that affect operational success. This research assists managers in developing 
green logistics knowledge and abilities in addition to the existing knowledge and skills required to manage the 
company at all levels.

Abstract 
Enhancing industrial organizations’ responsiveness to market fluctuations is essential to survive current global supply 
chain challenges. Better responsiveness can be attained through robust and real-time production planning, especially 
on the tactical level through Aggregate Production Planning (APP) activities. A key variable in APP is workforce 
productivity enhancement. However, the dynamic nature of the workforce raises concerns about productivity 
improvement initiatives. To address this issue, the incorporation of organizational learning and social sustainability 
into APP has received significant attention from megacorps looking to increase competitiveness. This literature review 
assesses the prevalence of workforce productivity and social sustainability considerations in the APP problem. The 
review found that there is a limited number of studies that consider organizational learning in APP, and more research 
is needed to address the resilience of organizational learning evaluation models. Additionally, there is a lack of studies 
that focus on social sustainability measures in APP. Finally, it was observed that metaheuristic approaches are 
commonly used to solve complex APP problems, with genetic algorithms, harmony search algorithms, and simulated 
annealing being the most frequently employed methods. More research is needed to explore the use of other 
metaheuristic approaches and to assess their effectiveness in solving APP problems.

1.Introduction
Aggregate Production Planning (APP) is the medium-term capacity planning that determines the production plans 
required to meet customer demands (Sakallı et al. 2010). The APP problem generally aims to find the ideal production 
quantity considering inventory capacity and lowering cost employment level throughout a finite planning horizon 
(Cheraghalikhani et al. 2019). APP’s primary objective is to manage plant capacity to fit demand while considering 
lowering the costs and presence of limited financial resources (Khaled et al. 2022). A typical APP problem involves 
simplification of considered influencing factors, such as machine failures, workforce productivity, backorders, setup 
time, changeover time, and delivery lead time. 
In today’s challenging industrial environment, with the scarcity of raw materials, growing world demand, and 
environmental regulations, sustainability has become a top priority throughout the production processes. In addition, 
unexpected events (for example, COVID-19) causing disruptions to the global economy made industrial firms adopt 
and change plans and policies related to employee management. Such policies and plans aim for better workforce 
performance and a healthy, socially sustainable working environment that ensures work-life balance (Kumar & Suresh 
2009; Türkay et al. 2016). In this article, the term workforce includes all white and blue-collar staff and all other 
employees interfering with the product/service. 
Sustainability-based Aggregate Production Planning (SAPP) is derived from the commonly accepted definitions of 
sustainable development, sustainable manufacturing, and production planning. Zarte et al. (2022) define SAPP as “the 
planning of production activities to achieve conventional (economic) production goals, ensuring the enterprises’ 
951",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

complexity of APP problems, and many different metaheuristics have been applied for similar applications. However, 
more research is needed to fully understand its potential in solving APP problems, including the use of hybrid 
approaches.  
The incorporation of organizational learning into the APP model can contribute to cost reduction and optimized 
workforce management, while the consideration of social sustainability measures ensures a proper balance of human 
resources in production systems. Additionally, the use of metaheuristics ensures higher responsiveness to variable 
fluctuations in the planning system.  
This review has identified several potential future research directions to enhance the APP process. First, there is a 
need to investigate ways to further enhance the workforce learning effect through employee training, combining 
individual and organizational learning, and reducing the forgetting effect. Second, more research is needed to 
understand how organizational learning impacts different types of industries and how it changes over time according 
to the applied management model. Third, future research should investigate how organizational learning impacts all 
sustainability pillars throughout production systems and address a set of quantitative and qualitative social 
sustainability measures for each type of industry. Finally, there is a need to develop solution approaches that consider 
the uncertainty of variables. 
The conducted review has some limitations. Firstly, some articles related to the research field were not accessible to 
review. Secondly, the consideration of social sustainability in APP is assumed to be based on the common definitions 
of sustainable manufacturing and production planning as there is no standard definition. Finally, the in-depth analysis 
of the interrelation between social sustainability and organizational learning was not considered in this study.

Abstract 
The measurement for quality in a clinical laboratory is to deliver reliable patient results within a specific time frame. 
To do so, it always needs sufficient stock levels. Unfortunately, little attention is given to inventory management and 
a designated laboratory worker is assigned to do inventory management tasks. In order to optimize inventory 
management, principles should be implemented to plan for future demands, buffer for present stock shortage, eliminate 
obsolete stock and modernize the system to ease follow ups on orders and back orders for all relevant staff. An 
experimental approach was used where known principles and methods were applied to determine if the outcome would 
add value. Interviews with staff, historical data, and observations in terms of time and money were statistically 
analyzed. It was concluded that all principles, including modifying safety stock were valuable in optimizing inventory 
management. The amount of safety stock to carry should be determined by the balance between cost and services 
needed. The principles should be extended to the entire inventory and real-time receiving should be investigated and 
implemented for added improvement

Introduction 
In the laboratory environment, a designated laboratory worker is responsible for inventory management in addition to 
routine laboratory tasks. Inventory control in this particular laboratory has been very old fashioned, with no other 
formal training for materials management officers than using the company software to place orders, receive and issue 
stock. It is also difficult for managers and helpers to solve queries regarding outstanding orders, back orders, and stock 
levels. This issue, results in duplicate orders and a delay in following up on outstanding orders, because of the current 
system being on paper file. The responsible person is not always available to handle queries. Implementing an online 
document system could ease problem solving in terms of outstanding orders and stock on hand, as well as utilizing 
software available to improve time spend on inventory control.

These findings suggests that forecasting and re-order point increase effective stock management and real time issue 
by means of automation decrease time spend on materials management tasks. Transparency of the inventory system 
results in a more hands on approach by staff. 
Green engineering should be kept in mind with every new system or method implemented, in order to preserve 
resources and protect the environment. Optimizing of inventory management result in an overall reduction of 
generating waste. The biohazardous waste, which is the reagent kit itself is demolished by a regulated medical waste 
system. The waste is incinerated and if the volume is reduced, it means less air pollution is produced. A recycle bin is 
provided for the packaging and a biological hazardous bin is provided for the biological waste. The implementation 
of the online system prevents usage of paper for the inventory system, and it also aids in preservation of wood 
resources. The specimen containers in use are locally produced, but unfortunately it ends up in the biological waste, 
since it is biohazardous. Energy usages are reduced by having an alarm in the fridge that goes off if the fridge door is 
open for too long and the temperature increases, and the filter are cleaned regularly in order for it to function properly. 
The laboratory building has solar panels installed on the roof to reduce electricity usage. 
5. Conclusion and Recommendations
The correlation between receipt and issue as well as a decrease in days on hands in the last month of observations 
suggests that the implementation of forecasting and re-order point increase effective inventory management. FIFO is 
an effective quality control method for inventory management where perishable goods are concerned and it aids in 
general housekeeping by allowing one to store kits on top of each other and behind each other that results in more 
effective space utilization. 
Safety stock should be reduced, in order to be cost effective, but it would still save money with stock outs. Alternative 
suppliers for kit A and kit B are more feasible in times of supply shortage in comparison with keeping a high number 
of safety stock on hand. If the safety stock is calculated correctly, it is most of the time more cost effective to have 
safety stock on hand. Realtime automated issuing proofed to be very successful to assist with stock forecasting, as 
well as decrease time spend on tasks like stock counts and issue. It is recommended to explore the possibility of real-
time receiving to free more time for the materials management officer as well as assisting with more efficient stock 
control. It would also further involve laboratory staff in inventory management tasks. Transparency in the inventory 
management system promote collaboration between staff and management for optimal control. 
As mentioned in the methodology, the study was only conducted with a limited amount of space and resources. It is 
recommended to include more stock items with the aim to have forecasting, re-order point and real-time issue for all 
inventory items where possible. Revised safety stock should be kept for all category A items, category B items and 
category C items should be allocated safety stock items on discretion of management and the materials management 
officer. The decision should be made according to the organization’s objective in terms of a balance between cost and 
service level. If alternative suppliers are sourced, preference should be given to green companies that use recycled 
products or agents that is environmentally friendly to conserve resources for sustainability. In order to see if the 
principles implemented are successful for preventing stock outs, a longer time of observation is recommended.

Abstract 
The study explores the application of lean six sigma in case study of finding recommendation to solve real time 
production problems to increase efficiency and utilization while looking into manufacturing wastes which have a 
direct implication on production output. The study considered real production problem and the information was 
gathered was based on the station workload (time study and process waste) looking an efficiency and utilization of 
production line. The optimization of production process was based on work-study principles like lean six sigma, 
kaizen, time study. Data collection used is survey & direct observation in a form of a time study. Based on LSS 
application, it was discovered that the current production performance standard can be improved & utilization can be 
increased and more manufacturing wastes were generated. The outcomes show that in this balancing situation, the 
suggested framework performs better than earlier approaches. The findings would offer insightful recommendations 
for balancing the line and increasing utilization to enhance assembly lines.

Introduction  
This project was done in at an automotive manufacturing plant in South Africa. Optimization of workloads involves 
redistributing processes across the assembly line to increase efficiency and operator utilization. The process sequence 
in each station is in precedence order, looking into which processes are done before others and what the consequences 
of doing one before the other are. This study focuses on optimization workstations, which are critical in an assembly 
system because they balance the line and increase the system's efficiency and productivity. Because of globalization, 
manufacturers are under enormous pressure to produce products in shorter cycle times while remaining competitive. 
The assembly line in a flow-oriented production system involves distributing work to different stations by assigning 
all-important jobs to workstations. Process optimization aims to assign all relevant jobs efficiently and effectively to 
workstations in a flow-oriented production environment.

The research focused on a paced line with a time limit to complete the task. The operators have a time and station 
limit to complete their process, and the idle station is one where the operator can do everything and finish his process 
in one station. Even when a paced line and deterministic task times are used, unbalancing can occur as an unintended 
consequence of disassembly lines.  
 
As a result of new, stricter environmental legislation, increased public awareness, and expanded manufacturer 
responsibility, manufacturers are increasingly recycling and remanufacturing their post-consumer products. In a flow 
production shape workload configuration, unbalancing a line could result in statistically significant throughput 
increases. Unbalancing a line in a flow production workload configuration may result in an increase in work in process 
for the line. Unbalancing a line configuration may increase the cycle time of the line. Unbalanced workload may 
increase output even in lines with low coefficients of variation. Underutilized operators add additional costs to the 
company; for example, if the lines have operators sitting at an average loading of 70% - 80%, we will need more 
operators than if we loaded the operators to target loading, which means fewer headcount and more utilized operators. 
An unbalanced line adds to headcount and idle time. The different methods can be used to obtain an imbalance in a 
specific production. As with the balancing line problems, different approaches were used to achieve distinct goals. 
Line balancing is not required if the material flow is continuous. Bottlenecks occur at some workstations and idle time 
occurs at others on unbalanced lines. The resulting output is less than if the line could be balanced. 
 
Despite the obvious benefits of unbalanced lines in certain conditions, most assembly line research remains focused 
on the traditional ALBP. Because human resources are always involved in the operation of assembly lines, more 
knowledge about how to deal with line imbalance for a variety of performance objectives is required to support 
production in the twenty-first century, with its speed, flexibility, and performance requirements. Assembly line 
designers can benefit from simulation, particularly in terms of workstation capacity. As a result, the goal of line 
balancing is to have all workstations have nearly the same cycle time, resulting in no waiting. If the line is unbalanced, 
the organization is not meeting its goal of having a balanced line. 
 
2. Recommendations and Conclusion 
Robots can take the role of takeout stations 5 and 6, which will help us reduce MV as well as errors related to weariness 
and carelessness. The robot will pick up the glass from the cell and set it right on the component. Resequencing of 
processes to allow process that can be done earlier to be moved to the stations that are under loaded. Yamazumi chart 
line balancing is a technique for increasing labor productivity and line efficiency that is result-oriented and 
performance-based. The analysis reveals that the existing production system was not oriented toward spontaneous 
flow. The manufacturing process was designed part by part. Yamazumi chart line balancing can be used to implement 
flow-oriented production, which allows for complete product output from the first day of production planning.  
To improve productivity and meet customer demand, the assembly line balancing problem is critical in all mass 
production systems. The primary goal of this study was to investigate the applicability of Theory of constraints (TOC) 
principles and lean six sigma in the automotive industry. In the manufacturing and service industries, lean 
manufacturing techniques are widely used. Lean is gaining popularity as a method of reducing time constraints. If 
Lean is not defined, employee quantity and quality will suffer. The six sigma DMAIC model can be used in the 
identification of problems in the automotive industry. These defects were reduced by appropriate corrective actions in 
the improve stage, as well as work standardizations and employee trainings to control these continuous improvements. 
If we are unable to find a solution with high balancing for a given cycle time for a given assembly line, we can change 
the cycle time to improve the balancing of the assembly line. If a solution with high balancing can be obtained, 
changing the cycle time is not necessary to improve balancing. The analysis of trade-offs between cycle time and 
workstation count helps to provide a better overall assembly line. Balancing assembly lines is a constant research 
topic, and there are numerous avenues for future investigation. When the workstation time exceeds the standard cycle 
time, for example, the next workstation is assigned based on the maximally-loaded-workstation-rule. 
 
Unbalancing production lines is still an unexplored area of operations research, and a better understanding of their 
behavior can aid in identifying new approaches and solutions for configuring new lines or improving existing ones. 
As a result, the scope of this survey is limited to the flow line-balancing problem.  
The proposed solutions have the potential to provide numerous benefits not only to the company, but also to other 
entities involved in its operation. The following are the benefits of this implementation: Customers - increased

customer satisfaction because of increased timeliness; employees - improved comfort and organization; lack of 
overtime. The assumptions made when conducting the study are: 
• 
Production runs with no planned downtime no PMs during production hours. 
• 
Ergonomics for every station was taken into consideration when planning each station. 
• 
The production line only produces one car model. 
• 
Non-Conforming parts are not fitted or used. 
Vehicle assembly line optimization has long been a popular area of study. The literature on vehicle assembly line 
optimization was reviewed in this paper. In this review, we've seen an increase in the use of simulations and 
optimization. The literature was reviewed to identify theoretical and practical gaps and to suggest future research 
directions in the field of Vehicle Assembly Line Optimization. Many authors recommend line rebalancing, line 
optimization, and splitting the bottleneck process into sub-processes as the best solution to the CT problem to maintain 
standard takt time and improve manufacturing process.

Abstract 
This study investigates the applicability and effectiveness of continuous improvement tools in mineral processing 
plants. The gold mining sector in South Africa in 2021 contributed about 8.2% towards the GDP, which is a lower 
percentage compared to the 21% of the 1980s. Mineral processing is the 2nd phase of mineral extraction and 
processing activities (from the 1st stage, the ore extraction process). As such, productivity improvement is important 
as it also improves the output the minerals extracted. It is essential that mining houses continuously looks at ways to 
improve productivity. Due to the nature of the process, it is also important to note that any change or improvement on 
productivity should be considered holistically and be efficient, as increases are usually in the range of 5 to 10%. The 
research looked at various productivity improvement tools including lean, six sigma, kaizen, and applicability of these 
tools. The research that has already been done on productivity improvement were also investigated, with the aim of 
establishing what has not been covered, which revealed that productivity in the mineral processing industry has had 
less research. Improvement tools applicable to the gold processing plants were then investigated and recommendations 
made on implementation of such.

1.Introduction
Production is one factor that is available in every industry and in the mining industry it is all about the amount of 
product, usually semi-processed which is achieved within a specified period. In gold mining, the amount of gold 
processed from the production plant is usually stipulated in ounces and is a representation of the input into the plant 
as well as the effectiveness of the classification process. Countries like South Africa, Tanzania and Ghana are major 
plyers in the gold mining business and as such each country aims to obtain maximum benefit from this giant economic 
contributor. However, there is need to proper governance to control and regulate the mining so that it benefits the 
country and the locals where the operations take place. Increasing production of this precious mineral therefore 
positively affects the nation (Elbra 2017).

Figure 4.  Corrective Maintenance Steps 
 TPM implementation is a gradual strategic process that brings numerous benefits, and there is also challenges that 
include having to bring the operations team to understand the value of them being part of maintenance activities. This 
is because the operators are using to be relaxing when its maintenance time. There is also need for basic training to 
non-engineering workforce in the process plant. 
 
Total Quality Management 
Quality is a critical part of an operation, and the effective implementation thereof positively impacts productivity. The 
process plant does not have a Quality department but do have metallurgists for monitoring the quality of the final 
product and processes. The researcher believes there should be a quality department that focuses on quality in the 
process flow and more on the engineering side of the process. The researcher has gathered that sometimes machine 
spares are delivered only to find out later during machine repair that the spares don’t fit. This then affects the time of 
bringing the machine back into service. This can be simply avoided by having quality control team that checks all 
equipment and spares on delivery and confirms usability. It should however be noted that implementation of TQM 
comes with its own challenges, especially due to the general resistance to change that is found in most operations.  
When it comes to procurement, most organisations are now having a person titled “supplier quality controller” who is 
there to ensure new spares and parts are fit for use and of the correct quality before being accepted into the warehouse. 
Most organisations attach a quality control sticker on their products as a sign that it has passed through a quality 
control process and passed. Proper storage practices also assist in reserving parts quality while waiting for use.  
6.3. Lean Six Sigma 
Waste elimination and process optimisation are great contributors to increased productivity. For effective 
implementation of Lean six sigma principles, the mine would have to engage qualified personnel for this activity as 
currently there is no such personnel. There is still a lot of waste that needs to be eliminated from the process system 
and also improvement on process optimisation The researchers also deduced that a holistic approach to the 
improvement objective would make the mission successful. It takes every employee’s effort and understanding for 
productivity to improve; therefore, the change managers should ensure the goals and objectives are communicated 
clearly to the whole organisation and encompasses all the departments of the organisation from engineering, finance, 
procurement, operations and projects.

Abstract 
In optimization problems, when the problem is differentiable, gradient search methods are developed using the 
gradient concept. When it is nonsmooth, the solution methods are based on the subdifferential concept which is valid 
under the convexity condition. Subgradients defined for convex functions are the general mapping of gradients. If the 
problem is not convex, the weak subgradient can be used. The weak subgradient is defined with a more analytical 
approach to nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems and it is provided to generalize the concept of 
subgradient for nonconvex.  In the problem of optimizing the sum of a finite number (m ) of functions, incremental 
methods that use the gradient (or subgradient) of each function one by one work faster than non-incremental methods, 
especially when the number of m  is larger. 
Machine learning problems are optimization problems based on ""minimizing the sum of the finite number of 
functions"", which is the minimization of the loss function that shows the difference between the real data label and 
the estimated data label. The semidefinite machine learning problem (SML) contains nonlabelled data and contains 
nonsmooth nonconvex functions. The aim of this study is to develop an incremental weak subgradient method for 
SML problems. We work on the incremental weak subgradient method, which starts with an initial solution and 
calculates a new solution by using the weak subgradient values of one of the functions with random order at the current 
solution in each subsequent iteration. The convergence properties of the method are investigated and SML problems 
are solved.

Abstract 
Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are major contributors in economy as well as employment of emerging markets. 
These SMEs can be categorized into service or manufacturing based industries. Manufacturing sector in SMEs are 
now being supported by large enterprises as well as many multi-national corporations for service deposition and their 
expertise in manufacturing of specialized goods. This is the reason these SMEs are now digitalizing their business 
models and expanded their market to global level. In this context, large enterprises are also providing Industry 4.0 
based solutions to these SMEs to align them with their business models. However, these industries are also realizing 
the need to reduce environmental impacts of manufacturing by incorporating disruptive technologies i.e., additive 
manufacturing and IoT in their organizations which comes under Industry 4.0 umbrella. The studies in literature have 
highlighted the potential benefits of these technologies to improve economic performance but less attention have been 
paid towards the sustainability performance in terms of environmental and social benefits. To address this issue a 
theoretical framework for SMEs is proposed which can be used to enhance their environmental performance. The 
proposed framework is validated in the leading manufacturing SMEs which have incorporated the additive 
manufacturing operations in their organizations to reduce environmental impacts and improve economic performance. 
The study also highlights the role of disruptive technologies on the sustainability and discuss how these technologies 
can improve the economic and environmental performance. The findings indicated that disruptive technologies can 
improve the environmental performance and create a sustainability roadmap in the initial journey of Industry 4.0 
practices for SMEs.

1. Introduction
Industries have seen many major developments in the manufacturing between the 17th to 20th century due to rapid 
advancements in information and technology. In literature Industry 4.0 is discussed as fourth industrial revolution 
which can provide mass customization and greater flexibility to the manufacturing systems across the shop floor and 
supply chain level (Almada-Lobo  2015). All the disruptive technologies which appeared in literature i.e., CPS, IoT, 
Blockchain technology, cloud computing, big data analytics and additive manufacturing comes under the Industry 4.0 
umbrella. The role of artificial intelligence approaches such as: machine learning and deep learning is also well 
discussed in literature to support Industry 4.0 shift (Klingenberg et al.  2019; Vestin et al. 2020). Various authors have 
reported about the different definitions of Industry 4.0 in last years but still it is an area of debate due to difference in 
opportunities for developed and emerging markets (Furstenau et al.  2020; Kim  2017).  The similar terms such as: 
digitalization, Industry 4.0 and fourth industrial revolution have also discussed in the literature to define the new 
industrial shift in various regions of world. The literature also highlighted about the impact of these practices on the 
sustainable performance of organization (Alcácer & Cruz-Machado 2019; Jamwal, Agrawal, Sharma, & Giallanza, 
2021; Stock & Seliger 2016). The alternative way to achieve this can be adoption of sustainable manufacturing in 
these organizations. The benefits of these practices can be carbon emission reduction, sustainability promotion, 
healthier soil, clean water and workplace (Sharma et al. 2020).

Abstract 
The TOPSIS method, which adopts the principle of reaching ideal and non-ideal solutions in the order that the 
alternatives make by considering their relative closeness to the best solution (positive ideal solution), can present it in 
a simple mathematical form while determining the relationship of decision alternatives and give simple outputs, 
without making a qualitative transformation using numerical values, directly It is one of the multi-criteria decision-
making methods that can be applied to data. The AHP method, on the other hand, is a multi-criteria decision-making 
method that structures and visualizes complex, multi-criteria and multi-period problems hierarchically and determines 
the appropriate decision alternative by calculating the criterion weights to determine the contribution of the criteria to 
the goal. The most distinctive feature of AHP is that it appears as a method in which the thoughts and intuitions of the 
decision maker are combined logically. 
In this study, it is aimed to prevent time loss and disruption of the process by planning to include the patenting process 
in an appropriate stage of the company's workflow process by using multi-criteria decision-making techniques to solve 
the problem of patenting, which is the problem of the company. Existing projects in line with the company's goals and 
strategies is evaluated and listed with the TOPSIS method. Before the TOPSIS method, the AHP method is used to 
give weight to the criteria. By using these methods, a decision support system is developed that prioritizes which 
project is patented and that is allow it to be used by different companies.

Abstract 
This study aims to determine how much the quality of service, store atmosphere, and application of health 
protocols influence repurchase intentions at bookstore Gramedia Surabaya Tunjungan Plaza, either partially or 
simultaneously. The research uses a quantitative research approach and the data are collected by using 
questionnaire that involved 100 respondents who had done in-store shopping transactions (transactions directly at 
the store) at bookstore Gramedia Surabaya Tunjungan Plaza in 2022, with a minimum age of 17 years. The 
sampling technique used is non-probability sampling (purposive sampling). Data analysis using multiple linear 
regression analysis and hypothesis testing using IBM SPSS 25 Research Results: 1) Service quality shows a 
significant effect, at least partially, on the variable of repurchase intention. Supported by the t-test results which 
shows the value of Sig. of 0.004 < 0.05.; 2) Store atmosphere shows a partially significant effect on the variable 
of repurchasing intention. This can be proven through the results of the t-test which shows the value of Sig. 0.007 
< 0.05.; 3) The application of health protocols shows a partially significant effect on the variable of repurchase 
intention. This can be proven through the results of the t-test which shows the value of Sig. 0.014 < 0.05.; and 4) 
Service quality, store atmosphere, application of health protocols have a significant effect simultaneously on 
repurchase intention.

Introduction 
Based on the research results of the YouGov team (Reza Pahlevi 2021) stated that with a score of 27.4% points 
Gramedia managed to rank 3rd and became the only retail brand engaged in bookstore networks on brand index 
statistics based on consumer values. This research assessment was taken based on an assessment of service quality, 
customer impressions, value, customer satisfaction and brand recommendations. This research was conducted on 
Indonesian consumers aged over 18 years with a research period of approximately 12 months. 
Through the results of this research, it can be concluded that Gramedia dominates the bookstore network with 
good service quality, impression, value, and customer satisfaction so that customers feel that their expectations 
are being met and in the end customers provide recommendations to their closest colleague regarding previous 
shopping experiences, as well as information that can be obtained about the company bookstore. Similar to the 
results of previous studies according to (Soebandhi et al.  2020) in his research entitled ""Service Quality and Store 
Atmosphere on Customer Satisfaction and Repurchase Intention"" shows that cafe atmosphere and service quality 
have a significant effect on customer satisfaction in cafes and intend to return to cafes. Customer satisfaction also 
shows a significant effect on customer intention to make repeat purchases. This proves that the better the 
atmosphere of the cafe and the quality of service created, the higher the chances of customers coming back to 
visit. If understood from a broad perspective, service quality is defined as a privileges of every company. So 
service quality is relatively special compared to customer expectations (Utami  2012).  
According to (Tjiptono, 2018), service quality is a tool to achieve customer satisfaction. Service quality begins 
with customer needs and ends with service delivery. When customers getting service, they will compare all their 
experiences based on their expectations and ideal perceptions of the service. In general, the higher the quality of 
service they recieved, the more customer will be satisfied and happier (Huang et al.  2019). Therefore the company 
cannot stop only at the point of customer satisfaction, but the company must seek ways to leading customers to

6. Conclusion
Based on the results of the research that has been described, the researchers can formulate research conclusions 
as follows: 
1.
H1 is Accepted. This can be proven through the results of the t-test which shows the value of Sig. 0.004 <
0.05, thus it can be concluded that the service quality variable (X1) shows a partially significant effect on the
variable of repurchase intention (Y).
2.
H2 is Accepted. This can be proven through the results of the t-test which shows the value of Sig. 0.007 <
0.05, Thus it can be concluded that the store atmosphere variable (X2) shows a partially significant effect on
the variable of repurchasing intention (Y).
3.
H3 is Accepted. This can be proven through the results of the t-test which shows the value of Sig. 0.014 <
0.05, which means that the variable of the application of the health protocol shows a partially significant
effect on the variable of repurchasing intention (Y).
4.
H4 is Accepted. This can be proven by the value of sig. 0.000 < 0.05. Thus it can be concluded that the
service quality variable (X1), store atmosphere (X2), application of health protocols (X3) have a significant
influence on repurchase intention (Y).
1. Recommendation
For the company 
• To increase interest in repurchasing, companies can always strive for and evaluate the maximum service quality.
In order to generate transactional, referential, preferential, and explorative interest effects
• To make customers feel more at ease while shopping, lighting elements in the store's atmosphere can be re-
evaluated. Because according to customer feedback, they prefer warmer and brighter light.
• The company is expected to more frequently urge employees and all visitors who enter to continue to adhere to
the implementation of existing protocols, for example, wearing masks properly inside the store. Or the company
can always actively share photo evidence of the sterilization agenda on the company's website or social media in
order to gain the trust of customers and encourage transactions or return visits.
For academics and general audiences 
This research can be used as a basis for future research when using the same objects or variables. But it's good 
that in new research, it is hoped that there will be different variables in order to broaden the scope of research and 
produce different and more perfect data.

Abstract 
There are various challenges that manufacturers of corrugated packaging boxes encounter in dealing with waste and 
customer complaints, and one of them which has been on the increase at XYZ Boxing is the collapsing of boxes in 
the market. Such complaints result in customer dissatisfaction, and they tend to seek products from other 
suppliers/competition. The purpose of this study is to find root causes of the recent increase collapsing issues as raised 
by the customers by evaluating raw materials mechanical performance over the past few years, verify if folding 
settings affect the box compression strength and compare how design choice (straight crease vs off-set crease) affect 
box compression strength. Supplier 1 for mechanical components was found to be generally performing better as 
compared to Supplier 2, but both suppliers were found to be poor. Changing folding settings does not bring about 
significance change in box compression strength and McKee formular underestimate box compression strength when 
using Edge Crush Test results to predict the strength of certain box; and that straight crease design delivers better box 
compression strength results than offset crease design. The proposals from the finding include evaluating all board 
grades mechanical performance and source the materials as per better performing supplier, including working with 
the suppliers to find the root cause of raw materials mechanical properties decline.

Corrugated Packaging Boxes, Box Compression Strength, McKee Formular, and Edge Crush Test 
Introduction 
Corrugated packaging boxes play a vital role in storing and distributing of goods by ensuring that the load they carry 
is protected and contained until it reaches its final destination, be it at retailers or at consumers. Once boxes fail at the 
storage and or during the distribution, damage is likely to occur on the contents they carry or the whole load become 
unstable. The corrugated industry produced over 184 million tons worldwide in 2021, with the projection of over 191 
million tons for the current year, as depicted in Figure 1 below.

• 
At design stage, customer requirements on staking strength are rarely assessed, which can cause 
collapsing issues at a later stage due to such requirements not being met or when the customer changes 
their stacking requirements to reduce shipping costs 
• 
Changes in design, such as changing to offset creases can significantly affect stacking strength and as a 
result may cause collapsing issues.  
6. Conclusion and recommendations  
The following are conclusions and recommendations based on the key findings mentioned above: 
• 
Since raw materials performance is on decline, XYZ Boxing must work with the supplier to address such 
issue. This can be done by meeting on a monthly basis to review the performance of most five used board 
grades and requesting the supplier to come up with corrective action to address the performance issues 
• 
One supplier seems to be performing better than the other, XYZ Boxing can choose which board grades 
to acquire from which supplier based on the performance of raw materials 
• 
Since changing folding settings does not bring improvement in BCT, settings should stay the same as 
the process capability was seen as better at current settings when compared to experimental settings.  
• 
XYZ Boxing should introduce customer requirements at design stage based on stacking practices by the 
customer for each new product to ensure that such requirements are known and met before even 
supplying the products. This will eliminate address issues of collapsing with the initial order and address 
issue of collapsing where the customer changes stacking practices to save shipping costs. One tool that 
can be used is QFD. 
• 
When design changes are implemented, performance of the new design should be tested through entire 
supply chain to verify that new design will perform at the same level if not better when compared to the 
old design.

1.Introduction
E-commerce has changed technology and business relationships. E-commerce participation refers to the extent to
which an organization adopts, integrates, and uses existing technology in e-commerce itself (Raktnasingam,
2003). Furthermore, the Financial Services Authority (OJK) stated that around 88.1 percent of internet users in
Indonesia have used e-commerce services to buy various products on a daily basis (CNN  2021). Not only that,
the chairman of the Indonesian OJK commissioner also stated that the value of transactions in e-commerce in
Indonesia had reached Rp. 266 trillion in 2020. The use of e-commerce had actually been used long before the
pandemic. However, currently many retail stores and manufacturers are forced to switch to digital platforms to
maintain their business. This, of course, has a long-term impact on consumers getting used to shopping online.
Sales of products such as groceries, masks, vitamins and health products as well as basic daily necessities have
increased, while demand for smartphones, automotive, clothing and holiday tickets has been the opposite. The
existence of MSMEs has also experienced a significant increase in demand during the pandemic.
The existence of E-Commerce is supported by online shopping applications known as e-commerce platforms that 
have mushroomed in Indonesia. Some examples of online shopping platforms that are widely used by Indonesians 
are Lazada, Bukalapak, Blibli, and Shopee, and Tokopedia. Last year, Tokopedia became the online shopping 
platform with the highest number of website visits, reaching 147,790,000 monthly average (iprice group, 2021). 
The competition for each of these platforms is fierce. Each - each company is competing to increase the number 
of consumers by carrying out various strategies that can increase purchasing decisions by consumers. What's 
more, new platforms such as digital business gempolklutuk certainly face more difficult challenges to gain trust 
and be chosen by consumers. Digital Business Gempolklutuk Village is an e-commerce platform built through 
kedaireka matching fund program as a commercialization of agricultural products, SMEs, services and tourism in 
Gempolklutuk Village, Tarik District, Sidoarjo Regency. Consumers go through several stages in the decision-
making process before buying a product, which starts from the introduction of needs to behavior after making a 
purchase (Kotler & Armstrong  2008).There are several variables that influence consumer decisions in making 
transactions on online platforms. Several previous studies regarding consumer decisions have been carried out by

Abstract 
Strategic technology innovation management (TIM) is critical for organizations to evolve and succeed (Barney et al., 
2011; Earle et al., 2019). A recent McKinsey survey (Am et al., 2020) indicated that although 90% of executives 
believed the Covid-19 crisis was going to fundamentally change their businesses in the next five years, only 21% felt 
their organizations were equipped to face the challenge. Can effective TIM be the “secret source” of competitive 
differentiation in a world of increasing commoditization of technology building blocks for knowledge-intensive 
products and services in highly competitive markets? (Azam, 2019; Mavroeidis & Tarnawska, 2017; Pisano, 2015). 
The orchestration of resources and proper setting of directions and priorities are critical for strategic management 
(SM) and TIM integration, representing a fundamental responsibility of leadership roles. Thus, to properly 
comprehend the interrelationship between SM and TIM and the challenges associated with said orchestration and 
prioritization of resources, one needs to consider how leadership affects this dynamic, i.e., look at the interplay of 
strategic management, technology innovation management, and leadership theory as an interdisciplinary topic.  
The study aims to conduct a bibliometric review to map the existing interdisciplinary knowledge structure of the three 
domains, including the critical knowledge base, research front, and key areas of current and future interdisciplinary 
research. The implication for practitioners of TIM is a better understanding of the key interdisciplinary challenges 
currently under investigation, through a view of both practical and theoretical tools used, leading to a roadmap of 
topics shaping the evolution of these synergistic domains.

Abstract 
Resistance spot welding is one of the most common welding techniques used in the automotive and aviation industries. 
In the present research, the effect of resistance spot welding parameters such as, holding time, squeeze time, welding 
current, force applied, and welding time will be examined using Simufact Welding 2020, a welding simulation 
application. The impact of these parameters on the strength of the weld in metal sheets are studied. Each parameter 
was studied separately by changing one parameter within the range values and other parameters as constant values. It 
was found that the best region for the following spot-welding parameters is, from 0.9 s to 0.95 for squeeze time, 6.5 
kA to 7.5 kA for welding current, 0.15 s to 0.4 s welding time, 30 ms for holding time, and 3.2 kN to 3.4 kN for 
electrode force. These parameter ranges are best to provide a spot weld with the highest yield stress.

1. Introduction
Resistance spot welding (RSW) is a powerful welding technique that can be generally used on thin metal sheets. For 
thick metal sheets specialized heavy duty equipment’s are used. This method allows for a quick welding process and 
the production of joints with high strength quality. Unlike other welding processes, spot welding does not use filler 
material to join two parts, or the electrode doesn’t melt during the process. Meanwhile the electrodes, which are 
typically made of highly electrical and thermally conductive materials such as copper, are clamped to both sides of 
sheets and the current is applied. The generated heat melts the metal while the pressure from the electrodes squeezes 
the molten metal to form a weld. It is primarily used in the production of automobiles. This is accomplished in a matter 
of seconds by spot welding robots. When working on a car body, however, sheet metal shops employ less sophisticated 
methods. The Basic mechanism of resistance spot welding is shown below in figure 1.

5. Conclusion Further Research
As for future research, further exploration for other spot-welding parameters that can affect the yield stress of the 
spotted weld such as, radians of the c-gun, the shape of the electrode rods and type of material. All of these parameters 
have an effect on the strength of the spotted weld affecting the quality and properties of the final product. Furthermore, 
using Matlab to find a formulate a prediction model and optimization equation of the experiment is advised as using 
the latest technology in research would allow to obtain more accurate and precise readings.  
6. Conclusion
The present study attempted to simulate the effect of various welding process parameters on spot weld quality by 
analyzing the yield stress. The Simufact 2020 welding simulation application was used to determine the maximum 
yield stress for each parameter. The simulations were performed by using the same initial file that contains the clamps 
to prevent any error that may be caused due to difference in positioning of clamps or in position of the spot weld. The 
effect of spot-welding parameters was achieved by keeping all parameters constant and changing the studied parameter 
within the range. The yield stress was collected after each run and summarized in graphs to understand basic trends 
and relationships between each set. It was found out that the highest yield stress welds can be performed at a holding 
time of 0.9 ms to 0.95 ms, welding current between 6.5 kA to 7.5 kA, welding time between 0.15 s to 0.4 s, hold time 
of 30 ms, and electrode force between 3.2 kN and 3.4 kN. The trends were characterized by a positive linear 
relationship. These conditions resulted in highest values of recorded yield stress of the spot welded. Therefore, the 
effect of each parameter on yield stress were found out using the simulation.

Abstract 
As a growing and emerging field of fashion, digital fashion is a fresh and functional tool to use in fashion industry. 
The term ‘digital fashion’ in the study refers to fashion prototypes and simulations of actual garments, that can be 
worn by customized avatars. Customizable avatars allow consumers to reimagine themselves in 3D clothes. As it is 
customizable, these avatars act as virtual entities of self that are affected by every individual’s behavior as self. This 
study is an experimental study that investigates Indonesian millennials preferred avatar as how they want to present 
themselves to public and how they portray their “actual” self through the avatar. This study measures Indonesian 
millennial’s types of self-concept from three different perspectives: Actual self, ideal self, and ought self through 
customizable avatars in digital fashion.

Abstract 
There are lots of traditional shipyards in Indonesia. These traditional boat buildings are used by fishermen. However, 
there is no prior study on how these traditional shipyards run the business. In this study, we focus on business 
feasibility study from 5 aspects such as market, economic, technical, financial, and customer needs aspects. This study 
will contribute to the traditional boatbuilding business development at the shipyard and small craft technology 
business in the maritime developing countries.

1. Introduction
There are 3 types of traditional boats for fishermen in Lamongan, Indonesia, namely: pursein, ijon-ijon, boats. Based 
on Figure 1, it is shown the hull constructions of each type, from the left side is pursein, ijon-ijon and boats 
respectively. For the advantages of boat products from traditional shipyards, this is a type of boat. As for the pricing 
system for each type of ship, there are no precise rules. Usually, it is done with a down payment system at the beginning 
then further payments are made based on the progress of the boat building stages with several terms. Based on the 
survey results, several shipyards have implemented a strategy, namely: shipyard owners are always open and provide 
opportunities for their customers to convey their deficiencies and requests from the results of the boats received. Boat 
owners are also open to monitoring at any time what is done by boat owners during the boat building process. This is 
intended so that the resulting boat products are truly in accordance with the needs of consumers/boat owners. During 
the manufacturing process, several existing technologies have been used, such as drills, chainsaws, cranes, loaders, 
etc. This shipyard is economically very helpful for the economy of local residents because it can open up opportunities 
for work. Residents there were not disturbed by the existence of this Shipyard even though it is located behind the 
Village Hall. The shipyard does not produce waste because the remaining pieces of wood will be sold to furniture 
factories as household appliances, as well as tofu factories and sugar factories as fuel. 
Business feasibility studies will indirectly have links with the interests of society and government. The government 
needs to use a business feasibility study, especially to see the impact of the business on people's lives and economic 
growth. There are five aspects in business feasibility study, such as: market, economic, technical, financial, and 
customer needs aspects. With the existence of innovations or new products that emerge from the community, even the 
smallest form of business can have a positive impact to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). To the best of our 
knowledge, there is no prior business feasibility study yet at the traditional shipyard. This study will contribute to the 
traditional boatbuilding business development at the shipyard and macro-economic mapping in general.

Based on the results of interviews that have been conducted, we found that the company ensures that the 
boatbuilding process has been carried out properly without any defects in the product which has been monitored 
directly by the customer with clear manufacturing transparency. Here we also obtain information that customers 
have been able to see a company culture that can support the sustainability of the company in the long term. 
 
6. Conclusion  
We have discussed the business feasibility study of boat building process at traditional shipyard from 5 aspects, such 
as: market, economic, technical, financial, and customer needs aspects. From market aspect, the payment is very 
flexible based on progress term payment or down payment. From the economic aspect, the shipyard can manage the 
payment by purchasing the wood to be stored to anticipate the price increasing.  From the technical aspect, they tend 
to still utilize human labor due to the location of the business location which is on the seafront so they take advantage 
of this opportunity. From financial aspect, the BEP value and the profit target is less than 1. It means that the business 
is well prospect and running. From customer needs, customer tend to be more flexible when they know beforehand 
about the company and the boat that they sell. There’s also a supporting factor where if the customer can see the 
process of the boat building, they can monitor and ask for customization.

Abstract 
The paper aims to present an overview of previous research on the application of “lean” in the construction industry, 
covering key aspects of recent discoveries, their limits, and potential future research directions. It makes two 
contributions to the body of knowledge. It initially divides the literature to provide an overview of completed research 
endeavors. Second, it points out a gap in the existing body of research and suggests fresh avenues for investigation. 
The findings indicate that prior research has had difficulty developing a sound theoretical foundation for the subject. 
To support the proposed ""theories,"" ""notions,"" and ""paradigms,"" more study is needed. In short, there is a big need for 
more research because there hasn't been a thorough evaluation of how lean has been used in the construction industry.

1. Introduction
The infrastructure sector is propelling India's overall development and GDP. New policies will result in the creation 
of world-class infrastructure in time, making it the new global identity of the country. Therefore, investing in 
sustainable infrastructure and enhancing its quality at an affordable cost should be a guiding principle for the industry. 
But there is a shortage of skilled labor in the Indian construction industry, which often leads to the quality of a project 
being questioned (Dinesh et al. 2017). The construction industry displays inefficiency primarily through cost overruns 
caused by delays in delivery timelines and material waste. Around 15% of all projects are cost overrun, over 70% are 
time overrun, and about 10% are material waste (Babalola et al. 2019). Currently, in the construction industry, 
conventional management methods are being replaced by lean management methods, which increase the quality of 
work and eliminate industry waste (More et al. 2016). “The Lean Construction practice is a method of designing 
production systems to reduce time, effort, and waste in a construction environment.” The purpose of this study is to 
summarize prior studies and highlight the significance of lean adoption in the construction industry. The subsequent 
research questions are created to achieve this goal: “RQ1: How have the concept of lean implementation in 
construction been investigated in terms of a year, region, research technique, context, and outcomes?” “RQ2: What 
are the extant literature’s limitations?” “RQ3: What are the future research directions for lean implementation in 
construction?”. 
1.1 Objective  
This study provides an overview of the past literature to highlight the importance of lean in the construction industry. 
2. Literature Review
Lean construction practices emphasize minimizing waste and materials, contributing to sustainable construction. The 
lean construction concept is adapted from the Toyota Production System (Anerao and Deshmukh  2016). Lean 
construction aims to put a significant emphasis on “continuous improvement,” “waste elimination,” “a strong customer 
focus,” “value for money,” “high-quality project and supply chain management,” and “improved communications” 
(Singh and Kumar  2020). “Control,” “performance optimization,” “scheduling perspective,” “production system and 
process,” “performance measurement,” and “customer satisfaction” are some kinds of traditional project management 
(Kim and Park 2006). It might be difficult to incorporate lean ideas and techniques into building projects and to put 
them into practice on real building sites. “Lack of understanding of the need for adopting lean construction,” “supply 
chain uncertainty,” “the propensity to use traditional management,” “culture,” and “human attitude issues (mindset 
issues),” “a lack of commitment from top management,” and “a non-participative management style for the workforce”

It was evident that the primary reasons behind the success of lean construction in India were the organization's culture 
and systems, top management's commitment, and worksite management. In practice, the advantages of the new 
manufacturing strategy regarding “productivity,” “quality,” and “indicators were convincing enough to enable the 
rapid deployment of the novel concepts. Lean development is a method for outlining production frameworks to prevent 
the waste of resources like time, labor, and materials to generate the most valuable output possible. The construction 
industry is still growing and has yet to achieve a maturity level for applying lean concepts and practices compared to 
the manufacturing and service sectors. Lean practices have variously been described as “methods,” “ideas,” “plans,” 
and plans of action that enable the accomplishment of lean construction goals. The two most popular lean construction 
practices are “LPS (Last Planner System)” and “JIT (Just in Time).  Lean construction practices have helped reduce 
material waste, which various studies have shown harm the environment. This shows that the perception of 
construction as a major cause of environmental deterioration could be dramatically changed by applying lean 
principles. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Lean is a powerful tool to reduce wastage in organizations (Vignesh and Suresh, 2016, December; Thomas et al. 2017; 
Thomas and Saleeshya  2019; Raja Sreedharan et al. 2018). In construction, lean should be implemented at several 
levels. It cannot only be applied at the operational level; it also needs to be planned strategically. To create the most 
significant use of materials, time, and effort through the implementation of lean development, frameworks are outlined 
to limit the waste of materials, time, and effort. In this paper lean construction is studied in the context of India. Based 
on the in-depth study of lean principles/concepts, it was discovered that the lean construction system minimizes waste

and increases productivity in the construction industry. Since lean construction practices are not backed up with proper 
strategic planning, companies using lean construction tools and practices cannot sustain their use or reap maximum 
benefits. Taking advantage of a lean system and accepting new construction technologies must be a goal for everyone 
in the company and on the project for it to be successful. Our construction activities should minimize their 
environmental impact to achieve sustainable and green growth. An analysis of 24 papers chosen from top-rated 
journals was conducted via a Systematic Literature Review. Although the number of papers may seem limited, it 
significantly contributes to this study. The limitation of this study was that past papers rarely discussed limitations and 
future research directions in their study. Because of various limitations such as limited outreach and time, this study 
reviewed the existing literature.  Since construction is an important sector and is projected to contribute significantly 
to India's GDP in the future, researchers can explore case studies regarding how different countries, states, or 
companies have applied lean construction methods efficiently. It may also be necessary to conduct a study to find out 
which obstacles exist and recommend solutions.

1. Introduction
AI simulates human cognitive processes through technology, especially computer systems. System learning and 
development without explicit programming is made possible by “machine learning, an application of AI” (González-
Carrasco et al. 2019). Risk management at banks has become more important since the global financial crisis, and 
continuous attention has been paid to how risks are identified, assessed, reported, and managed (Van Liebergen 2017). 
Machine Learning helps with various benefits by using its technologies to “enhance customer experience,” “improve 
service quality,” and “increase productivity” (Sabharwal 2018).This research aims to synthesize the past literature and 
highlight the importance of Machine learning (ML) in the banking sector. The research questions are focused on are 
“RQ1: How has the concept of machine learning in the banking sector been investigated in terms of a “year,” “region,” 
“research technique,” “context,” and “outcomes”?” “RQ2: What are the extant literature’s limitations?” “RQ3: What 
are the future research directions for machine learning in the banking sector?”. 
1.1 Objective  
This study provides an overview of the past literature to highlight the importance of machine learning in the banking 
sector in this current technological advancement era. 
2. Literature Review
ML techniques are currently the most valuable tools (Patil and Dharwadkar 2017, February). ANNs have been 
effectively employed in addressing complicated problems in a variety of domains, including “medical diagnosis,” 
“forecasting foreign exchange rates,” “speech recognition,” “pattern recognition,” and “computer vision,” due to their 
“processing power,” “generalization capacity,” and “dynamical features” (Patil and Dharwadkar 2017, February; 
Ramesh 2017, February; Guerra and Castelli  2021).  
The synthesis of the past literature on machine learning in the banking sector is shown in Table 1

5. Conclusion  
So, we read 25 articles and conducted research. The effect of AI on the digital age, especially in the banking sector, 
must also be carefully considered. The execution, limitations, possibilities, and effects on operations and jobs were 
also described. AI and machine learning have enabled the banking industry to meet customer demands. As a result, 
the majority of previous reviews were unavailable. As there is insufficient data, the concept of ML in the banking 
sector can be studied by considering the tools and methods used, such as the experiment and predictive model, and 
others for future research.

Abstract 
Cafe, as one of the service industries, is important to have a good facility layout to make customers enjoy the food 
and beverages and also the ambiance provided at the cafe. The object of this research is one of the cafe in Bogor. 
This study uses the SLP method through analysis of ARC, ARD, and calculating the travel distance to determine 
the material handling costs incurred. The result of the re-layout shows that the cost of material handling, travel 
distance, and time for operational standards decreased.

Introduction 
Technology development and a highly competitive market in the industry field require businesses to develop their 
own companies. In order to do that, innovations and improvement need to be done so companies can compete 
with other businesses and most importantly to improve their service and product quality. Facility layout not only 
facilitates a company’s operational performance, but also has an impact on customer satisfaction and loyalty 
(Ibrahim et al., 2018). Hence, a well designed facility layout can support companies to give their best quality.  
Industrial facility layouts are defined as a process to physically arrange the factors shaping the production system 
so that they suitably and efficiently fulfill the organization’s strategic objectives. The purpose of the layout design 
is to minimize material handling costs where material handling has an impact of 40% from 80% of all operational 
costs and optimizes the production process and the relationship between workers, the flow of materials and goods, 
the flow of information, and the working methods of a company. Therefore a facility layout has a significant 
impact on a business performance where it  affects the efficiency of production systems and their productivity 
level (Altuntas and Selim 2012; Ku et al. 2011;Navidi et al. 2012).  
Facility layouts are needed in any kind of business, including a cafe, where customers come to enjoy food and 
beverages and also the ambience provided at the cafe. Therefore, it is crucial for a cafe to have a proper facility 
layout to give the best quality to its customers.  
This research is conducted in ABC cafe, a cafe located in Bogor, West Java. It was founded in 2017 and has been 
serving a variety of coffee drinks, main dishes, and sweet snacks. It has both indoor and outdoor seating areas. 
ABC is built in an old house building that functions as a boarding house, which was later renovated into a 
commercial area (cafe).  
After observing the production layout, which is the bar area and the kitchen area, we concluded that ABC’s 
efficiency and productivity can be improved through layout planning. Hence, the objective of this paper is to

Abstract 
There has been an increase in the use of Photovoltaic (PV) systems in residential buildings due to their growing 
accessibility and affordability, as well as the shift in consumer preferences toward more environmentally friendly and 
sustainable energy generation alternatives. Moreover, these systems are highly effective in reducing the increasing 
cost of electricity supplied from the grid. The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, such as smart 
home appliances, that can be controlled remotely or directly reveals a potential for maximizing the benefits of these 
renewable generators. To realize this potential, this study develops a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) that 
minimizes the electricity cost and maximizes customer satisfaction by scheduling the run times of appliances and the 
charging and discharging times of the integrated storage system. The system considers the electricity tariff rates that 
vary depending on energy consumption levels and the ability to import from and export to the grid. We developed a 
mixed integer programming formulation and a novel heuristic algorithm and implemented them in CPLEX OPL and 
Python, respectively. We developed a user-friendly decision support system to help the average user schedule 
household appliances. We also analyzed many scenarios to investigate the economic feasibility of utilizing PV panels 
using actual data from Oman. We determined the breakeven points for different parameters and performed sensitivity 
analyses.

Abstract 
Maintaining Geographically Distributed Assets (GDA) requires complex team planning and scheduling decisions. 
Recently, many approaches have been introduced in the literature to solve this complex optimization problem. 
However, most of the introduced optimization models in the literature have considered this problem in its simplest 
form without involving realistic features such as precedence constraints, temporal dimension, and multiple depots. 
Therefore, the developed solutions are unlikely to be applicable in real-life systems. This study aims to determine the 
optimal number of teams and their schedules over a planning horizon to minimize the total cost associated with 
performing a group of maintenance activities in GDA. We formulated the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear 
Programming (MILP) model, which considers the release dates, due dates, interdependencies, teams working hours, 
and assets availability. The model is a more realistic variant of the multi-depot multi-period vehicle routing problem. 
As far as we know, this is the first study to consider all these features simultaneously.   
VRP is a well-known NP-Hard problem; therefore, we developed a novel hybrid metaheuristic algorithm to solve 
large practical instances of the problem. We combined Genetic Algorithm with a problem-specific solution encoding 
with a Simulated Annealing algorithm (GASA) to facilitate the search. We implemented the MILP model in IBM 
CPLEX OPL and coded GASA in Python. We performed an extensive computational study to test the performance of 
the proposed solution methods. The results over 600 instances revealed that GASA has a stable behavior dealing with 
different levels of the problem’s complexity, including the number of activities, assets, depots, days, teams, and 
interdependent activities. The MILP model is solved with a one-hour time limit. For the problem instances optimally 
solved by MILP, GASA provided solutions with an average error of 0.13%. Furthermore, when the MILP model was 
stopped due to the time limit, GASA produced an average of 4.4% better solutions than MILP. GASA was able to 
solve all instances in reasonable solution times. The performance of GASA was also demonstrated by real-life case 
studies of GDA maintenance systems of one of the leading companies in the energy sector in Oman. The results proved 
the effectiveness of GASA by generating solutions with an average of 39% less than the actual paid cost and 94% 
faster than the time spent on planning. The cost reductions in several instances reached up to 50%. The case study 
proved that the proposed GASA model is a promising tool to reduce the operational cost of the business and, 
accordingly, increase the company’s profits.

Abstract 
Ride-hailing business in Indonesia is facing challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This situation urgently needed 
readjustment to maintain customer satisfaction with unexplored antecedents and its relationships between known 
variables from before the pandemic. Therefore, this study will explore the relationship between ride-hailing customer 
satisfaction and its antecedents in terms of price perception and COVID-19 prevention services during the new normal 
era. This study conducted an online survey with convenience sampling techniques in the sampling process. Afterward, 
Partial Least Square (PLS)-Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is used as the analysis tool because the predictability 
of exogenous variables is the main objective. In this exploratory study, the formative measurement model is used and 
analyzed thoroughly by the SMART-PLS application. The results show that price perception and COVID-19 
prevention service significantly influence ride-hailing customer satisfaction. However, the COVID-19 prevention 
service does not have a significant indirect effect on customer satisfaction through price perception as a mediator 
variable. The discussed strategies that can be applied to maintain and increase customer satisfaction are developing 
exclusive features for female customers, improving health protocols in the new normal era, and strengthening the 
market position with operational excellence.

1. Introduction
Along with the rapid development of technology, means of transportation in today’s modern era progressing so fast. 
Many online-based transportation provider services arise in Indonesia. Providing many convenience aspects, these 
ride-hailing transportation services grow inseparable from people’s needs in everyday life (Triwanda 2020). Ride-
hailing also plays a big part in Indonesia's national economy. Lembaga Demografi Fakultas Ekonomi dan Bisnis 
Universitas Indonesia (LD FEB UI) stated that more than 80% of Indonesia society consistently use ride-hailing as 
the means of transportation and there are 24% increased revenue in 2021 for ride-hailing drivers in Indonesia (Purwanti 
2021). However, there is still limited research on this growing logistic business. Research on passengers' behavior and 
attitude toward ride-hailing services that focused on developing countries is quite rare (Shah and Hisashi 2021). These 
findings evoke urgency to understand customer satisfaction better in the ride-hailing business, especially in Indonesia. 
Many previous studies support the motivation to dig deeper into customer satisfaction in the ride-hailing business. 
Data from Statista predicted that ride-hailing users will increase by 75% to 40 million people in 2023 (Yanti 2021). 
Databoks also supports this fact from a recent survey on August 2022, there is 28.4% of respondents in Indonesia 
choose ride-hailing as their main transportation on daily basis. Ride-hailing becomes the second-highest transportation 
choice for Indonesian. Even when there are increasing tariffs on ride-hailing services due to fuel prices rising, 29.1% 
of ride-hailing customers will still use ride-hailing services in the future along with another 14% will combine ride-
hailing with commuting with their private transportation (Mutia 2022). According to research conducted by the 
Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF), 64% of online transportation services user in Indonesia 
has increased their frequency of use the ride-hailing service since the pandemic and 60% stated that they would 
continue using ride-hailing services even though there were no promos. The same research also shows that 73% of 
respondents claim the ride-hailing service improves their productivity (Wally 2022). Thus, ride-hailing is an important

6. Conclusion
This study explored the relationship between ride-hailing customer satisfaction and its antecedents in the form 
perception and COVID-19 prevention services by the Partial Least Square (PLS) and Structural Equation Modelling 
(SEM) in the SMRT PLS application. PLS was used because the method found out the influence between variables 
whereas SEM can simultaneously evaluate the dependent relationship between measured variables (price perception, 
COVID-19 prevention service, and customer satisfaction) and latent constructs as well as the relationship between 
latent variables. This study would like to fill the research gap in ride-hailing customer satisfaction studies in a 
developing country such as Indonesia in the new normal era. 
The result shows that COVID-19 prevention services affected price perception in ride-hailing customers significantly. 
Moreover, price perception and COVID-19 prevention service directly influence customer satisfaction significantly. 
Customers are satisfied with ride-hailing because of their good COVID-19 prevention services. Even after the 
pandemic, price perception is still a significant aspect of customer satisfaction. However, the COVID-19 prevention 
service does not have a significant indirect effect on customer satisfaction through price perception as a mediator 
variable. Thus, price perception can’t be a mediator for those two variables.  
The result of the F² value for the COVID-19 Prevention Service variable is 0.22, this value is included in the moderate 
category, so eliminating this variable will affect the other two variables and the model fit. The R2 value for the price 
perception variable is 0.177 (weak level), while for the customer satisfaction variable it is 0.35 (normal level). The 
predictive relevance assessment (Q2) shows a value of 0.207 for the variable customer satisfaction and 0.079 for price 
perception, so it can be said that each variable has predictive relevance. Measurement of the fit model in this study 
shows quite good numbers with an SRMR value is 0.059 and an NFI value is 0.9. Thus, it can be said that this model 
is fit for the results of data collection. 
From the results, companies can apply several strategies to increase customer satisfaction. The first strategy is to 
develop exclusive features for female customers which can be done by increasing the security guarantee. The second 
strategy is to improve health protocols in the new normal era, so that prevention services can meet the expectations of 
customers. The final strategy is to strengthen market position with operational excellence, so the costs applied are 
minimum costs and services can be provided at relatively low prices.

Abstract 
Managing warehouse operations poses a continuous challenge for companies due to associated costs and expenses. 
Inefficient utilization of warehouses leads to many undesired outcomes such as loss of manpower hours spent in 
storing or retrieving goods, degradation and obsoleteness of materials, etc. Therefore, optimizing the warehouse 
operations and improving its management will affect costs significantly. Nonetheless, it becomes necessary to first 
define the factors that affect the cost. This can be achieved by collecting related data, and then developing a sustainable 
and effective warehouse management system that can derive decisions accordingly. Furthermore, the nature of 
warehousing is becoming more dynamic such that the storing requirement is subjected to specific inputs and outputs 
related to, temperature, humidity, lightening, beside dedicated arrangements, etc. Thus, the ability to acquire a range 
of inputs, integrate and analyze them, is necessary to meet this objective.  
IoT technology support is a key pillar of the data-gathering process that enables it to provide reliable data that can be 
utilized. Despite all the hype around IoT as a decision-support tool, improper implementation might lead to an 
ineffective system. Therefore, it is beneficial to evaluate the impact of adopting such technology. Hence, the objective 
of this project is to develop a framework for data-driven decision-making for cost analysis of implementing IoT in 
warehouses. To achieve this, a well-structured methodology is followed. The first phase of the methodology employed 
in this study included conducting an extensive literature review aimed at identifying cost-effective factors contributing 
to the implementation of IoT in warehouses. The literature review papers were found using specified key words such 
as IoT, warehouse, big data, cost-effective factors, and data-driven decision-making. Research papers related to the 
subject from trusted journals were chosen. In the second phase, the factors were gathered and classified based on 
specific criteria. Then, they were subjected to a filtering methodology. Here, the total number of factors that was 
collected in the literature review phase initially exceeded 290. Then, using the systematic approach to study and 
analyze the collected data lead to group the factors into 35 main factors and 71 subfactors. 
In next phases of this project, those factors will be subjected to a common method bias test to ensure that the 
relationships between factors are not biased. This result will be statistically analyzed to rank them. This will be done

Abstract 
The widespread adoption of  smart farms can drastically improve the effectiveness and efficiency of farming all 
over the world. The advent of smart farming can be seen as a quantum leap towards the 4th industrial revolution. 
However, there have been some challenges which need to be tackled in order to ensure the wide scale adoption of 
smart farming and this study intends to improve the penetration and effectiveness of the IOT devices with a 
geographic focus on rural areas in developing countries. This study explores the possibility of using a combination 
of technologies including but not limited to passive IOT devices,  micro controller  devices and satellite dishes. 
There would be consideration given to the use of a combination of micro controllers devices which are connected 
to regional satellite dishes or radio stations as deemed necessary as this will reduce the cost of investing in smart 
farms as this is also another major hurdle especially in developing countries which rely primarily on agriculture 
as their primary source of national income. Finally, this study will investigate weather resistant technologies and 
will aim to produce smart farms which can be reliable in the rural environments.

1.Introduction
The so-called 4th industrial revolution is arguably the widespread adoption of smart farming facilitated using IOT 
devices and data analytics (Ghobakhloo 2020).This is especially important because according to many estimates 
including the United Nations the global population is estimated to reach the 9 billion mark by 2050 and according 
to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations this implies that the agricultural production must 
increase by about 70 % and  this means smart farming which can lead to increased agricultural produce and 
reduced carbon emission  is vital to the survival of humanity in this century and is an important stride toward 
sustainability. The Agriculture 4.0 solutions include the use of IOT devices which gather information later used 
by decision  support systems capable of making accurate predictions. This information can lead to increased 
effectiveness and efficiency in agricultural production however, there are some challenges which have reduced 
the velocity of widespread adoption of smart farming among which the most important ones are the initial cost of 
investment, lack of internet penetration in many rural regions and the lack of security of the collected data. 
According to the United Nations international telecommunications union  around 2.9 billion people lack access to 
the internet all over the world as of 2021 (ITU  2021). This study intends to provide a conceptual framework only 
with thorough theoretical underpinning  based on extensive literature review which aims to increase internet 
penetration and improve the security of the data collected from IOT devices used in smart farming.

5.Conclusion
The benefits of using our conceptual framework stem primarily from waste reduction and is an elements in the 
implementation of the agriculture 4.0. This is especially the case since lean production techniques need to be 
applied to the agriculture 4.0 revolution to improve both efficiency and effectiveness. This is because,  IoT in 
agriculture allows for greater production control and cost-efficient management through the use of smart devices 
such as the micro controllers. As such, producers can accurately identify anomalies in crops and prevent 
infestations that harm yields by improving the disease prediction capabilities. The sensors installed in agricultural 
machinery can also help save on irrigation and fertilization costs. Additionally, these sensors can be programmed 
to notify producers of the ideal harvest time, leading to less waste in the crop. Therefore, this will result in 
proactive agricultural farming, and this will reduce waster waste and crop damage.

Abstract 
This study focuses on gasoline and diesel fuel distribution process at Boyolali fuel terminal, Indonesia. This terminal 
is responsible to deliver fuel to more than 294 fuel stations in Central and East Java provinces. The distribution area 
is divided into three zones, utilizing both single and multi-destination methods. Since the deliveries are done based on 
order priority and time windows, single-destination method is preferable, especially when delivering fuel to 47 gas 
station in Zone 3, causing a not optimal distribution scenario. Thus, a more effective and efficient distribution process 
for Zone 3 is needed. Creating an optimized distribution cost is started by clustering gas stations using P-Median, 
considering the distance between points. The optimization model is Multi Compartment Vehicle Routing Problem 
(MCVRP) with split delivery and multi product with the objective function of minimizing total distribution costs 
(considering tank truck’s fuel cost and carbon emission cost). Branch and Bound (B&B) algorithm is applied to solve 
the exact method of distribution route optimization, using LINGO software. The results show that by clustering Zone 
3 gas stations into 9, the total daily distribution costs are reduced from IDR 12,712,435.20 to IDR 9,179,116.80, 
resulting to 28% reduction.

1. Introduction
The demand for fossil fuel is increasing in line with Indonesians’ dependence on this non-renewable source of energy 
(Kushariyadi and Sugito 2022). Oil and gas companies are required to have high competitiveness against changes that 
occur to be able to keep up with their competitors. Therefore, the quantity and quality of the products, as well as the 
optimized distribution process are mandatory. 
The distribution system shows the relationship of each activity, where transportation as a link or bridge that connects 
between manufacturers and customers (Nasution 2008). Thus, it is necessary to manage transportation effectively and 
efficiently in order to optimize the company's operational costs. According to Zaroni (2015), transportation costs are 
the largest cost component in the logistics cost structure, covering for up to 50% of total logistics costs (Chopra et al. 
2016). Zaroni (2017) also conveys no less than 70% of logistics activities come from transportation and almost 90% 
of CO2 emissions are mostly caused by transportation activities. Thus, it is necessary to improve transportation 
management in a sustainable and consistent manner to reduce CO2 emissions. Efficiency and effectiveness of 
transportation can be achieved by optimizing the route that considers the distance travelled as well as the capacity and 
number of trucks used. 
One approach to determine the optimal distribution route undertaken by a fleet of vehicles to serve a particular set of 
customers is the Vehicle Routing Problem or VRP (Fauzi et al. 2021), and the type of VRP used in this study is the 
VRP model that considers multi compartment, because the tank trucks used for fuel delivery, consist of several

6.2 Suggestions 
Suggestions for further research on similar topics in the future are as follows: 
1) The problems solved can be more adapted to the actual conditions such as considering the cost of tank truck, rental 
and tank car crew costs, as well as the use of heterogeneous vehicles. 
2) Calculation of the distance between points can use methods other than Haversine, such as Euclidean distance or 
Manhattan distance adapted to the needs of determining the distance. 
3) For the VRP variant in the next study not only use the Multi Compartment Vehicle Routing Problem with Split 
Delivery and Multi Product variant but can be developed by increasing time windows, multi trips, multi period, 
and stochastic demand.  
4) The distribution route problem can be solved using methods other than Exact, that is, approach methods such as 
heuristics and metaheuristics to be able to solve more complex problems.

Abstract 
The warehouse is a place to store goods in the form of raw materials, work-in-process goods and finished goods and 
a place that provides information about the status and condition of goods stored in the warehouse so that information 
can be easily accessed by interested people. This study aims to identify and analyze PT Krakatau Jasa Logistics’ 
warehouse layout problems, provide cargo storage layout suggestions to maximize capacity using the dedicated 
storage method, and determine the warehouse layout that produces the largest warehouse utility value. A comparison 
of the current warehouse layout with the dedicated storage method was carried out to choose a warehouse layout by 
maximizing the free in the warehouse based on the greatest utilization. The results of the study show that the proposed 
layout has greater utility compared to the current layout, namely 81% and 19% for forklifts and trucks, where the 
proposed storage layout only has a little free space or has maximized cargo placement, but in the current warehouse, 
there is a warehouse utility that is equal to 36% where in the storage layout there is still a lot of empty space in the 
warehouse.

1. Introduction
The warehouse is a place to store goods in the form of raw materials, work in process goods and finished goods and a 
place that provides information about the status and condition of goods stored in the warehouse so that information 
can be easily accessed by interested people (Apple 1990, Francis, & White  1992). According to Heizer and Render 
(2009). The layout is a crucial decision in determining long-term operating efficiency. The layout has many strategic 
implications for determining a company's competitiveness in terms of capacity, maximizing the use of space in the 
warehouse, processes, flexibility, minimizing costs, quality of the work environment, customer contact, and corporate 
image. A practical layout helps a company to achieve a strategy that facilitates differentiation, low costs, or fast 
response. A layout strategy aims to create an economical layout that meets the competitive needs of the business. A 
good warehouse layout is by arranging the facilities in the warehouse so that workers can operate it more efficiently 
and speed up service. Workers no longer waste time looking for goods because they have been placed according to 
their characteristics. A good layout scheme will improve overall operating efficiency (Zhenyuan  et al.  2011).  
Technology is growing rapidly, resulting in many advances, especially in the design of developments using 
engineering drawing software. With increasingly sophisticated technology, it can help speed up the completion of a

The following is an example of calculating the mileage to the output: 
Mileage to output =
Tj
Sj  x Block distance to output  
= 120,5 𝑥𝑥 47,5 
= 5.723,16 
Based on the results of calculating the distance to the input, the current layout has a value of 1,814.91m, while the 
proposed layout has a distance of 13,072.89m. After making a comparison, the shortest distance to the input is 
obtained, namely in the current layout, because the current layout has (I/O) in several places, but after analysis, the 
warehouse activity is not effective because it can hinder one truck from another, which is carrying out unloading 
cargo. 
The following is the proposed Warehouse D layout which has a warehouse storage utility of 81% and utilities for 
forklifts and trucks running by 19%, which still has a lot of free space or still has not maximized warehouse space, as 
shown in Figure 3. 
Figure 3. Warehouse Proposed Layout D 
6. Conclusion
Based on the results of the research that has been done, namely analyzing the layout of the warehouse at PT Krakatau 
Jasa Logistik. Based on the results of calculations and data analysis 
After doing practical work, the authors found several problems in the PT Krakatau Jasa Logistik company, namely 
the layout of the warehouse, which was not neatly organized and did not have partitions for storing cargo which 
resulted in a lot of empty space to separate cargo from one another so that it did not mix. Companies often lack 
warehouses to store future cargo and this result in companies having to conduct surveys to find vacant warehouses 
according to the company's needs and SOPs for storing these cargoes, which results in companies having to incur 
more costs. Companies that still use a manual system make workers have to recap daily reports and recap as a whole 
at the end of the month, which results in frequent human errors. Judging from the closed warehouse and the lack of 
air circulation, the cargo stored in the warehouse is still in bulk form, or raw materials that are not packed using sacks 
can make the cargo moist, and the quality will decrease. 
To maximize cargo storage in the warehouse, partitions per block are made to maximize unused empty space and 
minimize the mixing of cargo with one another. Using the dedicated storage method, it will make it easier for 
companies to store cargo, inspect warehouses, and look for cargo in warehouses because warehouses have been

grouped by family. For example, such as Warehouse D is only for feed and food cargo, then Warehouse A is for 
chemical cargo. 
Based on the results of warehouse utility calculations, it shows that the proposed layout has a greater value than the 
current layout value, namely 81% and 19% for forklift and truck running, where the proposed storage layout only has 
a little free space or has maximized cargo placement, but in the current warehouse, there is a warehouse utility that is 
equal to 36% where in the storage layout there is still a lot of empty space in the warehouse.

Abstract 
Healthcare supply chain has increasingly attracted the attention of scholars, researchers, government officials, and 
clinicians as one of the primary strategies in their efforts to reduce healthcare costs while improving quality. Supply 
chain management is the coordination and collaboration of supply chain participants as a means to achieve system 
efficiency. The healthcare supply chain is one of these complex systems, with numerous players involved. This study 
is designed to answer the following questions: How significant is supply chain management to the healthcare sector? 
Are hospitals in Saudi Arabia properly implementing supply chain principles, techniques, and tools? The theories 
addressed contribute to a better understanding of supply chain management in hospitals. A case study was conducted 
at a prestigious private hospital in Jeddah to understand exactly how hospitals in Saudi Arabia are implementing 
supply chain management.

1. Introduction
Human life expectancy in the United States increased from 68.2 years in 1950 to 78.7 years in 2011. (OECD 2013). 
Life expectancy in the United States is estimated to reach 88.5 years by 2050. (Milken Institute 2013). As people live 
longer lives, the share of elderly populations will increase, as will the demand for healthcare services. A growing 
demand for more frequent and higher-quality healthcare services threatens to overwhelm the current healthcare system 
unless severe efforts are made to improve its efficiency and efficacy. A supply chain is generally defined as an 
integrated system that synchronizes a series of interconnected processes to: (1) create demand for products; (2) acquire 
raw materials and parts; (3) transform these raw materials and parts into finished products; (4) add value to these 
products; (5) distribute and promote these products to either retailers or end-customers; and (6) facilitate these products 
(Min and Zhou 2002).  
To capture the synergy of tetrafunctional and interorganizational integration and harmonization across healthcare 
operations, we must recognize the strategic importance of planning, managing, and designing the entire healthcare 
supply chain. The healthcare sector depends on a stable and reliable supply chain. It ensures that the vital industry's 
health remains in good shape by ensuring that medical equipment, medical supplies, and medication reach the retailer 
or patient smoothly and in a timely manner. The need of research and collaboration within this sector is crucial to 
drive healthcare organizations to seek designs that optimize service delivery performance. According to a new global 
healthcare supply chain industry analysis, the global healthcare supply chain management market will develop at a 
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.8% from 2020 to 2025, rising from 2.2 billion to 3.3 billion during the 
forecast period (Redbird Logistics Services 2020). 
 The following are the primary drivers of market growth: 
• Increased adoption of supply chain management software

outcomes, the healthcare industry has been noticeably hesitant to embrace supply chain management approaches. By 
utilizing supply chain tools such as: Six Sigma, ABC Analysis, FIFO, and Capacity Planning which have been proven 
to be efficient, hospitals can achieve their goals of achieving all rounded higher quality and better service. The 
healthcare business is interrelated, one part cannot achieve efficiency while leaving others behind. Healthcare 
providers are under immense pressure today as a result of increased competition, government regulations, growing 
costs, and increased demand for improved quality of service. By evaluating supply chain performance, all healthcare 
organizations can strive for value addition across the whole supply chain.

Abstract 
In Indonesia, there are not many MSME’s Banks, so it is demanded that they continue to be improved through 
digital financial application. This makes the competition in obtaining users so large, that MSME’s Banks must 
make a strategy to increase the number of application users. This study aims to increase MSME’s users of bank 
applications. This study uses a qualitative method through in-depth interviews with eight respondents who are 
directly related to the implementation of MSME’s bank finance strategies. Analysis of interview data using SWOT, 
IE Matrix, Five Forces' Porters, Fishbone, Grand Strategy Matrix, and QSPM. The results of the study show that 
the leading MSME’s banks implement a market penetration strategy, because the application has a large market 
penetration potential from customers who do not yet have an application whose number is still very large, and 
prospective bank customers who will become application users. Another strategy is to accelerate the introduction 
of applications to various regions through advertisements and social media to increase public awareness of 
MSME’s digital bank financial application.

1. Introduction
Based on data from the Indonesian Ministry of Cooperatives and MSME’s, the number of MSME’s in Indonesia 
is more than 64 million (www.djkn.kemenkeu.go.id). This number is about 25% of the total population of 
Indonesia. With a large number like this, it is not directly proportional to the number of banks focusing on the 
MSME’s segment, which is not many in Indonesia. The potential for an increase in the number tends to increase 
every year, and there are currently developments in digital applications that are growing rapidly, so the existing 
MSME’s Banks must adapt to these developments. With conditions of intense competition from non-MSME’s 
banks, and digital fintech applications, MSME’s banks need to adapt to this and create a competitive strategy to 
deal with it. Since the launch of the digital application from MSME’s banks, this digital application requires a 
very important user to increase income for the bank. With an increase in users, this is directly proportional to the 
increase in fee-based income for MSME’s banks. In addition, when viewed through the number of MSME’s bank 
customers, MSME’s banks actually benefit greatly because they have a larger number of customers than non-
MSME’s banks, and new fintech companies have sprung up. Therefore, with a large number of customers, this is 
a potential for the bank's digital application. 
With the existence of a big threat from the outside, digital applications need a strategy to increase the number of 
users. Currently, the strategy has been carried out by the application, but the year-to-year acceleration of user 
growth must continue to increase, so the business team must re-optimize the user increase acceleration strategy. 
A strategic review of internal and external factors is needed to optimize the current strategy. In addition, every 
digital application is currently competing to innovate transaction features. Fulfilling the needs of all transactions 
from customers is an attraction for customers to join as digital application users. On the other hand, MSME’s 
digital applications already have large potential customers, but the absorption of these customers to become users 
is an important thing for digital applications to pay attention to. Currently, digital applications have an absorption 
capacity of around 10% of digital application users. Conditions like this indicate that there is still unreached 
potential for 90% of other existing customers, so optimizing user uptake of existing and non-existing customers 
is something that digital applications need to pay maximum attention to. In addition, apart from increasing user 
applications from non-existing customers, this will also contribute to an increase in MSME’s bank customers as 
well.

The QSPM application has a yield value of 6,736, where the strategy that can be implemented is market 
penetration. Applications must maximize internal strength so that they can explore the market potential that 
already exists in the application. The existing market is a huge potential that must be utilized optimally by the 
application. Not all applications have the same number of customers as micro, small, and medium banks. Several 
steps can be taken by the application from creating events in areas where you want to increase user acquisition. 
Of course, before taking any promotional steps it must be based on in-depth research, and data-driven so that the 
results are right on target. Regions that do not yet have fewer users can be targeted. Apart from that, another 
promotional step is to induce people to make transactions. This lure can be in the form of discounts, cashback, 
and others. In addition, the use of social media will certainly help increase the penetration power of applications 
in society. Therefore, various efforts must be made starting with posters, promotional videos, and others so that 
the application can attract the wider community to join application. 
6 Conclusion 
Based on the results of the research that has been done, some strategies must be implemented by the application 
team. The market penetration strategy is currently the best strategy to develop the number of application users. 
This needs to be done by the application because there is a large market potential from bank customers who are 
not yet application users. The large potential of customers makes the potential unreachable for applications, so 
market development for large potential customers needs to be considered. 
Another strategy is to introduce applications to several areas that have not been optimally reached. The use of 
social media is a good attraction for efforts to introduce applications widely. Introducing public awareness of 
digital financial applications for MSME’s banks is very important because the potential circulation of money that 
is so large at the level of micro, small, and medium transactions is a potential for a large increase in revenue for 
banks through application transactions.

Abstract 
The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the barriers and critical 
success factors that influence in the implementation of Lean Supply Chain Management (LSCM) practices in the 
industry. Through the analysis systematic literature review, it is hoped to identify the main gaps related to LSCM 
implementation in literature and industry and also discusses the relevance of research in this topic for indicating 
the future research direction. A SLR method was used, developed and determined.  It is about 48 research articles 
were analyzed. The content of the present literature was reviewed, critically analyzed and synthesized from the 
perspective of barrier and critical success factors that influence the implementation of LSCM. Based on the 
extensive systematic review of the literature, we discovered the consistency data between Barriers and Critical 
Success Factors. This study strengthens the body of knowledge on the issue and consolidates the key LSCM 
activities, extending previous studies on LSCM barriers and critical success factors associated with its 
implementation. The clear identification of these topics can allow researchers and practitioners to predict 
occasional problems and to set the right standards for the implementation of the LSCM.

1. Introduction
A supply chain is a dynamic structure that consists of technology, people, organization, information, activities 
and resources. The supply chain does not only apply to manufacturing firms only; it also applies to service firms, 
which are increasingly focusing on supply chain management to ensure that their customers receive prompt 
service (Alomari 2021). Activities in the supply chain turn natural commodities, raw materials and components 
into semi-finished and finished goods that are then delivered to end customer and distributors (Zhou & Ji 2015).  
The growing emphasis on sustainability in supply chain management (SCM) has contributed to the growth of a 
distinct area of interest for over the last three decades: sustainable supply chain management SSCM (Pagell and 
Shevchenko, 2014). International business strategy has shifted in recent years. The entire distribution of raw 
materials to consumers is known as an integrated whole in lean supply chain. Therefore, interfaces between phases 
i.e. between companies-suppliers and customers) are seen as artificial, created not as normal stages of transition
in the development of value, but as a result of the economic arrangement of properties controlled by many variable. 
The variables are convenient configurations of technology, labor skills and geographical location of raw materials
(Lamming 1996). The supply chain management requires operational and supply chain alignment, scheduling and 
cooperation of functions such as planning of distribution, market analysis, ordering, production planning,
warehousing, material handling, inventory, packing, order processing and shipping. In today's business worlds,
all of these functions are used as building blocks in the supply chain management (Agus 2012).
The Toyota Production System (TPS) is the benchmark utilized all through the world as the establishment for 
""lean"" thinking. At Toyota, the TPS practices and standards expand well past the manufacturing plant dividers to 
incorporate the all-inclusive production network and require some urgent decisions to guarantee supply chain 
effectiveness (Lander and Liker 2007).

Abstract 
The technique for site surveys at telecommunication towers in Malaysia has always been the conventional way rather 
than the new technique. A Radio Frequency (RF) site survey is arranging and scheming a wireless network to 
administer a wireless elucidation that will give the necessary circumstances. The results of these RF readings using a 
spectrum analyser to determine the non-overlapping frequencies when planning for a new RF transmission later. The 
current RF observation process may be time-consuming, but the safety and accuracy could be improved, affecting cost 
and quality. There have been many past tests that have used drones as tools to carry tools according to their respective 
objectives based on previous research, and most carry an improvement. The information gathered on whether the 
conventional or the new technique is more sustainable, which based on a case study on several similar sites using two 
distinct techniques, the conventional and a drone, as carrier agents of measurement tools. From the comparison, the 
RF scanning survey using the drone technique was much faster in execution, cheaper, and collected better data than 
the conventional method. This proves that this new technique can be practised for how it works in the future.

1. Introduction
In Malaysia, the technique for frequency scanning (FS) at telecommunication towers has always been the conventional 
way which requires a competent person with a degree of knowledge in the matter that has to climb the 
telecommunication tower while carrying a lot of tools and equipment to get the reading at a certain height of the tower 
(Farahani 2008). In another part of the world, a new technique has been introduced to perform the FS that requires 
less cost and is much safer than the conventional technique (Griffin et al. 2006).  
This new technique utilizes a drone to perform the tasks that have been carried out by human practitioners before. 
These drones are in line with opinions such as although initially drones were primarily used for military applications, 
they have been recently adopted by the leisure sector, thus becoming cheaper and more feature-rich. This has opened 
the doors for researchers and businesses to find applications of this technology for various purposes (López et al. 
2017).  López et al. 2017, also said that the possibility of using drones that can fly autonomously reduces the risk of 
accidents caused by an error of the human and drones can be equipped with a wide variety of sensors. The most 
common sensors that can be found on drones are categorized by purpose.

6. Conclusion 
Table 4 outlines the RF site survey using a drone, showing that it excels in the Project Management Triangle, which 
is cheaper, much faster, and has higher quality data than the conventional method. It is sufficient to say that the drone 
RF site survey is a more sustainable practice for the future.

authority. 
Very fast and efficient as it eliminates 
the need for setup for every site and

RSL measurement 
Observations can only be made on the 
rest platform, where it is often not 
accurate to the objective frequency path 
causing low RSL strength, and some 
RSLs cannot be observed 
Using a drone as a carrier agent can be 
done exactly to the objective, and there 
is no need for humans to climb many 
benefits in terms of safety, and time can 
also be done immediately in every 
situation, including in times of disaster. 
 
Based on the comparisons, we can conclude that the new RF site survey method using drones as the carrier for 
measurement tools is better than the conventional method. The RF site survey is a lot faster in terms of execution 
which is the ratio is 8 to 1. This practice is not just great but also can increase productivity. The workflow of the work 
that needs to be done is also cut, thus shortening the operation schedule. The cost for the RF site survey using the 
drone is also much cheaper since the cost that must be spent is only for the drone, the competent person, and many 
more. The RF site survey using drone also collect better data than the conventional method. This proves that the RF 
site survey using the drone is a more sustainable practice for the future. It can be said that practitioners look forward 
to using drone technique methods in the future.

Abstract 
In most countries, buildings consume about 50% of the total energy. High energy consumption is still addressed 
by stakeholders through traditional technical methods, such as design considerations. However, studies suggest 
that strategic actions achieve a zero net energy or low energy goal depending on the behaviour of building 
occupants. The objective of this study is to develop methods for modeling and evaluating occupant behaviour 
in green office buildings. Specifically, this paper aims to present the research questions and hypotheses for the 
main investigation and to identify the predictors of occupant behaviour in conventional and green buildings 
based on a literature review. The research found that the behaviour of building occupants in interacting with or 
using the building, such as using blinds, and curtains, controlling lighting, opening and closing windows, the 
way they dress, and the temperature of their drinking water to adjust the indoor environment to their needs or 
tastes, has a strategic impact on the energy performance and consumption of the building. The study also found 
that the building envelope, building services, natural ventilation, daylighting, artificial lighting, and thermal 
comfort are the most important predictors of occupant behaviour in green office buildings. User satisfaction 
with the building depends on user interaction with the building system and the extent of user adaptation and 
social value systems. It is found that the ontology of positivism and the epistemology of objectivism are the 
appropriate metaphysical orientations for the main research. The main research includes qualitative and 
quantitative data. The results suggest that performance surveys, simulations, experiments, case studies, and 
questionnaires are appropriate for the main research.

Introduction 
This research is part of ongoing research that looks at the energy management of office buildings in Malaysia by 
comparing green buildings with conventional buildings. This is a ground-breaking study on green energy 
modeling that incorporates thermal physiological data to reveal the effects of thermal comfort on human behaviour 
in the workplace when establishing a baseline model. Buildings have a significant impact on sustainability

4. Conclusion and further research  
Even though research on this topic is increasing, it is still in its infancy. Most of the extant studies are based on 
literature reviews or sponsored studies. The list of what the researchers think to be the reality of energy 
management in office buildings will include many superfluous constructs while leaving out many vital constructs 
if this is not the case. The research design for the main research was presented. This research argued for multiple 
techniques of data collection to predict the model performance of the buildings. Occupant behaviour has a 
significant impact on the building's energy consumption. To increase office occupant productivity and satisfaction 
and to maximize the building's energy performance, there is a need to model the energy performance of the 
buildings using multiple approaches of the survey, simulation, case study, and experiments. In particular, occupant 
behaviour is not assimilated into the building energy management model.

Abstract 
The impact of e-commerce and the ever-increasing integration of the online world to the daily lives of citizens are the 
driving reasons for the creation of this thesis. To help streamline the user’s shopping experience, the E-Commerce 
Cheapest Clusterer (ECCC) achieves this goal by doing its namesake: to group similar products into corresponding 
clusters and select the most affordable product in each of the clusters. The result is then displayed in an easy-to-browse 
interface that directly connects to the project’s target website, Lazada. The images are compared using the Structural 
Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). If the value returned by the SSIM function is greater than a certain threshold, the 
image enters the same cluster as the one it was compared to. To ensure efficiency, this paper also investigates the 
results of different threshold values. Setting a lower threshold value resulted in the algorithm finishing faster at the 
cost of several misplaced images in clusters, whereas a higher threshold value gave the program a considerable runtime 
but was less prone to misidentification. Additionally, the testing also revealed that setting the threshold value too high 
can hinder the program’s ability to cluster similar images even if the difference is slight.

1. Introduction
The rise of the Internet era and the gradual integration of technology into every aspect of the daily lives of people has 
led to an ever more digital lifestyle for global citizens. The Philippines and its citizens are no stranger to the 
cyberspace; in fact, by January 2022, there were 76.01 million internet users in the country (Kemp 2022). This is 
helped by the fact that mobile phones have become ubiquitous in the life of people, no matter the class or social status. 
In the growing integration of society into the digital world, we come across new developments in different fields that 
previously were grounded outside of the digital world. 
One of the facets of such a development is the advent of e-commerce, a relatively new branch of computer science 
that subsists on an online level (Blazewicz et al.  2016). According to a report on 2020 by Philippine Daily Inquirer, 
Lazada enjoys a monthly visit of over 34 million, followed by Shopee at over 19 million monthly visits. Looking at 
the same source that the report had cited (https://iprice.ph/insights/mapofecommerce/en/), the numbers have shifted 
even greater with its latest report, with Shopee enjoying 71 million monthly visits and Lazada at 36 million, as of Q2 
of 2022. The surprising shift in monthly visits indicate a growing popularity of e-commerce as an aspect of daily life, 
in the case of Shopee's explosive growth; as well as consistency of the trend, in the case of Lazada’s monthly visit 
numbers.

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
The system could potentially benefit from using hybrid algorithms, such as using both MSE and SSIM together and 
then applying different weighted values to both outputs when considering what images fit in a cluster. It is also worth 
considering to develop a mobile version of the system, as a huge portion of online shopping is done through 
smartphone applications of the e-commerce websites. For such an undertaking, the future researchers or developers 
must consider the feasibility of the following scenarios: whether the algorithm running the image comparison can be 
done on the customer’s own phone (client-side), or if it should be deployed in the cloud and the customer must connect 
to the system that way. Lastly, another avenue to explore is to try achieving the same objectives this paper did with 
different parameters instead such as a product’s title, or their description page, essentially touching on the field of 
natural language processing. 
 
6. Conclusion 
At the beginning of the paper, the problem of convenience regarding online shopping was brought up and has been 
the central objective of the project. The system was able to accomplish each step as outlined and produces an output 
within the expectations of the research. In addition, the system was also tested on different parameters and test cases 
in order to help identify the matters that could be finetuned. As demonstrated in the discussion of results, there was a 
clear pattern that emerged when setting up the threshold of the image processing algorithm. Because a lower threshold 
meant that the compared images could be less similar to each other, the system would only generate fewer clusters. 
While the number of clusters itself was not a problem, it was instead the number of misidentified images within each

of the cluster, rendering many of the clusters incoherent and unable to represent a majority. On the other hand, setting 
a threshold of perfect similarity – meaning 1.0 – meant that the program would only accept perfect comparisons 
between images. This would run the risk of not clustering images that are actually the same product but have been 
classified otherwise because of small imperfections in the image file. 
With the test cases conducted and observed through different datasets (earphones, gaming mouse, face mask), the 
numbers suggest that the optimal threshold to set for the system is 0.9. All of these were achieved and written using 
the programming language Python and external libraries that were designed for Python. As such it can be concluded 
that the project has answer all of the problem statements and has met all of its original objectives that were stated at 
the first chapter.

Abstract 
Maintenance actions have an important role in maintaining product availability, reliability, and quality in the 
production process. Strategies for carrying out maintenance actions have evolved over time, and technological 
advances and research are developing rapidly. Matter It aims to build a more efficient and reliable system. Equipment 
performance that continues to decrease over time without effective maintenance falls into the extreme damage 
category. Increasing age and use cause a decrease in the function of the equipment. To assess reduction due to age and 
reduction due to use, this study employs a hybrid hazard rate. Maintenance is carried out when the equipment reaches 
a predetermined reliability threshold. After several uses, the preventive system will be replaced. Until now, there has 
been no research to determine maintenance actions that optimize availability with a specified reliability threshold. 
This research will try to model a maintenance policy strategy that optimizes availability with predetermined threshold 
values. The goal is that the owner can evaluate the performance of the equipment so as to avoid the risk of loss of 
equipment availability due to maintenance actions. At the end, a numerical experiment is given to illustrate the 
implementation of the proposed model.

1. Introduction
Equipment is an important part of the production process. equipment with a high level of availability is needed to win 
the competition with its competitors. Increasing age and use of production equipment causes the system to experience 
a decrease in performance so that maintenance is needed. Maintenance actions result in reduced production time and 
can reduce equipment availability. For this reason, a strategy is needed in managing treatment actions. The strategy in 
carrying out maintenance actions is expected so that the equipment can work optimally by increasing the reliability of 
the equipment, preventing failure and in order to reduce maintenance costs. 
Maintenance actions can be carried out with preventive actions (PM) and corrective actions (CM) according to Barlow 
& Hunter (1960). Preventive measures to reduce the risk of failure and improve operational conditions. While 
corrective action is to repair the equipment so that it returns to operation. When the system reaches the reliability 
threshold preventive maintenance is performed. and replacement after several preventive times. Maintenance actions 
result in the system being ""as good as new"" or ""as bad as old"". 
A lot of research done in the field of maintenance. This shows the importance of a maintenance strategy. In order to 
obtain an optimal strategy policy, the optimization model development is carried out. Other researchers produced 
many variations of maintenance optimization models. Unlike the model in this study. This research will model a 
preventive maintenance policy that optimizes availability by considering the reliability threshold determined by the 
owner. The goal is to be able to evaluate strategies for carrying out maintenance on equipment, so as to avoid the risk 
of loss of equipment availability due to maintenance actions. Reliability thresholds are determined so as to maximize 
availability. This study uses the Weilbull distribution for the initial damage rate. Then this study will also use the 
hybrid hazard rate proposed by Lin et al.  (2001). System degradation considering age and usage is the reason for

6. Conclusion  
1. A mathematical model of maintenance policy that maximizes equipment usage while also optimizing availability 
by taking the reliability threshold into account. The owner can assess the maintenance action plan implemented. 
Maintenance operations (preventative repair and preventive replacement) will have an impact on the size of the 
availability value. The following elements are used in the availability value modeling:: 
• 
Threshold Reliability (Rth) 
• 
Period Preventive Replacement (δrp) 
• 
Period Preventive Repair (δcp) 
2. The following findings are attained based on the outcomes of the numerical experiment of this study model: 
• 
The level of equipment availability decreases with the amount of time required for preventive replacement, 
or 10,50,100,500 (Days). 
• 
The maintenance time decreases as the specified reliability level, which ranges from 85% to 95%, 
increases. 
• 
There are more preventative repairs made and less availability of the equipment the higher the value of the 
failure rate of the rental equipment (shape parameter), particularly (1.5, 2.5, 3.5).

Abstract 
To emphasize the significance of “supply chain integration in marketing”, the study aimed to present an overview 
of previous studies. The study employed “Biblioshiny”, a web interface of the ""Bibliometrics"" package of ""R-
studio,"" to conduct bibliometric analysis and visualization. Supply chains and marketing are the most frequently 
used keywords in “titles”, “abstracts”, and “author keywords”. In order to determine prospective study directions 
and themes for the supply chain integration in marketing, we employed a conceptual framework. By using a “co-
occurrence network,” four study streams are discovered. These research areas include marketing and commerce, 
as well as supply chain management. The study analysed the documents based on the keywords, sources, countries 
and year. Finally, by classifying important topics into ""basic or transversal"", ""emerging or declining"", and “motor"", 
highly developed, but isolated themes, a “thematic map” is employed to provide a comprehensive overview. 
Future directions and important areas for research have been suggested by these themes and subthemes. The study 
also points out the synthesis of past literature including its objectives, findings and suggested future research 
directions.

1. Introduction
Supply chain integration research has been taken into consideration as early as the 1990s, with the recognition of 
its importance in improving firm performance and competitiveness (Huo et al. 2014). However, in recent years, 
it has drawn more attention, especially in light of the advent of omni-channel retailing and the digital age (Song 
and Song 2021). The importance of supply chain integration in marketing lies in its ability to improve efficiency, 
reduce costs, and increase responsiveness to customer needs (Singh et al. 2018). Additionally, it enables greater 
interaction and coordination between the various supply chain stakeholders, including manufacturers, suppliers, 
and retailers (Jin and Shin 2021). This research is crucial because it identifies the importance for supply chain 
integration and aids firms in understanding the possible advantages and difficulties of implementing them. It also 
assists firms in determining the elements, such as management ties, IT capabilities, and trust, that influence the 
achievement or failure of integration of supply chains projects (Chen et al. 2018; Hald and Mouritsen 2018; Kumar 
et al. 2020). The performance of the supply chain can be enhanced, and strategic decisions can be informed by 
this information. Additionally, research on supply chain integration can help organizations navigate the changing 
business landscape and adapt to new technologies and trends, such as the 4th industrial revolution (Hurriyati et 
al. 2020; Vilar et al. 2022). Additionally, it can assist firms in comprehending the function of supply chain 
integration in solving global issues like the coronavirus pandemic (Zhou et al. 2022). 
1.1 Study Objective and Research Question  
Study objective: To provide an overview of the past literature to highlight the importance of supply chain 
integration in marketing.  
The following are the research questions: 
 “RQ1: How has the concept of supply chain integration in marketing been investigated in terms of  year, region, 
contexts, and outcomes?.” 
 “RQ2: What are the extant literature’s limitations?.” 
 “RQ3: What are the future research directions for supply chain integration in marketing?”

7. Conclusion  
Based on the research and studies discussed above, it is clear that “supply chain integration” plays a crucial role 
in the success of marketing efforts. Through the integration of various elements of the supply chain, such as 
suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and customers, businesses can improve their performance, innovation, and 
competitiveness. This is achieved through the sharing of information, resources, and collaboration between 
different supply chain stakeholders. However, the supply chain integration also requires the consideration of 
various factors, such as IT capabilities, HR strategies, trust, and social capital, to achieve optimal results. In 
addition, the integration of the supply chain also has an impact on sustainability, as it allows for the 
implementation of green practices and the promotion of social responsibility. Therefore, it is important for 
businesses to prioritize supply chain integration in their marketing efforts to drive growth and success. The study 
conducted a systematic literature review analysis for the selected 30 papers by year, reference, objectives, and 
findings. One of the major limitations of the past literatures were that the studies rarely discussed limitations and 
future research directions. This study limitation is that the study only considered the relevant recent English 
language papers for the literature review. “Supply chain integration in marketing and commerce” is found to be 
in higher relevance (high centrality) but its development stage (density) is low. Future researchers can explore 
this area. Future researchers can conduct study on How supply chain integration is impacting different industries 
and what are the barriers associated with supply chain integration?

Abstract 
Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a data-driven philosophy that drives performance improvement by eliminating waste and 
reducing variability. Food Manufacturing (FM) companies introduce programs like LSS to improve competitiveness. 
However, LSS implementations are complicated and complex. Companies must carefully manage the implementation 
of LSS to achieve the desired outcomes. In line with this, proper management of Critical Success Factors (CSFs) can 
enhance the initiative’s chances of success. This research aims to identify, rank, and understand the CSFs, and 
recommend strategies to manage them within Philippine FM companies. A combined approach of structured literature 
review, structured survey, and structured interview were used to gather the necessary data. The thematic analysis and 
Relative Importance Index method revealed that there are 15 CSFs. These CSFs were synthesized into 4 clusters: 
Synergy, Expertise in LSS, Effective Management, and Dedicated Leadership. Thus, to be successful, all stakeholders 
within the company must have the essential hard and soft skills to execute the DMAIC framework and manage the 
initiative as a whole. More importantly, they must have the proper working environment, be aligned to the intended 
goal, and fully cooperate and contribute to the activities that must be accomplished to achieve the target future state.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing in the Philippines has always been an important sector of the economy. It accounts for more than fifty 
percent of the country’s industrial sector and around twenty-five percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). It is 
comprised of sub-sectors such as food, tobacco, textile, chemical, metal, and equipment manufacturing, to name a 
few. However, among its sub-sectors, the single most significant component of Philippine manufacturing is food 
manufacturing (FM) (Department of Trade and Industry 2020). 
The FM industry contributes more value to the GDP than any other manufacturing sub-sector. It accounts for more 
than thirty-five percent of the total manufacturing value contribution from the 1990s until the early 2010s. It also 
employs the most among the sub-sectors, with an average employment contribution of more than twenty percent (from 
2001 to 2010) and twenty-five percent (from 2011 to 2013) (Department of Trade and Industry 2020). 
The industry’s importance to the economy has been highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic that we are currently 
experiencing. To curb the spread of the virus, the Philippine government implemented lockdowns throughout the 
nation. However, this resulted in many local consumers' early stockpiling of essential food products concerned about 
running out of stock (Euromonitor 2021). While FM companies were able to deliver, they had difficulties in satisfying 
customers’ demands and expectations.

6.2 Conclusion to Research Question 2: Does the LSS framework address these CSFs? If not, what 
can be improved on the framework to help address the CSFs? 
Utilizing thematic analysis, the researcher identified that the CSFs can be addressed throughout the current DMAIC 
framework and the encompassing LSS program of the implementing organization. However, to address the CSFs, the 
experts commented that the DMAIC framework must be rigorously followed and properly delivered. In addition, an 
LSS program must be in place to ensure a holistic and sustainable approach to the initiative and, more importantly, 
prepare the company for the changes that will be implemented. Therefore, by following these, the belters can ensure 
they can satisfy the CSFs and guarantee the success of their LSS implementation. 
 
While it is mentioned that the current LSS framework is sufficient to address the CSFs, the experts still suggested the 
following opportunities for improvement: (1) the explicit inclusion of the CSF Employee Benefits, Incentives, and 
Rewards in the DMAIC framework and the overall LSS program, (2) the increased emphasis on the use of the most 
recent technologies when brainstorming solutions in the Improve Phase, and (3) the addition of the Benchmarking 
Phase before the Improve Phase. It is important to recognize that these suggestions are aimed at increasing the chances 
of success to address the CSFs and updating the methodology to the present-day economic and technological 
landscape. 
 
6.3 Recommendations 
It is imperative that the LSS belters and FM companies address the 15 CSFs to succeed in implementing LSS in their 
organizations. This is because the CSFs hold a special role in ensuring good LSS implementation practices are 
achieved. Given this, out of the 15 CSFs, 6 CSFs aimed at ensuring that there is Synergy between all the relevant 
stakeholders. 3 CSFs are directed to make sure that there is sufficient Expertise in LSS within the company. In 
addition, 4 CSFs are designed to guarantee that Effective Management of the LSS project and the program as a whole 
is present throughout. Finally, 2 CSFs are focused on ensuring that Dedicated Leadership is available to support the 
initiative. 
 
In addressing the CSFs, LSS belters, and FM companies must properly build a holistic LSS program first, as this will 
support the CSFs and the implementation as a whole. They must not immediately dive in and execute an LSS project 
without laying the groundworks for the complete continuous improvement program. Therefore, practitioners must not 
rush in the implementation of LSS as this negatively affects the perception of the initiative. 
 
On the project level, the DMAIC framework is a complete and sufficient approach to address the CSFs, as mentioned 
in the previous sections. Given this, the belters must be thorough and careful in following the steps and activities 
within the DMAIC framework to fully address each of the CSFs. 
 
Thus, to be successful in implementing LSS, all stakeholders within the company must have the necessary hard and 
soft skills to execute the DMAIC framework and manage the initiative as a whole. More importantly, they must have 
the proper working environment, be aligned to the intended goal, and fully cooperate and contribute to the activities 
that must be accomplished to achieve the target future state.

Abstract 
Many unpredictable events make risk management a topic of discussion to avoid losses that affect organizational 
performance. Many studies have been conducted on risk management maturity, but research on risk maturity models 
to measure organizational risk is still limited. Therefore this study aims to answer several questions related to the 
application and maturity of risk management by using a systematic literature review of 30 literatures. There are three 
stages in conducting a Systematic Literature Review namely planning, screening  and analysis. Based on the review, 
bibliographic summaries, detailed case studies, objectives and scope and maturity models were obtained. It was found 
that the application field that has the highest average risk maturity level is project management followed by supply 
chain management and the lowest is management information system. Maturity level consists of 5 levels. The results 
of measuring the risk maturity level show that most of the research is only at levels 1, 2, and 3. Several variables need 
to be added to the maturity risk model, such as continuous improvement, time, and quality. It is recommended to use 
the Living Engineering Process (LEGO) Approach and sensitivity analysis in processing and developing a risk 
maturity model for further research.

1. Introduction
Risk management is a topic that is often discussed by the industry, both large companies and Small and Medium 
Enterprises (SMEs) (Sukanta et al.  2020). The occurrence of risks, either positive (opportunity) or negative (threat), 
is unavoidable in organization  because its  surrounded with uncertainties (Murray  2009). Risk management is 
important because many organizations experience losses, such as loss of income, loss of public trust, and even paying 
fines. Some organizations cannot adapt and there is no action taken to prevent these risks (Hadiwardoyo 2020). Risk 
management is needed to overcome possible losses and achieve organizational goals (Sofyan 2005). In managing risk 
management, companies need to measure risk maturity level, which is an approach to identify risks that will occur 
and determine the appropriate response based on the company's risk appetite (Zhao et al.  2013). To be able to make 
improvements in risk management, organizations need the right tools that can help them identify areas of improvement 
and measure progress in improving risk management. Risk management maturity model is used to assist this goal 
(Yeo and Ren  2009). 
In recent years, especially from 2016 to 2020, there have been many studies discussing risk maturity and have been 
published both in journals and proceedings. The object of study ranges from enterprise risk management, project risk 
management, Information Technology  risk management, to Occupational health and Safety (OHS) risk management, 
which has a wide range of applications. Likewise, the methods used to select variables and develop risk maturity 
models are also different. The motivations and objectives of conducting research also differ from one another. Until 
now there has been no agreement regarding the variables used, the level of risk maturity, and the stages of data

Abstract 
This research aimed to investigate the impact of passive design techniques on building envelope design. Whereas 
assessment of the heat transfer rate through building envelopes is frequently done using the OTTV standards 
worldwide. The research includes two parameters for measuring the thermal performance of the building facade. The 
first measurement uses a methodical approach to calculate the wall's thermal transmittance (U-values) and then moves 
on to calculate the OTTV. The OTTV of the case study was computed using the OTTV formula given by the Malaysian 
Standard. At the same time, building specifications were determined via a site examination. After that, the OTTV was 
compared with a recommended standard value for the local climate. New building materials and specifications are 
proposed when the OTTV value exceeds the standard range. The results indicated that the present OTTV value is 
55.31 W/sq.m, more significant than the proposed value for a standard commercial building. It recommended 
considering 6 mm single glazing low e-glass for all windows on the East, West, South, and North elevations. As a 
result, the OTTV was lowered to 45.34 W/sq.m. Since air conditioning consumes most of the energy in an office 
building, lowering the OTTV will result in a slightly reduced air-conditioning cooling load.

1. Introduction
The effect of greenhouse gas emissions has been acknowledged worldwide, and there is an urgent need to advocate 
for efforts to regulate primary energy usage around the globe (Sheng et al., 2020). According to studies (Min et al., 
2022; Zhang et al., 2022), buildings currently account for up to one-third of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, 
mainly due to the use of fossil fuels during the construction phase. The building industry uses up to 40% of all energy 
and produces up to 30% of the world's annual greenhouse gas emissions (Lakhiar et al., 2021). A substantial portion 
of the overall energy demand for buildings is accounted for by the electricity necessary to maintain inhabitants' thermal 
comfort level. In the United States, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems account for 37% of the total 
energy used in the construction industry (Santamouris, 2016); in Japan and Hong Kong, commercial buildings 
consume 25% to 30% of the total energy in the construction industry for heating and cooling (Natephra et al., 2018). 
In addition, air conditioning in large office buildings consumes a significant amount of power in Thailand, especially 
during the summer (Natephra et al., 2018). In the same situation in Malaysia, air conditioning devices in office and 
residential buildings require tremendous amounts of electrical power, mostly on hot days. Building designers

Abstract 
Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models have been proven successful in application and 
simple in comprehension and consequently, they have been widely applied to different fields in forecasting. The 
order of an ARIMA model is determined subjectively based on the judgment of the experts where, the 
autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots for a given time series are used 
to determine the potential orders of the model. In this paper, a new heuristic algorithm is proposed for determining 
the order of ARIMA models. The proposed method determines the order of the ARIMA models, objectively, 
based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Schwarz Bayesian Information 
Criterion (BIC). In this regard, the order of the models is determined objectively and as a result, the forecasting 
results would be more accurate. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated based on a real-world 
dataset of global temperature anomaly where, the results show that the proposed method performs accurately and 
efficiently in determining the order of ARIMA models.

1. Introduction
Forecasting plays a crucial role in many fields including finance, business, environmental sciences, medicine and 
so on. Many different methods such as time series analysis, regression analysis and artificial intelligence can be 
implemented in forecasting. The chosen method mainly depends on the purpose of the forecasting as well as the 
accuracy of each method. Time series data are among the most valuable data in the forecasting field. Time series 
data refers to the chronological sequence of observations on the variable of interest taken at equally spaced points 
in time. In recent years, different models have been developed to analyze the time series data. These models have 
different purposes and accuracies including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, 
regression models, exponential smoothing models, and Holt-Winter models (Gooijer & Hyndman 2006). ARIMA 
models are one of the most popular and widely used statistical methods for forecasting time-series data. The 
ARIMA models characterize the existing trend in a sequence and extrapolate the trend to anticipate the future 
(Montgomery et al. 2015). 
In spite of the wide application of ARIMA models, difficulty of constructing an adequate model based on the 
information provided by finite number of observations remains. Difficulty arises in different stages of constructing 
the model. It should be noted that building an ARIMA model consist of three stages including model identification, 
parameter estimation, and diagnostic checking and selection between competing models. There are several means 
for determining the potential order of ARIMA models. In this process, the order of ARIMA models is determined 
commonly based on the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots. In other 
words, the researcher investigates the ACF and PACF plots and suggests some potential orders and candidate 
models. It should be noted that the subjectivity in the first step of model building process can result in more 
iterations of other steps. In addition, this problem would be intensified when the number of observations is less 
than required number of observations.

Following the classical approach for order determination of ARIMA models, with regard to the ACF and PACF 
plots which are shown in Figure 3, different models are nominated. The parameters of the potential models are 
estimated by Minitab software. Final model is chosen based on the selection criteria. It can be easily shown that, 
following the classic approach, the same results are obtained.

5. Conclusions
To determine the order of ARIMA model effectively, a large number of historical data is often required. 
Furthermore, order estimation based on ACF and PACF plots often results in finding many potential models. 
These competing models can be biased. In this paper, a new heuristic algorithm has been introduced to determine 
the order of ARIMA models. The proposed method determines the order of the ARIMA model based on statistical 
selection criteria MSE, AIC and BIC. Also, the proposed method creates more objective results. The proposed 
algorithm is applied on a case study related to temperature anomaly where the results are promising. It indicates 
that the proposed method is efficient for determining the order of the ARIMA model. 
Future research should consider the potential effects of seasonality more carefully. For example, SARIMA models 
can be taken into account. In addition, parsimoniousness can be addressed in the proposed algorithm.

Abstract 
This study generally aimed to develop a model that can predict carbon footprint emissions based on the datasets 
obtained. The parameters that the researchers utilized were population and energy production from 1990 to 2019. The 
data were all chosen from the vital drivers of CO2 emissions identified through the literature review and had been 
collected using the open-sourced program WEKA. The three algorithms used in this study are Linear Regression (LR), 
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Sequential Minimal Optimization Regression (SMOreg) to test which among these 
most-used algorithms in time series data mining prediction delivers outstanding results. These were participated in the 
trials given to the researchers to gather sufficient data to draw conclusions. The researchers determined that the MLP 
model is able to estimate greenhouse gas emissions at error levels that are acceptable in comparison to the 
actual values and test results. If the Philippines maintains its current trajectory, the carbon footprint 
emissions will eventually rise and probably reach 255,595.03 kt in the year 2030. There is a powerful correlation 
between population and energy production that contributes to the carbon footprint emissions within the Philippines.

1. Introduction
Humanity has lived alongside nature and has been a part of that environment. However, as our global population and 
economy have grown, our impacts on the environment grew as well. The protection of the world we live in is vital for 
the sustainability of our existence. When people realized that environmental issues were putting their lives at risk 
because of economic growth, they started working to improve the quality of the environment. According to a study 
from Huang et al. (2017), the widely accepted definition of the carbon footprint refers to human production or 
consumption-related gaseous emissions that contribute to global warming. One key concept in the fight against climate 
change is carbon footprint, which refers to the amount of greenhouse gases produced by human activities such as 
transportation, energy use, and food production. The carbon footprint is a common notion in talks about responsibility 
and climate change mitigation. In 2016, experts affiliated with the World Economic Forum classified global warming 
as the number one hazard to society and the economy Cann (2016). There is a strong correlation between carbon 
footprint, energy consumption, and energy supply in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and 
Entertainment and Media (E&M) sectors, making it vital to investigate energy use concurrently. Numerous countries 
are establishing a green economy as part of long-term development strategies to leave future generations with a 
habitable world. To achieve these goals, various analytical approaches have been developed to predict carbon 
footprints and identify ways to reduce them. In recent years, data mining techniques have gained interest as a powerful 
tool for assessing, planning, and decision-making processes in many industries, including environmental management.

Figure 3. Correlation of GHG and energy production. 
As shown in Figure 3, there is also a strong positive correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and energy 
production.  
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Population and energy production were the only independent variables included in this study, so it is recommended to 
identify additional variables that affect carbon footprint emissions. The study made use of variables that are essential 
factors affecting carbon footprint emissions; it is recommended that the findings in this study be used to minimize 
CO2 emissions in the next few years. This study made use of data from 1990–2019; it is recommended to add new 
data to improve the success rate of the time series forecast. 
5.4 Validation 
Forecasts of greenhouse gas emissions for the Philippines were derived for the purpose of this study by the 
implementation of time series data mining techniques, using parameters including population and energy production 
variables. When looking at other studies that attempted to estimate emissions from carbon footprint, it was discovered 
that artificial neural network techniques were used in those studies. By employing artificial neural networks, Akyol 
and Ucar (2021) were able to make a prediction on Turkey's carbon footprint emissions. In spite of the fact that this 
study included substantially all of the same variables, it came to very different conclusions. It is presumed that the 
cause for these results was the utilization of only two variables and the incorporation of additional data into the dataset 
that was used for this study.  
6. Conclusion
Based on the results obtained from the model, the following conclusions were drawn: If the Philippines continues on 
its current path, carbon footprint emissions will eventually rise and could reach 255,595.03 kt in 2030. There is a 
strong correlation between population and energy production, which contributes to the Philippines' carbon footprint 
emissions.

Abstract 
Quality is innate in manufacturing value chains as it acts as a determinant for the level of desirability on the 
customer end. This is in terms of the level of satisfaction based on durability, performance, continuous 
improvement and the quality of product justifying the sale price. Total quality management is enriched with 
various methodologies and principles all focused on the level of performance, productivity, customer relations 
and service management. It is therefore very critical that for a country to improve on the purchasing manager 
index (PMI) and global competitiveness, the inherent aspects of quality should be enhanced and embraced as this 
can contribute to the level of domestic sales in the economy as well as the level of attraction in terms of products 
being sought in the export markets. South Africa currently has experienced a 12% decline in productivity in 
comparison to the 90’s, this has become even worse in the covid-19 economy, whereby there is a 7% contraction 
in the overall sectors of economy. Currently industry across quarters is bleeding as a result of cheap imports from 
China and poor competitiveness within the local industry. The steel sector in one such sector that used to flourish 
but has suffered a downward spiral with the closure of key industry players such as Accelor Mittal. Currently 
there is a development of a steel master plan under way to address the current deficiency in the level of 
productivity, competitiveness and local content. The paper in its critical analysis will emphasize on the importance 
of total quality management philosophy, specifically the 5S methodology, Total Quality Management, and joint 
improvement tools being inherent within the industrial development incentive value chains as a motive and drive 
for greater productivity and global competitiveness.  
Keywords: 
Total Quality Management, Manufacturing, Competitiveness 
Introduction 
Factory activity has expanded significantly because of the easing of lockdown rules, the PMI in October 2020 is 
a true reflection of this notion more drawing a comparison to the predicted pre pandemic figures. Whilst  this is 
celebrated it is essential that we reflect back on the industrial challenges that have been present prior to lock down; 
which comprise of the need to re-industrialise, as to enable diversification beyond the economy’s reliance on 
traditional commodities resulting in promotion of value addition; additionally realizing the need to compete in 
export markets against imports, labor absorbing industrialization coupled with hi-tech in skills embraced by total 
quality management philosophy.  
The paper draws a correlation between the quality management and resultantly leading to improved productivity 
within manufacturing value chains it is essential that quality management philosophy is extrapolated accordingly, 
by devising the cause-and-effect analysis.  According to Kerzner (2001), Total Quality Management (TQM), 
refers to an ever-improving system for integrating various organizational elements into the design, development, 
and manufacturing efforts, providing cost-effective products or services that are fully acceptable to the ultimate 
customer.  The author further alludes that TQM externally provides a more meaningful customer satisfaction and 
internally a reduction of bottlenecks in the production line thereby minimizing operational costs, therefore 
enhancing product quality and improvement of organization’s morale.

Abstract 
Asset management integrates multi-functional view to achieve the effectiveness and efficiency of the assets by 
balancing costs, risks, opportunities, and performance benefits. However, the relation between maintenance strategy 
and asset Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) has not been widely discussed in previous researches. This study evaluates 
the useful life of a typical physical asset by considering the aspect of maintenance strategy in the TCO calculation. 
The maintenance and failure database are utilized to accomplish this objective. Monte Carlo simulation is used as an 
integrated approach in the proposed model, specifically to simulate the failure uncertainty. An equipment from a 
cement production plant is used as a case study to test the proposed model and results in the desired output. Therefore, 
the proposed model contributes to the integration of maintenance strategy and asset TCO to evaluate the useful life of 
an asset. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Assets are critical for organization to ensure that the products and services give value to their stakeholders (Lima and 
Costa 2019). The effective management of the asset is required to achieve this objective (Lima et al. 2021). Asset 
management aims to realize the expected performance from all types of assets, hence helps the organization to get the 
most out of value from its assets (Janet et al. 2022). Depending on the objective of organization and expectation of 
stakeholders, value might signify different meanings (Amadi et al. 2010). Value could be tangible or intangible, 
financial or non-financial, and considering risks at different times in the asset’s life (Lima and Costa 2019). 
As a core functions of organizational strategies, asset management delivers a higher levels of customer service and 
reliability by allocating assets more efficiently (Konstantakos et al. 2019). Asset management integrates multi-
functional view to achieve the effectiveness and efficiency of the assets, by balancing costs, risks, opportunities, and 
performance benefits. Understanding which decision-making level, decision situation, and life cycle stages are 
crictical in the asset management processes and activities (Kunttu et al. 2016). Therefore, the integration of asset life 
cycle is required in asset management system to manage the asset throughout its useful life. 
The integration of asset life cycle in decision-making process implicates that asset management should consider a 
long-term objective and performance to drive the decision. Given all phases of asset life cycle are different, a multi-
disciplinary approach in asset management is required (El-Akruti et al. 2013). TCO is a technique that can be 
implemented to accomplish this objective (El-Akruti et al. 2015). In principle, TCO takes into account all costs 
incurred throughout the life cycle of a physical asset including capital, operations, and maintenance cost (Duran et al. 
2016). 
Maintenance cost is definitely influenced by the equipment’s failure rate, which further also influenced by the 
maintenance strategy applied. However, the consideration of maintenance strategy and its consequence are mostly 
still excluded in TCO discussion. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the useful life of a typical physical asset by 
considering the aspect of maintenance strategy in the TCO calculation. Monte carlo simulation is used as an integrated

value and start to escalate again. This minimum value of EUAC is interpreted as an ideal useful life as it provides a 
most minimum value of annualized TCO profile. 
 
 
 
Figure 4. EUAC (Annualized TCO) Profile Over Time 
 
The result from case study shows the minimum value of EUAC that converges at USD 169,379.31. This minimum 
value of EUAC converges at a year of 2046 or 34 years of useful life. The percentage value of breakdown days 
converges at 0.703%. It is worth mentioning that this result is still obtained under existed preventive maintenance 
strategy (which performed 4 times per year) and assumption that the equipment is a single (stand-alone) equipment.

5. Conclusion 
This study developed a model to evaluate the asset useful life, by integrating the aspect of maintenance strategy in a 
wider perspective of TCO. Three research concepts are elaborated including failure modeling, maintenance modeling, 
and TCO modeling. Model is demonstrable to deliver the expected result as tested in a case study. In industrial practice, 
this model has several potential benefits, including (1) Evaluate the end of economical asset useful life. (2) Estimate 
the remaining book value of an asset under various operating conditions. (3) Useful life database development for 
each specific type and condition of an asset.

For further research, the assumption about the observed equipment that stands as an independent equipment can be 
extended. In industrial practice, a complete production system is built by the equipment that interconnected between 
each other. Thus, a more precise estimation of system failure can be obtained by the evaluation of system reliability.

Abstract 
NFT or non-fungible tokens are online certificates of ownership that can be traded, based on data units stored in digital 
ledgers (ledgers) belonging to blockchain technology. Non-fungible means that it cannot be exchanged and is unique. 
NFT has been around since 2014. But now, it is increasingly being considered as a fairly practical method for trading 
digital artwork or art. To buy NFT assets, it requires special coins in the form of NFT coins, which consist of various 
types, such as mana coins, sand, axs and other NFT coins. The NFT coins are used to process NFT purchase 
transactions. The movement of NFT coins over time is relatively erratic and uncertain. This NFT coin price prediction 
will be very useful for investors to know how the investment flow of each price works, because the price of each NFT 
coin will change from time to time. Through the literature study stage, interviews and viewing daily NFT coin price 
data where the attributes used are date, open, high, low, close volume, and marketcap. Based on the experimental 
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) method on a data set using the parameter values of K 3, 5, and 7, it can be said that the 
KNN model that has the best accuracy is KNN with a value of K=7 with an accuracy of 65% . The greater the value, 
the greater the Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error values. The research conducted predicts the Close value 
of the NFT coin price in a period of 1 day.

1. Introduction
The trend of non-fungible tokens (NFT) has been increasing in recent times. This is because the public's interest in 
buying and selling digital assets and works of art through NFT is getting higher. One of the reasons for the growing 
popularity of NFT is the rapid development of digital technology. The increasing public interest in crypto assets 
sustains the popularity of NFT. As it is known that there are a large number or types of cryptocurrency coins. Likewise 
with NFT coins which consist of various types. Like mana coins, sand, axs and other NFT coins. The NFT coins are 
used to process NFT purchase transactions. 
The disclosure of NFT coin price data on coinmarketcap.com gives investors the opportunity to make profits. The 
profit in question is in the form of Capital Gain which is the difference between the purchase price and the selling 
price. However, the right time to buy and sell NFT coins must be known by investors in order to make a profit. The 
price of the NFT coin on coinmarketcap.com always displays the price movement of the NFT coin which is always 
changing, increasing, and decreasing at an unknown time by investors, therefore, the low and high prices of the NFT 
coin can be seen by looking at the price of the NFT coin both from the price the highest, lowest, and closing prices,

6. Conclusion
The conclusions from the research carried out are: From the experimental results of the KNN method (K-Nearest 
Neighbors) on the dataset using the K3 value parameters obtained an accuracy of 45%, K5 50%, and K7 65%, it can 
be concluded that the KNN model has the most accuracy good is KNN with a value of K = 7 with an accuracy value 
of 65%. The greater the value of K, the greater the value of the Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error. The 
research conducted predicts the Close value of NFT coin prices over a period of 1 day.

Abstract  
 
With the advent of digital technology, disruptive innovation is a strategy that is being adopted both by the 
manufacturing as well as the service industry. Disruptive digital technology like smartphone technology, social media, 
internet, and mobile applications have led to Business to Business (B2B), Peer to Peer (P2P), and Business to 
Consumer (B2C) strategies promising shared economy for tourism destinations. Technological disruptions such as 
IoT, Artificial Intelligence and rich media like virtual and augmented reality, parallel reality have created smarter 
environments that transformed tourism in terms of its structure, processes, and practices.  It is a relatively modern 
form of technology, introduced to the existing tourism market which enables service providers in creating a unique 
experience for their customers. Here the customers motivate others in order to reap the benefits of technology-driven 
product (Danneels, 2004). These technologies create entirely new products and services that are dramatically cheaper, 
better, and more convenient forcing change in the whole new competitive industrial workforce. Such innovations are 
because of continuous scientific discoveries for a more technology-driven competitive paradigm (Kostoff et.al. 2004). 
The emergence of such smart environments will redefine the tourism sector as customer experience solely prevails on 
varying levels of infrastructure, organization, and cultural constraints (Buhalis et.al. 2019). The paper tries to explore 
various disruptive technologies that could be used for promoting tourism in a destination, forcing stakeholders to 
rethink and reengineer their services in this competitive ever-changing world.

Abstract 
COVID-19 significantly impacted health, economic, social, and industrial activities. This condition requires a practical 
solution, namely vaccination. Every geographical area has its challenge in administering the vaccine to the population. 
This study presents a lesson learned from a major city in Indonesia: Bandung. We aim to analyze what critical 
challenges need to be managed in the humanitarian supply chain management process to distribute the vaccine in 
Bandung City. We used the analytical hierarchy process method with experts from the health center, law enforcement, 
and COVID-19 vaccination officials. The study shows that the most critical challenge comes from social, 
environmental, and technical criteria. Further validation is carried out from the general public's perspective using 
questionnaires.

1. Introduction
By the end of 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic has infected 666 million people, with total deaths of 6.6 million 
worldwide (WHO  2022). Indonesia has reported 6,73 million infections and 161 thousand deaths, with Jakarta, as the 
capital city, contributing the highest number of infections and deaths (Indonesia 2022). Bandung, a metropolitan city 
in Indonesia, with a population of only a quarter compared to Jakarta, contributed the second highest number of 
infections and deaths. In January 2023, the city of Bandung confirmed 112,270 cases and 1,485 death concerning 
COVID-19 (Bandung  2022). Figure 1 shows the number of instances in Bandung from 2020-2022. The pandemic 
has primarily impacted Bandung's health, economy, social, and industrial sectors (Bandung 2022). In this situation, 
the supply chain management of every humanitarian aid becomes critical in providing the goods timely, in the right 
amount, and to the right target. Therefore, the humanitarian supply chain management in managing the aids is needed 
during and after the pandemic.  
The vaccine is the key to surviving the COVID-19 pandemic (Fontanet and Cauchemez  2021). The first vaccine was 
approved in December 2020, and other vaccines have been developed and administered since then. To resist infection, 
a population must distribute at least 80% of the vaccine to the people. On the other hand, supplying vaccines becomes 
complex as humanitarian factors are also involved. The chain from the manufacturer to the customer continues even 
when the vaccines arrive at the customer side and how the government administers vaccines to the people (Alam, et 
al.  2021).

Furthermore, to ensure the above analysis's result, we surveyed Bandung's citizens to verify the main challenges. Six 
main questions were designed to ask the following questions and answers. 
 
(1) Which of the five main criteria significantly impacts vaccine distribution and administration? 
In summary, 55% of the respondents selected “social” as the main challenge, and 15 selected technical as the 
main challenge.  
(2) Which among the three sub-criteria of the first criteria has the most significant impact on vaccine distribution 
and administration? 
In summary, 50% of the respondents selected “the lack of organizational coordination” as the main challenge, 
and 32.5% “the lack of organizations and agencies as vaccination providers” as the main challenges.  
(3) Which among the three sub-criteria of the second criterion has the most significant impact on vaccine 
distribution and administration? 
In summary, 48 % of the respondents selected “rumor spreading/false knowledge” as the main challenge, and 
37% chose “the lack of vaccine awareness in society” as the main challenge. 
(4) Which among the three sub-criteria of the third criteria has the most significant impact on vaccine distribution 
and administration? 
In summary, 43 % of the respondents selected “information and data fallacy from the digital application 
provider side” as the main challenges, and 40% chose the “long waiting times for vaccine supplies” as the 
main challenges. 
(5) Which among the four sub-criteria of the fourth criteria has the most significant impact on vaccine 
distribution and administration? 
In summary, 48 % of the respondents selected “communication barriers regarding understanding the 
importance of vaccination” as the main challenge, and 30% chose the “inability to access information 
digitally” as the main challenge. 
(6) Which among the three sub-criteria of the fifth criteria has the most significant impact on vaccine distribution 
and administration? 
In summary, 55 % of the respondents selected “the lack of vaccine availability” as the main challenge, and 
23% chose “the lack of availability of vaccine tools” as the main challenge. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In this study, we have identified the main challenges of COVID-19 in Bandung, Indonesia. The five main criteria are 
organizational, social, technical, environmental, and availability. The expert analysis and confirmation survey re-
confirmed our conclusion that the main challenges of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration are the rumor 
spreading/false knowledge, the lack of vaccine awareness in society, and the lack of medical personnel involved. We 
can also conclude that the humanitarian supply chain context in the case of vaccine administration needs more attention 
as the social aspect is part of the supply and demand. This study can be extended to other cities of countries to find 
the main challenges in COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration.

Abstract 
The purpose of the study is to find the effect of master production scheduling (MPS) requirements on blood transfusion 
sustainability (BTS). Data was collected from 213 respondents of regional and transfusing staff of government 
university teaching hospital blood banks using a self-administered questionnaire. Simple random sampling was used 
to draw the sample. Finally, a model including MPS requirements and BTS was validated with a path analysis. The 
results of this study showed a positive significant effect of MPS requirements on BTS with the prediction rate of 
27.1% and in the 95% confidence level.

1. Introduction
Blood transfusion is necessary in addressing any blood shortages, illnesses and disorders in the human body (Lestari 
et al. 2017; Seed et al. 2018). Sustainable blood transfusion is crucial in extending and improving life for many patients 
(Kruk et al. 2018; Mulcahy et al. 2017). World Health Organization (WHO) Global report (2010) indicated that blood 
transfusion would drastically reduce the death figures of people that emanate from road traffic accidents (1.2 million), 
cardiovascular disease (2.5 million), malaria (1 million), tuberculosis (900,000), and maternal complications 
(132,500). In Sub-Saharan Africa, lack of safe, timely and full product range of blood units lead to about 300,000 
pregnant women and 3 million children below the age of 5 years dying annually (Checkley et al. 2019). Safe, timely 
and full product range of blood units are essential for both non-normal and normal healthcare for and during 
transfusion (Checkley et al. 2019; Thomas et al. 2017). World Health Organization recommend use of voluntary non-
remunerated donors to achieve BTS in most parts of Africa through encouraging more voluntary non-remunerated 
blood donors (VNRDs), testing for transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs), as well establishing interventions for 
hospital best use of blood (Aneke and Okocha  2017). Mulcahy et al. (2017) suggested that robust blood transfusion 
system is one that scored high on the following three factors: safety levels, full range of blood units, and timely 
delivery such that patient health and scheduled transfusion services are not unduly compromised. However, globally 
failure to match blood supply to demand has continued to result into unfavourable transfusion outcomes like forced 
prioritisation, postponement, cancellation and death (Jenny et al. 2017; Kanagasabai et al. 2018; Opoka et al. 2018).

overall effect of MPS blood requirements on BTS was positive and significant with the prediction rate of 27.1% and 
in the 95% confidence level.  Additionally, this study was conducted in Uganda. Most of the studies focusing on BTS 
are mainly conducted from developed countries.  
5.1. Managerial Implications 
The study results indicate that better MPS blood requirements would help developing sustainable blood transfusion. 
It is evident that creating a dependable MPS is a substantial aspect of blood transfusion service. Jonsson and 
Kjellsdotter (2015) informed that MPS methods resulted into plans that are more feasible in uncertain environment. 
Blood banks and decision makers in Uganda should make an effort to develop positive intentions of timely delivery 
of blood products through a well-designed and maintained MPS blood requirements in order to save lives of patients 
in need of blood.  
5.2. Limitations and Future Research 
Although the results of the current study have shed light on several important issues, some limitations need to be 
considered in future research. This study has developed a model which focused on cold chain respondents from 
regional blood banks and transfusing staff from government university teaching hospital blood banks in Uganda. In 
future studies, other screening methods for a greater representative sample should be considered. Secondly, this 
analysis assessed MPS blood requirements and BTS on a few dimensions, the generalizability of the study is therefore 
restricted. Future studies may then use more robust models, and in other countries applying similar conceptual 
framework. Finally, the findings are focused on a cross-section analysis, which requires empirical testing to verify the 
relationship between MPS blood requirements and BTS for testing the findings of the study in the longitudinal 
analysis.

Abstract 
Last March 2019, Philippines suffered the first wave of COVID-19 resulting in most, if not all, educational facilities 
seizing operations and swiftly shifting into the online learning environment most of us are familiar with. Currently, 
the Technological Institute of the Philippines Quezon City (T.I.P QC) has adapted to more flexible learning approaches 
as the threat of COVID-19 slowly dwindles away. With the standard learning approach shifting once again into the 
new normal, this study aims to explore the effects and impacts of the previous modality of learning, online format, on 
a graduating engineering student’s professional preparedness. COVID-19 has caused significant changes in how 
instructors impart knowledge and how students interact with Higher Education (HE). Different teaching and learning 
approaches have been adopted to account for social exclusion, learners' varied requirements, and the fact that they 
may live far from the HE classroom.Online learning is one such mode that was heavily adapted in the Philippines 
(Montemayor, 2020). In online classes, instructors instruct learners simultaneously in a digital classroom and 
synchronously online using video-conferencing tools. In this small-scale exploratory study, graduating students who 
took a six-week course through online classes are interviewed about their experiences and opinions. Despite 
communication difficulties between students who attended through various modalities, individuals did value the 
freedom it provided, according to the findings. The use of several aspects of video conferencing software and other 
digital tools was considered crucial to online learning’s effectiveness. A quantitative study was conducted using a 
unidimensional 4-point Likert scale questionnaire disseminated through a google form link. Respondents are limited 
to 26 Graduating Engineering Students of T.I.P. QC Campus. Survey results are further validated through the use of 
frequency, percentage, weighted mean, ANOVA, Standard Deviation, interpretation, and ranking.

1. Introduction
COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019, it is the first pandemic crisis in the 21st century. It spreads 
quickly, infecting different countries (Coşkun et al. 2021). This epidemic is declared by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) resulting in a global pandemic. The incubation period of an asymptotic patient can transmit and infect, severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) is an extremely transmittable virus (Huang et al. 2020). To 
lessen or slow the outspread of Coronavirus the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and promoting programs 
about hand washing and keeping a distance from each other is implemented. Patients who are infected are quarantined 
and immediately apply lockdowns in the area. The way that COVID-19 is infected is by the driblet coming from the 
lungs through sneezes and coughs of the Covid-19 positive patient, and by having close contact by touching the patient 
and contaminated objects or environment (WHO  2020a). 
Many changes in our culture will be brought forth by the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. The government has enacted 
a high-intensity social distancing strategy, restricting the operation of establishments and industries where lots of

4. Discussions 
4.1 Summary of Findings  
 
4.1.1 The demographic profile of the graduating engineering students. 
The twenty-six graduating engineering students at the Technological Institute of the Philippines - Quezon City during 
the school year 2022 - 2023 were composed of 57.7% are male, 42.3% female. 
 
4.1.2. The validity and reliability of the survey questionnaire 
The validity and reliability results of the survey questionnaire were tested and analyzed in the SPSS software and thus 
giving a reliable result of 0.981 exceeding the standard threshold of 0.700 produced by Cronbach’s alpha without any 
exclusions from the respondents and questions. 
 
4.2 Implications 
This research may be beneficial to graduating students of the Technological Institute of the Philippines Quezon City 
(T.I.P.-Q.C.) as it provides relevant information regarding the impacts of the adapted online learning format on the 
professional preparedness of graduating engineering students. 
 
4.3 Limitations of the Study 
The scope of this study is limited to the impact between the online learning modality and the professional preparedness 
of graduating students from the various engineering departments in the Technological Institute of the Philippines 
Quezon City. The research is focused on the impacts of the online format of classes on a graduating student’s 
professional skills, critical thinking and problem-solving skills, communication skills, interpersonal skills, 
innovativeness, decision-making skills, and the quest for excellence. 
 
4.4 Conclusion 
The results of this study indicated that the graduating engineering students are professionally prepared despite the 
number of differences in the respondents in terms of professional skills, critical thinking and problem-solving skills,

Abstract 
Particularly, Food integrity is a comprehensive construct that relates to food production.  Halal Food Integrity (HFI) 
means that in producing food, Islamic law should be noticed and applied. Halal integrity of the product is a result of 
the various activities in the supply chain, so HFI encapsulates the whole of the Halal Food Supply Chain (HFSC). 
This paper presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on HFI and some research agendas on it. Using SLR 
methodology and based on the Preferred Reporting for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol. 
In total, by 89 articles from Scopus database, published in journals over 12 years, 34 articles were selected, mapped, 
and assessed. The bibliometric approach made it possible to extract a large amount of useful information which was 
previously scattered and to present it in a systematic way. The analysis of the co-occurrence network of keywords 
identiﬁed five distinct clusters, corresponding to the dominant research themes in the area, which suggested the design 
of a research agenda. The authors find that the key to improved halal integrity is transparency so that consumers can 
make informed decisions. Halal transparency along the food supply chain could be enhanced by a halal traceability 
system. Unfortunately, there are some barriers and challenges in adopting advanced traceability technology in Many 
companies, especially in developing countries. Future research agendas could be in the area of enhancing traceability 
technology to ensure HFI while considering the barrier and inhibitor that encountered by many food companies.

1. Introduction
Halal food industry is evolving and thriving. It is the second-largest sector in the halal economy after Islamic finance 
(Khan et al.  2022). It has also created a new lifestyle in which consumers are now more aware of their consumption, 
particularly knowledgeable in terms of the ingredients and mechanism of the products that they use and consume, and 
celebrating value-added products that have good qualities (Rahim 2017). Muslim population is increasing fastly, so 
the halal food industry could be a a profitable market niche (Rejeb et al. 2021). According to Zulfakar et al. (2014) 
non-Muslim consumers also demand for halal foods as the halal foods maintain a reputation for cleanliness, hygiene, 
and palatability. 
The Future of the Global Muslim  Population Report published by Pew Research Center’s Forum on Religion & Public 
Life stated that the world’s Muslim population in 2020 will reach 1.9 billion people or 24.9% of the world’s total 
population and that number will continue to grow and was predicted to increase by 2030 to reach 2.2 billion people 
(Indonesian Ministry of National Development Planning, 2018). Muslim population increase resulting an increasing

Eventually, this research has some limitations.  First, this study is based purely on a literature review, which is used 
to explore HFI in the halal food supply chain management. Future work should use an empirical research on HFI. 
Second, this research is only based on a single international Scopus database that readers can see as a possible 
limitation. Future research could combine Scopus, EBSCO, ABI/Inform, and Web of Science to see if there could be 
even more integrated results. Finally, although the SLR provides rigorous methodology to avoid interpretative bias, 
however it is possible that relevant articles were not captured by the search engines. Future studies could bring 
interesting new research lines that have not covered by this research.

Abstract 
With the rapid development of electric vehicle (EV), researches related to EV battery systems have flourished in recent 
years, partly because the battery system accounts for almost half of the cost of an EV. For the battery system, its 
capacity degraded gradually along with charge-and-discharge cycles and hence increases the risk of the EV. The 
reliability issue of the battery system thus arises. The present study proposes an analytical model based on reliability 
engineering for studying the capacity degradation and quantitative reliability of EV battery packs. The model, in turn, 
is constructed in consideration of states of health (SOH) of battery cells and their uncertainties. As compared to the 
traditional system reliability model that judges the pack’s reliability purely based on considering if or not a battery 
cell’s SOH exceeds a prescribed threshold, the proposed model adopts the k-out-of-n system reliability concept and 
considers that SOHs of battery cells within the pack do not differ too much to assure the pack’s reliability. This study 
also adjusts a few parametric values in the model to investigate their influences on battery pack’s life and reliability. 
Through numerical case studies, it is found the proposed model results in a more conservative system reliability 
prediction of a battery pack than the traditional model, and the capacity degradation trend of the battery pack coincides 
with a real case. In consideration of an effective battery management system that avoids fierce temperature changes, 
the influence of temperature is not very obvious in this study. The uneven performance of battery cells reflected by 
discrepancies of their SOHs is found crucial to the battery pack. If the performance of each battery cell is balanced, 
the battery pack’s life and reliability would increase significantly. The above trends coincide with those factors 
considered in a real battery management system (BMS) of an EV.

Abstract 
Lithium-ion batteries have gradually become the mainstream of batteries used in electric vehicles due to their 
advantages such as high energy density and long lifetime. This research aims to establish a reliability-based 
mathematical model that considers uncertainties of the degradation of lithium-ion batteries. The model can be used to 
evaluate the lifetime distribution and reliability of a selected type of lithium-ion battery. Based on the actual battery 
test data, this research considers battery performance under different operational environments as well as the 
uncertainty existed for each battery and proposes two capacity loss formulas to describe respectively the declines of 
battery capacity along with time when it is in storage and charge-and-discharge cycle when it is in use. According to 
the model, the battery lifetime distribution and reliability can be evaluated, and the failure probability of the battery 
at any given time can be obtained. This research also converts a vehicle’s daily driving distance into a random depth 
of discharge, and explores the impact of different driving habits and charging methods on battery degradation. 
Research results show that state of charge (SOC) is one of the main factors affecting battery degradation. It is also 
found that selecting a lower battery charging limit and avoiding frequent shallow discharge under high SOC can slow 
down the degradation, and greatly extend the lifetime and improve the reliability of the battery.

Abstract 
Electric vehicles have become a trend in vehicle development in recent years due to their low noise, low pollution, 
and reusable batteries. However, the batteries of electric vehicles will gradually fade out with the number of charge-
and-discharge cycles, and may cause fire or explosion hazards. Battery life and reliability have thus become important 
research issues. Among the commonly used batteries for electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries are often used by 
electric vehicle manufacturers today because of their high-power storage, small size, and high energy density. The 
state-of-health (SOH) is the most commonly used indicator for evaluating the fading degree of lithium-ion batteries. 
For the battery, its SOH will gradually decrease with the number of charge-and-discharge cycles. When the average 
value of a battery system drops to be less than 80%, the vehicle manufacturer will advise the vehicle owner to replace 
the battery system to avoid inconveniences and potential hazards. In order to ensure the safety of battery cells used in 
electric vehicles, this study proposes a semi-empirical model to predict the SOH of a battery based on its ambient 
temperature during battery operation, the number of charge-and-discharge cycles, the discharge rate, and the nominal 
capacity and specifically discusses the number of charge-and-discharge cycles experienced when SOH is lower than 
80%. The proposed model can be used as an evaluation tool to understand the degree of battery aging through 
quantitative reliability analysis, and explores how the uncertainty of coefficients in the semi-empirical model for 
understanding its impact on the prediction results. At the end of this study, through the analysis of different types of 
lithium-ion batteries, and assuming that the effects of the internal chemical reaction of the battery do not affect the 
prediction of SOH during the charge-and-discharge cycle, the difference in the model's SOH curve-fitting under 
different conditions are discussed in particular. Different applications are also addressed. In this study, the number of 
charge-and-discharge cycles predicted by the semi-empirical model can be used to estimate the degree of battery 
aging, and the reliability analysis can be used to evaluate the battery usage, so that it can determine whether the battery 
needs to be replaced, and can minimize the probability of occurrence of hazards.

Abstract 
Manufacturing sheet metal parts with laser cutting machines involves placing several parts of various geometries from 
multiple customers on one sheet blank (e.g., 6’ x 12’). While this practice is common, it can cause complications in 
accurately calculating fabrication time and subsequent cost of parts for each customer. The reason for this is that laser 
cutting machines display only the total cutting time per entire sheet blank, and the cutting order within and between 
parts on sheet blanks may not be sequential. To resolve this long-standing machine time distribution problem, this 
paper proposes a Machine Learning approach based on the geometric characteristics of parts. To test this approach, 
348 sheet blanks with parts of various shapes and sizes were processed on a laser cut machine to collect the machine's 
cutting time for each sheet blank. The parts on the sheet blank were broken down into their component geometric 
characteristics (e.g., line length, number of vertices, arc length, number of piercing, etc.), which were used as features 
for the Machine Learning model. Data from 338 sheet blanks were used for training, and data from the remaining 10 
were used to validate the trained model. Three Machine Learning algorithms—Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, 
and Lasso Regression—were selected and compared. The results show that the Machine Learning approach, based on 
parts' geometric characteristics, is a viable method for designating cutting time for parts on sheet blanks. With the 
real-time data collection of parts' geometry and shop floor machine run time in the era of Industry 4.0, this approach 
can be implemented on any laser cut machines to automatically determine the cutting time (and therefore 
manufacturing cost) of each part.

1. Introduction
Sheet metal parts are commonly manufactured by laser cut and turret punch machines by placing multiple parts of 
different geometries from various customers on a single sheet blank to improve material utilization. However, this 
practice makes it difficult to accurately calculate the machine run time and the subsequent manufacturing cost of each 
part on the sheet blank. Inaccurate machine run time estimation leads to challenges in determining operation profit or 
loss, as well as difficulties in quoting customer orders. Currently, the industry relies on subjective estimation or simple 
calculations based on part geometry to assign each part a machine run time, which lacks accuracy and consistency. 
When a different machine model is used, machine run times must be reset for each part, which can lead to confusion, 
accounting errors, and delays.

6. Conclusion 
A new approach is proposed to distribute the machine run time of a sheet blank to each part on the sheet blank for all 
laser cut machines. It adopts Machine Learning method and is based on parts’ geometric characteristics and associated 
laser cutting actions. Through the training of Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression models, 338 
training sheet blanks were executed with 93% to 95% accuracy result using 5-fold cross validation procedure, and 10 
test sheet blanks with 91% to 92% accuracy result. Machine run time for the 27 parts on 10 test sheet blanks were 
accordingly assigned and verified. Additional geometric characteristics can be included for a broader geometry of 
sheet metal parts if needed. 
 
Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach is viable to provide precise and consistent machine run time (hence 
manufacturing cost) for parts of various geometries on a sheet blank. It can replace the subjective estimation currently 
used in industry, and can be automated with real-time data collection in the era of Industry 4.0. The approach can be 
expanded to incorporate manufacturing features of turret punch machines to develop a more comprehensive and 
versatile model.

Abstract 
During this pandemic, some nations have used frugal living to achieve economic stability, improve well-being, and 
protect the environment. This study examines how Indonesian frugal behavior might be used to stabilize the economy 
amid the crisis. This study will analyze frugal behavior surveys and interview respondents. This mixed-methods study 
found that frugal and pro-environmental behavior can be developed, but the public needs easy-to-access financial 
literacy knowledge. This study's fit model shows that frugal actors profit from pro-environmental action. Adherents 
of frugal conduct have inherent motives to adopt it after learning how to manage resources wisely and sparingly. The 
majority of people are still unfamiliar with the term ""frugal behavior"" and merely grasp the concept, which is less 
relevant to their needs. This is an opportunity to promote frugal and pro-environmental behavior based on the concept 
of frugal behavior. More knowledge and skills in financial management that are consistent with frugal behavior are 
needed.  
Keywords 
frugal behavior, economic stability, consumers, independence, well-being, pro-environment, and sustainable 
behavior. 
1. Introduction
As part of a new development agreement, Indonesia has adopted the Sustainable Development Agenda, also known 
as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development or SDGs. This agenda encourages shifts toward sustainable 
development that are founded on human rights and equity in order to promote social, economic, and environmental 
development. According to the Sustainable Development Goals, demographic bonuses will be an issue and a challenge 
for the people of Indonesia in 2024 in the context of the economy and community management. Developed nations 
have, over the course of the past several years, evolved a philosophy of life that places a higher premium on the ability 
to save money in order to accomplish objectives that are measured in terms of their economic value (Tirto. id 2020). 
This way of life is known as ""frugal living,"" and it is an individual living concept that leads to changes in mindset that 
affect individual economic behavior in managing daily finances frugally by looking at various aspects of economic 
value in order to achieve goals that have been set in terms of economic value in a certain amount of time.  
The concept of living frugally is a behavioral concept that should be adopted by savvy consumers since it has the 
potential to contribute positively to a sustainable economy. It is interesting to note that a number of well-known people 
in the world, like Mark Zuckerberg, Lady Gaga, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Keanu Reeves, have adopted a more modest 
way of living as a way to improve their financial situations. They do so since it has a beneficial effect not only on 
them but also on their family, the environment, and the community as a whole, in addition to bringing about mental 
and financial stability for them (Destiana, IDXchannel  2021). Every person, especially young people, has obstacles

Abstract 
Electric vehicles (EVs) are a significant technology that reduces greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to 
climate change prevention. Despite their many benefits, EV sales are lower than expected, suggesting that dealers 
may need more incentives to increase the adoption of EVs. This study investigates customer attitudes towards 
EVs, return behavior, and the factors most likely to influence consumer choice for EVs in India. A comprehensive 
questionnaire/survey is conducted with 503 respondents, and various logistic regression models are used to 
analyze consumer choices, attitudes, and perceptions of EVs and related aspects. The results of this study will 
help us understand consumer purchasing behavior towards EVs and have important policy implications for 
promoting EVs in India, identifying crucial socio-economic factors that affect consumers' purchasing decisions, 
suggesting changes to current policies for better implementation, and identifying opportunities for the private 
sector

Abstract 
The paper proposes a collaborative S&OP framework to encapsulate the digital marketing and supply chain 
collaboration to optimise firm performance by identifying the gaps in the existing frameworks and performance 
metrics. We argue that the demand and supply side of a business remains pivotal towards how a business operates 
and achieves sustainability. Hence, creating the need of further observations of achieving collaboration between 
both spectrums and able to apply in accordance to the proposed objectives. The paper examines the retail industry, 
in order to identify marketing and supply chain collaboration through the S&OP framework. The research has 
identified several findings within applications towards retail, implying further focus towards product and 
distribution planning due to the product focused nature of the industry. We suggest further applications of the 
framework to be reviewed and adjusted in accordance to the proposed objectives so as to align all departments 
within the company.

1. Background
The integration of Supply Chain Management and Marketing functions is vital in delivering high quality of 
services to customers. Without the integration of demand and supply functions, a firm may underperform. It is 
further elaborated on the importance of integrating both of these functions. Marketing is crucial in maintaining 
varying demands and consumer segments to identify suitable product offerings, while Supply Chain Management 
concerns the operational side of the business, such as inbound, outbound, holding stocks, and on-time deliveries. 
Thus, the importance of integrating both functions is evident. In achieving cooperation between both departments, 
there are specific challenges that arise. Although the importance of aligning both departments has been addressed 
previously, having a framework that could conceptualise both demand and supply is highlighted to be fundamental 
in creating consumer value. A performance measurement metric is also crucial in assessing marketing and supply 
chain alignment results. The alignment has been repeatedly supported in the literature; however, there is little 
focus on identifying metrics that assess the impact.  
This paper is to highlight the impact of marketing and supply chain collaboration towards operational 
performance. The scope of the study will be limited to the SME landscape in Indonesia, specifically within the 
grocery industry. Hence, the research adopts a case study of SMEs operating within the grocery landscape. The 
case study company was established in 2018 as an online grocery service to provide convenience for its 
consumers. The company utilises digital marketing channels to promote its offerings and an ERP system to 
maintain its operations. The areas of marketing are discussed, specifically digital marketing and its capabilities. 
In addition, the areas of the supply chain are also discussed, emphasising the three flows, namely financial, 
information, and material flow. Hence, this paper provides a framework applicable to aligning marketing and 
supply chain activities and measurement metrics to streamline the decision-making process.  
The paper outlines the importance of S&OP in balancing demand and supply within firms. The outcomes suggest 
that both demand and supply spectrums may have separate roles in fulfilling the collaboration, where marketing

6. Conclusion
The paper proposed an S&OP framework and a set of performance metrics applicable to balance demand-supply 
for the retail industry. More practically, the paper conceptualises an improvement by applying the proposed 
framework. The results of this research have suggested alternative methods for improving marketing and supply 
chain collaboration, specifically within retailing. In light of the contribution, there is considerable research for 
future exploration, we recommend as follows.  
•
The research outlines the framework and performance metrics that enhance operations planning towards retail
applications. We used a case study to identify key considerations, operational activities, and capabilities towards
implementations. Furthermore, we would suggest the proposed framework to be carried out in a dedicated time
frame in order to properly identify the significance.
•
The current research only involved one case study company. While it is also foreseeable to use the current
methods, further examinations could involve more case study participants to validate the usefulness of marketing
and supply chain collaboration. We would further conceptualise a thorough outcome when added participants are
included within the research.
•
The current research only considers internal factors, such as company compatibility in implementing the proposed
framework. Hence, we would also consider external factors within execution in order to precisely determine the
impacts of marketing-supply chain collaboration. The consideration of external and internal factors may provide
companies with a dynamic view of the current environment, hence translates to better execution of the proposed
collaborative framework.

Abstract 
This paper aims to determine the most essential competitive priorities in terms of relative importance that enables 
competitive steel manufacturing in India and how these contribute to boost firm performance. Empirical data from 
248 managers of Indian steel industries were gathered using a survey method. It also applies Importance-
Performance Analysis (IPMA) using Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling with SmartPLS version 
4.0 to determine the relationship between importance and performance of competitive priorities and the attributes 
of firm performance. The results indicate that flexibility must be preserved and emphasized more since it requires 
improvement, while quality contributes to performance. Similarly, the financial performance shows major 
importance, while learning and growth adds to the performance of firm performance of steel industries. This 
research contributes to business strategy in steel organizations by comparing the relative importance of five 
competitive antecedents to their efficiency in enhancing firm performance. The findings of study can serve as a 
road map for steel company operations managers, focusing on a certain facet of manufacturing competitiveness 
based on their strategic orientation. This research adds to understanding by highlighting competitive priorities of 
the steel industries and their impact in increasing company success.

Abstract 
The design of the lineman's pliers was improved, with comfort as the primary consideration. An online survey was 
conducted to gather customer requirements and identify their needs. The data collected was analyzed using the House 
of Quality (HOQ) Matrix to determine the top features that might be improved based on the quantitative information 
gathered. The results of the HOQ matrix were then used in concept screening to finalize the concepts to be incorporated 
into the product design. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the key factors that customers consider 
important in the design of lineman's pliers and can be used as a reference for future design and development efforts in 
this area, emphasizing the significance of comfort in the design of lineman's pliers and serving as a guide for future 
design and development efforts in the field.

1. Introduction
Lineman's pliers, also called ""linemen,"" play a crucial role in electrical line work (Kral n.d.). Originally invented by 
German immigrant Mathias Klein in 1857, these handheld tools have been widely used by electricians since the early 
1900s to perform various tasks such as cutting, twisting, and bending wire (Kral n.d.). Despite their utility, poorly 
constructed lineman's pliers can result in workplace injuries, with over 10% of industrial employees getting injured 
annually (Carey and Gallwey, 2005). The ergonomic design of these tools, with a focus on wrist posture and grip, has 
been shown to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal disorders and increase productivity by 8% (Carey and Gallwey 
2005). 
In this paper, the researchers aim to improve the design of lineman's pliers by utilizing various design approaches and 
tools, such as the House of Quality (HOQ), to understand users’ needs and requirements. The HOQ analysis is used 
in concept screening to determine the top features to be incorporated into the design. The use of advanced materials 
and technologies, such as carbon fiber and titanium, has been shown to increase the durability and lifespan of the tools 
while reducing user fatigue (Wang et al. 2018). Furthermore, recent developments in ergonomic design principles, 
such as anti-slip grips and adjustable jaw configurations, aim to improve user comfort and reduce hand and wrist strain 
(Li et al. 2019). The use of computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing has revolutionized the design

12). The lock mechanism proved to be an effective way to improve the grip of the pliers on the object it is holding. It 
also provided safety when the pliers were not in use. Furthermore, the prototype showed that the added designs did 
not impede with the usual functions of the pliers. Overall, the improvements did not complicate the product but, in 
fact, addressed the concerns that respondents raised in the survey. 
6. Conclusion
A new design for the lineman’s plier was created after considering user concerns and developing concepts that were 
developed, evaluated, and tested. The final product design addressed the concerns of users, focusing on the pliers’ 
handle, safety, and durability. It was not able to address all problems raised, but it prioritized the concerns that were 
very common and pressing to those who use lineman’s pliers. This type of pliers is a tool that is useful to have, 
especially when it comes to maintenance tasks. The lineman’s pliers may look simple, but there are still improvements 
that can be done to address issues that surface during the course of its use. 
For further studies, the researchers recommend exploring materials that can be used to manufacture lineman’s pliers 
without sacrificing any of the best qualities it already has. A study can also be done to evaluate the durability of the 
redesigned pliers, and potential fatigue associated with use of the new design.

Abstract 
Nowadays, the call to go green is getting stronger than ever. Numerous environmental issues are constantly arising, 
leading to various laws and regulations to address the problem. Companies and organizations are trying to integrate 
sustainability into their business processes. The construction industry, one of the largest industries, also encounters 
the same scenario. This study aims to bridge the gap between sustainability and the construction industry by developing 
a sustainable supplier selection tool. The researchers chose the country of the Philippines as the location. Sustainability 
is incorporated using the triple bottom-line framework. The triple-bottom-line framework consists of environmental, 
economic, and social dimensions. This framework allows a holistic view of the necessary things for prioritization and 
not on profitability alone. Existing literature and studies were found to determine the sub-criteria for each of the three 
dimensions. The economic dimension garnered a total of 15 sub-criteria, the social dimension has a total of 10 sub-
criteria, and 12 sub-criteria were determined for the environmental dimension, which sums up to 37 sub-criteria. A 
total of 100 respondents have participated with online survey questionnaires. Using factor analysis, the researchers 
were able to compress the 37 sub-criteria into eight sub-criteria: four sub-criteria under economic criterion, two sub-
criteria under social criterion, and two sub-criteria under environmental criterion. Moreover, Analytical Hierarchy 
Process (AHP), a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) tool, was employed to determine the relative weights, 
which corresponds to importance, of each sub-criterion. At the end, the researchers were able to develop a tool using 
Excel Visual Basic Application to determine the best sustainable supplier given the set of criteria.

1. Introduction
In recent years, concerns about global warming, natural resource depletion, and energy consumption have risen (One 
Planet Network  n.d.). Globally, the consumption of resources and energy is outpacing both population and economic 
growth, indicating that many resources and energy are used inefficiently. These unsustainable consumptions and 
practices have a critical impact on the environment and socio-economic, such as climate change, biodiversity loss, 
pollution, and loss of livelihood. The supply chain has significantly contributed to unsustainable consumption and 
practices (Luther 2021). With the sourcing of raw materials, production, inventory, and transportation and delivery, 
the supply chain frequently produces unnecessary waste. Thus, the government, non-government, and private 
organizations worldwide strive to minimize the impacts industries have on the environment, society, and economy by 
developing sustainable supply chain management. 
Among various industry sectors, the construction industry is considered one of the world's largest consumers of 
resources and waste generators. Around two-fifths of the world's energy and materials flow, one-sixth of freshwater 
reserves, and one-quarter of worldwide wood harvest are projected to be used by the construction industry (Turkyilmaz 
et al. 2019). Moreover, the construction industry generates an estimated 30% of total waste (BigRentz, Inc. 2022) and

Figure 11. Supplier Selection Interface 
 
The main command buttons on the Supplier Selection interface can also be found on the left side of the interface. The 
“Encode Supplier” button will prompt a user form that the user should fill up to input a material offered and the 
suppliers who will be evaluated. Only one material could be evaluated at a time. Thus, only the suppliers offering this 
specific material will appear on the company selection list. The user should encode the suppliers and their 
corresponding scores on each criterion one at a time. Once the form is complete and encoded, all information will 
appear in the interface. The “Remove Supplier” button will prompt a user form where the user can select the supplier 
that will be removed from the evaluation. The “Evaluate” button will compute the total score of each criterion and the 
weighted score concerning its relative importance, sustainability rating based on table 2, ranking, and give remarks 
whether to proceed or not on each supplier. The “Save Rating and Remarks to Supplier Information” button will copy 
the sustainability rating and remarks of each supplier to its corresponding row and remarks column on the supplier 
information interface. The “Print to PDF” button will enable the user to save the evaluation as PDF externally. A user 
form will be prompted where the user can enter the desired file name. The PDF file will be automatically saved in the 
computer’s document folder. Lastly, the “Clear Data” button will reset the evaluation sheet. The encoded material 
offered, suppliers, scores, and results will be deleted. 
 
6. Conclusions 
The proponents used existing literatures and studies to determine different sub-criteria for each of the triple bottom 
line framework. 15 sub-criteria were found for the economic criterion, 10 sub-criteria for social criterion, and 12 sub-
criteria for environmental criterion. Upon determining the sub-criteria, the data-gathering procedure was employed 
then factor analysis was utilized to determine the significant and insignificant criteria and sub-criteria and reduce the 
large number of variables into fewer number. The result of the hypothesis testing states that all main criteria and its 
sub-criteria have a significant impact on sustainable supplier selection in the Philippine construction industry. The 
environmental factor was reduced from 15 sub-criteria to four sub-criteria: S.A.F.E, Organizational Stability, 
Competitive Dimension, and Affordability and Technological Capability. The social factor was reduced from 10 sub-
criteria to two sub-criteria: Employee Management, Safety and Health, and Adherence to Rights and Policy. Finally, 
the environmental factor was reduced from 12 sub-criteria to two sub-criteria: Green Innovation Practices and 
Environmental Corporate Social Responsibility. The proponents determined the relative weight of importance of the 
criteria and the synthesized sub-criteria through Analytical Hierarchy Process. The researchers developed a sustainable 
supplier selection tool using Excel VBA to aid procurement decision-makers in assessing the suppliers standing and 
addressing the growing negative impact of the construction industry on the economy, society, and the environment. In 
conclusion, the criteria and sub-criteria will serve as a guide in ensuring that the chosen supplier will benefit the 
company most, not solely by profit but also by social and environmental aspects.

Abstract 
The paper gives insights about carrying out maintenance activities in hazardous work environments by first 
identifying factors that affect the maintenance activities and then uses the Total Interpretive Structural Modelling 
(TISM) method to analyse the interrelationship between identified major factors that affect the mechanical 
maintenance activities in hazardous environment in process industries. The MICMAC analysis used to rank these 
factors. The identified key factors are effectiveness and robustness of safety department, tools and technology 
being used for the maintenance activities. This paper states that safety department plays an integral role in 
providing a safe environment for the working maintenance teams.

1. Introduction
Maintenance as the word itself suggests relates to the activity of keeping the equipment and machinery at the 
workplace in their original state such that their condition does not depreciate over continuous usage and passage 
of time. Maintenance is one of the most underrated and neglected areas of a process-oriented organization owing 
to it being a cost center rather than a profit producing one. The umbrella of maintenance involves all activities 
from lubrication to overhauling of large machines. Carrying out maintenance is not always easy as the machines 
are required for carrying out the production process at the factories and stopping a machine for carrying out 
maintenance directly relates to downtime of the machine and hence subsequent loss in production.  
Maintenance becomes even more difficult when the activity has to be carried out in hazardous environment which 
includes exposure of the working personnel to high temperature, toxic gases, poisonous vapors, excessive dust, 
etc. Many a times, it is observed that because an equipment is operating in hazardous environment, the damage to 
the equipment is much higher than anticipated. Also, the working personnel are scared to work in such 
environments and have adverse and irreversible health effects from prolonged working in such conditions. This 
paper identifies eight factors that affects carrying out the maintenance activities in the hazardous environment and 
then analyze interrelationship between these variables to help the managers understand which factor they should 
concentrate on to carryout maintenance activities more efficiently in such environments. 
The main objectives of this paper are as follows: 
• To identify and establish interdependence of the factors that affects the maintenance activities in hazardous work
environment.
• To rank the factors based on driving power and dependence of each factor.
2. Literature Review
Utilizing failure and accident knowledge to attain the highest level of safety at the lowest possible cost is the major 
goal of the maintenance process. The goal of risk-based maintenance is to achieve tolerable risk standards by 
inspecting high-risk elements more frequently and thoroughly as well as maintaining them more frequently 
(Arunraj and Maiti  2007). By more precisely estimating event occurrence, maintenance and evaluation play a 
crucial role in risk reduction. If appropriate safety mechanisms are in place with little maintenance and inspection, 
the repercussions and danger to employees, the environment, and the equipment can be made tolerable or 
negligible where there is a probability of a high-risk catastrophic failure. A number of examples in which the 
authors have been involved and where failures would have been avoided if effective risk assessment protocols 
had been in place, or in which risk assessments were made to avert failure, are reviewed by Brown and Le May 
(2000). Over the past few decades, the focus of maintenance methods has shifted beyond minimizing downtime 
to more advanced techniques like ""condition monitoring"" and ""reliability-centered preventive maintenance

Figure 2 depicts the MICMAC graph. Table 6 shows the ranking of the factors affecting maintenance in hazardous 
work environment. According to the ranking, effectiveness and robustness of safety department, tools and 
technology being used for the maintenance activities are the key factors. Cost factor is the factors are ranked sixth 
in the MICMAC analysis ranking.  
5. Managerial/ Practical Implications
The study uses TISM approach to identify the interrelationship between factors affecting maintenance activities 
in hazardous work environments, and then uses MICMAC analysis to rank these factors. The models used in the 
study are easy to understand and interpret by any practitioner. In addition, mechanical maintenance teams can use 
this study to understand the interrelationship between the factors and how changing one factor can have ripple 
effect changes on other factors. As per the study conducted, effectiveness and robustness of safety department and 
tools and technology being used are the key driving factors and have maximum influence on the maintenance 
activities in hazardous environments. Also, failure rate and cost factors are dependent and are influenced by all 
the other factors taken in this study.  
6. Conclusion
The study examines the interrelationship between factors affecting maintenance activities in hazardous 
environments in process industries. The results obtained through this research will help the maintenance teams in 
carrying out maintenance activities in the most optimum and safe manners. In addition, it was also noticed from 
the results of the study, that, effectiveness and robustness of safety department plays an integral role in creating a 
safe work environment for the maintenance teams. Tools and Technology used by for carrying out the maintenance 
activities in hazardous environment play an integral role and reduces the time required and cost factors 
significantly. On the contrary, cost factors and failure history contribute the least towards maintenance activities 
in hazardous environments. This research basically focuses on maintenance of production equipment’s in process 
industries, the future researches can be carried out specific type of maintenance activities in various chemical

Abstract 
The purpose of this essay is to identify the difficulties that teachers in diverse Indian home situations experience 
when they deliver online instruction. To examine how the components interact, the study used the TISM method. 
From a literature search and expert perspectives, nine variables that influence teachers during online teaching have 
been discovered. The MICMAC analysis is used to classify the variables based on driving power and dependence. 
The study's results could be useful to regulatory authorities and primary and secondary educational institutions 
that are considering making online teaching a routine practice. The findings will aid them in evaluating their 
present policy frameworks, as well as building new regulations and technology mechanisms to support their 
instructors in effectively embracing EdTech to deal with any future crises.

1. Introduction
Covid-19, a contagious virus, has wreaked havoc on the global economy and tremendously influenced global 
learning. As per the “United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO),” the disaster 
affected 63 million teachers in 165 nations. 1.3 billion students throughout the world were unable to pursue school 
or college, including 32,07,13,810 students from India on its own. The disruption of teaching and exams has 
slowed student progress and had a broader socioeconomic effect. Covid-19 shifted from a classroom learning 
paradigm to an education technological (EdTech) paradigm, which introduced instructors and students to cutting-
edge instructional approaches. 
It's important to remember that online education can't work without instructors, who will be the main personnel 
of every academic facility. Teachers must adapt to technology to undertake online teaching and evaluations 
successfully. Online education is not very common in India, and there are several obstacles to overcome, including 
a lack of proper infrastructure, such as laptops, a lack of encouragement, family distractions, a lack of technical 
training, and so on. The aim of this study is to recognize the obstacles that teachers face when teaching and 
assessing students online at home. The study's results could be useful to regulators who are considering making 
online teaching and evaluation a routine practice in the future.   
2. Literature Review
All University Collages in Sri Lanka were closed due to the spread of Covid-19 (Jayalath et al. 2020). For both 
academics and students, e-learning had become the rubric. This paper provides key insights into developing a 
digital strategy for online degree delivery in universities. To identify the characteristics of online learning, rank 
the barriers to online learning adoption, and assess the effectiveness of online learning. Reveal any possible steps 
taken to address problems with internet distribution and ease the transition to an online mode of education in the 
event of a full lockdown. This paper also discusses the above concerns in the context of university collages where 
no prior experience with online course delivery exists. Many with basic IT skills and those who have attended 
taring workshops are secure in their ability to embrace the method, while those with weak IT competency choose 
to gradually adapt. Inadequate internet bandwidth, as well as poor and inconvenient internet connectivity, 
exacerbate the issue. Inadequate ability to handle the vast number of students using the internet is a concern once 
again. 
Aristovnik et al. (2020) conducted the latest survey till present about how learners understand the effects of 
Covid's initial phase affecting various elements of their lifestyles on a worldwide scale, and how individual 
perceives the effects of Covid's initial shock on various components of their living. Due to a lack of computing 
competence and the perception of a larger burden, they were unable to perceive their own greater success in the

• Budget for institutional-supported 
technologies. 
• Lack of technical support 
 
As per the MICMAC analysis, the factors influencing the last mile delivery is ranked (Suresh et al. 2021; Suresh 
et al. 2021; Suresh and Yogesh, 2021; Suresh and Krishnan 2021) in Table 6.

5.  Managerial/ Practical Implications 
The study's results may be useful to regulators who are considering making online teaching and evaluation a 
routine practice in the near future. The hurdles that have been found should be considered ahead of time, and a 
roadmap can be created to ensure that online teaching and evaluation runs smoothly. The teacher's obstacles to 
online teaching should be considered, and the syllabus and exams can be prepared accordingly. Once the situation 
has returned to normal, the findings of this study may be used to prepare teachers in the future. Rather than trying 
to balance the different variables using simplistic logic, using the results of the TISM model also improves the 
likelihood of more efficient use of resources. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The Covid-19 pandemic has pushed the educational system to become more tech-savvy. While it is clear that 
online classes cannot replace traditional teaching methods. The role of institutional support technologies in online 
teaching is clearly demonstrated in this paper. It is necessary to have an exclusive department dedicated to 
improving the institution's technical infrastructure in order to imbibe technology-driven teaching in real or virtual 
environments. Lack of motivation, negative attitude, budget for institutional-supported technologies and lack of

technical support are the key or driving enablers in this model. The TISM approach was used in this paper to 
define the factors and create a model that contributes to a successful understanding of the factors affecting teachers 
in online teaching in the digital age. As a result, this model serves as a guide for regulatory authorities and 
educational institutions, highlighting the challenges that teachers face in the online mode of teaching, and assisting 
them in taking immediate and appropriate steps to resolve these challenges.

Abstract 
In recent times the community is facing an alarming threat from the repeated pandemic, which has changed our 
lifestyle in many ways. This study assesses the fact that how the mind set of customers buying decisions in 
supermarkets for their day-to-day consumables and essential products have changed because of this pandemic. 
This change in behavior is found by identifying some factors that are related to the consumers buying behavior in 
supermarkets and then deeply related to the pandemic. The aim of this paper is to develop assessment framework 
for consumer purchase decision in supermarkets using multi-grade fuzzy approach. The framework is developed 
using four enablers, twelve criteria and twenty-four attributes. Important Performance Analysis (IPA) is conducted 
to find the gaps where the case-supermarket lagged which in turn could attract the customers to increase foot 
traffic and sales. 
Keywords 
Assessment framework; consumer purchase decision; supermarket; multi-grade fuzzy; IPA. 
1. Introduction
Consumer behaviour helps us learn how an individual customer group of people or set of people in an organization 
purchase identify use and induce proposal for products and services to fulfil the needs and wants of the consumer. 
It depicts the fundamental progress for the activities based on the measures of the consumers in the marketplace. 
This study also presumes that the consumers are the major role players in the marketplace. The outlook of this 
theory presumes that the consumers take part in different parts in the marketplace where they belong originating 
from the detail’s contributor beginning from the consumer to the spender and to the disposer the consumers take 
part in these activities actively in the decision process. The consumer behaviour as the totality of consumers where 
the decisions are made with respect to the acquisition usage (Hoyer and MacInnis 2010) and disposition of 
products services time take, and the ideas generated by the human decision-making process. 
The purchase selection process is also called as the shopper selection process, the purchase decision of a product 
helps the marketers to analyze and identify the consumers complete journey from knowing a product. The 
mandatory requirement for marketing and sales is based on the realization of the purchaser’s buying decision 
process. The purchaser or the consumer’s problems should be fulfilled by setting a marketing plan which enables 
them and also convinces them to buy the product or service that meets their needs or wants. The buyer’s selection 
criteria contain problem identification, analysing and evaluating the problem, search recognition and then buying 
decision. The need or want of a particular problem helps the consumer identify the buying process, which is 
initiated either by external or internal stimuli. The satisfaction and dissatisfaction of a buyer results in their later 
purchase behaviour. 
Due to the pandemic cause, people started to hoard food from all types of grocery stores and super and hyper 
markets, this sudden purchase decision by the people caused for sudden and rapid emptying of goods in the 
particular racks and stalls even though the government has been continuously communicating that, there won’t be 
scarcity for food and commodities for all the people at any point even if there is an extension in the lockdown. 
Many preceding studies and research had stated that the individuals in community under conditions of instability 
caused in the society is specifically for both economically and sociologically (Long and Khoi 2020).  
The Covid-19 pandemic has actually changed the buying behaviour of people all over the world even in 
ecommerce platform. Many people who were not a fan of online shopping have actually shifted to online platform 
during this Covid-19 period. WOM (Word of Mouth) plays a vital role in covering the people’s buying decisions, 
adding to that word of mouth actually helps people in good and bad buying experiments. Though word of mouth

Table 3. Suggestions for weaker attributes 
 
Weaker attributes 
Suggestions for improvement 
Spacing between products 
• The shop has an enormous amount of floor space, but it would be 
good if they could provide more space among the daily essentials 
so that the customers won’t squeeze. 
Interior display: Attractive 
arrangement of the products in the 
store which results in impulse 
buying by the customers 
• The store quite lacked in planogram, attractive arrangement 
would a major spot for the store to increase sales. They could use 
some creative ways and techniques to arrange the products in a 
more attractive way to increase sales in impulse buying. 
Placement of packed food and day 
to day consumables 
• Sanitary utilities are placed in the closest reach, whereas some 
importance could be given to consumables as well.  
Enough space in the billing area 
• There were eight billing counters but only three or four are active, 
they could make all the billing counters active. 
Workers to assist in providing 
proper spacing between the 
vehicles 
• The shop had a huge and plenty of space for parking, but no 
parking assist was given, hence the customers tend to get 
crowded near the shop entrance. 
 
6. Practical Implications 
The case study first helped us to find the enablers, criteria and attributes to develop a multi-grade fuzzy assessment 
framework. The study has come up with four practical implications from the managerial point of view. The first 
one would be the places where the managers should concentrate to improve the performance in the supermarkets 
which would motivate for more foot traffic in the stores and increase sales. The second one is a set of attributes 
where the case-supermarket is already doing good and should keep on doing the good work. The third would be 
where the supermarket managers should never compromise on certain attributes which would be a possible harm 
to the customers. The final one implication is of low importance yet if the managers could bring in some 
improvements where they could bring more sales through motivation in the minds of the consumers buying 
decisions. 
 
7. Conclusion 
Based on the study conducted in the customers buying or purchasing behavior. The study found that there were 
some attributes involved which played a prominent role in the supermarket characteristics. In this study identified 
were four enablers, which involves customers buying decisions in the supermarkets. Based on those enablers there 
were several criteria and attributes that relate to the customers buying decision in supermarkets. Multi-grade fuzzy 
was used as a methodology to develop this assessment framework. Then the attributes are classified based on its 
importance and weightages with the help of Importance Performance Analysis. The weaker attributes are 
identified from IPA, and also identified the key attributes where they are doing good. Hence, from this study it is 
clear that how customers buying decisions vary accordingly, also the places and perspectives where the 
supermarkets should fill the missing gaps to make more foot traffic in their stores and increase sales. Thus, the 
study has proven that how this pandemic has affected the customer buying decisions.

Abstract 
This research's goal is to list and rate the variables that affect how well Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized 
Enterprises (MSME) function. The Total Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) technique determines the 
interconnectedness, relative importance, and relationships between various components. Analysing these factors' 
dependencies and driving forces is another key component of the work. The findings revealed that organisational 
reform, entrepreneurial spirit, and government backing are the key motivators. MSMEs should concentrate on 
these elements to enhance their performance. Additionally, by reforming MSMEs' businesses, this strategy will 
increase their profitability and resilience.

The Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector contributes significantly to overall economic activity 
and job creation. According to the DGCIS data for 2019-20, the MSME sector comprises a large network of 63 
million units and employs approximately 110 million people. In 2019, the sector accounts for 29 percent of overall 
GDP and 48.56 percent of total exports in 2017-18 (Tripathi 2020). As a result, Indian SMEs are more exposed 
to global supply chains and integration. The MSME industry, which is India's growth driver, accounts for 33.4 
percent of the country's manufacturing production (IBEF 2020).  With the government's new mission of achieving 
a $5 trillion economy by 2025, the sector's importance for the economy's socioeconomic growth has grown. 
COVID-19, which is said to have emerged in Wuhan in December 2019, has caused widespread havoc across the 
world. It has resulted in a large number of human casualties around the world, especially in Europe, the United 
States, China, and many other developed economies. 
The objectives of this study are described below: 
• To identify and rank the factors influencing the MSMEs
• To analyse the interrelationships among factors using TISM.
2. Literature Review
2.1 Government support
The government policy made to support entrepreneurship in the country for the growth of the MSMEs units, one
such is investing in capital. MSME’s capital needs are met by either internal source of funds or debt capital from
external sources. However, the lack of timely credit should be covered by immediate government attention. Verma
(2010) has reported that the government has developed industrial policies to facilitate the flow of credit towards
the micro, small and medium enterprises. Parthasarathy (1992) highlighted that the support from government is
necessary to increase the growth of business activities in the country. Squire (20 found that the small-scale
industries face more challenges as compared to the large enterprises, financially. The Indian government
addressed the MSMEs are more credit constrained, compared to large enterprise. The study in Kerala concluded
that the financial institutions are hesitating to extend the credit to small, scaled firms.
This in-turn brought to an insight that unless there is a change in the attitude of banks and financial institution, the 
government’s incentive packages for small industries were not able to reach the grass root level. Duan et al. (2009) 
also stressed on the fact that MSMEs are dependent upon the public sector banks and financial institutions to a 
large extent, financially. The absence of collateral security, MSMEs are not able to access credit from the banks 
and thereby limiting its contribution to the economic development. Sahoo and Ashwani (2020) highlighted the 
government’s support to create a strong foundation for the Indian MSMEs, the Government of India has taken 
different type of measures like, changing MSME definition, collateral-free automatic loans, subordinate debt for 
stressed MSMEs, equity infusion through fund of fund, liquidity through TDS/TCS rate reduction.

Figure 2 depicts the MICMAC graph. Table 6 shows the ranking of the factors influencing MSMEs performance. 
According to the ranking, Government support is the topmost triggering factor, that ranked one. Team building 
and marketing opportunities are the factors that are ranked fourth in the MICMAC analysis ranking. 
 
5.  Managerial/ Practical Implications 
The current study has analysed the interrelationship between the factors influencing the MSME performance. The 
first importance has been given to covid-19 relief measures taken by the government especially with respect to 
credit and finance which will ensure the lift-off of the sector financially. The next priority has been given to 
entrepreneurial spirit and organizational change which will help in enhancing the internal environment of the 
MSMEs and also improves their ability to face challenges due to the pandemic. Innovativeness and technology 
are given further priority. MSME’s key to survive pandemic is innovative ideas and solution and the adoption of 
technology which will help in enhancing the competitiveness of the enterprises towards sustainability and 
inclusive growth. The least importance is given to team building and marketing opportunities. Factors, F1, F2 and 
F6 are the priority driving factors have maximum influence on the MSMEs. Hence, the enterprises must employ 
these factors in order to overcome the pandemic. Factors F4 and F7 were found to be influenced by all of the other 
selected factor i.e., changes in any one of the other factors will inflict a change on these dependent factors. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study identified the influencing factors by using TISM approach to implement survival strategies for the 
MSMEs performance. The key important factors identified are Government support, entrepreneurial spirit, and 
organizational change. The main key factor is government support which has an impact on the factors like 
entrepreneurial spirit, innovativeness and technology. Entrepreneurial spirit will decide the internal environment 
of the MSME and also adds up to innovativeness. Organizations attitude to change its practices, strategies etc 
influences the spirit of the entrepreneurs. Innovativeness influences the technology adopted by the MSME’s and 
also enhances the marketing opportunities of the business. On the other hand, technology influences 
innovativeness and the ability to meet customer needs. There is limitation in the present study. Firstly, the expert 
opinions are confined to one country. Second, survey is used to develop a theoretical model, which is based on 
the expert opinions. In such a case it is not possible to avoid the biasness from experts.

Abstract 
In recent years, social media development has changed the advertising and marketing landscape and has turned into a 
tool that businesses would do well to exploit. In 2019-2020 the growth of postpaid users has decreased. To increase 
user growth and understand the factors that influence consumer buying interest, companies need to know the key 
factors that can increase purchase intentions, in order to formulate a better marketing strategy. This study aims to 
determine the influence of marketing on social media with the variables of quality of social media, quantity of social 
media, and credibility of social media on customer inspiration and customer purchase intention. The method used in 
this study is a quantitative method. The questionnaire distributed to 384 consumers from prepaid users who have 
Instagram and have seen Telkomsel Halo content on Instagram. Sampling was carried out using a non-probability 
sampling method of purposive sampling. The data analysis technique uses SEM – PLS (Partial Least Square) which 
is processed using SmartPLS software. It was found that customer inspiration has a positive and significant effect on 
purchase intention. The indirect effect on purchase intention is also found credibility of social media marketing has a 
positive and significant effect on purchase intention.

1. Introduction
The results of the Kominfo survey in 2017 showed that the majority of Indonesian people already have smartphones. 
The number is almost 2/3 of the total Indonesian people or twice that of those who do not have smartphones. Interesting 
features that can provide a connectivity experience to cyberspace and the increasing number of smartphones being 
sold at low prices in the market can be a trigger for high smartphone ownership in Indonesia. Other results from this 
survey also show that more urban people have smartphones compared to rural communities. However, the number of 
smartphone penetration in rural areas has reached more than 50.39% of the total rural population. This condition shows 
that even though they live in rural areas, Indonesian people can still keep abreast of existing technological 
developments.

6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of descriptive testing, it shows that the respondents' assessment of Social media marketing 
(Instagram) Telkomsel Halo, which consists of the variables Quality (entertainment, Interaction, Trendiness, 
Customization, e-WOM), Quantity, Credibility, and Customer Inspiration, has an average value of 73.3%. It means it 
has a category of 'Good'. According to the respondents, the variable with the highest score is the variable credibility, 
with a value of 79.7%. This shows that respondents consider the information provided by Telkomsel Halo on 
Instagram to be trusted. 
 
The influence of each Quality of Social Media Marketing sub-variable, namely Entertainment, Interaction, Trendiness, 
Customization, and e-WOM on Customer Inspiration has positive and significant results. The results of tests 
conducted to determine the indirect effect of social media marketing variables on purchase intention show that it has 
a positive and significant influence. 
 
The findings in this study are expected to help the Telkomsel Halo brand understand the consumer's perspective. 
Suggestions are aimed at variable indicators that can be improved to improve consumer perceptions and impressions 
of Telkomsel Halo marketing. 
 
Based on t-values and p-values, Customer Inspiration was the most influential factor in the Purchase Intention of 
Prepaid users who own and have seen Telkomsel Halo content on Instagram. The descriptive statistical analysis found 
that item CI17, ""After seeing content on Telkomsel Halo social media (Instagram), I am motivated to buy more Halo 
products/services,"" got the lowest percentage score, namely 73.8%. From these findings, the authors suggest that 
Telkomsel Halo to increase consumer inspiration so they can be more interested in products or services from 
Telkomsel Halo. This can be done by providing various information on the benefits consumers will get if they use 
Telkomsel Halo and what more value consumers will feel and receive. Telkomsel can also collaborate with certain 
parties to educate consumers and increase customer inspiration. The content can be in the form of product/service 
reviews by influencers or KOLs who are experts in that field so that consumers can be more trusting and interested in 
the content provided. 
 
The object of this research is Instagram with the Telkomsel Halo case study in the telecommunications Industry, so 
the study's results cannot be generalized to other social media platforms and other business industries. The author 
suggests further research to learn more about this social media marketing topic on other social media platforms and 
other business sectors or even conduct comparative research between several social media platforms. 
It is expected to be able to conduct research by adding indicators and or variables that have not been included in this 
research model. Thus, a new research model will be formed which is expected to be more perfect than previous studies.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to identify, analyze and develop a structural model for the identified factors that can 
influence the electricity distribution using Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) approach. From this study, the 
results specify that the key factors are demand fluctuations, personal protection, uninterrupted distribution, 
location, construction activities, consumption charges perspective, electrical subsidiary industries. The ISM 
framework has been developed in this paper, which is a first attempt to analyse the interrelationship among the 
electricity distribution impacting factors. This study will be useful for practitioners and power distribution 
companies (DISCOM) to understand the factors influencing electricity distribution.

1. Introduction
In recent times due to the impact of the pandemic caused due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and it’s 
resulting lockdown has made the electricity demand to drop quickly across India with the implications of 
confinement and safety measures (IEA 2021). Electricity distribution is considered as the significant area in the 
power sector operational chain, Indian Government has provided much assistance to states through various 
sponsored schemes by the state and central government for improving the distribution sector (MoP 2021). 
Electricity distribution in India is capable to supply around more than 20 crore consumers with a connected load 
capacity capable to handle higher than 400 GW spread out in 28 diverse states and 8 union territories. Such widely 
spread customers are connected by almost 73 distribution facilities (MoP 2016). In India, the primary problem is 
with the large amount of losses in energy that occurs with the electricity distribution, on comparison this is very 
huge than the other countries and with the worldwide average (Jamasb et al. 2021). For streamlining the 
maintenance of electricity distribution, networks face a number of obstacles, this is because of the consumer 
inclination for such services tend to alter disruptively, the number of distributed power resources that are 
connected to the grid has increased, and more advanced format data interpretation and communication 
technologies has become omni present day by day (Bovera et al. 2021). 
The pandemic protection measures introduced by the government for the safety and well being of the citizens, has 
significantly brought down the workforce count that is available and also demands strict hygiene and social 
distancing protocols to maintain flawless and safe operations in their workplace. Reduction in the demand for 
electricity consumption in the commercial connections has its own challenges where the staff and engineers have 
to monitor and maintain voltage implications to foresee and meet the future demands, at the same time avoid any 
chances that can cause any kind of dangers at the grid and distribution levels. With the pandemic emergencies 
evolving with time, electricity utility companies have to plan ahead for options that can fit in various situations 
which can be the possibilities to unfold in different time frames making the organisation to be ready for fast and 
efficient decision-making. Also, it has become mandatory to operate in line with the government and regulating 
authorities to face the implications that can arises for sustainability, innovation, energy affordability, and security 
of supply (PWC 2021). The power supply distribution of India completely differs from the highly modernized, 
advanced and upgraded generation and transmission electric systems, distribution is in a deteriorated condition 
making the effective generation of power supply to drop. The pace of expansion and modernization  of such 
systems did match with the generation and transmission of electricity; thus, the electricity distribution is now 
becoming the feeble link in the power sector operational chain (Verma et al. 2020). Yet, the states like Tamil 
Nadu and Kerala are quite different where the generation, distribution operations are centralized with Tamil Nadu 
Generation and Distribution Corp. Ltd.(TANGEDCO) whereas Kerala State Electricity Board Ltd.(KSEBL) 
operates the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity to the state respectively (Das and Srikanth

Figure 2 depicts the MICMAC graph. Table 8 displays the ranking of the factors influencing electricity 
distribution. According to the ranking, consumption charges perspective, electrical subsidiary industries are the 
triggering factors, that ranked one. The factor that is ranked sixth in the MICMAC analysis ranking is manpower.  
 
5.  Managerial/ Practical Implications 
This research paper has studied and analyzed the interrelationship of factors. The results would help to understand 
the influencing factors for the electricity distribution among the employees and consumers during repeated  
pandemic to implement effectiveness in electricity distribution service. ISM and MICMAC analysis help to rank 
each of the factors based on their influencing level, so that government and distribution centres can concentrate 
on the top most influencing factor first, and subsequently move on and focus on the rest of the other influencing 
factors. The first significance is towards the consumption charges perspective and electrical subsidiary industries. 
The next importance is towards the demand fluctuations, personal protection, uninterrupted distribution, location, 
construction activities. The usage of renewable sources, staff salary and operating cost are given further 
importance. After these factors the importance is towards sector wise distribution. Finally the least and last 
importance has been given to the rest of the factors. Hence, this flow of analysis and rankings would help the 
government for better effectiveness in distributing electricity.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The present study helps the government and DISCOMs to identify the important factors that influence the 
distribution of electricity. This research paper has applied the ISM approach to identify the factors and the 
developed model leads to the successful analysis of factors that influences in the electricity distribution sector. 
The factors consumption charges perspective and electrical subsidiary industries play a significant role in the 
electricity distribution. The key factors that are identified from this study supports the DISCOMs for the effective 
distribution of power. This study would assist in identify dependent, independent, linkage and driving factors that 
influences electricity distribution. The demand fluctuations, personal protection, uninterrupted distribution, 
location, construction activities, consumption charges perspective, and electrical subsidiary industries are the key 
factors that are more important for influencing the electricity distribution. Sector-wise distribution and manpower 
has  more significant dependence factors involved in this study. This is because the changes in any of the other 
factors shows noticeable changes in the manpower and sector wise distribution. Also factors like usage of 
renewable sources, payment policy, staff salary and operating costs are autonomous factors. Extension of this 
study can deal with more specific regions so that challenges can be further reduced in future research. And

Abstract 
The construction industry is composed of various organizations and individuals. This creates a complicated 
environment requiring effective leadership and teamwork for the project to succeed. This, by implication, requires 
that the project teams communicate effectively to build solid relationships. This article aimed to ascertain 
communication factors that enable success in the construction industry. Combinations of primary and secondary data 
were used in the process of carrying out the research. The primary data were obtained from the use of closed structured 
questionnaires. Secondary data was obtained through a survey of related literature from existing sources. The 
questionnaire was sent out to professionals working for the built environment clients, consultants, contractors, and 
government departments. Subsequently, outputs were analysed and interpreted. Several factors were found to be 
efficient in enhancing the effectiveness of project management through communication. These include; 
communicating project objectives from the onset and continuously monitoring the progress with regard to the stated 
outcome. The article presents an overview of critical communication factors in the construction industry and provides 
a new leaf to enhance construction project management.

Effective Communication, Project Management and Construction Industry 
Introduction 
The construction industry is composed of various organizations and individuals. This creates a complicated 
environment which requires effective leadership and teamwork in order for the project to succeed. This, by implication 
requires that the project teams be able to communicate effectively in order to build solid relationships. To effectively 
communicate, proper communication management schemes must be adopted to set the path for accurate distribution 
and sharing the project information Taleb et al. (2017). Construction projects are increasingly becoming competitive, 
complex and difficult to manage Vasista and Abone (2018). 
It is however important to note that, in a project-based industry, interactions takes place between groups of people 
who are unfamiliar with each other; and who come together for a short period prior to the inception of the project. The 
different languages, personalities, values and cultures are a cause for individuals to perceive things in a different and 
multiple ways; thus it becomes more imperative for the parties to reach a common understanding of the goals and 
mission of the project. Significantly, communication is a strategic consideration Olanrewaju et al. (2017).  In addition, 
the construction industry is evolving and becoming more complex in nature as new designs are introduced, and these 
requiring new advanced technologies which perpetuate a challenging environment for conveying vital information as 
well as its reception by role players and parties involved. Also, most construction disputes are due to inadequate 
communication among team members Olanrewaju et al. (2017). 
Construction managers should prioritize effective communication in order to improve performance. Without effective 
communication, the construction industry remains stranded and divided other than united. This confirms that 
communication is essential in leading, managing and working with others Note (2016). By suggestion, leaders in the 
construction industry should develop a company communication strategy to maximize outputs. If effective

5.4 Validation 
Validity refers to the degree to which an instrument measures what it is intended to measure (Brink et al. 2012). There 
are three main approaches for estimating the validity of measuring instruments designed to collect quantitative data. 
These are content validity, construct validity and criterion related validity. The self-developed questionnaire items 
from the previous reviewed literature provided for content validity 
 
Conclusion 
The purpose of this research was to emphasise on the importance of communication strategies in enhancing effective 
construction project management.  To identify factors that act as a barrier to effective communication. According to 
the literature review of this research study, there are various types of communication processes and strategies used in 
the construction industry. The work completed by other researchers and scholars was supported by the findings from 
this research study that there are different communication processes and strategies used in the South African 
construction industry. Furthermore, findings showed communication plays a significant role in the construction project 
management. These include the communication plan which assists in communicating to the relevant people at the 
right time. However, there are number of challenges that affect the effectiveness of communication which can delay 
the project activities and processes.. The findings also revealed positive measures that can be taken to improve 
construction project performance using effective communication methods in the South African construction industry. 
Therefore, this research assists in providing communication factors to enhance effective project performance. This 
can be attainable through the practice of good communication. Thus, the project objectives of time, cost and quality

The study has also revealed the existing communication processes that are currently in use in the South African 
construction industry. Furthermore, factors that affect effective communication were identified. These include; late 
dissemination of information, sending incomplete information, noise due to construction activities, failure to 
continuously communicate project objectives and lack of coordination between project teams. 
In relations to the findings, it is recommended that project participants use communication tools effectively. These 
include; regular meetings and the use of effective communication channels for transmitting vital information. Also, a 
communication plan must be formulated so that the right information is sent to the right people at the right time. From 
this, it is recommended that; 
The scope and objectives of the project are communicating to all participants from the onset of the project. 
It is also recommended that construction project managers emphasise on the importance of sending information.

Abstract 
Energy plays a crucial role in developing a country and defining its’ living standards though many still use non-
renewable energy with high greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, there needs to be a change to new and renewable 
energy usage. In Indonesia, hydropower has huge potential as new and renewable energy. The government's 
support also follows in realizing potential. However, risks and uncertainties are involved when investing in new 
and renewable energy projects, particularly hydropower plants. Therefore, it’s crucial to calculate the value of a 
project while considering the risks involved in the valuation model. The Value at Risk approach using Discounted 
Cash Flow and Monte Carlo Simulation is viable for calculating the value while accounting for risk. This study 
aims to discover the value of a mini hydropower plant facility while accounting for risks and uncertainties by 
discovering the Value at Risk with a 95% confidence level tested through two different scenarios. The results show 
that the value decreases when faced with risks at a determined confidence level. It also shows the most significant 
risk affecting the valuation is the water flow rate in the facility's production. Additionally, the significance of the 
risk and uncertainty factors can increase through different scenarios.

1. Introduction
Energy plays a crucial role in developing a country and defining its living standards. The ever-increasing 
population and industrialization demand for more energy to be used. This rise in demand is rapidly depleting the 
supply of conventional energy resources (Singh & Singal 2016). In Indonesia, electricity energy demand is 
showing an increase due to the push of Electric Vehicle adoption by the government according to the Institutes for 
Essential Services Reform (2021). This agenda increases the consumption for energy, specifically electricity in 
the country. 
Along that line, the rapid growth of energy demand is accompanied by rising climate change issue. One of the 
factors of climate change issue is the rapid increase of greenhouse gas (GHG), specifically carbon dioxide (CO2). 
The government of Indonesia has previously made efforts in increase new and renewable energy usage in the 
energy mix. However, as of November 2021, the usage of new and renewable energy in the energy mix is only at 
11,50% (Agung 2022). This goes to show that there must be more efforts in realizing the potentials of new and 
renewable energy in Indonesia, such as hydropower energy. 
In increasing new and renewable energy usage, hydropower offers a number of benefits and plays a crucial role 
against climate changes. As a clean and renewable energy, the sources are abundant due to the fact that our earth 
are made mostly out of water. Though, hydropower plants have large costs of establishing, maintaining and 
operating. For that reason, a small-scale hydropower plant is a suitable option for a relatively lower cost but 
powerful plant. A mini hydropower plant has advantages of lower costs than large-scale, power output of 1–10 
MW, and the use of small water area that could supply electricity to regional grid. 
Hydropower is one of the new and renewable energy that has a large energy potential in Indonesia at 75.091 MW 
(Prasetyo et al. 2022). This low realization of potential is caused by a major challenge that are slowing the 
development of the hydropower plant sector. According to Chairman of the Association of Micro Hydropower

Figure 11 shows the difference between the NPV of the base model and the NPV-at-Risk. On normal condition, 
the Monte Carlo Simulation considering the risk registers on the financial model results in a value loss of 
Rp5.775.127.369 or 21,20%. On the second scenario, it results in a value loss of Rp9.049.645.223 or 33,22%. The 
Value at Risk analysis has shown that considering risks in a valuation will result in potential losses and lower 
valuation. From Figure 12, it revealed the most significant risk, the Water Flow Rate (Q). Additionally, there is a 
negligible increase on the coefficient in different scenario meaning that the result is concurrent between the two 
scenarios. 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
After conducting this research, the risk factors in the valuation of mini hydropower plants can be categorized into 
financial (O&M Cost) and production (Water Flow Rate) risks. The mini hydropower plant's base valuation using 
the Discounted Cash Flow method is Rp 27.242.932.483 and affected by risk the valuation is Rp 21.467.805.114, 
21,20% lower in value on normal conditions, and Rp 18.193.287.260, 33,22% lower in value on adjusted inflation 
condition. The Water Flow Rate (Q) is the most significant risk factor in both scenarios. Lastly, faced with the risk 
factors, the valuation of the mini hydropower plant is lower than the base value, with a 95% confidence level on 
any scenario simulated in this research. 
After conducting this research, the recommendation from the author includes more in-depth research using Value 
at Risk methodology on other mini hydropower plant facility to discover the potential loss in value when faced 
with risk factors. Furthermore, this research can be further developed to determine the mitigation step after

Abstract 
Industry 4.0(I4.0) or the fourth industrial revolution is a strategy that relies on digital and ubiquitous connectivity 
enabled by various technologies to transform processes, products, and services through real-time and decentralized 
decision-making, allowing systems to transition from surveillance to autonomy in collaboration with humans. 
resulting in the emergence of 'Industry 4.0' The term '4.0' has been applied to a variety of fields, including Quality 4.0, 
Agriculture 4.0, Agribusiness 4.0, Service 4.0, Logistics 4.0, Health 4.0, and so on, all of which represent the impact 
of Industry 4.0 on these terms. Quality 4.0(Q 4.0) is a new term that refers to a new and improved approach to quality 
management, it how we can use the DATA obtained by 4.0 and use it correctly with the quality methodology, the 
objective of this paper is to explain industry 4.0 as well as quality 4.0 and presented the various quality 4.0 
relationships. 
Keywords: Quality 4.0; Industry 4.0; Quality management; Data; Connectivity. 
Introduction 
At the turn of the century, the world is witnessing the fourth industrial revolution and the digital transformation of the 
business world, dubbed Industry 4.0. The fourth industrial revolution is a success rather than a fad (Ardito et al. 2010). 
Schroeder et al. 2019; Buer et al. 2018). Since the term ""Industry 4.0"" was coined in 2011, the digital transformation 
required by Industry 4.0 has quickly captured public attention. worldwide attention of industrialists and governments 
Nascimento et al. 2019; Gobakhloo 2018). Since the 18th century, the world has faced the challenge of producing 
more goods with high quality to satisfy the customer from limited and depleting natural resources to meet ever-
increasing consumption demand while limiting negative environmental and social impacts. Furthermore, this paper 
was divided into five sections: first methodology we will represent the research methodology we used to write this 
paper, then we analyses 10 articles in this section we will explain the various quality 4.0 relationships, after we will 
past to discussion, and result to represented what we found, finally the conclusions and future developments. 
Objectives 
This paper has been divided into five sections: first methodology we will represent the research methodology we 
used to write this paper, then we analyze 10 articles in this section we will explain the various quality 4.0 
relationships, after we will past to discussion, and result to represented what we found, finally the conclusions and 
future developments. 
2. Literature Review
Quality 4.0 refers to the future of quality management achieved using emerging technologies in the context of Industry 
4.0 to achieve operational excellence. The shift to a digital way of working in the manufacturing industry is fueling 
the quality-driven revolution, resulting in greater robustness and efficiency in our processes.

technologies. Furthermore, the development of disruptive technologies has allowed for rapid advancements in 
business models and, as a result, management approaches. As a result, through good connectivity between the 
technical and social sides of digital transformation, quality management approaches have adapted to the evolution of 
the way of thinking and evaluating quality. In the literature, the social aspect of Quality 4.0 has received less attention 
than the technological aspect. Nonetheless, there is growing concern about the issue. Not only is human-machine 
interaction critical, but topics such as leadership, training and education, and the development of a supportive 
organizational culture have also been identified as critical to long-term transformation. Based on these findings, we 
highlight several key Quality 4.0 topics and propose a new definition for a better understanding of the concept. 
 
4. Conclusion  
In this study we start to give the different definition of quality 4.0 and it’s suggesting that 'Quality 4.0' is a new quality 
management trend. As a result, both theoretical and practical aspects of quality management practices will be altered 
in the future. Quality management practices are recommended to identify technological advancement as a key enabler 
of successful quality standard implementation in the Quality 4.0 era. According to the literature review, the most 
common Quality 4.0 topics are technology and its implications for quality, business management and strategy models, 
systems, and human or soft factors. The use of technology for quality management is represented in a variety of 
information sources, and it appears to be the most direct way to connect quality to technology. The majority of 
products, services, and operations can now be controlled automatically across the value chain thanks to intelligent 
machines and armed operators equipped with augmented reality technologies. The paper concluded that big data is so 
important for deep learning techniques, connectivity, collaboration, and data presentation are the main Quality 4.0 
technologies. 
Therefore, to give a more in-depth view of quality 4.0, we have prepared a questionnaire that we will publish to have 
a clear view of the industry and quality 4.0

Abstract 
The circular economy concept is crucial in moving forward with sustainable development in any country. It has been 
identified that implementing CE (Circular Economy) in the built environment has various benefits towards the 
environment, society as well as the economy. Although this approach has various benefits, its implementation in Sri 
Lanka is still at a premature stage. Green rating systems are used to qualitatively assess the building’s performance 
regarding sustainability aspects of the built environment. It remains unclear whether green rating systems in Sri Lanka 
provide an appropriate guide towards implementing the CE concept. Hence, this paper aims to analyze the contribution 
provided by green ratings in Sri Lanka towards the implementation of CE. Two pilot case studies and semi-structured 
interviews were carried out among industry experts who have hands-on experience in green rating systems and work 
experience in green building projects. Findings indicate that Green building projects have implemented various kinds 
of sustainable features to obtain a rating. Nevertheless, the practice of these features are not adequately reflecting the 
implementation CE concept due to numerous barriers to implement CE in Sri Lankan context. The study concludes 
that in Sri Lanka, the green rating system does not adequately contribute towards the implementation of CE.

1 Introduction  
Sustainable construction (SC) practices have been rapidly increasing worldwide in recent years due to the 
unsustainable activities of humankind  (Lima et al. 2021). As a model to move more toward a sustainable construction 
industry, Circular Economy (CE) concept has been promoted, which is defined as “a regenerative system that aims to 
keep materials in a closed loop at their highest value” (EMF 2015). Anastasiades et al. (2020) have also identified CE 
as a bridge toward a sustainable construction industry. The sustainability assessment tools were introduced to evaluate 
buildings' performance and to take into account sustainability aspects, reduce damage to the environment and 
encourage investors and facilities managers to improve buildings' performance by observing environmentally friendly 
procedures (Waer & Sibley 2005). In Sri Lanka, the construction industry is regarded as an essential indicator of 
economic growth (Rathnasinghe et al. 2020); on the other hand, it generates a considerable amount of waste due to 
the excess use of materials in various means (Osmani 2011; Rameezdeen et al. 2004; Zhao et al. 2020). Developing 
countries have a huge demand for sustainable construction practices (Alsanad 2015).  
The demand towards Sri Lanka's SC is high, but Sri Lanka needs to adequately incorporate SC practices (Jayalath & 
Gunawardhana 2017). In the context of SC practice, even in Sri Lanka, various researchers have dealt with the 
application of CE concepts (Atapattu et al. 2022; Wanaguru et al. 2022); although it is still a new concept, the industry's 
adaptability is poor (Liyanage et al. 2019). Consequently, the need to adopt the CE concept in Sri Lanka's construction

Abstract 
As music composition and technology grow, the pursuit for music creation with machine learning as a trans-human 
collaborator is a relatively new venture in the world of artificial intelligence. Various RNN models for music genres 
such as classical, folk, and jazz has been made but none specifically for pop music. The study aims to fill in this gap. 
A pop music dataset was created from Billboards' Hot 100 Year End Charts of 2021. The dataset was used to train 
LSTM-based RNN models which were then evaluated through loss. This revealed that the model with the lowest loss 
came from the ADAM optimizer making it the best choice with 200 epochs. The results of the chosen model were 
then evaluated through its perplexity and a listening test. With a low perplexity score, the model was deemed confident 
in creating novel midi samples. The listening test then tested the created midi samples, resulting in a good rating.

1. Introduction
Music is a way of life that has evolved throughout centuries of culture and tradition. From the simple hum of a random 
tune to the grandiose bands and orchestras, it can be a fact that music is an irreplaceable part of our life. Anything that 
contains rhythm, melody, and harmony is music no matter the instrument or culture, these elements are present in all 
styles of music in every period around the world (Epperson  2022).  What does music have to do with computer science 
then? In recent times, the creation of music has been greatly enhanced with technology. The development of artificial 
intelligence is of much help to that, using algorithms to help create different sounds and tunes to music. Computers 
have also improved immensely, giving computers the ability to acquire intelligence (Zhang and Yu  2021). 
Music and artificial intelligence are not new. Multiple RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) have already been made 
to make trained models of music though mainly limited to classical music. Because of this information, the researchers 
asked the question, “How about pop music?” Pop music is also known for its simple and catchy hooks and 
repetitiveness which makes it easier to understand than other genres of music such as classical music (Hoffman 
Academy Team  2021). 
A problem that the researchers have seen is the absence of a pop music database. This may be propagated by the fact 
that the pop music scene is a fickle space that changes very fast and has many developments in only mere months. 
This is in contrast to classical music which is very static and rigid due to most music being made in the past. With 
this, the researchers decided to select Billboard’s top 100 pop songs of 2021. The researchers propose to create a 
Recursive Neural Network trained with a pop music dataset with the top songs of 2021. This can help in making a pop 
music dataset for future researchers and making an RNN that is trained with pop music.

model. Evaluation metrics such as mean squared error and perplexity were used to evaluate the model. A listening test 
was also conducted to evaluate the qualities of each music sample. 
5. Conclusion
The study successfully accomplished its objectives starting with the creation of a dataset consisting of songs from the 
Billboard’s Hot 100 Year-End Charts. An LSTM-based RNN Model was also designed and developed with the proper 
specifications. It was trained using the dataset created with various optimizers and epoch values. The multiple models 
were evaluated using the mean squared error loss function wherein the model with the lowest loss value was chosen 
for the final model. With its low loss value and perplexity score, the model was ready to create music samples. The 
music samples were then subjected to a listening test where the results showed that in terms of tonality, rhythm, form, 
and melody, they had a rating from 3.7 - 4.3 in the 5-point scale, which are interpreted as having a good rating. Lastly, 
a web application was also developed to make accessing the model much more convenient. These were all 
accomplished using the programming language Python, with the help of external libraries such as tensorflow, 
prettymidi, etc. With the accomplishments written above, all the objectives have been met. This study has filled in the 
gap, being the lack of pop music research in deep learning.

Abstract 
Innovation ecosystems are classified as one of the complex economic systems where many parties with different 
interests are involved. The holistic objective of such alignment of entities is to cooperate in the creation of innovative 
outputs. The innovation ecosystem provides the environment for large corporates, entrepreneurs, investors, and 
governmental institutions to accumulate their sole offering into value capturing via networking and exchanging 
knowledge and expertise. Thus, such kind of ecosystem exhibits multiple partnerships and interactions among actors 
to fulfill their own needs and contribute to the value co-creation process. This paper explores the nature of innovation 
ecosystem as a set of networks comprising a large spectrum of agents interacting with each other. Most of the previous 
work on ecosystems has pursued qualitative studies emphasizing on how to orchestrate an innovation ecosystem 
entirely. However, we addressed such a phenomenon by means of an agent-based modeling considering both the micro 
level of the system which consists of the individual agents and the macro level which is represented by the aggregating 
of individuals’ behaviors. The model can be used as a decision-making tool to examine the validity of an orchestrating 
strategy by detecting its dual impact on individual agents and on the overall performance of the ecosystem.

1. Introduction
For ages, economies around the world have been seeking to secure its economic stability through encouraging different 
national sectors to contribute into the rise of national economy. On this account, the initiation of innovation ecosystem 
was explained as the new direction that would lead nations to enrich their economic foundations with novel trends of 
economic activities other than relying solely on few industrial sectors. The diversity of contributions that is imposed 
by such collaborative settings ensures a yield that would outweigh offerings created individually by the actors. The 
innovation ecosystem is a grouping of entities that aims to create and capture value through joint innovation practices 
(Ritala et al. 2013). It consists of diverse entities that consider both external and internal innovation practices to 
enhance their profitability (Fosfuri and Rønde 2004).  Such economic setting ensures high level of productivity and 
business diversity through merging different outputs from different participated organizations (Garibay et al. 2015). 
However, this kind of ecosystems is characterized by dynamic flows, non-linearity, and unpredicted pattern of 
interdependencies which are emerged from the engagement in open innovation activities. Added to that, members of 
an innovation ecosystem usually demonstrate an accelerated learning curve which is strongly emphasized by the 
interconnections among them (Ferasso et al. 2018).  Similarly, innovation ecosystem is described as a network where 
flow of knowledge takes a place (Tejero and Leon 2016).  This economic structure tends to expand its boundaries to 
enclose entities with diverse backgrounds and schemes to integrate their vital role in capturing and creating value

the dynamic environment is made up of innovation agents, each of whom gives resources and expertise that are at any 
given moment pertinent to the value proposition. Each agent interacts with other agents to trade any necessary 
information or resources in response to demand. As a result, various alliances develop amongst agents. Additionally, 
each agent has a unique set of characteristics that characterize it and set it apart from other agents. Market share, the 
degree of interaction with other agents, type of resources, etc. are examples of these factors. A minimum market share 
value must be introduced to symbolize the beginning of a potential interaction, for example, the value of an agent's 
market share may decide whether or not an interaction might occur. However, it is not mandatory to rely solely on 
market share values; other financial measures, such as revenues, may also be taken into account.  
 
Because not every actor would be biased toward just one financial metric, we often adopt a weighted score of financial 
metrics when developing our model in order to account for all the selection criteria that could have been used in a real, 
dynamic market context. The model is focused on providing KPIs of the innovation ecosystem with which a policy 
makers may analyze their recommended policies and strategic settings by analyzing the impact of the alteration. These 
KPIs are produced from the aggregation of the factors that characterize the system's agents. For instance, the 
innovation ecosystem growth rate, the number of new startups, etc. It should be mentioned that because some of those 
KPIs cannot be directly correlated to the performance of the orchestrators, the policy designers must carefully choose 
them. The attempt of simulation a hypothetical innovation ecosystem using Netlogo software is shown in figure.2. 
The three primary components of the simulation model are displayed in the Netlogo software's interface window. 
These are the input parameters, the interaction environment (IE), which includes agents interacting in the IE, and the 
output monitors. 
 
 Plots and monitors show how each and every simulation model's unique set of contributing elements affects the 
results. For instance, the sliding buttons on the left-hand side of the window are designated to show the various input 
parameter values. A variety of input values are available for the user to choose from, allowing for the creation of 
different scenarios and the analysis of possible outcomes and their effects. For instance, the user will initially press 
the setup button, alter the input values collectively or individually in accordance with his or her viewpoints, and press 
the go button to see how the agents behave and determine the appropriate consequence through the indicated plots and 
monitors. In the addressed scenario, the number of orchestrators is kept high and the number of incubators and 
accelerators in the simulation model are reduced.  
 
Therefore, both average innovation score (46.9) and maturity score (41.9) are lower than their corresponding stable 
values of (50). Less interactions are detected between the agents and incubators and accelerators, which represent only 
0.2% of the total interactions occurred within the IE. However, the availability of orchestrators compensates the 
shortages of incubators and accelerators as in a decentralized approach where most agents tend to maintain connections 
with the focal entities. Due to the lack of incubators and accelerators, no relevant clustering activities were detected, 
where in this case agents are not matured enough in terms of the level of innovation and networking capabilities. 
Consequently, the establishment of new matured startups is relatively low; as almost no startup was established due 
to the scarcity of mentoring and financial support which are mainly provided by incubators and accelerators. On the 
other side, the level of governmental interactions is at an acceptable level, which indicted their tendency of forming 
links as with orchestrators and other matured and well-established entities such as large enterprises. The overall global 
clustering coefficient indicator shows a low value of 0.008. This implies the effect of not having sufficient incubators 
and accelerators.   
 
7. Conclusion  
This paper aimed to explain the phenomenon of establishing innovation ecosystem and proposed a new approach to 
tackle the complexity associated with orchestrating such systems. The nature of innovation ecosystem was addressed 
by developing An Agent-based modeling simulation. The calibrated simulation model can serve as a what-if analysis 
tool that policymakers may use to evaluate and confirm their strategic recommendations without having to carry out 
a real experiment. Therefore, our future work will mainly concentrate on adopting real data in the model for the 
purposes of calibrating the model and ensuring its functionality.

ABSTRACT 
The built environment has been slow in adapting innovative technologies and methods, and there has never been a 
more inspiring time to innovate than now. We live in a new automation era in which computers, robotic technologies 
and artificial intelligence will increasingly perform routine manual work and rightfully take traditional jobs from 
humans. This technological impact and socio-economic disruption in the industry will transform the employment 
scenery and skills requirements. This review notes the greater challenges faced by the construction industry in 
fostering innovation. These include both industry-specific challenges and the need to fulfill sustainable development 
goals. In addition to these challenges, the need for construction role players to understand the critical skills required 
for industry 4.0 is also discussed. The study is conducted by critically reviewing the literature of selected papers from 
well-known academic journals in construction and 4IR research. Above innovative leadership, different innovative 
skills are vital to developing and understanding emerging innovative technologies. Skills identified include; Creativity, 
design mindset, entrepreneurship, critical thinking, social intelligence, digital literacy, leadership and computational 
thinking. Moreover, industry role players with these skills can help fast-track the need for technological innovation in 
the construction industry. The study presents a robust background in identifying essential skills research agenda in the 
built environment that fosters innovation and its adaptation.

Introduction  
The banking sector has effectively taken advantage of the 4th industrial revolution (4IR) by finding technological ways 
to deal with their ordinary business; along these lines, adding to their profitability, precision, productivity and 
enhanced consumer loyalty (Teuteberg 2016). Nonetheless, the construction industry (CI), which contributes a huge 
portion to the nation's GDP, is as yet lagging behind in its technological developments. Shrestha (2011) presented that 
the slow technological adaptation in the CI, combined with resistance for change by the construction experts, has made 
the full digital process difficult. The 4IR, or Industry 4.0, is presently under way. Likewise, it is highly unlikely that 
the South African construction industry (SACI) can stay away from it or escape it. Industry 4.0 embraces artificial 
intelligence (AI), Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics and wearable technologies.  
We stand at the brink of an extraordinary technological transformation that will essentially alter the way people live, 
work and communicate with one another. Unlike its three antecedents (First Industrial Revolution: steam power and 
systematization; Second: electricity and mass fabrication; Third: computers and automation), the 4IR stems from a 
rapid fusion of technologies, as discussed above (e.g. IoT, advanced robotics, 3D printing), new materials (e.g. bio- 
or nano-based) and innovative processes (e.g. AI), which are affecting every industry and entire production systems 
(Federal government of Germany 2017). This will certainly have a considerable impact on cities, the construction and 
employment of technical skills.  
It was a noteworthy subject at the previous Sixth Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) Conference in 
South Africa. Much more to these forums it is important to note that, South Africa is underprepared for Industry 4.0

5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
The construction industry is one of the most active and receptive industrial sector of any economy. Despite these 
significance, construction activities are still plagued with traditional approaches and less technological advancement. 
This is in light of the 4th industrial revolution which is upon us. All Industrial Revolutions have had a profound impact 
on global society, and Industry 4.0 is no exception. Workplaces are experiencing dramatic transformations unlike 
anything before, and industries are challenged with recognizing and adapting to these changes. 4IR is particularly 
unique in the way it challenges current notions of skills development. Review on the current state of knowledge 
connected to the Industry 4.0 was done and much focus was placed on skills relevant for this revolution, this included 
digital skills to name a few. The industry including all the stakeholders must regard the call and prepare for 4.0 
industry, for the development and advancement of the construction industry. The study concludes that there are 
different relevant skills that will be required from the workforce, however skilling and reskilling the current workforce 
will play a critical role in understanding the 4.0 industry. The study recommends that stakeholders in the construction 
industry should take advantage of this 4.0 industry notion, and create awareness amongst the workforce and 
professionals, with the purpose of upskilling. It is important for role-players and aspiring leaders to stay abreast of the 
changing landscape and maintain a progressive approach to guide the industry into the future.

Abstract 
Integrating Africa's small farmers to the agricultural supply chains is necessary for their economic growth and 
development. Nonetheless, the lack of access to finance prevents many African farmers from taking part in the supply 
chain. the agriculture sector has a persistent problem with getting financial from finance institutions. Smallholder 
farmers have been mostly excluded from the access to financing services. Blockchain has been applied to resolve a 
variety of issues in numerous sectors. In the agricultural industry, Blockchain is utilized to increase the supply chain's 
transparency, security, and traceability. the deployment of Blockchain technology, known as distributed and 
immutable ledger could be utilized to strengthen agriculture finance. 
Regarding this, we suggest a systematic literature review to gather all pertinent research on the applications of 
Blockchain technology for financial inclusion of African small farmers in order to identify current research themes. 
This research makes a concrete contribution by discussing how blockchain technology might help address the 
problem of financial exclusion of African small farmers, laying the groundwork for a potential solution that could 
link these farmers to the global agricultural supply chain.

Abstract 
This paper presents electricity forecasting by integration of Nested Long Short Term Memory (NLSTM) as the another 
type of LSTM, Attention Mechanism (AM) as the technique for Neural Network and optimized by Cuckoo Search 
Optimizer (CSO) as the metaheuristic. It is important because of the electricity forecasting issue. Electricity is the 
crucial energy, due to the many sectors which is require it. Estimation of electricity consumption can enhance the 
effectiveness of generation and supply. The shortage and outage of electricity is the thing that should be avoided 
through the electricity forecasting. In order to create better forecasting result, the forecasting by NLSTM-AM will be 
combined. NLSTM-AM has several parameters which influence the network performance. Those parameters will be 
optimized by CSO. To discover the performance of this proposed method, the RMSE of this method will be compared 
by other algorithms. In this paper there are two datasets which will be used, those are Taiwan electricity consumption 
and Turkey electricity consumption. It is proved that NLSTM-AM-CSO has the smallest RMSE rather than other 
algorithms.

1. Introduction
Electricity is the crucial energy, due to the many sectors which is require it. The shortage and outage of electricity is 
the thing that should be avoided. In order to prevent that, the generation and supply of electricity should be effective. 
Estimation of electricity consumption can enhance the effectiveness of generation and supply. The more advance 
prediction, the more important it is in planning, analysis and operation of power system to ensure an uninterrupted, 
reliable, secure and economic supply of electricity (Bianco et al. 2010). Also, electricity forecasting assist to make 
decision related to the purchasing, load switching and infrastructure development (Singh et al. 2013). For specific 
period such as short-term, short-term electricity demand forecasting has big importance for daily control, scheduling, 
operation, planning, and stability of the power system (Chapagain 2020). Narayan and Hipel (2017) conducted 
forecasting for short-term load electricity which represented as time series by Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) 
approach. LSTM network, an extension of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In LSTM approach, there is LSTM cell 
as the solution of RNN problem related to the gradient vanishing problem. Much research about LSTM have been 
developed, and it leads to the several types of LSTM (Liu et al. 2017). One of them is Nested LSTM (NLSTM). 
NLSTM is an extension of the original LSTM structure (Yan et al. 2022). Not only the several types of LSTM as a 
proof of the improvement of LSTM research development, but also the integration of LSTM with other mechanism 
such as Attention Mechanism (AM). Ran et al. (2019) conduct research with combine LSTM with AM, to forecast 
traffic prediction. There are several parameters in NLSTM, which should be determined before running the model. 
Those parameters should be optimized to create the better model. Gandomi et al.  (2013) stated that metaheuristic 
algorithm is influential tools for modeling and optimization. These algorithms imitate effective processes in nature 
such as chemical and physical processes, and biological system. One of algorithms is Cuckoo Search Optimizer 
(CSO). The obligate brood parasitism of some cuckoo species, which involves them incubating their eggs in host bird 
nests, served as the model for the CSO algorithm. Wang et al. (2017) conducted research related to the comparison of

Digital Supply Chain Curriculum Development to Support 
the Talent Needs of Supply Chain 4.0 
W.D. Lin
Singapore Institute of Technology, Singapore 
 (David.Lin@SingaporeTech.edu.sg) 
Abstract 
This paper describes the curriculum development methodology for a new programme in Singapore to 
support the digital transformation toward Supply Chain 4.0. The methodology covered analyzing the 
industry workforce requirements, creating the contents, designing the teaching, learning, and assessment 
approaches, industry work study attachment, and curriculum review and improvements. The new 
programme aims to bridge the educational gap between industry requirements and the academic curriculum 
with a proposed curriculum development methodology for a new digital supply chain programme. This 
paper highlighted the need to examine the methodology of developing a digital supply chain programme, 
and addressed the need for an institute of higher learning to support the talent needs of Supply Chain 4.0.

1. Introduction
Increased attention and demand for supply chain resilience and agility are at an all-time high, primarily due to the 
COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. The disruptions and complexity of supply chains create significant 
challenges for companies. Studies on the digital transformation of supply chains are on the rise, and Digital Supply 
Chain (DSC) is receiving recognition as a holistic digital transformation approach for optimally planning and 
controlling an entire supply chain.  
The supply chain and logistics (SCL) sector is a major contributor to Singapore's economy, generating GDP and 
employment. Singapore must keep the SCL sector competitive through a competent workforce to allow the industry 
to continue to be a key sector to sustain the long-term economic growth of Singapore. 
In June 2020, a study of the impact of Industry 4.0 on Singapore's logistics workforce was conducted jointly by the 
Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB), Enterprise Singapore (ESG), Skills Future Singapore (SSG), and 
Workforce Singapore (WSG)  (EDB, ESG, SSG, WSG, 2020). Starting with the Skills Framework for Logistics (SSG, 
2020) and an analysis of the workforce capability-building ecosystem, the study revealed that Industry 4.0 technology 
adoption would transform existing jobs and spur the emergence of new roles.  
IMDA and ESG (2020) refreshed the Logistics Industry Digital Plan (IDP), and the new IDP provided a precise digital 
roadmap for businesses in the logistics sector of Singapore. It highlighted that developing and growing a talent pipeline 
is critical to success. As most businesses develop digitally, SMEs may use a new Digital Training Roadmap to find 
relevant training programs to upskill their employees.  
Given the surge of talent needed to support the digital transformation of the SCL sector, there is a need to start a 
Digital Supply Chain degree programme in Singapore that could contribute to the rapid digital transformation of the 
supply chain and logistics sector.  
For Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL), a curriculum guides the creation of the programme, learning and teaching 
resources, lesson plans and student evaluation, and stakeholder engagement (Adagale 2015). A well-designed

4. Conclusion 
This paper addressed the potential gaps of the methodology of curriculum design and development in preparing 
students to meet industry employers' requirements related to the digital supply chain domain. The methodology was 
used for developing a new digital supply chain programme, which mainly focuses on the industry workforce 
requirements, curriculum contents, pedagogy, teaching philosophy, curriculum review and improvements. The digital 
supply chain degree programme is the first such programme in Singapore, with the mission to prepare a pipeline of 
talents to support the digital transformation of the supply chain and logistics industry.  
 
The digital supply chain degree programme is highly industry-oriented and practical skills-focused, linking academic 
study closely with real-world supply chain and logistics practices. The importance of industry engagement and the 
approaches to engaging industry partners were discussed. We engaged the industry from the onset of the programme 
preparation and throughout the curriculum development, course delivery, PEO assessment, and continuous 
improvement. The practice-based and project-based applied learning approach is embraced to train graduates to be 
industry-ready and armed with the relevant skillsets and knowledge valuable to their career path.  
 
Future works are planned to verify the curriculum design and development through curriculum review and 
improvement. The surveys for graduates' employers and alumni will be conducted, and the results collected will be 
further analyzed and summarized for future programme improvement.

Abstract 
Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP), which closely represent contemporary manufacturing systems, is 
regarded as one of the most challenging and crucial scheduling problems. A job-shop scheduling problem that attempts 
to mimic real-life manufacturing is incomplete without consideration of machine related issues such as setting up and 
maintenance; and job related issues such as transportation of jobs between machines. Consideration of these factors 
for FJSP has gained attention in recent times. Majority of the papers, however, deals with only a few of these issues. 
The proposed work considers the FJSP with maintenance, setup and transportation time, termed as the complex FJSP. 
This work proposes a multi-agent based approach for solving the complex FJSP.   
Keywords  
FJSP, transportation time, maintenance, setup, Multi-agent system, simulated annealing 
Introduction 
The complexity of manufacturing systems is increasing to handle varying customer needs and changing market trends. 
The scheduling in such complex manufacturing systems is considered to be one of the difficult combinatorial 
problems. Flexible Job-shop System (FJS), contrary to traditional job shop scheduling, assumes that a machine can 
perform a variety of operations on the jobs. The scheduling problems related with FJS are called as Flexible Job-shop 
Scheduling Problems (FJSPs). This problem has attracted a considerable attention from industries and academia due 
to its closeness to the advanced manufacturing systems. The solution to FJSP needs solving two sub-problems: 
machine selection and operations sequencing. FJSP was first introduced by Brucker and Schlie (1990). Thereafter, 
various solution methods have been proposed to solve FJSPs which mainly fall into exact and approximate methods. 
Exact methods provide optimal solutions but proved to be less efficient due to high computation time. Instead, 
approximate methods which provide good solutions (not optimal) are mostly methods to solve the FSJPs.  
Approximate solution methods generally consist of heuristics and meta-heuristics algorithms. These can be 
categorized into centralized and decentralized approaches based on the decision-making environment. The solution 
approach where only single decision-entity takes all decisions is defined as centralized decision-making approach 
(Ennigrou and Ghédira 2008; Xiong and Fu 2018). While in decentralized approach, multiple decision entities 
generally solve the scheduling problem. Multi-agent system is widely used decentralized approach for scheduling 
problems where multiple decision-entities, termed as agents, solve the problem using either cooperative or negotiation 
based competitive approach.  
Since its introduction, attempts have been made to generalize FJSP to consider the real-life scheduling issues. One of 
the important issues is the maintenance of machines or resources. Maintenance or machine availability issue is quite 
common in scheduling problems as preventive maintenance is to be scheduled to avoid sudden failure of the machines. 
Another important consideration is setup time which is needed by machines before processing the jobs. The setup time 
has been acknowledged where machines need some pre-processing time to make it ready for the processing of the 
jobs’ operations. In addition, the movement of jobs between machines for processing also require time which is called 
as transportation time. To the best of our knowledge, none of the available research has considered these three issues

6. Conclusion 
Flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) has considered important and difficult scheduling problems. Its closeness 
to the modern manufacturing systems is the reason for its wide attention from the academia and industries. Nowadays, 
consideration of real life issues of the scheduling problems have been started to develop the solution approach which 
can target and solve the actual and complex scheduling problems. For real scheduling problems, factors such as 
maintenance, setup and transportation times are generally assumed. But, existing research papers have majorly 
counted these factors individually for the FJSP. The proposed work has considered these issues: maintenance planning, 
setup and transportation times simultaneously and termed it as complex FJSP. For the solution, a multi agent based 
approach is proposed.  An example of 4x5 problem instance is solved and illustrated in detailed. For the experimental 
comparison, three problems 4x5, 8x8 and 10x10 are solve solved and compared. The proposed approach is the first 
approach to be developed for the FJSP with three factors so it has been compared with FJSP with individual factors. 
The comparison has proved the effectiveness of the solution approach. The Gantt chart with optimal solution for 4x5 
problem is demonstrated.  In future, the proposed approach is going to be further improved with hybrid algorithms 
and by solving more number of problems.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to forecast product demands and develop appropriate and adequate procurement plans to 
meet customer needs and reduce costs. When the product exceeds customer demands that the company supports 
insufficient storage spaces. Moreover, some items are stored for a long period, causing the deterioration of dead stock. 
Which that uncertain customer demands, are considered. The actual purchasing orders of customers aren’t equal to 
the forecast provided by the customers. In some cases, customers have higher product demands, resulting in the 
product being insufficient to meet the customer's needs. However, some customers have lower demands for products 
than estimates, causing insufficient storage spaces and dead stock. This study aims to reduce the loss of sales 
opportunities and the number of remaining goods in the warehouse, citing 5 product samples of the company's most 
popular products. The data were collected during the duration of the study from January to December 2022. The 
methods used to forecast are simple moving averages, weighted moving averages, and exponential smoothing 
methods. The economic ordering quantity and reorder point are used to calculate to meet customer needs and track 
results. The research results are very beneficial to the company. The company can reduce the loss of sales opportunities 
by 10%, so that the company has enough products to meet customer needs, and can reduce unused products up to 10% 
dead stock. This enables the company to order products more accurately, increasing profits and storage space.

1. Introduction
Enterprise competition is fierce and changing, and consumer demand is increasing or decreasing. This makes it 
difficult to predict the number of products on the market. Therefore, many organizations want to develop their business 
potential to effectively promote and move forward. By looking for principles or methods to reduce costs, but still 
regard profits and consumer satisfaction as priorities. Forecasting technology is a method that applies scientific and 
statistical principles to short-term planning and decision-making. And long-term. 
Since 1972, Thailand's electronic industry has been developing continuously. The government has formulated a policy 
to promote investment by providing tax and non-tax benefits through the Investment Committee. The Board of 
Investment (BOI) aims to attract foreign investors. In 1972-1992, the government promoted investment in export 
production. Foreign investors have gradually invested in electronic production bases such as integrated circuits (IC) 
and printed circuit board: (PCB) hard disk drive (HDD) floppy disk motor wire and cable with the relatively low labor 
cost of Thailand at that time and the Plaza Agreement of 1987, the yen strengthened. Therefore, Japanese companies 
will move their production bases abroad. Thailand is one of the important production bases because it is a market with 
high growth potential. ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) In 2004, multinational companies from Japan, Taiwan and 
the United States established more production bases in Thailand. 
The electronics industry is undergoing rapid technological change. Only foreign companies that invest in Thailand 
and joint ventures with foreign countries are the entrepreneurs with competitiveness in the global market. Most Thai 
entrepreneurs carry out business in the form of contracts and often operate subcontractors from major foreign

6. Conclusion  
The forecast analysis of an electronic equipment and parts wholesale company concluded that: Collect 12 months' 
sales data from January 2022 to December 2022 and analyze the demand forecast. Three prediction methods of moving 
average and weighted moving average Average), exponential smoothing method. By comparing the demand forecast 
results, find the given forecast value MAD: The best prediction method of moving average is 14,096. 
 
MSE: The best prediction method of moving average is 38,0182,636. MAPE: Use best weighted moving average 
(WMA) and exponential smoothing methods Equal to 28%.It has the minimum tolerance, which is the closest value, 
and finds a new order point in the variable inventory demand rate and fixed time cycle Shortages may occur due to 
uneven utilization or inventory demand. Therefore, inventory must be retained to prevent shortages in order to find 
new order points. Through visual shift and experience prediction, there aren't enough raw materials to meet customer 
needs. As a result, the store lost sales opportunities. The study found that the prediction theory was used to predict the 
demand for appropriate products to meet the demand. Case study of customers who come to order products and reduce 
the loss of sales opportunities According to the product comparison results, the company reduced the loss of sales 
opportunities by predicting the demand for the top five screw products. The reduction of opportunity loss leads to an 
increase in the company's revenue. The prediction theory is used in this study as a guide for development, 
improvement, implementation, and planning management.

Abstract 
SMEs have an important role in the national economy. Ninety-nine percent of Indonesia's business units are SMEs 
which involved 97% of Indonesia's workforce. One of the important aspects of work safety is safety behavior. Good 
safety behavior has an impact on reducing the number of work accidents and injuries. The contribution of these 
programs/activities is educating workers by providing information through intervention (counseling) dealing with 
hazards and work implementation. Evaluation of intervention assessed 10 workers as participants. Implementation 
was done in two SMEs, Batik Naraya and Batik Zulpah located in Tanjung Bumi-Madura. The intervention was given 
for 2 days with a focus on efforts to increase the level of workers' knowledge of physical, chemical, and ergonomic 
hazards and their hazard management. Intervention activities by short explanations or discussions directly with 
workers at their workstations (safety briefing). The intervention activity ended by displaying the posters of hazard 
types and efforts dealing with safety engagement at each workstation. The results showed that there was improved 
knowledge of workers before and after the intervention regarding the physical hazards, the procedure of physical 
hazards, the chemical hazards, the procedure of chemical hazards, ergonomic hazards, and the procedure of ergonomic 
hazards.

6. Conclusion 
The implementation of intervention by counseling based on hazard prevention guidelines on the cognitive reactions 
of batik workers is effective. In detail, there is increasing knowledge regarding physical hazards, chemical hazards, 
ergonomic hazards, and efforts dealing with them. These results indicate that the guide can be used as a reference in 
counseling hazard prevention at Batik SME.

Abstract 
During the COVID-19 crisis, the digital economy expanded. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, people have become more 
reliant on online buying. Many businesses shifted their approach to online platforms, thus engaging more customers. 
The live-stream shopping campaign in the Philippines is continuously growing due to more social media interaction 
with consumers. Small independent merchants have shifted to Facebook Live Selling, which shows real-time video, 
as a direct selling technique. This study examined the factors influencing impulse buying behavior amongst consumers 
in Facebook Live Selling. Three hundred eighty-four (386) respondents, ages 18 to 55 participated in the online survey 
that consisted of their demographics and questions based on the internal and external factors affecting the 
impulsiveness of a consumer towards buying in Facebook live-selling. The study used Binary Logistic Regression to 
predict whether an individual will purchase an item on impulse in Facebook live-selling. The dependent variable was 
categorized by the individual’s intention towards the product, it was denoted as (0 = will not buy; 1 = will buy). The 
model revealed that among the factors, only sex (ρ = 0.049), frequency of purchase (ρ = 0.00), impulse buying 
tendency (ρ = 0.00), and trust propensity (ρ = 0.035) are significant predictor variables in the model, which were only 
internal factors. Overall, the model helps broaden our understanding of how the latest marketing strategy (live selling) 
affects the impulse buying behavior of consumers. Limitations and implications are further discussed in the study.

1. Introduction
Social commerce (s-commerce) is a new type of e-commerce. It continues to engage more customers since social 
media accelerates consumer-to-consumer information to develop social interactions on e-commerce platforms (Shirazi 
et al. 2022). The widespread proliferation of live streaming has boosted its fusion with marketing campaigns and 
driven a boom in e-commerce economies (Lu et al. 2021). It has recently been implemented into social media 
platforms and social business applications. Sellers can use real video to promote their products and engage with 
potential buyers through the live-streaming shopping feature, where customers can give their opinion and give 
feedback in real-time. Live streaming is particularly effective at introducing and selling products like clothes and 
cosmetics. 
According to Statista (2021), there were nearly 76 million Facebook users in the Philippines, making it the most 
popular live-streaming platform. Fenol (2021) pointed out that the Philippines' big business firms have even turned to

6. Conclusion
While the market for Live-selling grows, companies have been using live-streaming as a new economic strategy that 
integrates specialized activities with videos for its unique content presentation and high-level involvement (Zhang et 
al. 2022). Live streaming has been able to garner billions in revenue, leading it to be welcomed into the global spotlight 
as a source of profitability. Live streaming enables anyone to have access to information, interact with hosts live, and 
show their content from a remote location.  
In this study, various factors were considered relating to the impulse buying behavior of consumers in an online live 
selling set up. By using descriptive statistics, the proponents found out that only four factors significantly affect the 
impulse buying behavior of the consumers. This result is consistent with prior studies on how sex, purchase frequency, 
impulse buying tendency, and trust propensity correlates to online impulse buying. The Binary Logistic Regression 
Model was used to predict whether the consumers will purchase on impulse or not based on the significant factors 
found in the study. The model may be very beneficial to consumers who want to limit their unnecessary online 
purchases.  
The study enriches our understanding of the rising development of selling in a social commerce context. However, 
the study revealed that there is no significant relationship between the live streaming features and the impulsive buying 
behavior of consumers. Further study is needed to effectively grasp and utilize the live streaming features in the 
Philippines since it is a relatively new instrument that is still under development. This study can further explore the 
different factors that could be involved in the use of other live-streaming platforms aside from Facebook.

Abstract 
Problems with street vendors are location and the need for empowerment and more skills, even though street vendors 
contribute to economic growth. Street vendors need competency and innovation ability to develop. This study 
investigates the influence of competence on the innovation ability of street vendors for the research on the group of 
food vendors with a sample of 63 people. Data collection was in the form of questionnaires and interviews. Research 
results contribute theoretically and practically. The theoretical contribution explains that competence has a positive 
effect on innovation. Finding 7 (seven) competencies can increase innovation. The first is the ability to analyze and 
search for information that leads to consumer needs. The second competency is communication skills, leading to good 
service. Third, self-confidence leads to the ability to interact with the business environment. The fourth, initiative, 
leads to ideas. The fifth social mobility leads to easy access to information to broaden understanding. Sixth negotiating 
ability and seventh ability result in the orientation of business owners related to setting business targets and goals. 
This practical contribution is the basis for the government to create an empowerment program to increase the 
competency of street vendors to generate innovation.

1. Introduction
Street vendors are a group of informal business actors whose only goal is to make a living. The government 
must pay attention to street vendors at this time because they can contribute to economic growth. Such as absorbing 
employment (Fajri et al., 2018; Wibowo et al., 2021). However, street vendors often need help with problems that 
hinder performance, including having difficulty obtaining permits and getting access to places of business (Widjajanti, 
2016). It is not easy to get a strategic location, only being able to sell passengers through a window or on the side of 
the road (Forkuor et al., 2017; Satarudin et al., 2020). They have been unable to expand the market to increase sales 
and only expect sales from business hours (Khan, 2012; Wibowo et al., 2021). Problem on street vendors also has the 
same internal problems as the Small and Medium Enterprises Group. The problem of intense competition (Prasanna 
et al., 2019). Lack of access to capital (Agyemang and Ansong, 2017).  Low education (Moagi et al., 2021; Octaviani 
and Puspitasari, 2022). Difficult to develop because of a lack of knowledge about business management (Okvian & 
Nawangsari, 2019). Street vendors are not oriented towards consumer tastes. 
To overcome all problems, street vendors need the competence to increase sales (Tehseen et al., 2015).  Internal 
problems become a big problem if the government is not responsive to increasing street vendors' competency through 
various training pieces.  To survive, street vendors need to have the skills to know market developments, product 
knowledge, communication skills with customers, and other management skills.  At this time, Street vendors need 
more skills. 
Some street vendors have succeeded in improving their performance because they have the competence to 
innovate by making a difference with other street vendors, such as differences in service, process and product quality 
(Gazali, 2020). Previous studies were rare and limited in discussing the effect of street vendor competence on 
innovation (Ng and Kee, 2018; Pranciulyte-Bagdžiuniene and  Petraite, 2019; Sungkawati, 2019; Tosida et al., 2020). 
Innovating requires competence (Ibidunni et al., 2021; Pranowo et al., 2020). Indeed, competence is a way of surviving 
business actors (Tehseen et al., 2015) and producing innovations to make changes, thinking openly about something

Abstract 
Low back pain is a condition of pain in the lumbar spine due to injury or strained muscles. Through previous 
assessments of complaints obtained from patients at the physiotherapy clinic. Complaints appeared in the form of pain 
when using a back therapy device. These complaints are the background for making design and feature improvements 
to reduce pain during therapy. The aim of this research is to find alternative designs for back therapy devices for low 
back pain sufferers. Product design according to Nigel Cross is divided into seven steps, namely clarifying objectives, 
determining functions, compiling needs, determining characteristics, generating alternatives, evaluating alternatives, 
and detailing improvements, and using anthropometry to determine the dimensions of body parts needed for product 
design. The Nigel Cross method applied to Heated Back Therapy Device products produces black and white product 
color design specifications, product weight 1 kg, product shape is rectangular, product material is ABS plastic, product 
dimensions are 72.03 x 51.16 cm, product maximum load is 150 kg, the degree of curvature of the product is 3 levels, 
has heating feature as an additional function, heating temperature is 40℃, and heating time is 30 minutes. Ergonomic 
design for Heated Back Therapy Device products provides benefits to users, including improving the structure of the 
spine so that it is not bent and conforms to the structure it should be, overcoming low back pain in the spine, and 
improving blood circulation so as to produce an ergonomic product for the user.

Abstract 
The study examines the unloading and repacking process of Read With Me Group Company Limited. The research 
aims to improve the old work process and build a new efficient process with the Lean Technique and new machines 
for faster delivery without increasing the number of employees. Currently, two employees work based on five days 
on and off. However, workplace injuries have delayed the delivery time. When Value Stream Mapping was used to 
examine the data gathered, Non-Value Added was discovered, and a LEAN Manufacturing waste was identified in 
the working process. 37.20% of the total production time is Non-Value Added processing time found in the repacking 
process. The results of the new working process, improved plant layout, and cycle time before and after the 
adjustments are documented in the Flow Process Chart. By comparing the cycle time before and after modifications 
to the machinery and plant layout, the working day has been calculated in order to determine the Percentage of 
Efficiency. The improvements demonstrate a 25% increase in working space, a 42.82% decrease in process lead time, 
a 175.82% gain in work efficiency, and a zero percent injury rate at work.

1. Introduction
READ WITH ME GROUP COMPANY LIMITED is a small enterprise that imports children’s books from the United 
Kingdom and the United States and exports books to Southeast Asian countries such as Myanmar, Cambodia, and 
Laos. 
The books are imported in cargo ships in 40ft and 45ft containers. Each container contains 44 large carton boxes 
weighing about 17-18 tons. The estimated number of books in each container is 60,000. The frequency of the import 
is 8-10 containers per year. 
This paper focuses on the packing process, starting from unloading the large carton box and repacking it into a small 
box size 40x60x25 cm. weighing about 30-35 kilograms per box. 12 small boxes are equal to 1 large carton box. 
This process used to be run by one staff. The carton box will be unloaded and repacked within one day. However, the 
speed of the operation will continuously reduce. After three days, only half of a carton box is unloaded and repacked, 
and after day five, the process has to be stopped due to work injury in the neck, the back, the wrist, the legs, and the 
arms of the staff. The staff must stop working for at least three days before beginning the process again. Therefore, 
the repacking process will be completed in about 8-9 weeks per container. 
Currently, the company has increased the number of staff from one to two and the working hour is five-day work and 
five-day off. 
The tools used in the repacking process are (1) a Semi-Automatic Strapping Machine, (2) a Hand-held Stretch 
Wrapping machine, (3) an Industrial weight scale, (4) Free rollers conveyor, (5) Electric Forklift, (6) Hand-lift

The cycle time in the station with the electric hoist is increased due to the slower speed of the electric hoist 
compared to manual lifting. 
The repacking process can be completed in 25 days per container, a reduction of 63.77%. 
 
Efficiency (Phase 2)  =  Output/Input

Efficiency (Before Improvement) = 44/69 = 0.637 
Efficiency (After Improvement) = 44/25 = 1.76 
% Efficiency Increase = (1.76-0.637) x (100/0.637) = 175.82% 
 
The Phase 2 improvement reduced the processing time, as shown in Figure 8.

In addition, work-related accidents are noticeably reduced, allowing employees to work without interruption while 
on the job.  
5. Conclusion 
The delay in the repacking process is the lack of proper plant layout and unclear work process. As a result, 
transportation waste is at a high level. 
The indirect factor is work accidents related to manual lifting, which lead to poor work efficiency. 
After the process improvement, the work efficiency increased by 175.82%, and the work injuries rate was reduced 
to zero. 
The new work standard applies to the work process. Each member of staff must wear safety devices. Goods moving 
should only be done by an energy-saving machine. Manual lifting is prohibited. 
The budget for improving the process line and working standard on a two-people basis is 57,500 Thai Baht. 
Improving the system can reduce the cost and value of losses by 300,000 Thai Baht due to late delivery.

Abstract 
Discrete event simulations are becoming increasingly important in the management of complex manufacturing 
systems, however, a significant issue with current methods is the collection and processing of data from various 
physical systems. This data is often of poor quality and incomplete, making it difficult to produce accurate results. To 
address this problem, a Python-based automation tool was created to collect, analyse, and store data from 
Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) using a multi-step data preparation algorithm and a dedicated simulation 
database. This tool is more efficient than using tools such as Microsoft Excel and includes a user-friendly interface 
for data entry and visualization. This automation tool is expected to improve the quality and accuracy of simulation 
results, while reducing the time and effort required for data preparation in the automobile manufacturing production 
line.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing is crucial to a society's prosperity and progress. To swiftly capitalize on emerging market trends, 
operations must constantly be kept as adaptable as possible. One of the essential elements of competitive success in 
industry is the requirement for quick adaptability to changes in industry trends or consumer patterns. Unfortunately, 
rather than making greater use of the equipment that already exists, this modification involves large investments. 
Obviously, reducing wastes like excessive production, delay, movements, defects, etc. is crucial for improving 
competitiveness. Continuous improvement of production flows, which is at the heart of Lean Manufacturing, will 
result in a reduction in the time it takes to complete an activity from start to end as well as overall expenses. 
Discrete Event Simulation (DES) has shown to be a useful tool for such advancements. The use of DES reduces the a 
forementioned wastes by effectively planning, developing, and optimizing material flows in manufacturing. 
Nevertheless, despite its potential, the industrial sector has had trouble using simulation as a decision-support tool 
(McNally and Heavey 2004). The lengthy time commitment of simulation studies is one of the key drawbacks of using 
DES. This results in less thorough study and, as a result, production systems that ignore variation and disruptions and 
are built for perfect conditions. The input data procedure may be the cause of the lengthy time consumption. Typically, 
10–40% of a DES project's total time is required for the input data procedure (Skoogh and Johansson 2008). This is 
the outcome of the human labor-intensive process of converting raw data into simulation input and the poor quality of 
the data (Robertson & Perera  2002).

6. Conclusions 
We created an automation tool for IDM in DES that is based on Python which has a User Interface for data entry as 
well as a separate database for holding output files from the tool and the simulation software. Thereby establishing a 
workspace for simulation engineers that includes complete automation of the generation of input data for throughput 
simulation and the provision of data analysis visualizations with a single database housing all of their project-related 
documents. This tool significantly shortens the deadlines for simulation projects by giving useful input data in a matter 
of minutes, even when the tool is used for hundreds of Assets. In contrast, the Excel-based Macro tool generates the 
output over the course of hours or even days, and it occasionally gets stuck. 
 
The results demonstrate that the Python IDM tool is significantly more effective at delivering precise output rapidly. 
The newly created cleaning algorithm is exclusive and solely applicable to the data creation for throughput simulation. 
Depending on the sort of simulation input data required and the type of data given for cleaning, this task can be 
expanded by altering the cleaning algorithm, as a future direction of research.

researchers conducted. The tensile strength test, parametric test, and Universal Testing Machine (UTM) were used to 
gather the data for this study. The compressive strength test was performed at the TERMS Concrete and Materials 
Testing Laboratories Inc. in Tayuman, Manila. The study assumed that: CFBs are less expensive than CHBs; carry 
less weight than CHBs; and have greater structural strength. Results show that  CFB has an average compressive 
strength of 1,004.167 PSI. In comparison to a CHB, the CFB has more compressive strength. The researchers also 
concluded that a CFB would carry less weight than a CHB at 5.4721 lb. In both panels' cost analyses, the price of CFB 
is deemed to be higher than the price of CHB. Fiber Cement Board (CFB) offers a substantially more cost-effective 
alternative. By enhancing the walling system for residential establishment, this study will benefit the Philippine 
construction industry.

1. Introduction
In the Philippines, the construction industry contributes largely to its economy. In the fourth quarter of 2020, there is 
a gross value added of about PhP 336 billion. This refers to the total construction expenditure by private and public 
firms. CHB or Concrete Hollow Blocks are commonly used construction materials when building residentials due to 
its affordability and availability. In an article of Desai (2020), it is stated that Concrete Hollow Blocks have a relatively 
low compressive strength and load-bearing capacity which is not ideal in large-load bearing structures. Also, CHBs 
when delivered require extra workforce due to its weight which requires precaution as it could break easily when 
dropped. The proponents thought of a wall panel system that could further strengthen the load bearing capacity of the 
structure of residential housing while using its most abundant resources. The Philippines is considered as one of the 
top producers of coconut in the world, there are 9 billion coconut husks every year that are burned because it takes 
years for them to decompose (Pogosa et  al.  2018). The proponents developed a  cost-effective and high quality panel 
called Coconut Fiber Cement board made with cement and coconut husk and this panel will be used as permanent

5.4 Validation  
For the validity of the study, the researchers made sure that they base on the ATSM standards for the compressive 
strength. The test done on CFB is also done by the expert in the field in a legitimate testing site. Also, the proper 
equipment for testing the compressive strength was used in order to make sure that the results that will be obtained 
have no bias. The results for the test are also signed by an expert mason to make sure that all of the data are validated 
and confirmed. For the costing of the study, the researchers made sure to keep the receipt as the basis of our costing. 
This is also to make sure that all of the cost that was listed in the study is not altered or manipulated. Lastly, in order 
to make sure that the data for comparison is accurate, the researchers used excel in order to have a better visualization 
of the comparison between the CFB and CHB. 
 
For the improvement of the study, it is suggested that SPSS is used for the normality test in order to make sure if the 
data gathered is normally distributed. Also, use t-test in order to find out and prove the significance difference or 
relationship between CFB and CHB. 
 
6. Conclusion 
A material or structural element's capacity to withstand loads that, when applied, cause them to reduce in size is 
referred to as their compressive strength. The researchers have determined that the average compressive strength of 
the Coconut Fiber Cement Board is 1207 PSI with 28 days curing period. The Coconut Fiber Cement Board has 
satisfied the average necessary compressive strength in accordance with ASTM C90 with 28 days of curing period. 
The findings clearly showed that the Coconut Fiber Cement Board has a higher compressive strength than a Concrete 
Hollow Block. In the average Dead Load of both CHB and CFB, the proponents of the study concluded that the weight 
of CFB would be 3.2 lb, which means that it is lighter than the concrete hollow block. This means that the carrying 
weight of CFB is lower than the concrete hollow blocks without the poured mixture inside. In the cost-analysis of both 
panels, the price of CFB is evaluated to be higher than the cost of CHB. One of the main reasons for this is the addition 
of the Fiber Cement Board as the base of the CFB and the additional aggregate of Coconut Fiber Husk.  
 
Economically speaking, with regard to the price, the CHB is definitely better than the CFB but according to a Solutions 
Built article, Permanent Formwork Panel offers additional stability and shields concrete from deterioration despite the 
CFB's somewhat higher cost. It is also claimed that using permanent formworks allows for quick turnaround, lower 
prices, and a reduction in time and procedure needed for building commercial or residential structures. Based on the 
data results, CHB has a compressive strength of 801 PSI while CFB has 1207 PSI. As of the dead load, CHB has a 
dead load of 18.2 lb while CFB has 3.2 lb. Furthermore, the cost in creating 3 pcs of concrete hollow blocks would be 
₱1005.00. In addition, the cost of producing 3 coconut fiber cement boards would be ₱1,435.00. However, despite its 
slightly higher cost, the Permanent Formwork Panel which is the same concept as our CFB provides additional stability 
and protects concrete from deterioration, according to a Solutions Built article. Permanent formwork also allows for 
a faster turnaround, lower costs, and a reduction in the time and procedures required for building commercial or 
residential structures.

Abstract 
This research aimed to study the effect of gas metal arc welding parameters on 1.4003 ferritic stainless steel and 
SS400 carbon steel. There are three parameters for the experiment investigating the microstructure of the joint, 
Inspection of weld properties. It consists of a tensile test and a hardness test. The result is as follows. The gas metal 
arc welding could successfully produce the sound weld of 1.4003 ferritic stainless steel and SS400 carbon steel. An 
increase in welding speed affected to decrease in the tensile strength of the welds but did not affect to change the 
hardness of the welds. The study found that. The optimized welding parameter in this study that showed the ultimate 
tensile strength was welding wire ER308 LSI, welding current 120A, and welding speed 150 mm/min.

1. Introduction
In the current manufacturing industry, various metals are used as structural components to bring out each metal's 
strengths to meet users' needs. Welding is a popular method in the automobile manufacturing industry. However, it is 
quite challenging to join dissimilar materials. The two materials have different mechanical, physical, and chemical 
properties. As a result, the welding process is different. The bus chassis manufacturing industry uses various materials 
to increase efficiency and reduce production costs. Chassis design must consider the metal's anti-corrosion ability and 
the material's cost. It must take advantage of stainless steel in anti-corrosion and the lower cost of carbon steel used 
in the design of the Bus Chassis. 
In general, in bus chassis production, most of the production process is carbon steel to carbon steel welding. However, 
the bus chassis manufacturing company in the case study chose to use ferritic stainless steel grade 1.4003 and carbon 
steel grade SS400 because the company in the case study did not study the parameters of welding processes between 
the two sheets of steel. Therefore, choosing the type of welding wire and adjusting the process parameters is not 
suitable for the nature of the job. 
Based on the above problems, This research focuses on the welding process and the effect of welding factors between 
ferritic stainless steel and carbon steel by gas metal arc welding (Gas metal arc welding: GMAW), which will affect 
the properties of the workpiece. In addition, another purpose is to improve the bus chassis welding process of the case 
study company. 
1.1 Objectives 
•
To study gas metal arc welding (GMAW) between ferritic stainless steel and carbon steel.
•
To study the effects of gas metal arc welding on the mechanical properties of ferritic stainless steel and
carbon steel weld.

Hardness Test 
To analyze the hardness measurement test results, Collecting the hardness measurement data from Table 2. shows that 
the hardness of the weld line depends on the factors of welding wire, current and welding speed. For example, the 
weld that welded with ER70S grade electrode at the welding current of 100 A and a travel speed of 150 mm/min gave 
the highest weld hardness value of 329 HV. Furthermore, at an arc current of 80 A, a travel speed of 150 mm/min will 
give the lowest weld hardness of 242 HV, as shown in Figure 10. 
 
Figure 10. Comparison of Hardness Test from current factor at current 80, 100, 120 A 
 
From the test, measure the hardness of the workpiece in all five areas, which are 1. Base metal SS400 2. Heat Affected 
Zone of SS400 3. Weld bead area  4. Heat Affected Zone of Ferritic stainless steel 1.4003 5. Bass Ferritic stainless 
steel 1.4003. The hardness value was found to be the highest in the weld area. Compared with the hardness of each 
area, it was found that the Heat Affected Zone of the Ferritic stainless steel 1.4003 workpiece had a hardness almost 
similar to the weld area. In contrast, the Heat Affected Zone of Carbon steel SS400 had less hardness than the weld 
bead, and the Heat Affected area zone of the workpiece Ferritic stainless steel 1.4003. 
 
Proposed Improvements 
The study of the influence of gas metal arc welding process parameters between stainless steel grade 1.4003 and 
carbon steel grade SS400 can be improved as follows. In welding, for additional comparison of mechanical properties, 
such as changing other wire grades. Moreover, it should study other effects to provide a more comprehensive analysis 
of results to choose which to use.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The experimental results can be analyzed to show that the most appropriate arc current was 120 A, and the welding 
speed was 150 mm/min with ER308LSi grade wire, which gave the highest tensile strength of 359.09 MPa. The study 
found that such welding variables affected the melting and metallurgical transfer between the welding wire and the 
workpiece due to the appropriate arcing of the test piece and the optimum melting rate of the wire. From the tensile 
test, it was found that most of the test pieces broke down at the welding line at 80 A current. Therefore, the welding 
current at 80 A was not suitable for use. On the other hand, because the welding wire's melting rate is inadequate, the 
welding's penetration is less. Furthermore, at arc currents of 100 A and 120 A, the test piece's tear marks are on the 
side of SS400 steel, making it suitable for use.

        The hardness test revealed that the welding areas of SS400 and ferritic stainless steel 1.4003 had a higher 
hardness than the Heat Affected Zone on both sides. And from the results of the microstructural analysis of the weld 
area. The structure of the workpiece that gives it the highest tensile strength is ferrite. The hardening characteristic is 
columnar, which tends towards the middle of the weld under heat, causing the structure to resemble dendrites.

Abstract 
The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed the use of digital payments. However, this is still far from reaching the cashless 
economy that Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas seeks. With the ease of lockdown restrictions, cash may still dominate 
physical transactions due to the limited adoption of e-wallets in the country. This study aimed to determine whether 
Filipino consumers prefer the use of cash or e-wallets in dealing with in-store transactions. A self-administered survey 
was distributed to 252 individuals residing in Greater Manila and Pampanga. It gathered socio-demographic variables 
and a Likert scale to measure factors, namely performance, usefulness, trust, ease of use, security, responsiveness, 
transparency, perceived enjoyment, and behavioral intention. The results of the survey were analyzed through Non-
Parametric Tests such as the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test, Mann-Whitney U Test and Kendall-
Theil Test. The results of the study showed that most of the Filipino consumers still prefer having cash transactions 
in the current and future times and are not yet able to adapt to the usage of e-wallet. Having an aim to become a 
‘cashless’ society, e-wallet service providers must make improvements to encourage more consumers to use e-wallets 
in dealing with in-store transactions.

1. Introduction
Digital wallets, also known as e-wallets, are financial transaction systems that run on mobile devices. This technology 
is mainly known for enabling contactless or faster remote transactions for personal, business, or government purposes. 
Moreover, as the COVID-19 pandemic started, digital wallet companies have found a new prominent purpose: to let 
users experience a contactless and ‘more lightweight’ payment system during in-store transactions. Bangko Sentral 
ng Pilipinas (2020) reported a 14% increase in e-wallet payments in 2019 and 20.1% in 2020 in terms of volume. In 
terms of its value, e-wallet payments have increased from 24% to 26.8% during the same period. In 2020, government-
related payments (G2X) is reported as the most cash-lite payment sector. This progress should drive the digitalization 
of payments and push the government to start initiatives and policies establishing the digital transaction system 
(Estioko et al. 2021). However, since this payment system is yet emerging and progressing, drawbacks were 
experienced by the Philippines in using it - cybersecurity risks, social class and financial literacy, and the role of 
physical cash in having a ‘cashless’ life. Even though the pandemic has prompted the people in utilizing e-wallets, the 
scam and cybersecurity issues has held them from trusting them. Even with the rise of e-commerce, cash on delivery 
is still preferred by most users since they feel safer with their purchases through it. Internet connectivity such as poor 
access, slow speed, and affordability is still being experienced in the county which hinders the use of e-wallet. It was 
estimated that 57% of households in the country do not have internet access, so cash is still the primary mode of 
payment since digital methods cannot fully be utilized  (World Bank 2020). The findings of the study served as a 
determinant of the readiness of the Philippines to be a cashless society and the need for e-wallet companies to provide 
more accessible, user-friendly, and optimized services. It can also aid e-wallet developers in better understanding user

meet the research primary objective. The key constructs used in this study were usefulness, trust, ease of use, security, 
performance, responsiveness, transparency, and perceived enjoyment. The Kendall-Theil regression specifically, 
developed a predictive model for an individual's behavioral intention when using cash or e-wallet in daily in-store 
transactions. The key constructs used in this study were usefulness, trust, ease of use, security, performance, 
responsiveness, transparency, and perceived enjoyment. With these critical constructs, the Kendall-Theil regression 
specifically, developed a predictive model for an individual's behavioral intention when using cash or e-wallet in daily 
in-store transactions. The results of the Kendall-Theil regression predicted that using cash during in-store transactions 
has a greater value than of the value when using e-wallet. Therefore, it is concluded that people still prefer to use cash 
rather than e-wallets during in-store transactions even in the near future. Also, the Mann-Whitney U test identified the 
factors in which cash is favored more than e-wallets which are believed to have caused the low usage of e-wallets. 
With the results of tests, most of the Filipino consumers still prefer having cash transactions in the current and future 
time and were not yet able to adapt to the usage of e-wallet, therefore it is apparent that e-wallets still need 
improvements to encourage consumers to use it for their payment transactions.

Abstract 
The total food waste constitutes a great portion of perishable goods and Kaya (2021) stated that inventory management 
has been proven to be more challenging for perishable goods since these deteriorate over time and become obsolete. 
This study will be significant for business owners in Convenience Store X in Marikina City and for future studies to 
have an effective inventory management. The objective of this study is to create user-focused inventory management 
system using a design thinking approach which is a five-stage process: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test. 
With that, the researchers gathered data and determined the users’ pain points related to the inventory management 
system for perishable goods in Convenience Store X. Then, the researchers came up with criteria and solutions for the 
new inventory system with the use of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), specifically Analytical Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) and integrated with software developers in designing the three (3) user interfaces of a Software-as-a-
service (SaaS) inventory system namely: System X, System Y and System Z. Through the Pugh Selection and User 
Acceptance Test, the researchers collected ratings from the users and concluded that System X is the most preferred 
design based on the users’ pain points and preferences.

1. Introduction
Perishable goods are a large component of retail sales, they represent up to 50% of all sales in the retail food industry. 
However, 70% of the total food waste constitutes a great portion of perishable food products (Gardas et al. 2018). In 
general, a problem is seen from perishable food spoilage and deterioration in the retail industry, wherein it results in 
significant losses of profitability. With that, Kumar (2020) highlighted that a system perspective is needed to analyze 
the complexities on the sustainability of perishable food supply chains.  
With Convenience Store X located in Marikina City as the study site, the researchers gathered data recurring from 
August to December 2021 and found significant reports of bad merchandise, or also known as products that may be 
damaged, expired, or near their expiration dates. It was recorded that Convenience Store X had a significant financial

Convenience Store X in Marikina City, the researchers have concluded that the owner, managers, and employees of

considered System X as the most preferred design. With that, to further test System X, beta testing was conducted to 
provide trial use to potential users. User acceptance testing was also provided to the users to guide the researchers. As 
a result, from all the tests that were conducted, the researchers were able to conclude that system X can tend to the 
needs of the users.   
 
Based on the results of the study, it shows the relevance of having a user-focused design of an inventory system as it 
aims to meet the needs and preferences of the users and it promotes an effective interaction between the user and the 
system. With a user-focused inventory management system, it allows users to track the products/items easily and 
efficiently throughout the supply chain of an organization. Hence, it is revealed from this study that organizations, 
particularly convenience stores, should focus on implementing a user-centered design of an inventory management 
system.

off-takers consider it a necessity to apply digital technology in order to improve business results so that without any 
influence from the surrounding environment they are already interested and using this application. The off-taker also 
provides direct aspirations for the development of an agree system, namely there needs to be an IoT that is connected 
between the cage data and the smartphone in real time, and there needs to be integration with farmers regarding the 
need for rice husk.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Performance expectancy has a positive and significant influence on behavioral intention. Facilitating conditions and 
behavioral intention have a positive and significant influence on use behavior. The availability of facilities and 
performance influencing poultry performance are the research's novelty and utility. As a suggestion for future input 
for this research, so that the number of research samples used is increased in order to obtain maximum research results. 
Testing is also carried out after the implementation of the application is implemented.

Abstract 
The recent global pandemic and the academic efforts, nationally and internationally, to minimize teaching and learning 
interruption due to this unexpected phenomenon provided educators an opportunity to explore alternative teaching 
and learning methods. Several online communication mediums saw opportunities to explore these needs and stimulate 
the innovative use of these technologies. The engineering education community was among the groups who cautiously 
led this transformation. Over the past twenty years, the Texas A&M University-Qatar campus has established itself as 
one of the leading academic institutions in the region. The Education City in Doha, Qatar, houses six American 
university branches, among which Texas A&M University-Qatar is the only one that offers four ABET-accredited 
engineering degrees in Chemical, Electrical, Mechanical, and Petroleum. Texas A&M University-Qatar campus has 
consistently been regarded as an institution that often takes the lead in developing, implementing, and assessing the 
most innovative use of innovative teaching and learning methods to engage students in learning further actively.  
This paper reports some of the results of an empirical study conducted at Texas A&M University in Qatar and Texas 
A&M University in College Station, Texas, in two undergraduate courses taught on these two campuses. This study 
also compared students' academic performance in synchronous learning environments with face-to-face teaching and 
learning options.

Figure 9.  Academic performance during traditional face-to-face learning 
6. Conclusion
The responses provided by undergraduate students from both campuses showed several similarities. The knowledge 
of information technology (IT) plays a key role in synchronous learning. The availability of high-speed internet 
affected how students participated in the classes and collaborated with their peers. The survey identified that class 
participation affected the academic performance of the student. It is also pertinent that access to course instructors and 
face-to-face instructions were preferred as both of them could speed up the learning process. The availability of the 
course materials should be continued during face-to-face learning and not limited only to online courses. 
The survey results also showed that students for the classes with laboratory components were less respective to remote 
learning (synchronous). The main disadvantage for engineering students in remote learning is the ability to perform 
hands-on experimental work and do research. The academic performance appeared better during traditional face-to-
face.

Abstract 
Tanjung Priok Port and international trade are two things that cannot be separated. However, the performance of the 
Tanjung Priok Container Terminal is currently not optimal even though Tanjung Priok is the main port lever in 
Indonesia in terms of exports to foreign countries. As a result, increasing the productivity of container ports in serving 
container traffic flows is essential. In order to improve container terminal productivity, this study will create a model 
and simulation of container stacking in the stacking yard (stacking area). A proper stacking procedure (stacking rules) 
will limit the amount of reshuffling, which is a waste in container operations. The study's findings are discrete event 
simulation-based models that may be used to evaluate container stacking options based on container terminal 
productivity. As a result, it is planned to provide an understanding of the relationship between productivity and 
container stacking procedures in stacking yards.

1. Introduction
AInternational commerce promotes economic freedom, which can be used to boost a country's prosperity. 
Furthermore, economic freedom might motivate all manufacturers to improve product quality in order to compete in 
the global market. Foreign commerce plays a direct and indirect role in economic development by increasing foreign 
exchange revenues, transferring capital and technology from outside, and developing new domestic industries or 
industrialisation (Muchtar 2001). Because it is a source of foreign exchange for the country's income, the movement 
of export-import goods between countries promotes economic growth. In 2021, Indonesia's imports will total USD 
196,190.0 million (up 38.58 percent), with oil and gas imports being USD 25,529.1 million and non-oil and gas 
imports totaling USD 170,660.9 million. Tanjung Priok Port is the largest unloading point for imported products, 
accounting for 38.63 percent of the total (USD 75,786.3 million). Indonesia's export value would reach US$231,609.5 
million in 2021, up 41.92 percent from 2020. (BPS  2022). The expansion of supporting infrastructure, such as ports, 
container terminals, and road infrastructure connecting to ports, must be capable of accommodating the increase in 
commercial activity. This is because Indonesian ports handle the vast majority of world trade. 
Tanjung Priok port is the epicenter of Indonesian export trade. This is corroborated by Export Data by BPS Port of 
Loading for 2021, which shows that Tanjung Priok handles the majority of Indonesia's exports. Tanjung Priok 
accounts for 44.39 million tons (27%) of Indonesia's net export weight of 163.12 million tons in 2021. Tanjung Priok 
has a total export value of USD 55.7 billion (24%) of the total value possessed by the country, which is USD 231.6 
billion (BPS  2022). Tanjung Priok, on the other hand, has a less competitive performance when compared to Asian 
ports. Yangshan, on the other hand, is ranked first in East Asia in terms of overall efficiency, analysis on port efficiency 
(CPPI indicator), with an index score of 183.5. The CPPI 2021 employs two methodological approaches: an 
administrative, or technical, approach, a pragmatic methodology based on expert knowledge and judgment, and a 
statistical approach based on factor analysis. The reasoning behind using two methodologies was to ensure that the 
ranking of container port performance represents actual port performance as precisely as possible. In the same study, 
the CPPI rated Indonesia 37th out of 66 analyzed ports in Asia, with a score of 28.2. (World Bank 2021). Tanjung 
Priok is ranked 124 out of 370 ports in the World Bank database, according to the Container Port Performance Index

stacking area, the percentage indication for these events is the primary indicator. The percentage of reshuffling on the 
three models is contrasted in the table below. The % value given here represents the model's overall stacking block 
reshuffle percentage.  
 
Yard Occupancy Ratio shows the performance data of stacking area utilization. In the Category Stacking model 
created in Plant Simulation, it can be seen that the area utilized in the model is larger than the real field YOR data. 
The model is then validated by verifying the present processes in the model with the model's conception. Verification 
begins by identifying the critical processes in the model and establishing whether they are operating in accordance 
with the model's conceptualization. The model activity verification is shown in Table 1.

Table 1. Model Activity Verification 
 
Depending on the model's final results in the preceding section, the three indicators used as a reference suggest that 
stacking containers based on ship characteristics delivers the best performance (Category Stacking Based on 
Destination). According to the three indications, the approach yields the least number, reflecting the efficiency of 
container unloading activities in the stacking area. 
 
Essentially, the container unloading procedure will be tailored to the ship's arrival at the pier. Containers from ships 
that dock first will be unloaded first in the stacking area. As a result, it is critical to stack containers in groups based 
on the ship that will deliver them. So that containers from one ship do not mingle with containers from other ships. 
Finally, it will make unloading containers from the stacking area easier. 
 
The model with the destination-based category stacking approach, on the other hand, does not stack containers in 
groups based on the ship that will convey them. Because stacking is solely determined by the container's function. 
Meanwhile, the containers are stacked randomly rather than clustered when seen through the ship's properties. Finally, 
there will be issues throughout the container unloading procedure. Because the containers will be picked up by the 
gantry crane in the sequence in which the ships arrive at the dock. 
 
However, stacking approaches based on destination qualities are still relevant in the design of container terminal 
operations. In reality, aside from the arrival of ships anchored at the wharf, there is also a matter of planning for 
stacking on board at the container port (Stowage Planning). The destination of the container is the most essential 
component in stacking on board. Because the container with the most distant destination must be at the bottom of the 
stack. So that it does not obstruct the operation of loading and unloading containers at the next port. 
 
As a result of an examination of the model architecture and container stacking simulation, it is possible to conclude 
that Category Stacking Based on Destination is the optimum strategy. 
 
6. Conclusion  
Researchers were successful in developing a discrete-event simulation-based container terminal model that represents 
the activity of loading and export containers from the time the container enters the container terminal to the time the 
container is transported on board.

The model was able to represent the process of stacking containers in the stacking area using three types of stacking 
methods: category stacking based on destination, category stacking based on vessel, and random stacking. 
The category Stacking Based on Destination approach produced the least reshuffling activity, resulting in the 
maximum efficiency in container stacking activities in the stacking area. Reshuffling accounts for just 13.78% of total 
crane movement. 
 
According to research, the category stacking approach based on destination has the highest performance since it creates 
the least amount of reshuffling. Other metrics, such as the number of gantry crane movements and the percentage of 
gantry crane movements, similarly reveal low values. So, in this model for the stacking yard approach, category 
stacking based on destination is superior to category stacking based on vessel and random stacking. 
However, in order to develop operational activities for stacking containers that are more true with real-world settings, 
stowage planning concerns (stacking of containers on ships) must be taken into account. This model does not take 
these factors into account. As a result, the destination-based category stacking strategy can still have a considerable 
influence on container port operating performance. When discharging containers from the stacking area, the activity 
of stacking containers on ships is taken into account. 
 
To be produced, extensive research on the operation of each container terminal is required. Because the container 
terminal's activities and operations are highly complicated. As a result, the researcher has some recommendations for 
the future development of this research. The use of Discrete Event Simulation software which is more up-to-date in 
terms of visualization in the future. The next model development is expected to be able to use other methods that are 
more complex and have more variables as consideration for container stacking methods such as Allocation Methods, 
Ship Queues, and Crane Placement. The development of the next model is expected to be able to incorporate other 
factors such as stowage planning and other factors for the complexity of container terminal operations. So that the 
model is able to more closely represent the container terminal in the real world.

Abstract 
The Bus Carousel is one of the primary modes of transportation in EDSA. The factors identified were affordability, 
reliability, accessibility, environment, tangibility, comfortability, and safety. This study examines the relationship 
between variables identified to improve the public transportation service and establishes a recommendation for the 
problems to be discovered from the data collected via an online survey among passengers within a year. Through 
Factor Analysis, it was identified that the sub-factors that are relevant to each are pricing and budgeting for 
affordability, journey satisfaction for reliability, ease of access for accessibility, pollution exposure for the 
environment, customer service for tangibility, bus stop and bus conditions for comfortability, and personal safety and 
security for safety. 2-3 alternatives were determined for each sub-factor/criterion. Using AHP, the best decisions are 
to implement an automated payment system, create an incentive platform for e-payment, implement a real-time 
estimated time of journey from one station to another, provide/improve elevators and escalators that can accommodate

Highlighted rows in table 5 show the solutions the best possible decision to make for each factor. For example, the 
solution A2 or the implementation of an automated payment system is the most desirable decision for affordability in 
terms of pricing with an overall priority of 0.029. For budgeting, the identification of the optimal value for a fixed 
price through the creation of an incentive platform for e-payments is the best possible decision with an overall priority 
of 0.004.  
 
5.4 Validation 
The study was presented and discussed to 2 panelists (both industry and academe practitioners). Focus group 
discussions with passengers of the service with regards to the solutions were done as well. No concerns or negating 
feedback were raised with regards to the model synthesis and overall results. 
 
6. Conclusion  
As efficient operation of mass public transportation is a key to improving the living and commuting conditions of 
citizens in Metro Manila, the Bus Carousel is one of the primary modes of transportation in EDSA. Starting operations 
in 2020, the service has offered transportation to passengers within the EDSA highway. This study fills the gap 
between customers’ expectations and perceptions towards the EDSA Bus Carousel services. 
 
The researchers based their criteria on several studies and other credible online resources regarding public 
transportation, especially on Bus Rapid Transit and Public transportation in order to identify and consider all the 
factors necessary to identify the customers’ perception and satisfaction. From here, seven (7) criteria were made: 
Affordability, Reliability, Accessibility, Environment, Tangibility, Comfortability, and Safety. A total of forty-five 
(45) sub-criteria were created. The researchers utilized factor analysis through the SPSS software on the data that was 
obtained through an online survey where the forty-five (45) sub-criteria was reduced to nine (9) sub-criteria: Pricing, 
Budgeting, Journey Satisfaction, Ease of Access, Pollution Exposure, Customer Service, Bus Stop Condition, Bus 
Condition, and lastly, Personal Safety and Security. The proponents determined the importance of the criteria and their 
sub-criteria through relative weights using Analytical Hierarchy Process. 
 
Several alternatives were identified and weighted according to their relevance and impact. The chosen alternatives 
have the greatest overall priority, serving as a guide that these alternatives can create a better impact compared to other 
suggested alternatives.

Abstract 
Customers bringing their automobiles for maintenance services at one local automobile service station experience 
long waiting times.  The service station normally is overwhelmed with complaints from customers due to 
understaffing, lack of standard work procedures, and staff training, which lead to poor service quality.  It is the goal 
of this study to analyze and redesign the service workflow of this service station in order to reduce service time and 
meet industry standards.  Fish-bone diagram, 5s Activities, as well as ECRS, are used to not only analyze the root 
cause of delays and customer complaints but also reduce and eliminate waste in the service procedure. A new service 
workflow has been introduced by reducing the number of steps to serve customers from 30 to 15.  The standard time 
for the whole procedure is calculated based on the proposed procedure, which is reduced from 77 minutes to 52 
minutes. 
Keywords 
Workflow redesign, ECRS, Lean technique, Waste reduction, Customer satisfaction 
1. Introduction
The case study service station is a car maintenance service center that sells all kinds of auto parts, servicing all brands 
of cars. The primary services are suspension repair, brake repair, engine repair, engine oil change, and others. There 
are an average of 527 cars coming in for the service per month, or 17 cars per day, of which an average of 45% engine 
oil change, 17% brake repair, 15% suspension repair, 12% tire change, and 11% other services. Business can provide 
multiple services. The major problem of this service station comes from employees, who do not have sufficient 
knowledge and information. This leads to delays in work processes and increasing customer complaints. Upon 
collecting customer complaint statistics for 3 months, it is discovered that there are 14 complaints about staff 
unprofessionalism, 35 complaints about delayed service, and 3 complaints about non-standard work causing the 
service center to lose credibility. Service center also loss revenue from delayed work processes by losing the 
opportunity to acquire additional customers because the car that receives the previous service is not finished yet. 
Technicians are not enough to provide service and customers can't wait. For this reason, we would like to reduce time 
and non-value-added workflows in order to increase customer satisfaction. Therefore, lean concept is applied as a 
process improvement guideline. This study will focus on the services that people use the most at this service center, 
which is the process of an engine oil change. The goals of this study aim to reduce times and steps of the engine oil 
changing process.

Moreover, the working station and the overall atmosphere of the station were more workable since the station was 
organized and applied the keys of 5S activities. Hence, time spent on searching and preparing tools was reduced as 
shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Working station after 5S Improvement 
The application of both 5S activities and the improved process of engine oil changing discovered that 15 steps were 
reduced from the initial steps of 30. Moreover, the time required for each service was declined to 52 minutes from 77 
minutes which enable the station to establish a time requirement for engine oil changing at 60 minutes.   
 
5. Conclusion  
The goal of this study was to reduce steps and process time. After improving the process by implementing fishbone 
diagrams, 5s activities and ECRS principles to analyze waste, it was discovered that the main cause of the delay was 
due to staff's lack of skills and redundant work processes. When a new work process was implemented, it was 
discovered that the work process was reduced from 30 steps to 15 steps, representing a 50% reduction, and the time 
spent on work was reduced from 77 minutes to 52 minutes. corresponding to 32%

Abstract 
The rapid development of cellular technology is directly proportional to internet penetration which continues to grow 
yearly. This certainly results in the emergence of intense competition between cellular operator companies in 
Indonesia. The fierce competition between operators at this time forces all telecommunications companies to wage a 
price war to secure loyal customers and increase market share in the future. Telkomsel is the telecommunications 
company with the largest number of subscribers in Indonesia. Still, Telkomsel is also a cellular operator that ranks 
first as the cellular operator with the most customer complaints, according to a survey by the Indonesian consumer 
institute foundation in 2021. Based on this phenomenon, this study aims to analyze ""The Influence of Service Quality 
and Price on Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty in Telkomsel Cellular Operator Services."" The aspects of service 
quality studied are reliability, assurance, tangible, empathy, responsiveness, network aspects, and convenience. The 
method used in this study is a quantitative method with data collection techniques distributing questionnaires. The 
sampling technique used is non-probability sampling with a purposive sampling method. The sample to be studied is 
400 respondents who use Telkomsel cellular operator services throughout Indonesia. 
The study's results indicate a positive and significant influence of service quality (reliability, assurance, tangible, 
empathy, responsiveness, network aspects, convenience) and price on customer satisfaction (customer satisfaction). 
There is a positive and significant influence of customer satisfaction on customer loyalty and a positive and significant 
effect of service quality and price on customer loyalty through customer satisfaction.

1. Introduction
In Indonesia, the growth of the cellular telecommunication business continues to progress every year in line with the 
increasing population and number of people using cellular phones in recent years. Seeing this, the players in the 
telecommunications industry continue to improve their competence in providing various conveniences and cheap 
services to customers so that later they can attract customers from competitors and make previous customers more 
loyal. However, not all services provided by every cellular operator can meet the needs and desires of customers. 
According to research conducted by Open Signal, it is revealed that Indonesians easily switch to services belonging 
to other cellular operators when they feel dissatisfied with the services provided because a contract does not bind them 
by the cellular operator company.

company's physical facilities, lest customers cannot enjoy the latest services, monotonous product materials, and 
unattractive website appearance, which will affect customer satisfaction in using Telkomsel products. 
 
Empathy describes the care and concern that a company gives to its customers. Seeing this, it is appropriate that 
Telkomsel, in carrying out a network development plan, always prioritizes customers' interests in making decisions. 
Do not let the products that come out later not fully understand the needs of customers in the field. Responsiveness 
describes the company's ability to be fast, precise and responsive in providing services. Seeing this, employees must 
have a high sense of belonging to what customers feel so that employees can help customers regarding problems they 
are facing and respond to existing complaints and complaints. For example, if there is a weak signal complaint in an 
area, the company and employees must be alert and responsive in handling the complaint. Don't let customers be given 
uncertainty regarding the problem being faced. The network aspect describes network performance indicators that 
affect the increase in the quality of cellular services felt by subscribers. Seeing this, Telkomsel must always pay 
attention to the availability of a cellular network that covers each area, the ease of customers accessing services, the 
network speed when accessing the internet, and maintaining the network to minimize disruptions. Convenience 
describes the ease of service to reduce the time, and effort consumers spend obtaining the goods and services they 
want. Seeing this, Telkomsel has a call center, website, and others that customers can use to clarify if there are 
problems with existing services. Telkomsel also has Grapari operating hours that are comfortable for all its customers 
because it opens its work operations from Monday to Saturday. Kotler and Armstrong (2012: 52) explained that four 
indicators characterize a price, namely price affordability, price compatibility with product quality, price compatibility 
with benefits, and price according to ability or price competitiveness. So Telkomsel, in determining the cost for each 
region, must pay attention to these four indicators. 
 
The effect of customer satisfaction on customer loyalty 
Table 5 shows that the P-Values value of H9 is <0.05, and the T Statistics value of H9 is > 1.65. So it can be concluded 
that the hypothesis test H9 is accepted. Customer satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on customer loyalty 
at Telkomsel. The results of this study follow previous research, according to David (2019), indicating that of the three 
variables studied, namely service quality, price, and customer satisfaction, customer satisfaction is the most influential 
on customer loyalty. Customer satisfaction describes a consumer's pleasure or disappointment after comparing what 
he received with what he expected. Seeing this, Telkomsel must focus on making customers feel comfortable and 
happy using their purchased products. So that later, of course, it will affect by itself the customer's repeated purchases. 
 
Effect of reliability, assurance, tangible, empathy, responsiveness, network aspect, convenience, and price on 
Customer Loyalty through Customer Satisfaction variables 
Based on table 5, it can be seen that the P-Values of H10-H17 are <0.05, and the T Statistics values of H10-H17 are 
> 1.65. So it can be concluded that there is a positive and significant effect of reliability, assurance, tangible, empathy, 
responsiveness, network aspects, convenience, and price on customer loyalty to Telkomsel customers through 
customer satisfaction variables. The better service the company provides will impact customer satisfaction and will 
affect customer loyalty. Vice versa, if customers feel insecure and comfortable when transacting using company 
products, it will impact customer satisfaction and loyalty. 
 
The results of this study follow the results of previous research, according to Hani (2016), showing that the effect of 
service quality on customer loyalty can be intervened or mediated with the customer satisfaction variable and research 
results according to Shen and Yahya (2021) show that customer satisfaction mediates the effect of price on customer 
loyalty. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Based on the results of research, test results, and analysis that has been done before, it can be explained some research 
conclusions about the effect of service quality on customer satisfaction and customer loyalty with the following 
description: 
1. There is a positive and significant influence of variable service quality (reliability, assurance, tangible, empathy, 
responsiveness, network aspect, convenience) and price on customer satisfaction with Telkomsel cellular operator 
services. 
2. There is a positive and significant influence on customer satisfaction with Telkomsel cellular operator services 
on customer loyalty with a t statistics value of 26.954 and a path coefficient value of 0.821.

3. There is a positive and significant influence of variable service quality (reliability, assurance, tangible, empathy, 
responsiveness, network aspect, convenience) and price on customer loyalty through customer satisfaction at 
Telkomsel cellular operator services. 
 
Suggestion 
There are several limitations in this study, so the researcher suggests some things that can be used as a future reference 
by the next researcher: 
 
1. In future studies, it is hoped that they can conduct research by adding other service quality indicators and 
modification variables that have not been included in this research model, such as Wen and Hilmi's (2011) value-
added services variable and Rahhal (2015) complaint handling variable. 
2. Adding other variables to be studied related to telecommunications company objects, focusing on service quality 
and price and adding product quality variables, Yugi (2019).

Abstract 
 
The circadian rhythm cycle has a significant impact on students who attend their daily classes at home or online. As 
students adjust to the new system, sleep deprivation is one of the most significant factors affecting their daily 
schedules. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the circadian rhythm cycle on engineering students who attend 
classes at home or online. The researchers used structural equation modeling to analyze relationships between 
variables such as sleep, grades, workload, and stress levels. The results showed that factors such as academic 
workload, fatigue, academic stress, screen time, and the number of units had a significant effect on the sleep-wake 
activity of engineering students. Additionally, academic stress was found to be a contributing factor to psychological 
well-being, while screen time and hours of sleep were found to be contributing factors to working conditions and 
individual factors, respectively. To address these issues, the researchers recommend giving students sufficient 
deadlines for online activities, implementing a system of monitored class length and interval, and providing quick 
breaks. They also suggest that counseling and medical consultation should be made accessible to students to create a 
more open environment for discussing mental health and well-being.

1. Introduction 
 
Ever since the pandemic started everything switched to an online setup, in the course of still adapting to the new setup, 
sleep is one of the biggest factors that affected the daily cycle of students. A person’s sleeping cycle or also known as 
the circadian rhythm cycle has been a big role in students attending their daily classes off or online. Circadian rhythms 
are 24-hour cycles that correspond to the body's internal clock. This, in turn, correlates to carrying out essential 
functions and processes within the body. The most significant example of Circadian rhythm in action is the sleep-
wake cycle.

2676","result in inaccurate data analysis. With the said problem the researchers made sure that all of the data collected will 
be anonymous so the responses will not be able to identify the identity of the respondent. The researchers will not 
discuss or disclose any information to other people and will use data gathered for academic purposes only. This study 
will also be complex with the reason that the researchers have limited knowledge when it comes to some medical 
terms and backgrounds which will be used for the research. Another reason is the researchers consider multiple 
variables to assess a person’s rhythm to create solutions for them. The data of the study were collected only once but 
it should have been collected daily and then taken its average to help minimize bias and increase the accuracy and 
reliability of the results. The percentage given in the questionnaire is also only assumed by the respondents so it does 
not apply to every grading system. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Academic activities can impact the circadian rhythm cycle of engineering students studying in NCR, according to the 
accepted assumptions (H5, H6, H7, H9, H11, H12, H14, H15, H16, H17 and H18). Even yet, there are still gaps in 
the study that prevent the researchers from conclusively stating whether or not the circadian rhythm is disturbed. As 
there isn't enough data to fully establish the circadian rhythm, the researchers then offered several recommendations 
for future research to improve the study.  
Additionally, this research will assist students in improving their body clocks and sleep-wake cycles so they can 
enhance their well-being without compromising the subjects’ academic performance. Faculty members and/or 
professors in schools who are responsible for implementing the curriculum will also become more informed as a result 
of this study, enabling them to give their students an appropriate workload and class schedule.

Abstract 
The Philippines is currently still in the midst of a pandemic, the Philippine railway systems such as the LRT and MRT 
are still part of the daily lives of commuters. In this context, this report surveys 400 commuters’ insights and notions 
regarding the service quality provided by the Philippine Railway System. The SERVQUAL scale will be used to 
determine the commuters’ insights and notions of proper service quality. Evaluating service quality is critical in order 
to boost passenger satisfaction and loyalty in riding a train in railways. It is essential for customers to maintain 
contentment and to increase morale. The study aims to recommend new policies to the railway system for the 
improvement of its quality service during pandemic and for the future purposes. Updates to the results of the 
interviewees' (customers') work are also required to make sure that the users' expectations and perceptions of the 
railway system's current internal and external performance, as well as its capacity to serve the general public (including 
the elderly and PWDs) and improve their facilities and equipment to do so, are plausible.

1. Introduction
The Philippines saw its first railroad framework, harking back to the 1890s originally called the Ferrocarril de Manila-
Dagupan. The line was reaching out from Manila to Dagupan in Pangasinan, covering 195 kilometers. It served as the 
path and bridge between the funding to the towns in the north of Luzon. Over a century after the fact, modernized 
train frameworks are all around the nation, serving different key regions and making business and exchange more 
helpful and effective. Today there are 3 different railway transports currently active. With over 20 kilometers of length, 
the elevated LRT-1 (Light Rail Transit 1) interfaces two urban areas in the capital district, Pasay and Caloocan City. 
There are 113 trains presently working, obliging a large portion of 116,021 travelers everyday and running at a speed 
of 60 kph. The LRT-2 (Light Rail Transit 2) with a 15-kilometer raised railroad framework, associates two Metro 
Manila urban communities, Pasig and Manila, crossing key areas in the locale. It serves around 200,000 travelers day 
to day running at a speed of 60 kph. Extending more than 16 kilometers and 45-60kph, this railway transport system 
fundamentally serves the critical urban communities of Metro Manila, as the MRT (Metro Rail Transit) course 
interfaces the north and south of the capital area. The first ridership limit of the train was 350,000 every day, except 
1793",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

there are multiple factors regarding Philippines’ rail transportation that need improvement and updates. This is proven 
based on the survey conducted. By performing multiple tests such as AHP to identify and rank the average weights of 
the problem commuters are encountering, multiple alternate solutions are to be provided for commuters to receive 
100% satisfaction and avoid more problems.

Abstract 
According to the Department of Information and Communications Technology, the internet in the Philippines needs 
continuous improvement. The Statista research department labeled the Philippines as one of the worst internet speeds 
with high costs in the Asia Pacific. The COVID-19 pandemic forced businesses to implement a work-from-home 
(WFH) setup where high-performance broadband services are required. Therefore, findings of this study will be 
beneficial to them since the aim of the study is to assess the satisfaction of WFH employees with their current Internet 
Service Provider (ISP) through the five factors - speed, cost, accessibility, reliability, and customer service. 
Multinomial Logistic Regression was used to predict which ISP (ISP X, ISP Y, and ISP Z) is most likely used by 
WFH employees based on the satisfaction of the respondents. The results of the study showed that speed and cost are 
the only significant factors. A WFH employee who uses an ISP with higher speed and cost is most likely to be a ISP 
Y user. These results imply that there is a high demand for fast and affordable internet in the Philippines. The 
researchers recommend using a wider sample of internet users and ISPs, and utilizing different statistical tools for 
future studies.

1. Introduction
The Philippines has the highest average daily time spent using the internet in the Asia Pacific region. Internet Users 
in the country spend 10 hours and 27 minutes daily using the internet (Statista  2022). With the increase of employees 
working from home due to Covid-19, having a reliable and fast internet connection is a must. In 2016, 64.41% of the 
population of the country was using the internet compared to 2020 with 72.7%. Forecasts show that by 2026, it would 
increase to 77.44% of  the population. According to a research released by Statista Research Department in 2021, the 
average Internet speed in the Philippines is one of the slowest among the Asia Pacific region. In addition, among 
ASEAN countries, the Philippines was considered as one of the most expensive monthly internet costs (Baclig & 
LUSTAN  2021). This shows that there is a need to increase the quality, speed, and performance of Internet services. 
There are numerous current actions initiated in the Philippines that serve as assistance to the researchers’ potential 
resolution to the issue. Due to widespread complaints, the government has announced plans to bring free Wi-Fi into 
schools, parks, libraries, hospitals, and public transportation stations (Toh 2015). According to CNN Philippines 
(2021), technology experts urge lawmakers to implement a law that would help improve internet connectivity in the 
Philippines. Other actions done were to establish a strong regulatory system. The House Bill 8910, also known as the 
Open Access in Data Transmission Act, was approved by the House of Representatives on July 28, 2021 (Cervantes, 
2021). The bill shall ensure fair competition in the data transmission industry by lowering barriers to entry for the 
telecommunications industry, in the process lowering the cost of such services (Legislators Tout Open Access Bill as 
Recovery Driver  2022).

The parameter estimates allow the researchers to have an in-depth understanding of the results. The data in this table 
shows the contribution of each independent variable. Column “Exp(B)” indicates the increase or decrease of a 
probability of an event occurring. (Multinomial Logistic Regression - Statistics Resources - LibGuides at Northcentral 
University, 2022). In Table 11, the upper part shows the comparison between ISP X and ISP Y. Based on the 
significance levels, only speed and cost are the significant predictors in the model. Since the coefficient on column B 
for ISP Y is positive 0.17, the researchers can conclude that the higher the internet speed of the WFH employee, the 
more likely that he/she uses ISP Y. It can also be concluded that for every one unit increase in speed, the odds of being 
a ISP Y customer increase by 1.186. A similar conclusion can also be derived from the comparison of the cost for ISP 
X and ISP Y. Since the coefficient of column B for the cost of ISP Y is positive 0.467, the researchers can conclude 
that the higher the internet cost of the WFH employee, the more likely that he/she uses ISP Y. It can also be concluded 
that for every one unit increase in cost, the odds of being a ISP Y customer increase by 1.595 times. 
 
The lower part of Table 12 shows the comparison between ISP Y and ISP Z. Based on the significance levels, the 
speed and cost are also the only significant predictors in the model. Since the coefficient on column B for the speed 
of ISP Y is positive 0.053, the researchers can conclude that the higher the internet speed of the WFH employee, the 
more likely that he/she uses ISP Y. It can also be concluded that for every one unit increase in speed, the odds of being 
a ISP Y customer increase by 1.055 times. For the cost, since the coefficient of column B for the cost of ISP Y is 
positive 0.293, the researchers can conclude that the higher the internet cost of the WFH employee, the more likely 
that he/she uses ISP Y. It can also be concluded that for every one unit increase in cost, the odds of being a ISP Y 
customer increase by 1.34 times. As seen on Tables 11 and 12, speed is the only factor that is considered as statistically 
significant to compare ISP X and ISP Z using the model. In Table 11, the coefficient on column B for ISP Z is positive 
0.117. The researchers can conclude that the higher the internet speed of the WFH employee, the more likely that 
he/she uses ISP Y. It can also be concluded that for every one unit increase in speed, the odds of being a ISP Z 
customer increase by 1.124 times. 
 
The classification statistics indicate the percentage of responses that the model was able to predict correctly. 69.6% 
or 16 out of 25 ISP X respondents were predicted by the model. ISP Y and ISP Z users were predicted by the model 
50% of the time. As seen in Table 13, the overall percentage of 56.7% means that the model is able to correctly predict 
the ISP of the respondent more than half of the time.

4.6 Cost-Benefit Analysis 
According to our findings, ISP Y and ISP Z have the fastest internet connection among the three ISPs, while ISP Z 
and ISP X have the lowest prices. Respondents who currently use ISP Y and ISP Z may be internet users who highly 
consider speed in choosing an ISP. On the other hand, respondents who are currently using ISP Z or ISP X may be 
internet users who prioritize availing an internet plan with a low cost. Internet users who wish to change their current 
ISPs may use this data to evaluate their decision. Every ISP has distinct undertakings and operations to meet the needs 
of its customers. As a result, companies manage their costs, provide funding for improved connection, and anticipate 
other operational adjustments. 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations
In summary, there is a high demand for a fast and affordable internet in the Philippines. Businesses, school, workforce, 
and every sector now relies on the internet for their operations. As more users depend on it, the higher quality ISPs 
should provide their services. Therefore, identifying the user experience and their satisfaction is a must to improve 
their products and services. In addition, it can also help the respondents and users in evaluating their current ISPs. As 
a result of the study, the researchers recommend the following: (1) Increase the speed of megabits per second in all 
ISP plans, and align the provided plan MBPS with the intended internet speed. When it comes to internet speed in the 
NCR, choose ISP Y or ISP Z as your ISP, (2) Provide additional price selections when selecting a plan in all ISPs and 
lower costs to be more affordable. When it comes to pricing, choose ISP X or ISP Z as your ISP.  
In the light of the limitations identified and the findings of the study, the following are recommended as future research 
subjects: (1) The researchers can use alternative modes of data analysis for understanding the relationships among the 
five factors considered in the study; future researchers may explore and consider using Kruskal-Wallis H Test, and 
Structural Equation Modeling. (2) The researchers can include additional ISPs to further evaluate the factors and the 
overall satisfaction of WFH employees. (3) The researchers may consider adding another sector of the society that 
uses the internet in their daily lives; their study may include individuals in educational institutions like students, 
teachers, and researchers. (4) The researchers can increase the sample size of this study. The Greater Manila Area can 
also be included in the sample size of the study since there are also a lot of WFH employees in these areas.

Abstract  
This study's goals were to enhance nitroglycerin manufacturing efficiency through simulation, recover nitroglycerin 
from the storage facility, and enhance nitroglycerine recovery and purge systems. It was found that the problem was 
nitroglycerin reflux. Therefore, the researcher created three alternatives to solve the problem. The system of 
Nitroglycerine Recovery and Purge was then simulated using the FlexSim program, and each alternative was tested. 
The results demonstrate that the alternative system-led Nitroglycerine Recovery and Nitroglycerine Purge System 
collaborate to produce Nitroglycerine, which is more efficient than other alternatives and can reduce production time. 
It can also improve the recovery of nitroglycerin. It also serves as a guideline for developing a real-world system and 
modeling it for training staff without wasting chemical raw materials or fuel energy.

1. Introduction
 Explosives, which can be categorized into low explosives and high explosives, are any one or more types of 
substances that, when exposed to a sufficient amount of heat or mechanical force, will instantly decompose, creating 
heat and large quantities of pressurized gas that will destroy everything nearby (Boonsin Kulsiripruek 2021).

Nitroglycerine, abbreviated NG, is an explosive liquid energy substance (Boonsin Kulsiripruek  2021)   It was first 
discovered in 1846 when Ascanio Sobrero, an Italian chemist, mixed glycerin with a mixture of nitric and sulfuric

4. Results and Discussions
 Alternative 1: Improving nitroglycerin production efficiency by developing a system for nitroglycerine recovering 
from simulation and using it in production without wasting the primary raw material. It takes 2,040 seconds, or 34 
minutes, before it is transferred to the Nitroglycerine Purge system. 
Alternative 2: Increasing efficiency in nitroglycerin production by building a system for nitroglycerine purge, resulting 
in the recovery process of nitroglycerin decomposition taking 15,960 seconds, or 266 minutes, or 4 hours and 26 
minutes. The process duration was the combination of the Nitroglycerine Recovery System and the Nitroglycerine 
Purge System, which is 2,040 + 15,960 = 18,000 seconds, or 300 minutes, or 5 hours. 
Alternative 3: By installing a nitroglycerin tank, valve, and pipe to link the two systems together, the Nitroglycerine 
Purge System is used in conjunction with the Nitroglycerine Purge System to strengthen the connection between the 
two systems and enable them to access one another. The simulation produced a nitroglycerin emission recovery system 
and a nitroglycerin decomposition recovery system capable of running continuously for 16,020 seconds, 267 minutes, 
or 4 hours, 45 minutes. It is also possible to work in any system. 
5. Conclusions
The study's findings are based on data from layouts, manuals, and factory plans owned by Nobel Explosives Company 
Limited as well as on interviews with knowledgeable employees who have been given technology by the company. 
The development of three alternatives to improve the efficiency of nitroglycerin production was also influenced by a 
comparison of the work process durations between the Nitroglycerine Recovery System and the Nitroglycerine Purge. 
The third alternative is to apply the Nitroglycerine Recovery System and the Nitroglycerine Purge System, the 
regeneration process of nitroglycerin decomposition is able to work continuously. It takes 16,020 seconds, 267  
minutes, or 4 hours and 45 minutes, and it can choose to run either system. It is the most suitable choice. The 
application of simulation techniques to increase nitroglycerin production efficiency in a case study of a military 
explosives factory in Nakhon Sawan Province can be a practical and effective approach to system development. 
Nitroglycerine Recovery and Purge can be used successfully in practice.  
The technical data for this research is particular to nitroglycerin production plants, factory divisions, and military 
explosives factories, and only individuals working in the nitroglycerin production plant fully comprehend the working 
process. Those who are interested, however, can apply the concepts of the Nitroglycerine Recovery and Purge System 
to various operational applications. When designing a real system, it is advantageous to learn more about electrical 
and electronic control devices, performance display devices, and the system's control system in order to be consistent 
with the Nitroglycerine Recovery and Purge system and make the system more complete and safer for operators.

Abstract 
Health services is a process or intangible activity that occurs with exist and interaction between customers and 
providers of service or source power physique another sector. Quality service health can be measured based on the 
Service Quality (Servqual) model with compare performance service through attribute relevant services, according to 
5 dimensions of quality service namely tangible, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy. The research 
aims to investigate quality services and determine priority attributes of Individual Health Efforts (IHE) at all Public 
Health Centers (PHC) at Sarolangun Regency in 2019. The concept of Servqual dimensions is used to determine the 
quality of services and Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) is to determine priority attributes of IHE. The total 
sample based on the formula Sugiyono is as many as 576 people. The result showed that the service quality of  IHE 
was considered good, except for the tangible dimension where 46.98% of respondents measure was not good. IPA 
analysis shows that all Servqual dimensions are priority attributes to improve the quality of IHE at PHC in Sarolangun 
Regency, especially the tangible dimensions that emphasize the cleanliness of public facilities and the availability of 
medical devices and information services. However, the existence of other Servqual dimensions as priority attributes 
means that infrastructure development is not enough without strengthening quality from the human resources in public 
health services, and this is proven in this study. It is important for the Sarolangun Regency government to prioritize 
the development facilities. It is important for the Sarolangun Regency government to consider that infrastructure 
development must be accompanied by human development.

Efforts to healthy individuals who are carried out in health centers form service building with a service focus treatment 
to somebody started from registration until service pharmacy (Mariano et al. 2022; Wang et al.  2022). Physical 
evidence form means infrastructure is just not enough if not supported by power performance health in giving service. 
Besides that remember the dynamic condition society is facing so gift information through system information proper 
health will be much needed in creating service effective and efficient (Yazdi-Feyzabadi, Emami and Mchrolhassani, 
2015; Mariano et al.  2022; Zhai et al.  2023). 
 
6. Conclusion 
All dimensions of Service Quality (Servqual) are priority attributes in improving the quality of Individual Health 
Efforts (IHE) at Public Health Centre (PHC) in Sarolangun Regency, especially the tangible dimensions on cleanliness 
and the availability of public infrastructure including medical devices and strengthening of service information. 
However, the existence of other Servqual dimensions as priority attributes shows that strengthening infrastructure 
alone is not enough without strengthening the quality of human resources, especially health workers, and this is proven 
in this study. Based on this, it is important for Government of Sarolangun Regency to prioritize the development 
facilities and infrastructure for health services at the health centre and accompanied by efforts to improve the quality 
of human resources providing services at the health centre.

Abstract 
The study aimed to determine in what ways a proposed teleconsultation booking application can facilitate access to 
university teleconsultation services; identify significant factors to be considered in the development of such an 
application in terms of operational and functional requirements; and determine the strength of the relationship between 
the counselee demographic factors and the application requirements. A mixed method of research was used by 
gathering data from elicitation interviews and online surveys. 211 respondents who are currently enrolled students or 
employed faculty members, office staff, and administrators of Adamson University took a survey that aimed to 
determine their awareness on the Guidance Office’s current teleconsultation service and problems encountered with 
it, and the importance of the 17 potential operational and functional requirements of the proposed application to them. 
The researchers identified problem areas that hinder access to university teleconsultation services and concluded that 
these could be mitigated or eliminated by the use of a booking mobile application. Welch’s ANOVA and Games-
Howell Test were used via Minitab software for data analysis towards determining which requirements are more 
important and less important for inclusion in the app. From the results, 15 of the 17 potential requirements warranted 
their inclusion in the app. Spearman’s rho was used via SPSS Software to determine the relationship between particular 
counselee demographic factors and the app requirements. The researchers found a weak to nonexistent relationship 
between them.

6. Conclusion 
Through descriptive analysis of the data gathered from the online survey, the researchers conclude that a booking 
application can efficiently facilitate access to university teleconsultation services by addressing problem areas, which 
it can do by: 
• 
Spreading awareness about university teleconsultation services 
• 
Instructing counselees how to set a teleconsultation appointment 
• 
Reducing the steps necessary to set a teleconsultation appointment 
• 
Facilitating speedy agreement of a convenient appointment schedule between counselors and counselees 
• 
Inducing the Guidance Office to get in touch with counselees quicker 
 
The researchers conclude that all 17 of the potential operational and functional requirements for the proposed 
teleconsultation booking mobile application, except for requirement F3 that states the app must enable users to choose 
their own counselor to have an appointment with, should be included in the development of the app. The requirement 
that the app must not store any of the users’ data (O7), despite being deemed as less important by survey respondents, 
was part of the Guidance Office requirements, so it is included in the development of the app. Requirements that the 
app must be easy to use (O1) and must be easy to learn how to use (O2), are to be prioritized in the development of 
the teleconsultation booking application. 
 
Finally, the researchers conclude that there exists a weak to nonexistent relationship between the demographic factors 
of the counselees included in the study and the requirements of the application. Therefore, the Guidance Office can 
be sure that the requirements of the proposed teleconsultation booking mobile application will not hinder their 
important goal of giving counselees unbiased and equal quality of service, regardless of demographic factors.

Abstract 
Driving Behavior (DB) is a complex concept that describes how the driver operates the vehicle in the context of the 
driving scene and the surrounding environment. Recently, DB assessment has become an emerging and very important 
topic. However, given the stochastic nature of driving, measuring, and modeling, DB continues to be a challenging 
topic today. Thus, this paper argues that in order to move forward in understanding the individual and organizational 
mechanisms influencing DB, a conceptual framework is outlined in which DB is viewed in terms of the different 
dimensions established in the Driver-Vehicle-Environment (DVE) system. In addition, DB assessment has been 
approached by various machine learning (ML) models. However, there has been no attempt to systematically analyze 
empirical evidence on ML models, moreover, ML-based DB models often face problems and raise questions that need 
to be resolved. This article presents a systematic literature review (SLR) of the concept of DB investigasi investigation

Abstract 
The main objective of this study is to develop a chatbot that helps minimize the negative impact of the new normal 
on college students’ well-being. In order to do that, the researchers also determined the physical and psychological 
impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on college students in the Philippines. To assess the impact of the Covid-19 
pandemic, the researchers conveniently surveyed 328 college students who are currently enrolled in online classes 
and are living in the Philippines. The data gathered were analyzed using IBM SPSS and Microsoft Excel. The test 
of normality has revealed that there is enough evidence that there is a significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic 
on the physical (p (0.000) <0.05) and psychological well-being (p (0.000) < 0.05) of college students. Furthermore, 
the study has revealed that there are factors that make the students more vulnerable to experiencing physical 
discomfort and psychological distress. On the other hand, the study has revealed that there is a weak to negligible 
correlation between the demographics of the college students and the physical and psychological impact they were 
experiencing during the pandemic. Furthermore, there is a weak correlation between the physical impact and the 
college students’ human attributes while there is a moderate correlation between the psychological impact and the 
college students’ human attributes.

Table 4.5.1.17 shows the weighted scores of each alternative/option. Following the MCDA procedure, the weighted 
scores on each criterion and option were computed by multiplying the criteria assessment of the options by the weight 
of each criterion. The sum of the weighted scores on each option was computed. The highest the sum, the most optimal 
the option is. Based on the computed table, the most optimal option is Option A which has almost all of the features 
except for the “Free of Charge” feature. Therefore, the prototype of the chatbot will be based on the optimal option.  
6. Conclusion 
The researchers based upon the analysis of the survey result through the use of a web-based survey, related literature, 
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software, and Microsoft Excel. Furthermore, Convenience 
Sampling and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis were used in this study to obtain relevant information and analyze the 
data gathered.  
In conclusion, the researchers have found that there are significant factors that make college students more vulnerable 
to experiencing physical discomfort and psychological distress with a p-value less than 0.05 (p (2.1107E-12) < 0.05). 
Therefore, talking to professionals, looking for external validation, and searching the web are the factors that make 
college students more vulnerable to experiencing physical discomfort and psychological distress. 
Upon using the spearman’s rho correlation to test the relationship between college students’ age, sex, student type, 
year level, course, school type, and location of schools physical discomfort, and psychological distress they are 
experiencing,  the researchers found that the sex the college students has a weak positive correlation and their year 
level has a negligible positive correlation on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their physical well-being. It 
means that males and females experience different impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on their physical well-being.  
Upon using the spearman’s rho correlation to test the relationship of college students’ sex to psychological well-being, 
the researchers found that 0.7% of the time, there is a weak positive correlation between sex to the psychological well-
being of college students. This implies that the impact of Covid-19 on their psychological well-being varies differently 
for both sexes. Furthermore, the result of the spearman’s rho correlation states that 84.2% of the time, the college year 
level and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their physical well-being have a negligible positive correlation. The 
result of the spearman’s rho correlation states that 84.2% of the time, the college year level and the impact of the 
Covid-19 pandemic on their physical well-being have a negligible positive correlation.  
The result of the spearman’s rho correlation implies that the college students' physical discomfort and their human 
attributes are positively correlated. This shows that their physical discomfort affects their human attributes. 
Furthermore, the result of the spearman’s rho correlation shows that the college students' psychological distress and 
their human attributes are positively correlated, implying that their psychological distress has an impact on their human 
attributes.

Abstract 
Telemedicine is a service that provides remote clinical services by utilizing telecommunication services. It aims to 
provide medical care access to patients regardless of geographic challenges. The use of telemedicine in the Philippines 
was underutilized not until the occurrence of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Improving the service quality 
of telemedicine can help Filipinos improve their quality of life using such services. With the use of the service quality 
(SERVQUAL) framework to identify the factors affecting the satisfaction of the patients, online survey questionnaires 
via Google Forms were disseminated through different reliable and open access platforms to gather data, and Analytic 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) to evaluate and analyze the key indicators. Based on the result of this study, patients consider 
assurance as a key indicator of the service quality of telemedicine, with a priority rating of (37.2%). This is followed 
by reliability (27.1%), empathy (17.6%), responsiveness (12.7%), and tangibility (5.4%). It can also be inferred that 
among the two (2) sub-criteria under assurance, the competency of the telemedicine service affects their perception of 
its service quality. Furthermore, applying skills training for physicians in telemedicine services can further improve 
patient satisfaction.

1. Introduction
In today's age of technology, advancement and innovations in healthcare services are highly evident. One of which is 
telemedicine, a service that provides remote clinical services by utilizing telecommunication services (Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 2020). This service is said to improve affordability and accessibility to healthcare in 
the United States (Macariola et al. 2021). According to Haleem et al. (2021), because of the increasing cost and 
continuous changes in the current situation, healthcare facilities are gradually adapting to telemedicine services for 
cases that do not require physical consultation. In the Philippines, telemedicine was established in 1998. However, 
this service has been underutilized for years, not until the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic (Macariola et al. 
2021). Because of the emergence of the Corona Virus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare services

Under empathy, it is more important for patients to feel the patience of the telemedicine personnel through 
accommodating, understanding, and attending to their needs (77.3%) than attentiveness to health concerns (22.7%). 
For responsiveness, the patients value their time even though the health consultations were conducted virtually, which 
is why on-time and hassle-free consultations are more important (73.7%) than the overall service availability (26.3%). 
Although as mentioned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2020) that SEA countries have issues when 
it comes to overall service availability, which includes connectivity, cellular reception, technological literacy, and lack 
of access to gadgets, the result shows that the respondents still prioritize how time efficient the telemedicine 
consultation is. Lastly, for assurance, the competency of telemedicine providers and personnel is more important for 
the patients (64.3%). This includes showing confidence in providing the needed service with minimal to no mistakes. 
While the cost, addressing post-treatment concerns, and successful consultation has 35.7%.  
 
Table 5 shows the computed prioritization for alternatives with respect to each criterion where the different weights 
of criteria and sub-criteria were considered. It shows that for Tangibility and Empathy, the first alternative which is 
the adoption of User-Centered Design for the design and development of telemedicine systems with 4%, and 
implementation of communication skills training on physicians with 11.5% has the highest weight for that specific 
criteria. For Responsiveness and Reliability, the second alternative should be prioritized; these alternatives are the 
application of 5G technology in telemedicine and conducting training for physicians with 8.7% and 17.4% 
respectively. Lastly, the first alternative for Assurance has 26.9% which is the application of skills training for 
physicians who wish to engage in telemedicine. 
 
5.4 Validation 
Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy and Bartlett’s Test for all criteria are summarized in Table 6; 
wherein all criteria meet the recommended value of 0.6 for Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy, 
signifying that the sample size is sufficient for factor analysis. In addition, all the criteria’s Bartlett’s Test is significant 
with all p-value of less than 0.05, which indicates that there are enough correlations for factor analysis. Additional 
respondents to be observed are advised to ensure that the sample size is adequate and that there are enough correlations 
for factor analysis.

6. Conclusion 
Based on the result of the study, it can be concluded that, among the five (5) SERVQUAL dimensions, assurance 
greatly affects patient satisfaction with the service quality of telemedicine with a weight of 37.2%. This is followed 
by reliability at 27.1%, empathy at 17.6%, responsiveness at 12.7%, and lastly, tangibility at 5.4%. It is also inferred 
that the competency of the telemedicine personnel greatly affects the service quality of the telemedicine consultation. 
This signifies that the confidence and level of ignorance of the telemedicine personnel affect the patient’s satisfaction 
with availing telemedicine service. Furthermore, based on the overall priority as seen in table 5, to address these 
factors, among the proposed alternatives, the researchers suggest conducting skills training to assure high-quality 
telemedicine service. Although skills training will incur additional costs for the telemedicine provider, patients, 
healthcare workers, and telemedicine services will substantially benefit from its implementation. In addition, if the 
telemedicine service in the Philippines is improved based on the outcome of this research, patients would rely more 
on telemedicine services due to increased customer satisfaction and improved service image. In return, their 
transportation costs will be reduced when they have consultations.

Abstract 
 
Cloud kitchens are non-conventional food businesses that do not offer dine-in services to its customers. In comparison 
to traditional food business, the setup offers higher profitability to business owners due to overall reduced costs, hence 
it is an advantageous model. It also has the potential to increase customer satisfaction since it can diversify the food 
options offered by the food industry. In the Philippines, these models are starting to grow in the hospitality industry. 
The subject of this study is a local cloud kitchen that has recently started – Lina’s Kitchen. It has a problem of not 
reaching the target profit per day. The study has utilized multiple tools, such as root cause analysis and process 
documentation, to identify the areas of improvement of business processes. From these tools, improvements on the 
end-to-end process are proposed. These include dissemination of sensing surveys and purchasing of ingredients 
weekly, early menu posting, more cost-efficient delivery methods, and hiring manpower. The actual implementation 
of some recommendations shows that the target is reached. Overall, as a business that operates in the food industry, 
the business must have customers considered as these points for improvement are addressed by the enterprise.

1. Introduction 
Cloud kitchens, also known as ghost kitchens or virtual kitchens, are food delivery businesses emerging from digital 
innovations in the gastronomic field (Reiley 2020; Corvo et al. 2022). These deviate from the dine-in options provided 
by traditional food businesses, and make use of online websites and applications to take orders from customers 
(Upadhye and Sathe 2020). Along with these rapid technological developments are changes in consumer behavior, 
one of which includes the increasing preference to purchase products online, furthering the growth of cloud kitchens 
(Islami and Romli 2022).  
 
This growing industry encompasses the large-scale cloud kitchens leading in the market, as well as the micro, small, 
and medium enterprises (MSMEs). However, there is relatively little focus and research on this sector with respect to 
the entirety of the food and beverage (F&B) service landscape, let alone smaller cloud kitchens. Hence, it is important 
to conduct studies focusing on small-scale cloud kitchens, may it be on their business models, operations, or 
contribution to the F&B as a whole. 
 
This study will then focus on Lina’s Kitchen, a virtual food micro-enterprise based in Pasig Greenpark Village 
(PGPV), Pasig City, Philippines. Their menu varies daily, offering at most five home-cooked viands, and they receive 
orders through a Facebook group and then directly deliver these orders to the buyer’s house. However, Lina’s Kitchen 
was not able to reach their average daily target profit of at least PHP 840.00 by having actual sales of only PHP 221.75. 
This study, then, seeks to determine the various operational factors that may cause this loss.

Abstract 
World Health Organization recommends consuming vegetables and fruits at least 400 gr or 5 (five) servings of 
vegetables and fruits a day. According to the results of the analysis of Basic Health Research (Riskesdas) data in 2007, 
the average portion of vegetable and fruit consumption per day in Indonesians aged 10 years and over, is less than 5 
(five) servings per day. This study is to determine the number and type of recommended consumption of vegetables 
and fruits by the Indonesian population according to age group and gender as well as the adequacy of the needs of 
vitamin A, vitamin C, potassium, folic acid, and fiber for the body. This study used vegetable and fruit consumption 
data from Riskesdas data in 2010. The results showed that the 5 (five) types of fruits that are most consumed by the 
Indonesian population are bananas, oranges, papayas, apples, and watermelons. The five (5) types of vegetables that 
are most consumed by Indonesians are spinach, spinach water, cassava leaves, tamarind vegetable soup, and soup. 
The results of linear programming analysis obtained 5 (five) alternatives to vegetables and fruits according to age 
group and gender.

1. Introduction
Linear programming is a mathematical tool that is useful for optimizing (minimizing or maximizing) a linear function 
from a set of decision variables (variables x1, x2,...xn). Y function (objective function) is the function that will be 
optimized with the linear program (Stanimirovic 2022). 
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends consuming at least 400g of fruits and vegetables per day as part 
of a healthy diet to prevent chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. This 
is equivalent to roughly 5 servings of fruits and vegetables per day (WHO 2021). Approximately 16 million (1.0%) 
DALYs and 1.7 million (2.8%) of deaths worldwide are attributable to low fruit and vegetable consumption. Adequate 
consumption of fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases, stomach cancer and colorectal cancer. 
There is convincing evidence that the consumption of high levels of high-energy foods, such as processed foods that 
are high in fats and sugars, promotes obesity compared to low-energy foods such as fruits and vegetables (WHO 
2022). 
According to the National Report of Basic Health Research 2018, 95.4% of the Indonesian population consumes fewer 
fruits and vegetables than the recommended amount, which is 400 grams per day (Ministry of Health, Republic of 
Indonesia 2018). The low consumption of vegetables and fruits by the Indonesian population is a  subject of

The research limitation is the consumption data used in this study, which was collected using the 24-hour recall 
method. One of the weaknesses of the 24-hour recall method is that respondents rely on memory to report the amount 
and types of vegetables and fruits consumed 24 hours ago, which can lead to bias in the information provided by 
respondents. Another weakness of using the 24-hour recall method is that trained interviewers are required to ask 
about the amount and types of vegetables and fruits consumed by respondents. 
Another limitation of this study is the use of linear programming mathematical analysis method. Mathematical models 
have weaknesses, including that not all system characteristics can be easily modeled using mathematical functions. 
Even if they can be modeled with mathematical functions, sometimes their solutions are difficult to obtain due to the 
complexity of the function and techniques required. 
Linear programming is a mathematical method for allocating limited resources to achieve a goal, such as maximizing 
profit and minimizing cost. Linear programming is widely applied in economic, industrial, military, social, and other 
problems. Linear programming is related to explaining a real-world case as a mathematical model consisting of a 
linear objective function with several linear constraints. 
The results of the research on the recommendation for the amount and types of vegetable and fruit consumption by 
the Indonesian population have been summarized in a table of recommended portions of vegetables and fruits for each 
age group (Table 3). Generally, the recommendation for vegetable and fruit consumption by the Indonesian population 
is 1-3 portions of vegetables and 2-4 portions of fruit. The recommended types of vegetables and fruits are commonly 
and widely consumed by the Indonesian population. The recommended types of vegetables are Spinach, Water 
spinach, Cassava leaves, Tamarind vegetable soup, and Soup. Meanwhile, the recommended types of fruits are 
Banana, Orange, Papaya, Apple, and Watermelon. These types of vegetables and fruits can also be varied with local 
varieties in each region. For example, in Sulawesi, the recommended types of vegetables can be added with Moringa 
leaves, and in Maluku and Papua, the recommended types of fruits can be added with langsat fruit. 
Currently, several countries in the world have guidelines for the recommended amount and types of vegetable and 
fruit consumption per day that are appropriate for their respective countries, including Greece, the Netherlands, the 
United Kingdom, New Zealand, the United States, Switzerland, Australia, Japan, Spain, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, 
Brazil, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Africa, and Mauritius. 
Compared to the guidelines for vegetable and fruit consumption in other countries, the recommended amount of 
vegetable and fruit consumption from this research (1-3 portions of vegetables and 2-4 portions of fruit) for the 
Indonesian population is not significantly different from other countries, especially from New Zealand and Mauritius. 
In terms of the portion size, Indonesia is still considered moderate (not too large). This can be caused by the diverse 
eating patterns of the Indonesian population, such as rice, side dishes, vegetables, fruits, and milk (balanced nutrition). 
Based on the eating patterns that have become a habit for the Indonesian population, the fulfillment of nutrient needs 
for the body can be met from various types of food consumed, some of which come from animal and plant sources. 
Therefore, in the recommendation for vegetable and fruit consumption, it is necessary to consider local eating patterns 
and local varieties to increase the diversity of vegetable and fruit consumption. 
6. Conclusion  
The types of vegetables commonly consumed by the Indonesian population are Spinach, Water spinach, Cassava 
leaves, Tamarind vegetable soup, and Soup. The types of fruit commonly consumed by the Indonesian population are 
Banana, Orange, Papaya, Apple, and Watermelon. The average daily consumption of vegetables for the Indonesian 
1866","International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

population is 153.66 grams, while the average daily consumption of fruit is 136.61 grams. The recommended daily 
intake for vegetables is 1-3 portions, and for fruit is 2-4 portions. The recommended intake of vegetables and fruit 
may vary depending on age and gender. Regional recommendations for vegetable and fruit intake are adjusted to 
include local produce.

Abstract 
This report aims at developing an understanding of the term “Safety Culture” and its parameters and uses the findings 
to present guidelines that aim at developing the Safety Culture within an organization. The understanding of the terms 
was done through research from international sources on the origin and adaptations of Safety Culture and what are its 
indicators. The report details findings on what Safety is in general and how it relates to Safety Culture. As well as 
what signs of a positive or negative safety culture are within an organization. It also includes a thorough look into 
Safety incidents data and information that justify the need to develop a positive Safety Culture. Finally, the report 
details procedures that can be implemented to develop a positive safety culture within any organization while 
providing guidelines on how to monitor and improve the process explained.

1. Introduction
According to the Health & Safety Executive (HSE) in the United Kingdom (U.K.), in 2020-2021 around 1.7 million 
workers are suffering from Job associated Diseases, and around 450,000 workers out of the 1.7 million, were injured 
during this period and only in the United Kingdom. Most of these injuries or job-related illnesses could be eliminated 
by following health and safety measures (HSE 2020). 
Regardless of the presence of the hazard, there are other key players in the process of eliminating or reducing risk. 
These key players are Safety Culture and the organizational policy or procedures. Examples of big incidents that

5. Conclusion  
The report explored the term “Safety Culture” and its origins of it. As well as its use in recent history. As detailed in 
the report, there are many different indicators and parameters identified by different resources. This shows how 
abstract the term is and hence the group has identified nine parameters that will be used as the basis for the 
development of a Safety Culture within an organization. The report also explores development justification by 
presenting moral, legal and financial justifications where consequences of different categories can occur due to a poor 
safety culture. The report also presents examples of incidents that occurred with severe consequences such as the 
Chernobyl Incident in 1986.  
 
The nine identified parameters were used as pillars to develop a set of procedures that improve the Safety Culture of 
an organization. These procedures are subject to assessment using monitoring and measurement tools. In conclusion, 
it was identified that Safety Culture is tied to human behavior and not administrative parameters, and to develop it, 
the actions shall address human behavior, interactions and competencies which are reflected in this report.

Abstract 
This study investigates the impact of prolonged driving posture for occupational drives on the upper back muscles. 
There have been limited papers in the literature that studies the upper body muscles hence this study focuses 
specifically on neck and shoulder muscles. A human simulation software called Jack software was used to measure 
the impact of the driving posture on these muscles. Three different trunk conditions relative to the angles were adopted 
as follows: extension, neutral and flexion. The trail incorporated four different postures to mimic the real driving 
experience including the neck muscle at the neutral position, neck lateral rotation to the left and neck extension. The 
results of this study reveal that the lowest discomfort levels of both neck and shoulders were measured at the trunk 
flexion position, thus it suggested that a proper headrest that would support the neck at 15 degrees’ extension would 
help to reduce the strain on the joint.

1. Introduction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), musculoskeletal health is the performance of the locomotor 
system made up of muscles, bones, joints and adjacent connective tissues. There are numerous impairments that impact 
the musculoskeletal system and they are commonly characterized by pain, limited mobility and dexterity, which has 
a negative impact on society as it reduces human’s ability to work and exercise. Apart from the fact that approximately 
1.7 billion people live with various musculoskeletal conditions such as lower back pain, neck pain, fractures, 
rheumatoid arthritis, and etc., people with musculoskeletal conditions are at a higher risk to develop mental health 
issues (WHO 2022). In addition to the conditions mentioned previously, there is a subcategory that is covering work-
related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSDs). These can affect muscles, joints and tendons and in general, develop 
over time; these disorders can be either episodic or chronic, and also can result from an injury acquired in a work-
related accident. Among the jobs that have the highest rates of WRMSDs are agriculture and forestry, construction, 
transport and storage (Goggins et al. 2022). Among the various musculoskeletal disorders and impairments, Lower

6.3 Proposed Improvements 
Based on the results obtained in this study, the lowest discomfort level of the neck was recorded during the trunk 
flexion condition and specifically during the third posture which is the extension of the neck at 15 degrees. This finding 
can suggest that having a headrest that can support the neck angle at this degree can help to reduce the strain on the 
joint and hence a more comfortable position. Most of the industries with fixed headrests, it’s suggested to include an 
adjustable headrest. According to the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 202, Head restraints are required to be 
positioned in all cars manufacture. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, has extended this standard 
to include trucks as well (US Department of transportation 2001). 
7. Conclusion
The study results showed that the lowest discomfort levels of the neck and shoulders are at the trunk flexion position, 
which is contrary to the expectation of having the lowest discomfort at the neutral position since this is the most 
common driving position. Among the results of the study, it is useful to note that the addition of a proper headrest that 
would support the neck at 15 degrees extension would help to reduce the strain on the joint. Future work recommended 
to validate the findings of this study is to measure the pressure during the different postures to assess to which extent 
it matches the comfort assessments and hence propose a better and improved seat design for industrial vehicles.

Abstract  
 
Food waste is classified as a threat that causes a challenge in achieving the goal of sustainable development worldwide. 
Recently, food waste has tripled over the past 50 years due to the increase in population. Moreover, food waste is 
accountable for a third of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions and it generates 8% of greenhouse gases 
annually. However, sustainability can be achieved when losses of resources, food waste and it is associated impacts 
are reduced. Food waste management systems might not yet be introduced in the offshore islands. Thus, this paper 
works in introducing the food waste management system to the offshore locations in UAE to prevent and minimize 
the volume of food waste generated. The paper provides calculations of the estimated food waste volume generated 
from offshore islands to determine the effective solution for food waste management. This study proposes methods 
that include specialized mechanisms and solutions that can help in reducing food waste and extract revenue from such 
practices.

1. Introduction  
In the current and highly populated world, food waste is a growing global crisis that is affecting the physical health of 
the earth and the population inhabiting the entire planet. A big population requires big food production, which leads 
to more waste as it is more difficult to efficiently produce more food without increasing the waste. Food waste not 
only affects the environment by filling landfills and emitting greenhouse effect gases but also it wastes the valuable 
resources that have been used and consumed for its production: CO2 emitted by the processes and transport, water 
used for irrigation and energy. In a modern society where every aspect of environmental protection is taken into 
consideration, food waste is another critical issue that cannot be ignored. By reducing the amount of food wasted and","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

in the composting process. The second path is anaerobic digestion failure, it can be developed if there is a food waste 
volume, food waste sorting failure, and inefficient chemical injection. However, composting process or anaerobic 
digestion both can help in managing food waste. Tacking action by organizations regarding limiting the volume of 
food waste per person and the emotions of gases released into the atmosphere, will force companies to follow the 
regulations and standards. By acting and managing food waste we can achieve a noticeable reduction in the impacts 
of food waste. 
 
6. Recommendation 
As per the finding, the volume of food waste is estimated as 10,840,500 kg/year in offshore locations. The following 
recommendations are suggested to be implemented in the offshore location to reduce food waste along with the 
associated impacts. As the suggestions cover three different levels of food waste management before food preparation, 
educating end-users by campaign or introducing the food sorting system and after consumption to utilize the food 
waste. 
 
1. Before food preparation companies must endorse a meal preference survey. In order, to understand consumer 
preference and prepare the cuisine upon end-user recommendations. Thus, a clear estimation of the dish 
quantity will be considered, especially in the buffet to minimize the probability of excess food. Therefore, 
the survey outcome will eliminate the unpreferred dishes that will end up as waste.  
2. the waste of food is highly essential as they are the consumers. Offshore companies must prompt for 
measurable food consumption through campaigns and marathons. To enhance individuals' knowledge of the 
consequences of food waste. Such an initiative will support the UAE's vision for zeros waste. 
3. The food sorting system can be applied as a practice to be implemented in canteens and cafeterias. Basically, 
4-6 compartments and divided trays must be provided for each user. The different compartments in the trays 
are divided based on the type of food such as fruits, vegetables, meats, or carbs. Each food waste category is 
associated with a specific trash bin for leftovers. Organizations must provide guidelines and procedures for 
their employees. These procedures will raise awareness of food waste management and help acknowledge 
the required food consumption for individuals among employees. Additionally, the trash bins for food waste 
can be sent to composting unit for composting process. 
4. As per the data, the cost of food waste is 11,856,797 $ in offshore locations. Thus, it is highly recommended 
to establish a service area in the offshore islands to utilize the food waste. The installment of such a machine 
will make revenue from waste as it will be converted to organic soil for plantation. Consequently, this will 
reduce the amount of food waste in landfills, and it will limit the associated impacts such as greenhouse gas 
emissions and wasted resources. Introducing the soil-making machine in offshore islands will support in 
achieving the goal of sustainability. 
5. A food sorting system can be applied to limit food waste in canteens and cafeterias. This method helps to 
reduce time in sorting food waste before composting process. To implement this food sorting system in 
canteens and cafeterias, 4-6 compartments and divided trays must be provided for each user. The different 
compartments in the trays are divided based on the type of food such as fruits, vegetables, meats, or carbs. 
Each food waste category is associated with a specific trash bin for leftovers. The trash bins for food waste 
must be approachable for all canteens users to dump leftovers. The organizations must provide guidelines 
and procedures along with food sorting systems to their employees. This practice will raise awareness of food 
waste management and help acknowledge the required food consumption for individuals among employees.  
 
7. Conclusion  
Food waste is classified as a potential hazard that affects the environment as food waste emits greenhouse gasses. 
Unfortunately, food waste shows a significant increase worldwide due to the increase in population. While UAE trying 
to reduce food waste, they still report a high food waste volume of 3.2 million tonnes annually. Per the estimation, the 
food waste in the offshore locations is 10,840,500 kg/year. This amount of waste cost 11,856,797 $ which consider 
huge. Therefore, this issue should be addressed to achieve sustainable development and to meet the UAE zero waste 
vision. Thus, a food waste management system must be introduced to offshore locations to minimize food waste and 
its associated impacts. In this research, a proposed method and recommendations were introduced to reduce the 
amount of waste. Offshore companies must endorse guidelines and provide procedures to be followed by individual 
and kitchen staff. Additionally, they must utilize advanced solutions to start making use of food waste. Food waste 
become a significant issue that should be treated and reduced to prevent any future consequences.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Abstract 
The UDFM is an enterprise located in Yogyakarta that produces leather products. Consumers nowadays demand of 
quality products with the shortest production time possible. However, quality products begin from quality raw 
materials that meet company’s predetermined specifications. Unfortunately, raw materials often fail to fulfil the 
company’s expectation. This discrepancy indicates that the suppliers’ role is less optimized. This study was performed 
to enhance the selection of suppliers in the Indonesian leather firm2 based on certain criteria and sub-criteria 
predetermined by the company. The criteria included quality, price, delivery, service, company profile, and risk. The 
Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference By Similarity To Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) 
were employed in the selection process. After identification and assessment process completed, a proposal was 
submitted to select the most appropriate supplier. The results of this study showed the performance values of the four 
suppliers, namely supplier A of 6.25%; supplier B of 31.25%; supplier C of 43.75%; and supplier D of 18.75%. 
Supplier C obtained the highest performance value, which indicated that supplier C made the most appropriate main 
supplier for company.

1. Introduction
Suppliers are business partners that ensure the availability of materials needed by a company. In the supply chain 
concept, suppliers play a very important role to the continuity of the company's production. Even problems in the 
shipping process can cause stockouts. The UDFM is a company engaged in leather tanning (sheep, goat, cow, and 
crocodile skin). The company, which was founded in 1981, is located in the Yogyakarta Indonesia. The production 
process of this company is divided into wet process and the dry process. The company currently has four suppliers to 
supply the production materials, produces only make-to-order products, hence the products specification requested by 
consumers often varies in terms of leather types, thickness, size, and colour. Each product has different specifications 
to fit consumers’ demand and every incoming order is processed based on consumers’ demand.  
Delays in delivery process have always been the biggest issue. Raw material delivery from the four suppliers took 1 
to 2 weeks from the mutually agreed time. In February 2019 – December 2019, supplier A made 16 late deliveries out 
of 176 delivery, supplier B with 23 late delivery out of 143 delivery, supplier C with 29 late delivery out of 115 
delivery, and supplier D with 5 late delivery out of 86 delivery. The late delivery resulted in delayed production 
process. The company also suffered losses as it had to be returned the raw materials amounting to 11,509 pickle sheets. 
Some factors were also concerned by the company, including the quality of raw materials, prices, speed of delivery, 
services provided by suppliers, company profile, and risk in shipping. Problems that occur from poor performance of 
suppliers can potentially harm the company. Therefore, supplier evaluation should be conducted to solve the problem. 
Regarding the aforementioned reasons, supplier evaluation was performed using a combination of the Analytical 
Hierarchy Process (AHP) method and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) 
method. Each method offered its own advantages to produce optimal values. AHP was used for weighting criteria,

6. Conclusion
Based on the results of the AHP and TOPSIS analysis, the company is recommended to select supplier C as the main 
supplier for the company as it gained a percentage of Performance to Quality of 1.82%, Performance to Price of 7.29%, 
Performance to Delivery of 12.76%, Performance to Service of 7.29%. Supplier C also had a percentage of company 
profile of 9.11% and risk of 5.47%.

Abstract 
In this study, we analyze a two-echelon supply chain consisting of a manufacturer and a retailer operating in a 
monopolistic market under production disruptions due to pandemic workforce restrictions. In this work, the 
production disruptions occur at the manufacturer, which is transmitted to the retailer. The objective of this study is 
to analyze supply chain performance in uncoordinated and coordinated situations. Our results show that a coordinated 
situation, where coordination is achieved through a wholesale price contract, has a higher optimal order quantity 
compared to an uncoordinated situation.

Introduction 
As the world moves through decades to centuries of development, it faces challenges, disasters, disruptions, and 
risks, and so do the modern world's supply chains (SC). Supply chains face many challenges and disruptions (Kapoor 
et al., 2021). Production disruptions are generally events that affect the manufacturing company processes. This paper 
mainly focuses on production disruptions due to pandemic workforce restrictions. The disruptions caused by the 
COVID -19 pandemic have caused major upheavals in manufacturing and have had serious impacts on production 
and its operations. (Cachon  2003) defines that a contract between two partners is called a coordinating contract if it 
ensures the maximization of the sum of the partners' profit in such a way that the total profit of a non-coordinated 
supply chain is equal to the profit of a supply chain with a single decision maker. We succeed in showing that 
coordination under disturbances can be achieved if the contracting parties agree on a wholesale price that lies between 
the calculated bounds.  
Manufacturing has encountered significant disruptions on previous occasions.; natural disasters, trade wars, political 
risks, and other infectious diseases have already put the industry at risk (Okorie et al. 2020). Nevertheless, COVID -
19 precedes all as it wreaks havoc on the global economy (Handfield et al. 2020). For example, during the pandemic, 
industrial production in the United States experienced the sharpest monthly decline since World War II (Rapaccini 
et al., 2020); manufacturing in the United Kingdom is still experiencing massive economic shocks after years of 
impending Brexit and deindustrialization (Harris et al. 2020). Even before the pandemic, the manufacturing sector in 
2019 was experiencing a global economic life of its own, which has now turned into a global economic crisis with 
COVID -19 (Teng et al. 2021). Despite past disasters, lessons have not been sufficiently learned for the 
manufacturing sector to successfully overcome the challenges of the pandemic (Handfield et al. 2020; Javaid et 
al.,2020). Manufacturers are constantly struggling with liquidity and profitability issues, and now COVID - 19 they 
are becoming even more vulnerable to economic shocks (Juergensen et al. 2020). Now, in the midst of an economic 
storm, manufacturing faces difficulties stemming from cancelled orders, weak revenues, and falling stock prices. In 
this study, we assume production disruptions at the manufacturer, which can spread to both the manufacturer and the 
retailer. Moreover, in this study, we attempt to model the disruption in two scenarios based on coordination and non-
coordination. 
 1.1 Objectives 
 The objectives of our study are as follows. 
1. Analyze supply chain performance in profit and order quantity in both uncoordinated and coordinated situations.

From Figure 2, we observe that under the high impact of disruption, i.e., 𝛾𝛾=0.2, a very small fraction of quantity is 
supplied, and the manufacturer offers a larger range of possible wholesale prices to ensure coordination. This result 
is promising as it shows that even under disruption, a manufacturer and a retailer give themselves larger possibilities 
of agreeing on a price that does not harm their individual profits and ensures coordination between them. However, 
when the impact of disruption is low, i.e., 𝛾𝛾= 0.9, almost all the quantity is supplied, the wholesale price contract 
holds strong by giving a smaller range of wholesale price to the SC partners to agree. 
 
6. Conclusions and Future Research 
This study ensures supply chain coordination using a wholesale price contract in a two-echelon supply chain with 
interruptions and fluctuating demand. In this analysis, order quantity is used as a decision variable, with a focus on 
determining a wholesale price in a no-coordination scenario and limits on the wholesale price in a coordination 
scenario to determine how intermittency is affected. In this study, a wholesale price contract was created, and it was 
shown that coordination could be achieved through this contract if the manufacturer and the retailer agree on a total 
sales price that falls between the calculated limits. It also compared the optimal order quantity and profits under 
coordinated and non-coordinated scenarios. The study concludes that the optimal order quantity under coordination 
is always larger than the optimal order quantity under non-coordination when the wholesale price that facilitates 
coordination is agreed upon. This study is limited to a two-stage serial supply chain. Future work may focus on 
incorporating multi-stage supply chains. This study does not include an actual case study to support its modelling. 
Future work may focus on the inclusion of a real enterprise supply chain.

Abstract 
Based on a three-term plan, this study applied an integrated model (IPCC-RA-LMDI-TD) to analyse China’s Carbon 
Emission from the manufacturing industries (CCEMI) for 2001-2020. Results revealed that for the long-term plan of 
CCEMI and decoupling analyses, the activity effect was the main enhancing factor while the intensity effect was the 
main limiting factor. For medium and short-term plans of CCEMI and decoupling analyses, the main enhancing factors 
are the activity effect followed by the carbon emission factor while the main inhibiting factors were structure effect, 
after intensity effect. In general, the sector’s resultant decoupling status is mainly Expansive negative decoupling (2.22 
in 2011-2015 and 1.27 in 2016-2020) followed by Expansive coupling (0.81 in 2001-2010). Nevertheless, the status 
is Expansive negative decoupling in the second half of the study period suggesting deterioration of the decoupling 
index of the sector over the study period. To actualize sustainable development, there is a need for environmentally 
friendly strategies such clean energy and technology deployment.

Introduction 
Green House Gases (GHGs) have posed major threat to human existence, sustainable growth and development; hence, 
there is need to reduce GHGs (Olanrewaju and Mbohwa 2017). Countries from both Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) & Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) emit about 80% of 
the world’s GHGs(Olanrewaju and Mbohwa 2017). As one of the most industrialized countries in the world, energy 
is core to the manufacturing process in China; as energy is a key player in industrialization(Olanrewaju 2018b) which 
will result in high production of GHGs; particularly for the case of China due to population and manufacturing 
activities (Olanrewaju 2019; Khobai and Le Roux 2017). China is one of the highest CO2 emitters in the world, next 
to the United States of America (Khobai and Le Roux 2017; Scientists 2022) as shown in Figure 1. China’s GHG 
emission will continue to increase and probably increase to four-fold by 2050 as the country’s economy grows and 
population increases, except carbon emission factors greatly improves and appropriate strategies are carefully 
employed (Winkler et al. 2011). Hence, carbon emission is one of the country’s major problems. This has resulted in 
the development of various studies, policies and targets (Olanrewaju 2018a).

Figure 11. Decoupling efforts of decomposition results of change in CCEMI based on short-term plan, 2001-2020 
5.11 Proposed Improvements 
In the next phase of this study, scenario analyses will be conducted to examine prospective characteristics of the 
CCEMI from 2021 to 2035. Another future study could be sensitivity analyses across three-time ranges, before the 
study period, during the study period and after the study period. Also, Data Envelopment Analyses could be conducted 
to assess reduction potential of CCEMI. Finally, Artificial Neural Network could be introduced into the study to 
further deepen analyses. Any of the following analyses or combination will serve as a good improvement on this work.    
 
6. Conclusion 
With the help of IPCC’s Reference Approach and primary energy consumption data of China’s Manufacturing sector, 
CCEMI, 2001-2020 is computed. The five (5) factors driving CCEMI are quantified by additive LMDI decomposition 
method. Next, the decomposition of Tapio decoupling analyses of CCEMI from GDP is conducted. To deepen the 
study, both analyses are done based on a three terms plan: long, medium, and short. From the results in Figure 5 and 
Figure 9, activity effect is the main enhancing factor while energy intensity is the main inhibiting factor to change in 
CCEMI and its decoupling from GDP. On the other hand, from the results of Figures. 6, 7, 10 and 11, the main 
enhancing factor of CCEMI and its decoupling are activity effect and carbon emission factor while the main inhibiting 
factors are intensity effect and structure effect. From Figures. 7 and 11, 2020 experienced a downward trend in CCEMI 
and an improved decoupling level due to COVID-19. The sector’s decoupling status is Expansive Coupling that is 
much closer to Expansive negative decoupling compared to Weak decoupling as depicted in Table 2. Also, the results 
in Table 3 shows a deteriorating decoupling level in the first three 5-year plans and improved a bit in the last 5-year 
plan, however it is still at Expansive negative decoupling status; and from Figure 8, decoupling level is mainly 
Expansive negative decoupling, followed by Expansive coupling and Weak decoupling across the study period. 
Overall, CCEMI and decoupling are deteriorating, especially during the second half of the study period. To improve 
on the declining environmental condition for sustainable development, there is need for policy to reduce fossil-fuel 
share in the energy mix, this will substitute fossil-fuel with clean and renewable energy.

Abstract 
This paper aims to analyze and review the most recent scientific literature regarding the implementation of Machine 
Learning (ML) in Supply Chain Management (SCM). Moreover, an examination was conducted to find out what areas 
and industries were addressed in the use cases, and how ML may impact SCM. A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) 
was conducted for this purpose. It was found that the applied examples mainly used ML's prediction capabilities, and 
some industries such as health care and logistics were the main focus areas. Then, discussions were developed based 
on the results of the systematic literature analysis, which can be used as motivation for future research.

Introduction 
Supply Chain (SC) and SCM 
Russell & Taylor (2019) defines SC as “the facilities, functions, and activities involved in producing and delivering a 
product or service from suppliers (and their suppliers) to customers (and their customers).” SCM has become a key 
strategy for managing quality, satisfying customers, and maintaining competitiveness in the face of globalization and 
the evolution of information technology. An SC is an overview of all activities involved in the flow and transformation 
of goods and services from raw materials to the end user (customer), including the information flows that accompany 
it. All the assets, information, and processes that provide supply are referred to as the supply chain. In addition to raw 
material suppliers, it includes suppliers of parts and components, suppliers of subassemblies, producers and 
distributors of products and services, and finally customers. Suppliers, such as raw material suppliers, are the first link 
in the chain. In the supply chain, upstream players are known as suppliers, whereas downstream players are 
distributors, warehouses, and eventual end-users. Flows of goods and services (i.e., demand) represent the flow of 
goods and services as the SC moves downstream.  (Figure 1.1.)  (Russell & Taylor 2019, p. 416). A SC is primarily 
focused on increasing a customer's willingness to pay for the product or service. Considering this challenge, efficiency 
improvements to the SC process are inevitable (Sarkar & Kim 2021a).

demand forecasting using ML algorithms in modern SCM systems. Forecasting demand can also improve the 
sustainability of SCM models and increase environmental effects (Sardar et al. 2021). Based on the results, the ML 
models were able to effectively predict various risks during the SCM process (Abbasi et al. 2020b; Han & Zhang, 
2020; Wei 2022b). However, evaluating the prediction of mixed risks can reveal some gaps between predicted and 
actual results (Li  2022).  
 
To improve SCM systems efficiency, many researchers are combining ML with other disruptive technologies.  
Blockchain technology has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. It was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 and 
is based on his consensus protocol. It is primarily designed to store the historical log of transactions for the well-
known cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin (Abbas et al. 2020c). Research on the benefits of SC networks under IoT 
technology is another interdisciplinary topic as SC networks are becoming larger and larger. Based on the complexity 
and evolution of SC networks, ML algorithms can be used to analyze IoT modes of service. RFID technology, EDI 
technology, and enterprise resource planning ERP are among these modes of service (Yuan et al. 2022; Li et al. 2022a).  
 
RQ3 
During the study period, the most notable occurrence was Pandemic Covid 19. While the quarantine measures and 
virus have not directly affected factories in a particular area, it is still possible that the raw material is captured by the 
area where the virus was discovered. Due to the complex SC across the world, the crisis, which has taken over half of 
the world, is likely to affect the rest of the region as well. The effects of this crisis have led many researchers in recent 
years to focus on the pharmaceutical, medical, and other service industries (Chaubey et al. 2022; Abbasi et al. 2020d).  
Several other industries were also studied, including shipping (Wong et al., 2021), manufacturing, e-commerce, and 
offline sales (Li et al. 2022b). 
 
Proposed Improvements 
Every country on every continent is affected by climate change. Lives are being affected and national economies are 
disrupted. Companies are implementing new approaches to reduce the rise of global temperatures this century below 
pre-industrial levels in response to climate change. The SCM process is also moving toward sustainability as a critical 
part of the industrial process. ML and digital transformation can greatly enhance SC sustainability. Yet, only a few 
research papers have explored ML's role in green SC management. The potential of this topic can be explored in future 
studies.  
 
The predictive power of ML models has been applied in many studies to increase the efficiency of supply chains and 
manage possible risks. In most cases, however, only simple risks are accurately predicted with high accuracy. Finding 
the most accurate ML models to predict more complicated risks with more variables could also be a potential topic 
for future studies. 
 
Conclusion 
ML in SCM research for the past 6 years is summarized in this paper. Furthermore, this systematic review highlights 
current trends, opportunities, challenges, and future ideas for ML in SCM. There have been 13 articles published 
between 2016 and 2022 that have been reviewed comprehensively in the paper. Throughout the last few years, there 
have been numerous challenges in applying and adapting technologies to SCM, the need for a balanced approach to 
their use, and ultimately, their potential to drive sustainability. Studies can also be conducted in the future to address 
more complex risks that SCM systems deal with.

Abstract 
The United States manufacturing sector has managed to remain an impressive and productive sector in the country 
and globally owing to the U.S. government’s support in matters of manufacturing. Due to the increasing use of 
sophisticated technological advancements that streamline operations and standardize product quality and quantity, the 
manufacturing sector in the U.S. produces exceptional output. Technological advances in the U.S. manufacturing 
sector enable manufacturers to remain competitive in an aggressive business environment and profitable amid stiff 
competition. Moreover, technological advances streamline communication processes along supply chains, enabling 
manufacturers to better serve their customers. The enormous potential of these technologies to rescue economies from 
recession and other economic obstacles makes it almost inevitable that the future of manufacturing in the U.S. will be 
promising. However, automation and innovative technologies have not been easy on the manufacturing workforce for 
the obvious reason that they tend to replace human labor. As a result, people who have been integrated into the 
manufacturing sector are either laid off or completely frustrated, and those who are still integrated receive low wages. 
Because of this, the manufacturing industry's employment prospects appear dim because machines receive more 
attention than human resources. The Covid-19 pandemic had crippling effects on U.S. manufacturing by dramatically 
hiking prices of raw materials and finished goods, altering delivery schedules and demand patterns. Manufacturers 
resorted to low inventory to avoid losses. The sudden demand spike caused by the pandemic caught manufacturers off 
guard, disrupting supply chains and weakening the sector. That said, it is critical that the government of the U.S. 
increase its efforts to enhance the manufacturing sector and protect it from unforeseen occurrences that could 
jeopardize the sector's progress to date, both locally and internationally.

U.S. Manufacturing: History and Current Status 
Introduction 
The term ""manufacturing"" refers to the physical, mechanical, or transformation of raw materials into new goods. 
Manufacturing has always played a significant role in the U.S. GDP. Prior to being overtaken by China in 2010, the 
U.S. had the largest manufacturing sector in the world. China takes first place in manufacturing, accounting for 28.4% 
of global manufacturing, according to the US Statistics Division. U.S. manufacturing accounts for 16.6% of global 
manufacturing, following China. The United States' history of manufacturing can be traced back to the 19th-century 
Industrial Revolution. There were new manufacturing techniques introduced. The process of producing goods by hand 
was replaced by machine-aided manufacturing during the industrial revolution. 
During the Industrial Revolution, more finished goods were produced because more people used machines. The world 
has experienced four industrial revolutions from the 19th century to the present. The fourth industrial revolution (IR 
4.0) is still ongoing which includes the digital, biological, and physical worlds. The first industrial revolution was 
marked using water and steam power to mechanize production. Several notable productions made use of electric power 
during the second revolution. During the third industrial revolution, electronics and information technology were used 
to automate production. The digital revolution, also known as IR 4.0, began in the middle of the 20th century. It 
enabled remarkable technological advancement, including the Internet of Things (IoT), robotics, artificial intelligence

quality infrastructure, which makes sure manufactured goods get from the plant stations to consumers without any 
problems. This keeps perishable and fragile goods from getting damaged. Additionally, the U.S. has a favorable 
regulatory environment that does not compromise the manufacturing sector even when there are disagreements in 
parliament regarding manufacturing issues. This level of political stability has continued to play a crucial role in 
ensuring the continued existence of manufacturing operations in the U.S. for the subsequent benefit of the nation and 
the world as well (West & Lansang  2018c). 
 
The U.S. manufacturing sector has the reputation of a sector graced by rapid productivity improvements over the 
years, whereby its spectacular performance is mostly attributable to the subsector of computers and electronics. 
Despite everything, it has been noted with tremendous regret that there is a significant decline in U.S. manufacturing 
employment, whereby machines and other sophisticated technological advances replace human labor. Expectedly, this 
has had devastating effects on workers because it implies that they would be subjected to a personal financial crisis 
owing to affected remunerations, which, by extension, affects their households as well. It is important to note that 
when such ripple effects are felt across a large population, many people's incomes would be affected, which would 
have an impact on the U.S. economy (Baily & Bosworth  2014a). 
 
The U.S. manufacturing sector, although performs exemplarily well, has proven to have its limitations, especially with 
the recent full-swing wave of Covid-19 which endangered progress that had already been made. Covid-19 disoriented 
the U.S. manufacturing sector by promoting unprecedented delivery delays, distorting demand patterns, hiking prices 
of raw materials and finished goods, etc., all of which had a paralyzing effect on supply chains nationally. Given the 
intensity with which the U.S. manufacturing sector was affected by the devastating global pandemic, it could be argued 
that the sector is not as strong as it should be. Post-COVID-19 was equally dramatic in the U.S. manufacturing sector, 
whereby staggering demand patterns that were resuscitated once again had a crippling effect on the supply chains. 
This is because manufacturers were already accustomed to stocking little inventory after supply exceeded demand. As 
a result, when COVID-19 appeared to slow down, manufacturers claimed to have been caught off guard by the 
dramatic buying behavior of consumers (Helper & Soltas  2022c). 
 
The future of U.S. manufacturing appears promising, depending on the angle with which this is analyzed. For the 
manufacturing workforce, the future could be argued to appear bleak because new technological advancements are 
likely to keep replacing human labor (Baily & Bosworth  2014b). This prediction is likely to remain viable unless the 
U.S. government rises to the occasion to cushion its citizens from unemployment. When analyzing the future of U.S. 
manufacturing from the perspective of manufacturing output, it could be argued that the future is promising because 
with increased technological advances would come more manufacturing output in terms of quality and quantity, owing 
to the potential of machines to vitalize product quality and quantity. 
 
Conclusion 
U.S. manufacturing performs exemplarily well compared to other sectors in the U.S. and provides more revenue for 
the U.S. government. U.S. manufacturing also does well on the international plane by emerging second in terms of 
manufacturing output after China. U.S. manufacturers now have a competitive advantage in competitive business 
environments thanks to technological advancements that have enabled them to achieve greater success. It was 
unfortunate to witness the extent to which the Covid-19 global pandemic frustrated the U.S. manufacturing sector by 
having a crippling effect on supply chains. In this respect, it is imperative that the U.S. government invests more in 
the manufacturing sector to make it more ready to deal with future unanticipated catastrophes that threaten this 
invaluable sector. On the same note, it is important that the government invests in ensuring that employment in the 
manufacturing sector is revitalized to continue benefitting ordinary citizens whose sole reliance is on the income they 
derive from the manufacturing sector. When this happens, it is inevitable that the future of the U.S. manufacturing 
sector would become promising across all domains, be it through employment or with regard to the economy.

Abstract 
This paper reviews safety safety measures and safety culture and uses them as the basis for a new and more practical 
construction named 'safety orientation'. Factors and items from the scale reviewed are related to factor names and 
importance, reliability, and validity. The analysis shows that researchers have found it difficult to move from the 
exploratory stage to the confirmation and causal stage which allows agreement on industry standards that can be used 
as benchmarks. Safety orientation is safety as an operational construct of safety culture and as a first step towards 
more practical instruments for safety benchmarking, so that strategy improvements can be implemented.

Abstract 
Penetration of Internet use especially access to social media in Indonesia, continues to increase year by year. Social 
media is one of the media that is considered by the public to buy goods or services. No exception in the selection of 
investment products. Many financial service providers promote the advantages of their investment products through 
social media, one of the providers is Pegadaian, whose product is Gold Saving. This research aims to see the influence 
of social media marketing conducted by Pegadaian againts brand awareness, brand trust and purchase intention. The 
data on this research was obtained from respondents who were social media followers of Instagram Pegadaian as much 
as 400 people. All data collected has fulfilled the criteria of validity and reliability. Researchers use SEM using 
SmartPLS. The results obtained from this research are social media marketing have a positive and significant effect 
on brand awareness, brand trust and purchase intention. Beside that, it has a positive and significant effect on purchase 
intention through brand awareness and brand trust. This research is expected to provide more effective evaluation and 
marketing strategy for companies, as well as being able to complement scientific knowledge and references in the 
field of marketing.

1. Introduction
The phenomenon of an increasing number of people interested in investing in gold digitally indicates a high level of 
trust in companies providing these products. Several things strengthen this statement, that is several product provider 
companies do not have offline stores or fully run their business online so that consumers only depend on the 
applications they use. For example, with the Pluang company, even though it has only appeared on the Indonesian 
market since 2019 and received official permission in early 2022, Pluang is able to convince the public to use its 
digital gold investment product, up to 6.5 million people have been recorded as Pluang customers. Pluang was also 
able to convince several large marketplaces in Indonesia to establish partnerships as digital channels in marketing 
their products. Similar to Pegadaian, since releasing a digital gold savings product in 2015 and obtaining official 
permission from the OJK regarding this product in 2016, Pegadaian has been recorded as having succeeded in 
convincing up to 7.8 million people to use this digital product until December 2021. If you look at it more detailed 
marketing strategy carried out by this company, both of which focus on marketing through digital, utilizing websites 
and social media to market their products to the public. 
Pegadaian's gold savings product has entered the age of seven years since it was first launched in 2015. Based on the 
results of a comparison of the overall performance of Pegadaian's products, gold savings has performed better than 
other products. Gold Savings has a total of 7.8 million customers. Many factors influence the results of this data, the 
most important of which is because this gold savings is an investment product that has more enthusiasts with a more 
general and broader target market when compared to the target market for other products. Although many have 
advantages such as having awards won by Pegadaian to create trust and also having carried out many marketing 
activities to increase brand awareness, both offline and online through various social media platforms, and one of them

Abstract 
The paper reviews the impact of biogas use in rural communities in Zimbabwe. A comparative study 
between the use of firewood and the use of biogas can be done. The paper discusses the historical 
developments in the use of biogas to date. The use and cost of energy and power is assessed to identify 
options to replace with biogas. Possible replacement of natural gas and firewood usage is also considered. 
The different and main feed stocks for biogas are discussed with a view to determine feed stock options for 
Zimbabwe. The challenges around the use of human waste for biogas are examined in terms of perceptions 
and cultural aspects. A case for biogas use is developed to justify the need to use it since it is a renewable 
energy. The production of biogas in bio-digesters and biogas plants in different parts of the world is 
considered to provide possible benchmarks. A discussion of the climate change impacts of biogas use and 
the mitigation options are presented. Finally, research gaps are identified paving way for future studies. The 
proposed future studies will focus on these reviewed aspects and research gaps with a view to fully study 
the impacts of the use of biogas in rural communities in Zimbabwe.

Introduction and background 
The Flemist and physiologist Jan Baptist van Helmont discovered biogas in 1630. The gas was coming 
from decomposing organic matter through combustion process. It is a mixture of primarily methane, carbon 
dioxide and hydrogen (Bond  2011). The gas is flammable. The first biogas digester construction took place 
in 1859 in Bombay, India. Thereafter, the Victorian England used sewer gasses for streets lights. German 
started feeding biogas into public gas supply in 1920 and built large agricultural biogas plant that initially 
operated in 1950. In 1970s, the use of biogas gained momentum when there was high oil cost that led to 
alternative energy sources (Ni and Nyns 1996). China promoted biogas use in all rural families and 
facilitated installation of more than seven million digesters (He  2010). The government of china subsidies 
the construction of nearly four million family sized biogas plant (Indian government 2007).  
The cost of other source of energy is very high, as global demand for energy is increasing daily hence there 
is decreasing availability of fossil fuels. However, most of the countries are experiencing load shading and 
availability of grid electricity is now a big concern worldwide especially in developing countries (BMUB 
2017). In 21 Sub Saharan countries, for example 10% of Zimbabwean population has access to electricity. 
Zimbabwe generates about 1300 megawatts (MW) hence its requirement is 2200 MW. It imports 100MW 
from Zambia, 300MW from South Africa, Eskom and 40MW from Mozambique in 2012 (BMUB 2017). 
According to energy policies and management, the world market energy utilization was forecasted to 
increase by 44% between 2006 and vision 2030 (Thran et al. 2018). Greater population of developing 
countries depend on firewood and by so doing thus leading to deforestation and desertification (Yakubu

Abstract 
The Philippines is one of the Asian countries most vulnerable to natural disasters according to Climate Change 
Vulnerability Index, and has been under the Pacific Typhoon Belt due to its location. As a result, the Philippines is 
highly vulnerable to typhoons and flooding. Tarlac, a province in the Philippines, is a frequently flooded location due 
to its geographic features. With this, this study aimed to assess the service quality of La Paz Tarlac LGU's disaster 
response by analyzing the underlying factors that explain the correlational pattern between a set of measured variables 
using SPSS software . The researchers evaluated this by getting the points of view of both LGU employees and 
residents of the area. Through Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the complex information in multi-criterion decision-
making was dealt with. As a result, the alternative solutions with the most significant weight among others for each 
criterion are as follows: “Standard Operating Procedure on Disaster Management,” “Drill and Trainings,” and “New 
and Improved Disaster Reduction Technologies,” respectively. By clustering variables, factor 1 is linked with the 
Efficiency of LGU’s Disaster Response. The second aspect relates to the Readiness of LGU Personnel for Disaster 
Operations. Factor 3 is connected with Effective Disaster Plan Dissemination.

1. Introduction
According to the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, disasters affect approximately 100 million young 
people, including children, each year. Natural catastrophes kill an estimated 45,000 people worldwide, accounting for 
an average of 0.1% of all deaths during the last decade, ranging from 0.01 to 0.4%. Since the 1980s, the total number 
of disasters has nearly doubled. The 2020 Ecological Threat Register (ETR) reveals that since the 1960s, the number 
of natural disasters has increased by 10. The world had the most significant number of natural disasters in 2005, with 
442 events, more than 90,000 fatalities, and 160 million people needing immediate assistance. Disasters can hit any 
country, regardless of economic standing; however, underdeveloped countries suffer the worst consequences. 
Developing countries have limited capacity to plan for calamities and emergencies and deal with disasters when they 
occur (Al Kurdi 2021).  
The Philippines has been named one of the Asian countries most vulnerable to natural disasters by the Climate Change 
Vulnerability Index. Due to its geographical location, the country is under the Pacific Typhoon Belt. As a result, the 
Philippines is highly vulnerable to cyclonic storms and flooding. During the wet season, when the country is most 
susceptible to floods, the country experiences an average of 19-20 typhoon occurrences per year (Kurata et al. 2022). 
Its location within the Pacific Ring of Fire makes it even more vulnerable to disasters. With numerous disasters

operations. 
 
For SOP on disaster management, it can improve the efficiency of LGU’s disaster response through standardization 
of procedures during emergencies and would increase disaster preparedness of the research locale. According to Chang 
et al. (2019), disaster response is substantial in ensuring that the possible risk of losses during a disaster is reduced. 
The study also mentioned that the absence of standard operating procedures when it comes to disaster could negatively 
impact the number of victims during a disaster since it may lead to improper management of the situation. In this case, 
it is highly recommended that the LGU of La Paz, Tarlac establish an SOP for disaster management to increase service 
efficiency.  
 
Moreover, the drills and training about disaster preparedness is another solution proposed by the researchers to 
increase the readiness of LGU personnel for disaster operations. According to Liu et al. (2020), initiatives like training 
will encourage rapid response and effective coordination among staff and involved departments  during an emergency 
situation. With this, drills and training will be beneficial for the LGU personnel to execute disaster operations 
effectively. It will also maximize task delegation for its departments so that they can fully accommodate the needs of 
residents and reduce the losses in the aftermath of a disaster. 
 
Lastly, the mobile application, ALPAS, will increase the effectiveness of disseminating the municipal’s disaster plan 
among its residents. Through the app, they can educate people on how to react to emergency operations through the 
provided guidelines initially. The LGU officials in-charge of rescue operations can also easily locate the residents who 
are in need amidst a disaster. Maximizing technology to increase the community's disaster resilience is another aspect 
of the LGU’s service that needs to be considered.

Abstract 
The target of current work is to cut off the cost of solar energy systems by using weather forecasting to predict energy 
production and implementing energy management measures to optimize the use of energy and reduce the need for 
energy storage. For standalone systems, this can include reducing the number of PV panels and battery banks, while 
still ensuring that there is enough energy to meet user needs. The energy management system you describe monitors 
the power level of the storage elements and adaptively controls switching to minimize the number of panels and battery 
banks needed. For grid-connected systems, the goal is to calculate the energy produced by the system and use that 
information to arrive at a zero-balance bill, considering the user's daily and nighttime energy consumption. The 
proposed energy management procedures are designed to reduce costs by optimizing the use of energy. the percentage 
of cost reduction has been determined for both types of systems.

1. Introduction
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has a high reliance on non-renewable energy sources, particularly oil, to meet its 
energy needs. However, there are several reasons why it is important for the UAE to shift to renewable energy: 
The UAE has a hot and arid climate, which makes it well-suited for solar energy. Solar energy is a clean, renewable, 
and abundant energy source that can help the UAE reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Also, the cost of the renewable 
energy the cost of renewable energy has been decreasing in recent years, making it more competitive with traditional 
fossil fuels. And solar energy, in particular, has dropped dramatically over the last decade. The price of solar panels 
has fallen by more than 85% since 2010, making solar power one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy. 
The cost of building new utility-scale solar power plants is now competitive with the cost of building new fossil fuel 
power plants in many parts of the world. The cost related highly with the amount of energy must be produced; 
therefore, the area will need more and more. So, to make the reduction forwarding and make the solar energy suitable 
for all people by making the system smarter via involve weather forecast and energy management system to increase 
the cost of PV models.

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
The system of reducing the energy is based on the weather of the day, are more specific on the energy will reach to 
power the house, therefor to be the whole system user friendly by build an application based on mobile phone, to 
check by the costumer the energy generated, if there need to save energy or not, if yes, which appliance will w turn it 
off? All of those will be answered by the application. the Figure 11 shows a proposed message will send it by the 
application to check the plane of consume the energy.

6. Conclusion  
From the result of the analysis in the case study, the following conclusions were drawn: 
1. The two ways of construct the system are stand-alone solar system and grid-connected solar system; the stand-
alone from the name added storage device like the battery ad voltage regulator, while in grid-connected those 
two-equipment cancelled from the system, but that does not mean the cost pf grid-connected will be always lower 
than the stand-alone. 
2. The cost of implanting the system are depends into many factors, and they are divided into 3 main categories 
(Manufacturing parameters, Geographic parameters, Special parameter), so the location will be construct the 
system affect, the type of the devices will affect also, the lifespan of the PV, invertor, and other devices, and for 
the grid-connected the tariff of the electricity will affect the total price too. 
3. Weather forecasts play vital role of generation the energy, will make the user more aware of the way of consuming 
the energy, or to be controlled automatically by sensors using energy management system to control, monitor the 
power.

Abstract 
The time series forecasting method is a forecast that relies on quantitative past data to create a forecasting process. In 
the forecasting process, forecasters must determine the accuracy of forecasting methods before applying them by 
measuring forecast errors. It is measured by the difference between the forecasted values and the actual values. The 
method of error measurement is also an appropriate consideration to be used to make decisions on choosing effective 
forecasting methods. Therefore, this research presented in the first part of the article also aims to present a literature 
review of the relevant topic of error measurement in the forecasting method. In the second part of the article, to identify 
research gaps in the relevant literature review, it was found that the error measurement of the forecasting method had 
more than one error measurement method. The results of each error are contradictory, or the results are not in the same 
direction. This made it difficult to decide on a forecasting method to use. This is a research gap and led to the 
introduction of a conceptual model for developing a selection error measurement method to measure the effectiveness 
of the time series forecasting method. This results in the accuracy of the chosen forecasting method. The researcher 
has set the structure of the research method to be used as a research process and will be presenting research results in 
the future.

1. Introduction
Forecasting is the expectation or estimation of future states, or the forecast of actual value in a particular situations 
and circumstances. It is also defined as the estimation of the unbeknownst. Speaking of which, forecasting is the future 
estimation of the variables. It is utilized as a tool for decision making procedures and future plans. If a business is able 
to forecast future circumstances, it will be able to adjust its current operations for better future. 
Regarding common forecasting practices, the practices can be divided into two categories: qualitative forecasting and 
quantitative forecasting. Qualitative forecasting is a forecasting manner that does not require past information as a 
principle; judgement and experiences of the forecaster or person related to the matter will only be applied. This type 
of forecasting is aimed at determining basic changes; whereas quantitative forecasting requires past information as a 
fundamental to determine future situations. Statistical and mathematical models will be applied. A forecaster is to 
examine type of the data to be analyzed in the forecasting process, and select a forecasting method that best suits with 
the type of the data. Normally, accurate forecasting requires both qualitative and quantitative forecasting. Quantitative 
forecasting is an interesting model for the development of forecasting proficiency due to the factors that contribute to 
more accurate forecasting. With being said, time-series forecasting — a forecasting that relies on past quantitative 
data to establish forecasting process — is the simplest model to forecast quantitative demand as past data is the 
determination of what will happen in the future. The data will be arranged to make it appropriate with demand 
forecasting that differs over time. A practitioner can select a wide range of forecasting techniques that are suited best 
with the application. The selection of forecasting techniques must be determined based on the proficiency of the 
techniques prior to the application by calculate forecasting errors. The process is done so by comparing deviation

determined quantitative datasets from the Industrial Statistics, the National Statistical Office, in the next step.  
4.7 Examining datasets with the implementation of error analyses: The test was conducted by  
putting the dataset into forecasting procedures and the errors would be calculated based on each of their respective 
group (Figure 1). The results were used to determined errors, leading to the selection of appropriate error analysis for 
such a dataset.  
4.8 Creating patterns for the selection of error analyses: The test results were used to design and  
create patterns for the selection of error analyses to be implemented on the time-series forecasting, leading to effective 
selection of forecasting methods. 
 
5. Conclusion 
From the review of literatures and associated studies of the error analyses to determine the effectiveness of forecasting 
techniques, mostly, the implementation of more than one error analyses and the results are usually conflicting, rarely 
moving onto the same directions. This makes difficult for the selection of forecasting techniques, leading to a research 
gap. This study is the first part of content that presents the review of literatures and associated studies to fill the 
research gap and lead to the concepts towards the improvement of the selection of suitable error analyses for time-
series forecasting. This paves ways to the accuracy rates of the selected forecasting techniques. The researcher, 
therefore, specifies this research structure for use as research procedures for the next presentation of the and research 
results shall be presented in the next issue.

Abstract 
Ergonomics studies how people interact with other system components, thus ensuring that the task and individual are 
compatible. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are the leading causes of poor ergonomics. Meanwhile, ABC Oil Mill 
is a producer of coconut oil and copra cake. Manual copra cake handling was one of the processes being observed in 
the company and chosen due to most workers encountering MSDs such as fatigue, back pain, shoulder pain, etc. The 
researchers used different ergonomic assessments such as the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA), Rapid Entire 
Body Assessment (REBA), and the Washington Industrial Safety and Health Act (WISHA) lifting analysis. Based on 
the result, REBA had a final score of seven (7), while RULA resulted in a score of ten (10), with an equivalent of 
High Risk, indicating that the process must be investigated, and change must be implemented. Moreover, the WISHA 
results show that the lifting index is greater than 1, denoting a high risk in the process. From the ergonomic assessment 
results, the researchers have developed a design of copra cake lifting equipment. Using the anthropometric data of the 
workers, some of the highlights of the designs are: (1) it is maneuverable with an adjustable platform; (2) with push 
buttons for the lift; and (3) with a motor that helps to lift the sacks.

1. Introduction
ABC Oil Mill is a company located in the center of Quezon Province – part of  the region considered as one of the 
leading coconut producers in the Philippines (Philippine Statistics Authority 2022). One of their by-products is the 
copra cake which is the residue left after oil is physically extracted from copra (dried coconut kernels). The process 
of extracting the oil begins with grinding and heating copra to reduce excessive moisture; using an expeller machine, 
colorless oil is then extracted from the flakes producing copra cakes that contain about 7% of oil. Hexane can be used 
to further extract the remaining oil, resulting in copra cakes with less than 3.5% oil by weight. These cakes are valued 
and commonly used as livestock feed.  
Workers in ABC Oil Mill use shovels to scrape up and store the copra cakes in sacks. Each sack, weighing an average 
of 40 kilograms, is manually lifted into trucks for transport. According to a study by Azevedo et al. (2012), when 
performing a bi-manual whole-body lifting task while holding a load, the center of mass shifts forward, placing stress 
on the dynamic balance control and impeding the continuous extension action, which results to a disruption in the 
internal equilibrium. Manually lifting heavy loads may affect postural balance, increasing the risk of falling, 
discomfort, and injury.  
In addition to the lack of reliable manual lifting tools, the workers at the oil mill were not properly oriented about the 
ideal lifting postures to reduce discomfort and health risks. Their working conditions show potential factors that can 
lead to the development of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) such as sprains, strains, back discomfort, 
hernia, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Such musculoskeletal problems, due to awkward postures and prolonged periods

The researchers used a Modified Likert Scale wherein the level of agreement of each respondent to the statements was 
measured. Statements were designed to assess the functionality, efficiency, and cost of the proposed ergonomic copra 
cake lifting equipment. According to the survey (see Table 14), the respondents showed strong agreement that the 
proposed equipment is functional in terms of reducing ergonomic risks and discomfort in the handling of copra cake 
sacks, efficient in terms of increasing workers’ productivity and reducing the difficulty of the task, and cost effective. 
4. Conclusion
Based on the findings of the ergonomic assessments (RULA, REBA, and WISHA Lifting Analysis) and initial 
observations at the ABC Oil Mill, the researchers have determined the existing risk factors (high lifting index, high 
repetition, improper posture, and excessive physical exertion) that compromises the health and safety of workers who 
are exposed to manual lifting of heavy loads of copra cake. The actual root cause of the discomfort, usually manifesting 
as muscle pain, through a series of why-why analysis and root cause validation in collaboration with the selected 
workers with direct experience to the task. The lack of effective lifting equipment was found to be the major issue that 
contributes to high risk of developing WMSDs among the workers at the oil mill. 
To address the problem, the researcher integrated various tools and techniques in designing the ergonomic copra cake 
lifting equipment. Anthropometric measurements of the workers and ergonomic principles were integrated to specify 
the features and dimensions of the lifting equipment. The proposed equipment has the following new and improved 
functions: high maneuverability/portability, an adjustable lifting platform, an electrical motor to support the lift 
through a pulley system, a manual pedal), and an improved handle. Using the ergonomic lifting equipment, there has 
been a reduction in the number of absences of workers due to experienced back and shoulder pain. Efficiency also 
increased; the number of required workers in the manual lifting task was reduced from two to one, while also 
increasing the average lifts per minute from one sack of copra cake to two sacks – suggesting an increase in 
productivity. The workers were able to avoid additional expenses associated with availing remedies to alleviate the 
pain that they experienced before after performing the task without the use of the lifting equipment. Meanwhile, the 
respondents of the survey assessing the acceptability of the proposed equipment showed strong agreement that the 
proposed equipment is effective in eliminating risk factors and improving worker performance in lifting copra cake 
sacks. 
The study benefits the workers and owners at ABC Oil Mill by improving their current process and promoting health 
and safety in their workplace. Developing the ergonomic copra cake lifting equipment highlights the significance of 
using ergonomic tools and equipment to reduce risk factors that contribute to the development of WMSDs, as well as 
to boost the productivity and performance of workers through the improved working conditions. For future studies, 
the researchers recommend the use of other in-depth assessments and measurement tools to further improve the overall 
design and specifications of the equipment; it is also important to consider other factors (e.g. environmental factors) 
that may have direct effect on the performance and well-being of the workers.

Abstract 
This study discusses the soft drink supply chain sustainability, which includes the production of carbonated soft drinks 
made from carbonated water, flavors, and sweetened with a non-nutritive sweetener or sugar, their packaging, storage, 
and distribution. The study targeted three soft drink companies in Kuwait, to successfully identify sustainability 
problems relating to the three pillars of sustainability in the companies’ supply chains. We used the identification of 
the problem; analysis; design; evaluation of alternatives; and implementation approach in the project design. To 
identify the sustainability problems in these companies, a list of questions and an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) 
questionnaire were sent to them. The answers to the questions/and the AHP questionnaire revealed a packaging and 
water waste problem. As a solution methodology, we first implemented benchmarking to identify industry best 
practices in the soft drink industry. As a solution to the water waste problem, after conducting a feasibility analysis, 
reverse osmosis (RO; as compared to ultrafiltration) was chosen as the best sustainable water recycling method; as it 
has a longer life span than ultrafiltration. As a solution to the packaging problem, when analyzing between rPET and 
PlantBottle, rPET was chosen because it is less costly. Moreover, a simulation of RO was conducted using Arena 
software for a real-life illustration. Lastly, to illustrate the benefit of the sustainability initiatives, a multiple regression 
model was built by collecting data from the Refinitiv database. The regression results showed that there is a U-shaped 
relationship between the firm value and environmental sustainability performance.

1. Introduction
Supply chain activities involve the sourcing of products from raw materials and semi-finished parts, all the way to the 
assembly and production, then, packaging, storage, and distribution to the stores, and finally delivering to customers. 
Sustainability is defined as satisfying the needs of the present without compromising the future generation's ability to 
satisfy their needs. In this respect, it applies to both manufacturing and service supply chains as well as applies to a 
broad spectrum of different industries. As part of the bigger Consumer Non-Cyclicals economic sector, soft drink 
companies do the most environmental damage in the food and beverage industry (Lau  2022), and this comes down to 
two main reasons. The first reason is that the packaging of many soft drinks is not recyclable. Even if it is, consumers 
find it difficult to recycle them. For example, when visiting a beach, you can instantly spot many different soft drink 
bottles and cans that have been littered, and that surely isn’t doing any good to the environment. The second reason 
that soft drink companies are damaging to the environment, is due to the water waste that comes from manufacturing 
soft drinks. Water isn’t just used to create the drink that gets consumed, it is also used and wasted in huge amounts in 
the cleaning processes, and other processes. 
To correctly identify the problem, we visited some soft drink companies in Kuwait to understand their sustainability 
issues. We asked each one of the three companies about their sustainable practices through a questionnaire: an AHP 
survey and a list of questions. The answers are collected and analyzed. We noticed that all three companies have 
sustainability issues regarding packaging and water treatment.Kuwait relies solely on desalination as a water retrieval 
technique. However, with its rapid population growth, per capita water consumption is increasing. As reported by

the five stages of reverse osmosis where all the contaminants are removed from the water. The simulation shows that 
25% of water is cleaned in the reverse osmosis filters, resulting in 20L out of 80L that gets cleaned. 
 
Figure 5.  Arena Simulation after Implementing RO 
 
6. Conclusion 
To conclude, we were able to successfully fulfill the objectives of satisfying the United Nations Goals by reducing 
packaging waste, and water waste. 25% of water waste was saved through the RO technique. The methods were 
suggested to the soft drink companies and are being implemented in the future. Continuous checkups will be done to 
further test the companies’ abilities to adapt to these sustainable practices. In the end, since the food and beverage 
industry is causing a lot of environmental damage, it is our ethical and professional responsibility to find methods to 
make this industry more sustainable. 
The feasibility study showed that rPET is a better choice for the packaging issue, as benchmarking showed 
that it is already being used by other international companies around the world. The study also showed that RO is a 
better choice for water treatment as it removes more contaminants than ultrafiltration and that it has a longer lifespan 
as well. Arena simulation also proved that RO does in fact save 25% of feed water that goes into the system. By 
conducting a feasibility analysis, choosing between alternative solutions, creating a real-life simulation of water 
treatment, and conducting a regression analysis, we were able to find several different methods of evidence that prove 
that there is always a way to become more sustainable. Finally, analysis of the ESG data also showed that there is a 
U-shaped relationship between firm value and Environmental pillar score. This means the firms need to continue with 
the Environmental initiatives by following up with the results and this will have a sustained effect on the firm value.

Abstract 
Upstream Oil and Gas (O&G) companies that operate brownfield assets with aging surface facilities experience 
challenges in managing their base-business operations.  Companies must manage the increasing challenges of 
maintaining equipment reliability, integrity, and operational safety. The high quality and timely decision to take 
necessary action for the operation and maintenance of the aging facilities becomes very critical. The support from the 
comprehensive analytics approach to drive the decision-making capability also becomes very important.  The 
Digitalization and the adoption of Business Analytics (BA), such as Digital Twin, Computerized Maintenance 
Management System (CMMS), Big Data (BD), Artificial Intelligent (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning 
(DL), Decision Support Centre (DSC), become the option which is commonly growing in line with the increase of the 
investment in the BA adoption. There is a need to have a thorough evaluation or lookback to review whether those 
efforts on BA adoption have produced the promised solution, and returned the benefits of the investment that has been 
allocated. This paper is a research proposal that provides the introduction and background, the state-of-the-art and 
research gap identification, and the proposed methodology for the operationalization of the research. The research 
background and objectives are described, many previous studies are summarized and compared and finally, the 
methodology is proposed.

6. Conclusion
In the last 5 years, different kinds of novel BA Adoption and Impact have been proposed and numerous studies have 
been conducted to investigate. This paper systematically summarized a Literature and state-of-the-art review on the 
underlying theory, model and variables, capabilities, analytics aspect, and design and analysis methods. 
The research is important to better understand and explain how the BA (Descriptive, Prescriptive, Predictive 
Analytics) adoption will impact O&G Industry performance through facility integrated optimization, comprehensive 
maintenance, and reliable operation program, and assess the BA capabilities readiness to support the adoption. Having 
a better understanding of those two areas will benefit the development of a framework of BA Adoption. 
In general, there are 5 important stages in this research. The first stage is literature review and preparation of the SOTA 
table, the second stage is compiling the research methodology, the third stage is data collection and collection, the 
fourth stage is in-depth analysis and data analysis, and the fifth stage is compiling conclusions and recommendations.

Abstract 
This study examines the postures that put fisherfolk in Jala-Jala, Rizal at risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders 
and provide ergonomic solutions to improve their performance. Job demand analysis and interviews revealed the 
factors affecting fisherfolk's jobs. Mr. Basig, the agriculture sector representative in Jala-Jala Rizal, claimed that 90% 
of the 1,800 fisherfolk aged 40 to early 60s had hip and back pain. 60% of fisherfolk also get fish thorn cuts and stings 
when lifting nets. Analysis of Variance, Tukey Comparison Analysis, Pareto Chart, Root-Cause Analysis, Rapid 
Entire Body Assessment (REBA), and 5S Lean Methodology were used to conduct the investigation gradually. Thus, 
fisherfolk routinely pull and carry nets, scoop fish, and pull rope, which statistical study has proven to pose ergonomic 
dangers. The REBA Analysis classifies these three fishing activities as Action Level 4 high-risk. Therefore, the 
researchers conceptualized ergonomically designed fishing equipment as well as a working process layout that 
improves the working condition and lessens the physical discomfort of the fisherfolk. The designed equipment has 
given the researchers a degree of improvement in the posture of fisherfolk's top three activities by 47.50% in fishing 
net pulling and carrying, 46.15% in fish scooping, and 21.74% in rope pulling.

1. Introduction
The local fishing industry or aquaculture contributes significantly to the country's food security, employment 
opportunities, and national economy. The Philippine Statistics Authority (2016) reports that each Filipino consumes 
98.6 grams daily. It proved that the Philippines benefits greatly from the fishing industry because it provides a large 
portion of the country's requirement for animal protein, employs many people with the highest socioeconomic status, 
and generates a substantial amount of foreign currency. 
According to the findings of the Fourth European Working Conditions Survey, 35% of all workers, including skilled 
agricultural and fishery workers are particularly at risk due to repeated action, uncomfortable stances, and holding and 
relocating large objects for at least a quarter of their work schedule. These factors contribute to the development of 
musculoskeletal disorders. Moreover, as we look at or observe, the review and study of the occupational safety and 
health of workers in the fishing industry are still inconsequential in the country and that’s the factor why researchers 
thought about conducting this study.

Abstract 
Low Back Pain (LBP) is a common global musculoskeletal problem and has been the leading cause of 
disability among public transport drivers. The present design of motorized tricycles in the Philippines 
focuses more on aesthetics, neglecting the drivers' comfort, safety, and well-being. It is a concern that 
drivers' quality of life and transportation needs to be improved. The study aims to identify the ergonomic 
risk factors of LBP among tricycle drivers in the vicinity of the University of Santo Tomas-Manila. 
Moreover, this study will provide improvements and recommendations to prevent low back pain and 
provide convenience and comfort. The data was gathered through a questionnaire and analyzed through 
Ordinal Logistic Regression using SPSS statistical software. Further assessment was made on the 
significant factors affecting the lower back of the tricycle drivers. The results showed that the age, sitting 
height, and hip breadth measurements, and environmental conditions such as type of traffic and motor 
vibration significantly contributed to the LBP of the tricycle drivers. The findings implied that tricycle 
drivers are at risk of developing reduced well-being and comfort. A lifestyle modification for tricycle 
drivers and the establishment of procedures aimed to address the LBP were recommended.

1. Introduction
In the Philippines, the traditional tricycle is one of the most commonly used public transportation. A traditional tricycle 
is composed of a motorcycle connected to a passenger cab or commonly known as a sidecar. The tricycle's fare is 
cheap, and the tricycle itself is accessible, small, and can drop the passengers to their preferred destinations such as 
offices, schools, public markets, etc. However, the present design and construction of the tricycle focus more on 
aesthetics, which neglects the comfort, safety, and well-being of the commuters and even the drivers. According to 
Gumasing and Liao (2021) policies and regulations are absent regarding the Philippines' standard design of public 
vehicles. This lack of policies resulted in different designs and sizes of public vehicles. Based on the Philippine 
Statistics Authority (PSA) data as of 2021, there are 4,488,507 registered motorized tricycles in the country, and 
853,075 or 19% are from Metro Manila. In a 2021 analysis of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) by the World 
Health Organization (WHO), the approximate number of people with Musculoskeletal Disorders is 1.71 billion 
worldwide, and 369 million are from South-East Asia. Also, according to WHO, low back pain is the main contributor 
to MSD with 568 million people, fractures with 436 million people, osteoarthritis with 343 million, neck pain with 
222 million, and amputations with 175 million people. According to GBD, Low Back Pain (LBP) is a common global 
problem and still increasing every year. LBP  is defined as “pain in the area on the posterior aspect of the body from 
the lower margin of the twelfth ribs to the lower gluteal folds with or without pain referred into one or both lower

Abstract  
 
 Recent global environmental challenges have increased the demand for sustainable consumption and the use of green 
products around the world. One such example of green product is green cosmetics. The cosmetic industry is widely 
criticized for contributing to environmental and public health hazards due to the use of toxic chemicals. As a result, 
the manufacturing and distribution of eco-friendly cosmetics are receiving ongoing attention from both businesses and 
the markets. The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that influence customers inclination to purchase natural 
and organic cosmetics. A thorough assessment of the literature resulted in the identification of twelve distinct criteria 
and by using Factor Analysis these factors were reduced into three dimensions. A hierarchy was then established and 
AHP was used to come up with a comprehensive list of factors along with their degree of importance. The data for 
this study was gathered using a quantitative research approach and a total of 156 responses were obtained using an 
online questionnaire promoted through e-mails and social media platforms. This study adds to the knowledge base of 
managers on how they can encourage the use of green cosmetics and orient their strategies to address consumers 
environmental concerns.

1. Introduction  
The worldwide demand for natural and eco-friendly beauty products is growing. An increasing number of people are 
opting for healthier lifestyles and organic personal care products, as they become more aware of the risks posed by 
synthetic chemicals (Ghazali et al. 2017). A ""green product"" is generally characterized as a product that is not 
detrimental to the environment or society. Products that are more eco-friendly and ""green"" tend to be safer for

2701","green cosmetic products that demonstrate their concern for the environment. Because social media does not provide 
much information about green products and why they should be used, it has little influence on their purchase. 
 
6. Limitation, Future Scope and Conclusion  
Time and money were the most significant limitations placed on the study. More factors could have been taken into 
consideration, but only a small sample size was used for this research. In subsequent research, it may be possible to 
take into account a larger sample size in addition to an increased number of factors. Also, researchers might take into 
account a variety of research approaches, such as in order to determine ranks, important weights, and cause-and-effect 
relationships. The goal can be accomplished through the implementation of DEMATEL, VIKOR, and other similar 
analysis techniques. In the beginning, factors were found through a review of the relevant literature. In addition, the 
identified factors were refined after taking into account both the domain knowledge and the results of the literature 
review. The final step was to compile a list of the 12 factors that influence a person's intention to buy environmentally 
friendly cosmetics. Taking all of these considerations into account, a questionnaire was developed. The responses 
were obtained through the use of a simple random sampling method. A total of 156 responses were gathered from 
approximately 700 people who were questioned after they were approached. The gathered information was analyzed 
with SPSS 26.0 using factor analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and other statistical methods. Authors 
were able to identify a total of three principal components, which served as the basis for the subsequent development 
of the factor hierarchy. The three primary factors were the environmental, personal, and social factors. The study that 
was carried out will serve as a foundation for researchers in the future. The developed framework could be taken into 
consideration by subsequent researchers for the purpose of advancing research on topics related to purchase intention 
and environmentally friendly cosmetic products.

Abstract 
Development in the field of IT and competition in the market forces companies to increase their market share and 
revenue. To satisfy this goal, companies can apply and adopt plans that may lead to making the supply chain (SC) 
lengthy and too rigid to control/monitor. The longer the SC the more it can be disrupted by expected and unexpected 
events (e.g., Digital security incidents, climate). For that purpose, the SC must be built in a way to respond fast to 
disruptive events in an effective way and to bounce back to its original state to be considered a resilient SC, which 
gives a competitive advantage to the companies. 
 
To achieve SC resilience, several studies have discussed enablers. Some of these studies, focused on increasing 
velocity through the SC, others argued that high adaptability leads to SC resilience, and others mentioned information 
sharing as a key to achieving SC resilience. In addition, applying technology in the SC processes can add strength. As 
such, the Internet of Things can support/enhance the level of Velocity, Adaptability, and Information sharing, which 
leads to enhancing SC resilience. This research explores the opportunities that IoT presents to enhance resilience 
enablers and boost SC resilience.

Figure 4:  IoT contributions in supply chain resilience enablers 
 
5. Conclusion 
Many different enablers may fit in a particular supply chain better than others in terms of resolving hazards and 
increasing resilience. As a result, a list of specific enablers tailored to the domain, criteria, and needs of the business 
may be focused on to ensure supply chain resilience. 
 
In this paper, a module has presented the benefits of utilising IoT for resilience enablers in the supply chain. To achieve 
high-performance supply chain processes and gain future robustness to achieve resilience. We focused on three key 
enablers of supply chain resilience: velocity, Information sharing, and adaptability. 
 
Our research has emphasized the use of smart devices and IoT technologies in rebuilding traditional supply chains by 
focusing on three enablers that deliver resilience across the SC, Moreover, due to the limited research discussing the 
effect IoT has on SCRes, this study focuses on implementing smart technology on supply chain functions such as 
product tracking and tracing,  
 
With data and sharing information in real-time, IoT promises quick and accurate information throughout the supply 
chain. When it comes to resilience and the supply chain, it's evident that there are various areas and prospects for 
further research when it comes to Internet technology.

Abstract 
The health systems are one of the systems affected by the Covid 19 pandemic. Lack of equipment, personnel, and 
facilities are among the issues impacting the epidemic's control and progression. While studies such as vaccination 
continue, models have been developed to keep up with these developments. Because the SEIR model lacks a vaccine 
compartment, the more advanced SEIRV model with a vaccination compartment was used in this study. After a 
comparison of the various article contents, the necessary outputs of the Turkey data were recorded over the data of 
other countries on the GitHub platform, and the study proceeded. By comparing data from different nations with the 
modeling, various outcomes were found.

Abstract 
Physical inactivity and unhealthy lifestyle among individuals are persistent societal problems that have negative 
implications on one’s health. With the COVID-19 pandemic breakout, there has been an alarming rise in sedentary 
behaviors, a decrease in fitness activities engagement, and apparent physical inactivity among people across different 
countries. By integrating the Theory of Effort Minimization (TEMPA) and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) with 
socio-ecological factors into a single framework, this study aims to identify factors influencing the perceived behavior 
of Filipinos toward facilitating physical fitness and lifestyle wellness. Through the convenience sampling method, a 
self-administered questionnaire was disseminated using online platforms, with a total of 565 Filipinos being 
considered for this study. Results from multiple linear regression analysis showed that Age (p-value = 0.005), Media 
(p-value = 0.023), Self-efficacy (p-value = 0.000), Intent to Adapt (p-value = 0.002), Income (p-value = 0.034), and 
Diet (p-value = 0.000) were the key variables that affects the perceived behavior of Filipinos in boosting physical 
fitness and lifestyle wellness. This study has structured a model that could be utilized by the fitness industry, different 
government and educational institutions, Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), and other private and public 
institutions to establish effective strategies and interventions through fitness programs that will promote fitness and 
lifestyle wellness among different stakeholders.

1. Introduction
Physical fitness is the ability of the body to function efficiently to perform daily activities, maintain good health, and 
prevent diseases (Kent 2006). Comparatively, lifestyle wellness pertains to every individual’s action that contributes 
to physical, mental, and social well-being. Fitness and lifestyle wellness are linked to physical activity such as walking, 
gardening, and doing house chores, and exercises such as jogging, cycling, strength and muscle training, including a 
healthy diet. These two components have been considered essential to human health and, unfortunately, have not 
received significant attention.  
Over the past decades, physical inactivity and unhealthy lifestyle have been alarming issues among many individuals. 
In relation, The WHO recommended physical activity levels per week are not being met globally by 81% of 
adolescents and 23% of adults (World Health Organization [WHO], 2010). Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic 
has amplified people's deteriorating lifestyles, such as sedentary behaviors, poor eating and sleeping habits, and 
alcohol consumption worsening their overall lifestyle (Chew & Lopez 2021). These unhealthy behaviors increase the 
risk of mortality due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart and chronic respiratory disease, 
and cancer (WHO 2013). In the Philippines, it is revealed that approximately 27 million Filipinos are overweight and

to the study of Edwards et al. (2020) of diet-only interventions without exercise was already associated with a 
significant reduction in BMI.  
5.3 Proposed Improvements 
As promising as the results of this study are, the researchers acknowledge the several limitations of this paper. First, 
due to COVID-19 restrictions, the researchers could only disseminate the survey online, resulting in a majority of Gen 
Z age bracket respondents who also favored a certain income bracket. Face-to-face data gathering can capture more 
age and income brackets for more robust results for the study. Second, more geographical representation from other 
regions could be improved, which could then be used for further studies focusing on the three island groups can also 
be a good topic due to different environmental and cultural factors. Lastly, considering the integration of action 
control, planning ability, and attitude as added variables may contribute to a more comprehensive study.  
5.4 Validation  
From Table 6, the Cronbach's Alpha values of the variables are in the acceptable cutoff range; higher than 0.600 
(Ghozali 2016). This indicates that all measurement items are considered consistent and reliable.

6. Conclusion
The high prevalence of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors of Filipinos, fueled more by the COVID-19 
lockdowns, resulted in adverse health effects and a weakened immune system; therefore the necessity for health-
promoting behaviors are necessary to reduce the risk of diseases and improve health outcomes. This study identified 
factors affecting Filipinos' perceived behavioral intention to boost physical fitness and lifestyle, considering individual 
factors, ME, CU, M, and incorporating both the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Theory of Effort 
Minimization in Physical Activity (TEMPA). These factors were assessed using a multiple regression analysis.  
Results indicate Salary/Income and SE have a positive direct and high significance to PB. At the same time, Exercise 
Often, Age, ITA, ME, and Diet were seen to have a significant negative effect on PB. The belief in one's capability 
and financial capacity contributes to engaging in healthier routines. With that, it would also increase the likelihood of 
an individual becoming a health-oriented person if they are encouraged at the earliest stage of their life with less media 
exposure. Though limitations were presented, the study could be utilized by the fitness industry, government, local 
government units (LGUs), and private and public institutions to create successful fitness and wellness programs.

Abstract 
 
Digital Twin is one of the many components in Industry 4.0. Unfortunately, the meaning of digital twin could be 
differed from one to another. It is very confusing when someone is asking for a “Digital Twin” solution, what does 
the person really want? IBM has defined digital twin as virtual representation of component or assembly of 
components that interact with one another limited for the purpose of product life management. Siemens defined it in 
three areas namely Product, Production and Performance twins. The name suggested limit the definition to its 
application and there is no relationship with another. Lastly Jones characterized the term to 19 areas which is too much 
for one to remember and to know how they are related to one another.  The purpose of the paper is to re-classify digital 
twin from the perspective of its purpose of implementation.  By knowing the need, we could recommend the level of 
digital twin to be adopted.

1. Introduction 
The term Industrial 4.0 was introduced at the Hannover Fair, Germany in 2011 (Schwab 2017) and later this was 
proposed by Kiaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the Entity Economic Forum (VDI nachrichten 2011). 
In short, Industry 4.0 is a label that was given to the integration of technology and the use of data that reflects a new 
direction. It is a terminology for the confluence of many innovations that are coming to fruition and now being 
integrated (using high speed data sharing) (Thorsten and Sink 2022). Industrial 4.0 is the industrial revolution from 
Industrial 3.0 where the industry adopted automation using high speed supercomputer to reduce or eliminate the 
dependency on manpower in the operation. With the enhancement of high-speed internet and clouds computing at the 
back end, data hunger technology such as AI/ML, simulation, Augmented Reality, Big Data, and data analytic, 
Cybersecurity and others which could not be accomplished by technologists effectively and timely in the past, could 
now achieve through the digitalization of such information in the clouds. Operation data such as operation 
performance, quality information, equipment performance could be upload and access through such an ecosystem. 
Both the flexibility and the ability to access this information timely and even before the event has taken place has 
enabled quick actions in the decision making or interruption to the wrongdoing in the day-to-day operation. The result 
of such intervention has greatly improved the quality and the efficiency of the operation even at the absent of 
manpower. This facilitates the concept of “smart factories” where an entity of virtual and physical systems of 
manufacturing globally cooperates with each other in a flexible way. Among the technologies that are possible now, 
Digital Twin is one of which. Through the different enablers such as IoT devices, high speed data sharing capability, 
digital twin has been applied at product lifecycle management, building design affirmation, operation performance 
monitoring and optimization, predictive operation control and management and others; solving different problems at 
different level, but all of them are still known as digital twin. In 2022, Mendonca and the team has provided a summary 
of the application of the digital twin into several areas (da Silva Mendonça et al. 2022).

6. Conclusion 
From the perspective of the purpose implementation to classify Digital Twin has responded to the industrialist 
according to the purpose that one is trying to solve. If the purpose is to identify the bottleneck of an operation system 
or to define a product design, a Level 1 digital twin which is a virtual entity of the system or design is sufficient to 
solve the problem. On the other hand, if the purpose is to be able to decide and to make immediate changes to the 
current state of the system, for example, how many toll lanes to be opened with the immediate influx of car into the 
toll gates, then a Level 2 digital twin should be implemented. With the use of the virtual system to identify the 
performance of the physical entity, one solves the problem by intervening the current state of the physical entity 
manually. Lastly, if the purpose is to predict what will happen to the physical entity from the data trend so as to know 
what is the best action plan for the next period of time. One should adopt a level 3 digital twin. The approach also 
simplified the way how the terminology is characterized from nineteen points to three points. Instead of focusing on 
the industry or the area of application, it emphasizes on how the data come from, the period of the data that is needed 
and how long is the impact to the physical entity. When someone asks for a digital twin solution, one could then 
response by clarifying the purpose of the solution. By knowing the purpose, one could know what level of digital twin 
is necessary to solve the problem.

Abstract 
The tremendous increase in urban solid waste in the fast-growing cities of developing and emerging countries has 
raised public interest in health and environmental implications. The municipal waste from about 3 billion people is 
still disposed of in an uncontrolled manner. As citizens and decision makers become more sensitive to environmental 
degradation, pollution, and its impact on their quality of life, efficient and effective municipal waste management is 
gaining importance on the agendas of local, regional and international discussions. The research evaluated the current 
status of reverse logistics aimed toward bioenergy production and identified the major stakeholders, sources and 
problems of the waste generated in the City of Johannesburg. Stakeholders in the reverse logistics and recycling value 
chain in South Africa were also identified and included in the survey. Solutions of waste accumulation, transportation 
and improper dumping were suggested. The researcher also developed a logistics model for waste to bioenergy. The 
current situation and issues associated with waste management leading to bioenergy production were also explored in 
relation to sustainability.

concerns over the effects on health and the environment have grown especially about urban solid waste. 
In response to these concerns, the study assessed the state of reverse logistics for the generation of 
bioenergy in Johannesburg. The research has contributed to the creation of information systems and 
databases with raw data that includes, returns rate, recovery rate, returns inventory turnover, waste 
quantification, and supply chain management systems and framework. This new knowledge can be 
applied to any other cities. The study developed a logistics model for waste to bioenergy in an urban 
setting, which included process options and conversion paths for converting the targeted waste stream 
to enriched bioenergy. The study also developed a framework for the management system to successfully 
achieve a municipal waste reverse logistics system for bioenergy production.

Abstract 
Lean-based sustainability targets reduction in different types of waste such as material, time, and labor. Lean thinking 
and sustainability share similar goals of using processes efficiently using different tools and technology. This paper 
analyzes lean and sustainability under a system thinking lean using the perspectives concept that improves the current 
process for Work Inspection Requests in a Construction Project in Qatar. The current process mainly utilizes manual 
steps and physical paperwork. The suggested improvements were implementing an electronic workflow system, 
purchasing iPads for inspection, and removing redundant steps. As a result, the suggestions were found to reduce total 
process time and lead time and significantly reduce the material used. Cost comparison and sustainability indicators 
also supported the findings, showing that the improved process is better than the current one in the respective criteria.

1. Introduction
The twenty-first century has witnessed a prosperous, competitive environment that impacts different sectors, such as 
technological development and globalization. Therefore, there is a need for significant approaches and concepts to 
affect the new management positively. Therefore, the lean thinking approach plays a core role in business management 
and industry sectors by understanding the current process and improving processes by which products and services 
are created and delivered to customers. In addition, it has the essential concepts in the direction of production activities 
and processes, which were introduced in Japan during the fourth quarter of the last century. Most organizations across 
the globe now adopt this principle because it supports the concept of continuous improvement and does not just apply 
to the products or services; it involves processes and people.  
This paper aims to explore the current work inspection request process and show how the implementation of lean 
concepts and principles is applied in a consultant company, as it is known that the lean approach is not limited to the 
manufacturing process. In the past 25 years, organizations have increasingly acknowledged that lean methods are 
applicable in other aspects outside car factories (Graban 2018). Industries see lean in their perspective as a way of 
improving their quality, safety, and cost and understand that it plays a crucial role in developing and optimizing various 
aspects. 
According to Womack and Jones, there are five key lean principles . First, determine the value by the customer 
requirements. The second is value stream mapping, eliminating unnecessary activities that do not give value to the 
final product and ensuring a continuous and easy flow in the production and service process. During this process, it is

the electricity used. In the improved process, the storage includes the iPad storage areas and electricity costs for 
charging the iPads. The cost for the storage is shown in Table 5. The scores were assigned as per the approximate 
ratio (2:8) of the total calculated cost, with a higher ranking for the cheaper process.

Safety 
Replacing paper with an iPad is one of the safest methods in offices, especially when fires break out, as paper helps 
speed up the ignition. However, the fire risk would be high, especially in the archive storage room where many paper 
is filed. This is why it is important to know the paper's risks. The priority in workplace environments is to implement 
the requirement of safety and security, and thus will be fulfilled when the improved process is achieved. The scores 
were assigned as per the approximate ratio (2:9) of the total calculated safety with a higher ranking for a safer process. 
Motivation 
Nowadays, modern technology such as the iPad is immensely used by employees as it has been proven to enhance 
their work performance. This is due to several factors, such as organization, editability, and customization. iPad has 
various writing apps that include different fonts and unique features which can easily be customized to fit their needs. 
Unlike iPad, writing on paper can be frustrating as erasing and changing things can be difficult, messy, and more time-
consuming, especially if written in pen. Therefore, iPad note-taking is more effective as employees have all their 
documents organized in one place, making them more motivated to work properly. 
Furthermore, the improved process removes redundant steps, decreasing the staff's workload. The scores were 
assigned as per the approximate ratio (2:8) of the total calculated for the motivation of the staff with a higher ranking 
of the improved process that makes the employee more motivated and has positive impacts on the social indicator. 
6. Conclusion
This paper presented a lean-based methodology for enhancing the work-inspection request process performance in a 
construction project. The process includes 24 steps and has been reduced to 13 steps by introducing an electronic 
workflow system, iPad for inspections, and removing redundancies. As a result, process time was reduced by 41 %, 
lead time by 61 %, and the material used by 100 %. A cost comparison of the two processes showed that the electronic 
system (improved process) is cheaper than the manual system (current process), considering annual costs. 
Furthermore, the lean-based methodology was linked to sustainability indicators grouped into environmental, 
economic & social. The improved process was found to be more sustainable.

Abstract 
The institutionalization of continuous improvement highlights the need for personnel across all levels of governance, to accept 
change in program implementations. It must be embedded in the system to sustain the data-driven approach of identifying first 
the main cause of the problems, then testing for the best possible strategies for the life-long benefits of the solutions. This study 
dwelt on determining how the CI methodology can be sustained in different CI schools in DepEd Region V. The non-
experimental quantitative research mode was used to capture the data that naturally exist in the completion and utilization of 
projects. The descriptive-evaluative survey method was used. It was noted as findings in this study that the training and 
coaching to teams have influenced them to work on interventions focusing on improving the teaching and learning processes. 
The CI projects became useful ideas in delivering blended learning modalities by making and using its new versions in Audio 
Lessons, Video Lessons, Self-Learning Modules, and Learning Activity sheets. Their focus is limited to the implementation 
and not to the application of CI Methodology in the system operations. It is recommended that calibrated measures of 
sustainability practices, focusing on promising sustainability procedures and emerging practices, are structured and designed.

I. Introduction
Quality Management System (QMS), as mandated by the provisions of Executive Order No 605, s. 2007, sets the 
implementation guidelines and standards integrating into its internal systems and processes, upgrading personnel capacity, 
ensuring consistent delivery of quality service, and promoting continuous improvement in DepEd offices, schools, and CLCs. 
Continuous improvement (CI) is an ongoing method of making incremental improvements in service delivery and quality 
management system or breakthrough development over time.   It is an “Improvement initiative that increases successes and 
reduces failures” as described by (Bhuiyan & Baghel 2005). It is Idowu (2013) that considers CI as an iterative way of 
undergoing improvements ending with favorable results. It requires the involved personnel’s determination and willingness to 
perform for improved conditions of systems and processes.  
The certification program on CI was launched in DepEd in 2015 in partnership with Basic Education Sector Transformation 
(BEST).  With a 7-month of CI Certification, CIP starts with a five-day basic training following the “Three A” learning cycle 
(Asses, Analyze and Act).  At present, the program is being rolled out in schools.   In Region V the program has already reached 
247 schools in all 13 Divisions of the Region.  The Department’s target is for CIP to be institutionalized in all schools and 
divisions in the Philippines with this lies the need to sustain the implementation of the program in schools and ensure that CI 
Methodology (CIM) is embedded in the school’s system as an iterative methodology to improve operational processes for a 
more efficient, and effective strategy to increase student outcomes. Cases of CIM success stories as well as challenges should 
therefore be collected and processed to be able to come up with better ways of sustaining the program. This research can aid 
educational leaders in coming up with contextualized policies to ensure that the program is continuously practiced in schools

This initiated the idea to have calibrated measures of sustainability practices through a toolkit in the 13 SDOs in DepEd Region 
V, focusing on promising sustainable procedures and emerging practices, structured and designed. 
 
The sustainability toolkit in CI is a collection of viable practices anchored on the CIM structure and is designed in an online 
infographic format. It is created to offer guides on how to maintain or even improve processes. The toolkit highlights its major 
elements; the key audience, scope, strategy to get the basis for the inclusion of practices to be included, and advocacy.  
 
In the CIM Sustainability Toolkit, the identified key audience or users are the school teams and coaches. 
The scope of the graphical contents evolves in the credence and simple ways to sustain CI. 
The best strategy to collect the information to be included in the kit must be anchored on the CIM structure presented in figure 
1 which is all based on the needs of the current situation. 
An effective way to encourage the target audience to use and advocate the content of the toolkit must be considered. 
 
With the toolkit, the researchers believe that CI can shift direction to focus on the roads of executing workable procedures. 
 
Conclusion and Recommendation 
“Continuous improvement has been proven useful and effective in various industries, and schools and districts incorporating 
continuous improvement into their work have shown promising results” the findings of Jane Best and Allison Dunlap (2014) 
 
Conclusion 
The learning gaps as well as school concerns addressed by the completion and rollout of CI projects in schools proved that 
Continuous Improvement Methodology is at present the most effective means for schools to produce timely interventions that 
work and will alleviate our Learning Poverty issues. 
 
 The initial undertaking of schools to sustain CI gives the researcher a possibility that the methodology can be sustained if it 
will be communicated through standard guidelines and technical assistance mechanisms that practitioners may easily refer to 
for review or technical assistance provision. 
 
The suggested sustainability plans provided in the survey can aid the researchers in a policy recommendation formulation to 
ensure that CIM is implemented and effectively practiced in all schools in the region. 
 
CI has laid the most complex cognitive and technical activities in which concerned individuals became engaged, in making 
ideas to address the priority improvement areas doable and remarkable. It requires a concerted and collaborative effort by 
advocates, educators, researchers, and policymakers with a focus on long-term solutions as much as possible. The CI solutions 
are expected to be translated into practices and policies.  
 
In a challenging world like the Department of Education, interventions or new solutions are imperative. Many activities are 
being delivered, many teams and organizations have been organized and many innovations are being introduced but still many 
fail to meet the expected learning outcomes. To ensure acquiring benefits in the school/organization, a very supportive, 
proactive, and open to new possibilities is required to limit the waste of effort, time, and resources. All actions are headed 
towards sustainable effects on the school community. 
 
Recommendations 
It is recommended to have an investigation on how the non-CI team members in the school community perceived the step-by-
step completion undertakings of a CI project, what is their capacity to support the co-members of the school community who 
are directly involved in the CI team, and what are their misconceptions about the methodology of continuous improvement. 
 
The Learning and Development (L&D) of the Department of Education is now a requirement in hiring and promotion which 
is now connected to Merit Selection Plan (MSP). The MSP highlights the inclusion of the application of L&D or intervention 
made by an applicant relevant to the position being applied for.  This is a good starting point for another research journey 
dwelling on how the implementation requirements of the system directly influence the highest points to be credited in the 
equivalent pertinent documents for recruitment, assessment, and selection processes in the MSP.

Abstract 
The internet plays a very vital role in the education sector. Having a good internet connection in an educational 
institution such as a university campus is a must-have. For a campus network, the university installs WLAN Access 
Points (AP) in certain areas. Users can access the internet using their devices in these certain areas covered by the APs 
signal. This study is applied to the Gaziantep University campus in order to find the optimal locations of outdoor 
access points that satisfy demand points. To do so, first of all, geographic information of 17 current and 14 new 
potential locations of outdoor access points, and 25 demand points were gathered using their GPS coordinates. Second, 
two of the location-allocation models were used; one of them is the Set-Covering model which was used to find the 
minimum number of outdoor APs to cover all campus areas within a specific distance. The other one is the maximal-
coverage location problem (MCLP) model which tries to maximize the demand to be covered, served by a fixed 
number of Wi-Fi APs. Distances between the total 31 potential locations and 25 demand points were taken using the 
Euclidean Distance Algorithm. Then, the models were solved using GAMS, software for mathematical optimization. 
The results obtained were compared with the current system and showed approximately 30% improvements in some 
aspects.

1. Introduction
In today's world, the Internet is one of the most indispensable technologies. And since the emergence of the Internet, it 
has become an important medium of communication as well as a research and leisure tool. The reason is that it provides 
many opportunities to many people around the world in many different ways. The internet serves nearly 5.07 billion 
people worldwide (63.5% of the population). The role of the internet is observable not only in statistics but also more 
visibly in everyday life: in social interactions, entertainment, business, science, and especially in education 
The internet plays a very vital role in the education sector. And having a good internet connection in an educational 
institution such as a university campus is a must-have. A university campus network is far more than just a physical 
infrastructure, and planning and having full coverage of a good internet connection in a university campus means 
developing an entirely new information environment that will have a profound impact on almost every aspect of campus 
life such as full access to information in any place at any time, enhanced communication between students/faculties/staffs 
in the campus and increasing their welfare. 
A campus network is a set of interconnected Local Area Networks (LAN). And a Local Area Network (LAN) is a group 
of computers and peripheral devices that share a common communications line or wireless link to a server that connects 
multiple sites or buildings, within a distinct geographic area.  When two or more devices use wireless communication,

Abstract 
This paper presents an experimental study based on Grandspan Development Corporation that aims to find the 
combination of drilling parameters, namely: drilling speed, feed rate, and drill diameter, that would generate the 
optimal drilling time and material removal rate. A CNC FSD-1020 machine with low-carbon twist drill and a sample 
of A572 Steel was used for the experiment, whose data was analyzed with L9 orthogonal array. The Taguchi-based 
Design of Experiments was utilized in finding the optimal setting of the drilling parameters. Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA) and Signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) were also utilized to determine and analyze which among the independent 
variables has significant effects and contributions on the response variables. Power Test was applied to check if the 
Power of the input parameters are acceptable. As generated by Stat-Ease, 1.8 mm/rev is the most optimum feed rate 
for all settings. Meanwhile, using Minitab, the drilling parameters with the minimum drill time are as follows: 390 
rpm for cutting speed, 1.8mm/rev for feed rate, and 25mm for drill diameter; and, the optimal set of parameters with 
the highest material removal rates: cutting speed of 400 rpm, feed rate of 1.8mm/rev, and drill diameter of 25mm. 
ANOVA shows that drill diameter is the parameter with the most significant impact on drill time, and feed rate for 
material removal rate. The two most optimal sets of parameters for each drill diameter were also determined in the 
study.

1. Introduction
Drilling operations is a metal cutting activity that makes up 25% of all machining processes and plays a critical role 
in structural steel production and fabrication (Black and Kohser 2012). In fact, drilling is done on structural steels 
such as plates, beams, and columns to connect them to other steel members. Drill holes are also normally drilled near 
supports to attach fasteners and connectors. In Grandspan Development Corporation, drilling is a key production 
activity and is used in all metal pieces processed by the company. Hence, many resources are focused on its drilling 
processes.  
Manufacturing companies like Grandspan consistently monitor their production processes to ensure that operations 
are continuous and efficient, but there are several factors that can hinder a production line. One of these factors is 
time. Time is a critical variable in the manufacturing environment and is often used as a performance indicator in 
manufacturing processes due to its decisive effect on the flow of operations. For that reason, businesses value time 
not only to satisfy client demand timely but also to minimize costs associated with time. For instance, downtimes like 
machine breakdown can disrupt production schedules reducing productive capacity by 5 to 20% (Deloitte 2017) and 
can potentially cause failure to meet customer demands, resulting to revenue loss.

Abstract 
As technology advances, climate change comes along with it. The world advances towards an era where everything 
can be easily manufactured. So, it is essential to know which materials and resources to use and utilize. This study 
was conducted to know which organic material is stronger as the main component in the production of bioplastics. 
Such findings benefit the companies that produce or plan to produce eco-friendly bioplastics. The emerging need to 
use sustainable materials pushed them to divulge in this study. Moreover, this redounds to the benefit of humanity, 
considering that non-biodegradable materials continue to litter the planet. This paper aimed to promote sustainability 
and resourcefulness by identifying the better material for manufacturing bioplastics. The literature review presented a 
detailed discussion on plastics. From how it is caused, up to how it should be reduced and diminished. The researchers 
prepared samples of corn-based and cassava-based bioplastic, and prepared samples of petroleum-based plastic to 
serve as the standard in this comparative study. These samples were tested under a series of trials to determine the 
difference between their tensile strength. The researchers analyzed the results of these trials by using the Independent 
Samples T-test as a statistical tool to determine the statistical difference between these bioplastics in terms of their 
tensile properties, with the petroleum-based plastic packages as the standard. From there, the researchers concluded 
that corn-based bioplastics are up to par with petroleum-based plastics regarding tensile strength. However, it is 
recommended to try a more relevant test to have more in-depth knowledge of these plastics.

1. Introduction
Bioplastics can be created entirely or partially from renewable biomass sources like sugarcane and corn and microbes 
like yeast. Under the right circumstances, some bioplastics are biodegradable or even compostable. Bioplastics 
manufactured from renewable resources can be naturally recycled by biological processes, protecting the environment, 
and reducing fossil fuel consumption. With that said, bioplastics are indeed sustainable, biodegradable, and 
biocompatible. Bioplastics are plastics manufactured from natural materials like vegetable oils and starches (Ashter 
2016). The researchers will compare two biodegradable plastics: corn-based and cassava-based bioplastics. Corn-
based bioplastics are made from corn and its by-product, which are then fermented to produce Polylactic Acid (PLA), 
the primary material in the production of bioplastics. Meanwhile, cassava-based bioplastics are made from cassava 
and its by-product, fermented to produce PLA.  
Annually, about 4 to 12 million tons of plastic waste go directly to the world’s oceans. 20% of the waste is marine-
based, originating from maritime activities and operations such as fishing and shipping. At the same time, 80% of the 
waste comes from land-based sources. Moreover, the Philippines is one of the 5 countries considered where 60% or 
most of the plastic waste leaks into the ocean; other countries are China, Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam (Akenji et 
al. 2020).  Each year, the Philippines produces an astounding 2.7 million tons of plastic garbage, of which an estimated 
20% ends up in the water. Since the country is made up of more than 7,500 islands, the Philippines' coastal

5.3 Test Between Cassava-based bioplastic and Traditional plastic 
5.3.1 Group Statistics 
Table 14 shows the group statistics result of the statistical test. Based on the development, cassava-based plastic has 
a mean of 1.489 and an SD of 0.05007. Petroleum or traditional-based plastic has a mean of 3.5227 and an SD of 
0.34217.

5.3.2 Hypothesis Testing 
H0: µCassava-based ≤ µTraditional; The mean tensile strength of cassava-based bioplastic is less than or equal to the 
mean tensile strength of traditional plastic. 
H1: µCassava-based > µTraditional; The mean tensile strength of cassava-based bioplastic is greater than the mean 
tensile strength of traditional plastic. 
Alpha: 0.05 
P-value: 1.0303x10-25 
Conclusion: Fail to reject H0. Based on table 9, since the p-value acquired was 1.0303x10-25 and less than the α of 
0.05, the null hypothesis can be rejected. Therefore, traditional plastics have statistically higher tensile strength than 
cassava-based bioplastics.

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
Based on the results and conclusion, it was considered that both extracted polymers from each starch are a feasible 
option as replacement for plastics. The gathered data indicates that the mean tensile strength values for both 
components catch up with the industry benchmark mean value of the plastic industry. In addition, the proponents 
highly recommend that the respondents utilize biodegradable plastics rather than conventional plastics. Due to the 
cost-benefit analysis, the best recommendation/action plan for how the respondents can benefit from the study is to 
adapt and embrace the greener option. This would be beneficial for the environment of the nation or the planet and 
the plastic manufacturing industry. 
 
The action plan could be implemented by investing in research and development pertaining to sustainability. It is 
important to fund research studies such as this, so that information on bioplastics will continuously improve. With 
that, innovative ideas and technological advancements will immensely grow. It is important to acknowledge papers 
on biodegradable plastic and take it a lot further. Adapting solutions in reducing waste will be world changing. There 
is still knowledge that could be tapped on which can be obliging to society. Most importantly, it may be profitable to 
companies without damaging the environment. 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendations 
The possibilities for the optimum component in the manufacture of biodegradable plastic packaging were determined 
by statistical analysis of the dependent variable resulting from the independent variable. With the statistical analysis 
of the study, corn-based starch would be the ideal choice for the primary component, which would be greatly beneficial 
for the local farmers and corn harvesters, the plastics sector with regard to the manufacturers of plastics, and the corn 
industry. This would imply that the findings of the study, which compared the tensile qualities of the two components, 
could support manufacturers in evaluating which would be more advantageous to use as the primary component in the 
creation of bioplastics.

In the future, researchers interested in studying the potential of bioplastics to replace conventional plastics, as well as 
the target respondents mentioned, should introduce variables for testing the properties of these materials. It is 
recommended for future researchers to test the morphological and degradation properties of both raw materials in 
order to determine the overall potential of the polymers.  
The experimental procedures of the mentioned variables are as follows: physicochemical test and degradation test. 
For the first procedure, it is a necessary method of testing because it defines the physical and chemical properties, 
composition, quality, purity, and stability of the polymer. On the other hand, the degradation test focuses on the rate 
of degradation of each polymer because it is a significant criterion for helping the global situation of the environment. 
The following are the equipment needed for the mentioned testing methods: Digital and Scanning Electron 
Microscope, Fourier Transform Infrared, and Weighing Scale. Furthermore, it is also recommended that future 
researchers make the samples so that the accurate quantitative measurements of raw materials used in making the 
plastics can be assessed and further expound on which materials affect each property by using correlation analysis. 
Consequently, it is also recommended to use regression analysis that does indeed significantly impact the overall 
quality of the plastic. Thus, knowing which plastics are statistically better than the other plastics.

Abstract 
Although cancer is a broad term, it is an important problem that causes a high rate of death. It indicates disease that 
occurs when cellular changes cause cells to grow and divide uncontrollably. Cancerous cells can form tumors, damage 
the immune system, and cause other aberrations that prevent the body from functioning properly. In particular, lung 
cancer is the type of cancer with the highest death rate in the last five years. The important thing in lung cancer is 
early diagnosis and diagnosis to ensure the survival of patients. In this study, a model that automatically detects lung 
cancer has been developed in order to detect lung cancer early and take the necessary precautions at the first stage of 
the disease. The aim of our study is to diagnose the presence of lung cancer cells based on attributes and information 
from human symptoms. In our study, a dataset consisting of 26 features and 3 classes determining lung cancer as low, 
medium and high was used. Some preprocessing and transformations have been done to make the data more suitable 
for predictive analysis. The first 26 features were used as the inputs of the model. The lung cancer feature was used 
as the predicted output based on the input features. The values of the attributes are normalized. In the first stage, data 
preprocessing was carried out with various data mining techniques in order to process the data more easily and increase 
the performance. In the proposed model, feedforward backpropagation Artificial Neural Network model was used to 
detect the presence of lung cancer in the body of the person. Unlike other studies, the factors that cause lung cancer 
by producing our own neural network have been determined. When the results obtained are compared with the studies 
in the literature, it has been observed that it gives very successful results.

1. Introduction
Lung cancer is the most important cause of death in humans. Since the symptoms of lung cancer occur in advanced 
stages, it leads to a high mortality rate among other types of cancer. Early diagnosis is therefore very important. Most 
of the lung diagnosis methods are costly and laborious. Lung cancer is a cost-effective disease that requires early 
diagnosis (Brunetti et al.  (2022)). 
Lung cancer is one of the leading types of cancer that ends in death worldwide. In the detection of lung cancer, a large 
number of chest radiographs are examined by expert radiologists (Joshua et al.  (2020)). As a result of these 
examinations, misdiagnosis or differences of opinion among specialist radiologists on diagnosis and diagnoses may 
occur (Radhika et al. (2019)). 
In our study, using the backpropagation algorithm of artificial neural networks on the lung cancer dataset, multiple 
predictions are carried out on patients with a rapid and accurate diagnosis on patients with suspected lung cancer. 
Thanks to this diagnosis, the patient's risk of developing cancer is estimated as low, medium and high. In our study, it 
was aimed to develop an automatic model with developed artificial neural networks and lung data. Feature extraction 
was performed with the model we created, and then it was classified and compared with different machine learning 
methods. Success rates were calculated according to various performance criteria that were compared with the results.

6. Conclusion  
Lung cancer is the formation of tumors in the lung as a result of abnormal and uncontrollable proliferation of lung 
cells. Lung cancer has become the most common type of cancer in the world in parallel with the increase in smoking 
habits. Due to the importance of the subject, November has been chosen as 'Lung Cancer Awareness Month' around 
the world. Although it is a fatal disease, early diagnosis of the disease is very important. As in all types of cancer, in 
the treatment of lung cancer, it is possible to diagnose and fully treat the disease at the first stage with early diagnosis. 
Identifying the disease in its early stages is very important in terms of treatment. 
 
In our study, this important disease was handled and the early diagnosis and diagnosis of the disease was emphasized. 
An automated neural network model has been developed to detect the disease early. In our study, a data set containing 
information about the risk status of people with and without lung cancer (3 classes as low, medium and high) was 
used. Some preprocessing and transformations have been made on the utilized datasets in order to make the data more 
suitable for predictive analysis. With this research, the presence of lung cancer cells can be detected based on the 
attributes and information from human symptoms using Artificial Neural Network. Then, the Artificial Neural 
Networks model was trained and validated. In the Artificial Neural Networks model, it was able to predict the presence 
of lung cancer with 98.75% accuracy after 10000 learning cycles with less than 1% training error rate. In addition, the 
model obtained showed that chronic diseases were the most influential feature on the presence of lung cancer. This 
study showed that the neural network can diagnose lung cancer, so it can be used by doctors as a diagnostic tool. This 
study showed that the neural network can diagnose lung cancer, so it can be used by doctors as a diagnostic tool. 
In the future, it is aimed to increase the success of the study by automatically modeling different network structures 
on different and very large real datasets. In addition, the difference of our study from other studies is that we create

our own artificial neural network. We will improve the study by performing this neural network on different datasets 
with different parameters.

Abstract 
This study evaluates the productivity in terms of number of transactions, earnings, and profit of a local online delivery 
service operated by a tech start-up company that has seen increased sales but not profit. Through PDCA, this study 
identified the problems that affect the productivity of the company the most, the root causes of the top problem, and 
their correlation with the productivity of the company. Furthermore, solutions were formulated to help the company 
improve its productivity for the next year. The assessment began with data collection through interviews and survey 
questionnaires which were run through various quality control tools as well as correlation analysis. At this stage, it 
was determined that the poor user interface of the application causes the most problems for the company in terms of 
productivity. From here, various concrete solutions were formulated for high-impact root causes that were controllable 
and a corresponding risk assessment plan was developed. With a detailed monitoring and response plan, the solutions 
provided will help the company as well as other companies within the delivery services industry.

1. Introduction
The Philippines is part of the growing start-up scene alongside other countries in Southeast Asia including Singapore 
and Indonesia. Some of the most popular online applications in the Philippines backed by start-up companies include 
Grab and Food Panda which offer services such as online taxi booking, as well as food and grocery delivery. With 
this, many start-ups have considered launching delivery services as a result of their popularity and demand in the 
market, especially because of the COVID-19 pandemic and people who prefer not to go out can use these services for 
convenience. 
In connection with the influence of delivery applications in the Philippines, this study focused on a local online 
delivery service application hereinafter referred to as “the app” which is operated by a local tech start-up company 
that aims to represent Filipino developers in the tech space and be a viable competitor to established international 
companies in the delivery industry. Founded at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company launched the app 
in the middle of 2021 which is a service most similar to Grab and Lalamove providing same-day delivery in Metro 
Manila and the surrounding provinces of Bulacan, Cavite, Rizal, and Laguna. Similar to existing platforms, the app 
also uses high-performing application-based technology. It provides three main verticals including (1) a point-to-point

The monitoring plan is a data collection method that serves to keep the implementation of the solutions on the right 
track and keep it at an optimal performance. Meanwhile, the response plan establishes a trigger level that is based on 
the measures indicated in the monitoring plan. Once these triggers are reached, specific actions are done in order to 
keep and maintain the performance of the implemented measures. Table 6 shows the monitoring and response plan, 
the final part of the implementation phase of the study, in achieving its objective where strategies are recommended 
to improve the productivity of the company. 
6. Conclusion
Upon the completion of data collection and analysis, different problems that affect the company’s productivity were 
identified from each department. The top five problems that affect the productivity of the company the most were 
found to be as follow respectively: poor user interface of an application, failure to meet expectations of key accounts 
in terms of number of users, several glitches in the technical system, repeatedly occurring problems in partnering with 
merchants, low number of orders received by the rider in a day, poor order-matching for riders, frequent delay in 
delivering the orders, outdated merchant operational status and lack of customer loyalty. 
Through the affinity diagram and matrix diagram, it was found that there is a specific department within the company 
that affects its productivity and this department was found to be the IT/Tech Department which has the problem of 
“poor user interface of the application.” This problem keeps the company from sustaining profit despite the increase 
in the number of users that register on the app. Through correlation analysis, it was verified with a Pearson’s r value 
of -0.686 that as the number of registered users increases, the profit of the company decreases. However, with a 
significance level of 0.133, this relationship is not significant. Looking at the relationship between the number of 
registered users and number of transactions (r = 0.822) as well as the costs incurred (r = 0.814), Pearson’s r value 
indicates a high positive relationship for both pairs and a significance level below 0.05 thus the relationship is 
significant. This means that although the users are converted into paying customers, these customers do not spend 
enough to cover the expenses incurred by the company in fulfilling customer orders. The high impact and controllable 
root causes of the top 1 problem are the following: (1) App was not assessed thoroughly, (2) Lack of planning prior 
to designing and, (3) Lack of funding. By identifying the root causes of this problem through the cause and effect 
diagram, the high impact and controllable root causes were identified. Furthermore, the tree diagram and prioritization 
matrix were used to determine the alternative solutions that would have the highest impact on the productivity of the 
company once implemented. 
The following solutions were recommended by the researchers to improve the productivity of the company: (1) 
Perform periodic app maintenance to test wireframe functionality, (2) Receive and review customer feedback and use 
them for improvements, (3) Provide training for employees working on the app, (4) Improve existing projects to make 
them more efficient, (5) Settle receivables from partner merchants at most within 45 days, (6) Create standardized 
checklists for app improvement and, (7) Conduct meetings with developers and designers 
Along with these solutions, a detailed response and monitoring plan are added to give recommendations to the 
company in addressing the root cause that affects its productivity the most.

Abstract 
The use of solar energy as a renewable energy source is becoming increasingly popular globally as a way to reduce 
dependence on fossil fuels and minimize negative environmental impacts. However, in emerging economies, the 
implementation of solar energy is often hindered by several barriers. These barriers present significant challenges for 
policymakers in achieving comprehensive energy sustainability. This study aims to identify and analyze the most 
significant barriers to implementing solar energy in emerging economies, as well as the relationships between these 
barriers. Thirteen barriers were identified through a review of the literature and input from experts and were analyzed 
using the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method. The results revealed that 'High 
upfront costs', and 'Limited access to land and resources for large-scale projects' are the two most prominent barriers 
to implementing solar energy in emerging economies. Analysis of the cause-and-effect relationships between these 
barriers identified 'Limited access to land and resources for large-scale projects' as the most significant cause and 
'Limited access to financing' as the least significant cause. The findings of this study are expected to assist 
policymakers in emerging economies in addressing these barriers and successfully implementing solar energy to 
achieve long-term energy sustainability and support sustainable development goals (SDGs).

Introduction 
Solar energy is becoming increasingly popular all over the world as a clean, renewable energy source that does not 
produce emissions or pollutants, making it a popular choice for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing 
climate change (Shahsavari and Akbari 2018; Anam et al. 2022a). With technological advances, solar energy is 
becoming more accessible and cost-competitive with traditional fossil fuel sources (Balakrishnan et al. 2020). 
Additionally, solar energy can be generated on-site, which means it can be used in remote and off-grid locations, and 
thus can be more convenient (Phuangpornpitak and Tia 2013). Developed countries around the world are promoting 
solar energy through subsidies, tax incentives, and mandatory renewable energy targets which also drive the growth 
of the solar energy industry (Haukkala 2015). However, countries with emerging economies often stumble due to 
several barriers to implementing solar energy on a large scale (Ansari et al. 2013; Ohunakin et al. 2014; Shahsavari 
and Akbari 2018). Therefore, researchers and policymakers need to explore the barriers to implementing solar energy 
in an emerging economy to overcome those barriers and attain sustainability in the energy sector.

deployment of this clean energy source. Furthermore, the widespread use of solar energy can also help to reduce the 
dependence on fossil fuels and decrease the impacts of air pollution and deforestation, which are often associated with 
the extraction and use of fossil fuels. 
 
5. Conclusions 
In recent years, the concept of sustainability has gained significant attention in political and economic discussions. 
Policymakers have recognized the harmful effects of traditional fossil fuel-based energy systems on the environment. 
However, despite the potential benefits of solar energy, there is a lack of research linking the use of solar energy and 
the Sustainable Development Goals in emerging economies. The current study aims to bridge this gap by connecting 
these two important concepts to promote a sustainable future. 
 
The unique aspect of this study is its use of the DEMATEL method to identify, prioritize and understand the cause-
and-effect relationships between the barriers to implementing solar energy. An interesting finding from the results is 
that the most prominent barrier and the most causal barrier are not always the same. This highlights that a barrier may 
be important, but may not necessarily be the root cause of other barriers. 
 
This study analyzed 13 barriers related to the implementation of solar energy, of which 5 were identified as the root 
causes and the remaining 8 as the effects. Policymakers must understand these causal relationships between the 
barriers to achieving specific Sustainable Development Goals. Emerging economies should pay particular attention to 
the barriers identified as causes in this study to minimize the negative impact of other barriers that may arise and 
achieve long-term sustainability in line with the UN SDGs. 
 
The study has limitations that need to be addressed in future research, such as the DEMATEL method only considering 
influencing capabilities and not other criteria in decision-making, and the difficulty of applying the method with a 
large number of alternatives. To improve the study, other flexible numerical analysis tools and methods can be 
incorporated. Additionally, the study was conducted in the context of emerging economies, so more studies in different 
countries are needed to develop a broad understanding of the topic. A prospective research scope could be determining 
the feasibility of various renewable energy sources in different countries.

Abstract 
The method of carrying out the work is a process, method, or procedure for doing something by providing a structure 
to complete the work. The project of dredging the Kalibaru terminal stage 1B Tanjung Priok Port is a work to increase 
the depth of the pool and entrance channel from -4 mLws to -16 mLws. In its implementation, there is a work error 
method that has an impact on the implementation of project time. Basically, the dredging work of the Kalibaru entrance 
channel and pool terminal phase 1B Tanjung Priok Port has a method of carrying out the work but there are still some 
things that are not standardized and incomplete. This research uses survey methods, literature studies, and case studies, 
and then data analysis uses the Delphi method. This research was also conducted to develop dredging work methods 
to improve risk-based time performance. The results of this research hope to provide input and guidelines for new 
methods of dredging work that will be carried out in the future.

1. Introduction
A method is a process, a way, or a procedure to do something by providing a structure to get the job done (Kimbell 
and Julier 2019). Methods are also defined as procedures, techniques, or systematic means of investigation used by or 
according to a particular discipline (Merriam-Webster 2013). Methods are expected to be a guide for a person or 
organization in making or compiling work steps. So, making or doing something is mandatory according to the existing 
steps. The methods’ accuracy will provide a higher success rate of project work (Wells 2012).  
The Kalibaru terminal entrance channel and harbor pool dredging work project phase 1B of Tanjung Priok Port is a 
work to increase the depth of the pond and shipping channel from -4 mLws to -16 mLws So that the port in the future 
can serve large ships so that the organization's revenue can increase. In its implementation, there are dredging work 
activities with improper work methods that impact time performance and increase operational costs.

Based on the results of the risk analysis, 3 risk factors with a high level of risk namely: dredger damage, mistake 
dredger selection, and dredger are not available. Where these risks are contained in the planning and execution process. 
5.2 Proposed Improvements 
Risk analysis in a project is important because it can minimize the negative impact that will cause losses to the project. 
It is necessary to map the risks in each process and stage of work so that the type of risk, probability value, and impact 
value can be known so that a project can make its risk level. Furthermore, the project can avoid the emergence of 
impacts and minimize risks that occur so that the risk level can decrease. 
6. Conclusion
From the discussion in this study, it can be concluded that in dredging work there are risks in every process and stage. 
3 high risks were obtained namely: dredger damage, mistake dredger selection, and dredger not available. Where these 
risks are contained in the planning and execution process. So, it is necessary to map the risks in each process and stage 
of work so that the type of risk, probability value, and impact value can be known so that the risk level is made. 
Furthermore, the project can avoid the emergence of impacts and minimize the risks that occur so that the risk level 
can decrease. Considering the results of these risks, it is expected to be a guide in the implementation of dredging 
work to improve the performance of work time.

Abstract 
The time spent on the queue to get consulted by a doctor affects the patient’s satisfaction on the services provided by 
a hospital. Just like in the OPD of a public hospital in the Philippines, the researchers have observed poor queueing 
system where some patients are dissatisfied. To provide solutions to the existing problem, the researchers utilized 
SERVQUAL scale, five quality dimensions: tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, assurance, and empathy to assess 
service quality. Queueing theory and Promodel process simulation were also used to analyze the current queueing 
system and propose new layout. The result obtained shows a negative gap exists between the expectation and the 
observation of the patients with the service of the OPD in each dimension, which are tangibles (-0.4733), reliability (-
0.2311), responsiveness (-0.1675), assurance (-0.3289), and empathy (-0.2258). In implementing the proposed layout, 
the results obtained were an 86% increase in the number of patients accommodated, a decrease of 40%, 6%, and 46% 
in the average time of patients in the system, in operation, and in the waiting time of patients, respectively, compared 
to the existing process. It has been demonstrated that the recommended layout model can improve the hospital's service 
quality while cutting down patient waiting time.

1. Introduction
The pandemic has incredibly strained healthcare systems, with rapid shifts in demand for inpatient care. Caring for 
COVID-19 patients while continuing to treat other patients is a complex planning challenge. A critical aspect of the 
Philippines’ response to this crisis is ensuring safe and timely care for COVID-19 patients and those with other 
conditions. With that, hospitals have been busy since the start of the pandemic until now. The window of external 
service of hospitals is the outpatient department (Shan et al. 2013), and they are trying their best to provide the medical 
services possible. With the rise of the pandemic, multiple challenges in providing immediate responses to patients 
have been a considerable concern. Waiting time is a global problem in the healthcare industry (Algiriyage et al. 2014). 
Patients spend a significant amount of time before a physician sees them. In most developing countries, as several 
studies have shown, patients spend 2-4 hours in outpatient departments before seeing a doctor (Ofilli et al. 2005). The 
average length of long queues varies by country; even within a country, it varies by hospitals or clinics. Unnecessary 
waiting time increases frustration and stress for the patients. Also, long queues are subjecting the hospital to be 
overcrowded. One of the critical aspects of Hospital Administration is the Outpatient Department (OPD). It involves 
patients treated without staying in the hospital and going home after treatment. OPD oversees the function of the 
hospital, which is being the first contact between the patient and the hospital staff.

utilization for the proposed process. An increase of 95% utilization was obtained in one of the triages in the proposed 
compared to the existing one. Additionally, an increase of 53%, 138%, 76%, and 124% was obtained in the activity 
utilization in the proposed treatment or consultation of the OB, IM, Pedia, and surgery services, respectively. 
Furthermore, this indicates that the doctors' idle time decreased since the percentage utilization of the activities they 
are in increased.  
6. Conclusion
Based on the survey results and observations, the service provided by the hospital's OPD did not meet the patients’ 
expectations in the various dimensions of the SERVQUAL scales. The expectations of patients were proven to be 
higher than what the patients had experienced. On the other hand, although the dimensions equally affected the quality 
of service provided by the hospital, the patients had high expectations for the reliability dimension. However, 
responsiveness got the highest score after they experienced the service in the OPD. Meanwhile, the dimension with 
the lowest mean score for both the expected and observed values is the tangibles dimension and the dimension that 
the hospital should prioritize to increase the satisfaction of patients with their service. The researchers identified 
medicine availability as the reason this dimension received a lower score than the others. Additionally, the delay in 
the release of laboratory results was found to be an attribute with which the patients were not satisfied.  
The process identified nurse triage as the main bottleneck of the operation. Most patients spend more time in this 
process, while the next patients, since the hospital has a “first-come, first-served” policy, need to wait for their turn in 
the triage. The average wait time for patients before receiving the service that they required was determined to be 
three hours. Overall, they need to stay in the system for more than 4 hours, including their time in operation. The main 
issue in the OPD has been identified as a lack of healthcare workers, which is why patients must wait longer for the 
services they require.  
By imposing the proposed process layout and having additional health workers, the researchers were able to determine 
the difference between the existing and proposed layout in terms of the patient's time and state in the system. It is 
found that there is an 86% increase in the total number of patients that the OPD can accommodate under the proposed 
system. Also, there is a 40%, 6%, and 46% decrease in the time of patients in the system, in operations, and in waiting. 
According to the current state of the patients, there is a 101% increase in the percentage of patients who are moving 
in logic, a 57% increase in the percentage of patients who are in operation, and a 26% decrease in the percentage of 
patients who are waiting.

Abstract 
Sleep deprivation is noted as one of the prevalent causes of disrupted circadian rhythms, especially to students and 
young adults. In a local perspective, around 46% of Filipinos do not get adequate sleep, and 32% stated that they get 
less than six hours of sleep per day (National Nutrition Council  2021). A survey from Sleep Cycle found out that 
Filipinos spent between 6 hours and 30 minutes and 6 hours and 45 minutes of sleep on average. This study discussed 
how the sleep quality and task workload of undergraduate and graduate students taking up different courses offered 
by the University of Santo Tomas affected their academic performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study 
measured the seven components of sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the five components 
of task workload through the NASA Task Load Index (NASATLX), and the age, gender, and year level of the 
respondents. The academic performance of the respondents was measured through their General Weighted Average 
(GWA) for two academic years. The correlation among the variables was then determined using the multiple linear 
regression analysis. After thorough analysis of the results, it was concluded that age was a significant factor that 
affected the academic performance of graduate and undergraduate students.

1. Introduction
The 2016 Healthy Living Index Survey, as cited by the National Nutrition Council (2021), found that 46% of Filipinos 
do not get adequate sleep, and 32% stated that they get less than six hours of sleep per day. Moreover, sleep deprivation 
affects a person's performance and health, specifically blood pressure and reaction time (Patrick et al. 2017). 
According to Sleep Cycle's recent survey, an application that monitors people's hours of sleep, Filipinos were spending 
6 hours and 30 minutes to 6 hours and 45 minutes of sleep per day. (PH Ranks 4th in Sleep Deprivation in the World 
– Survey 2019). This study’s aim was to lessen sleep deprivation cases in the Philippines by contributing to the sleep
studies available in the country. The Philippines ranked the 4th spot and other countries experiencing sleep deprivation 
based on a recent study conducted by Sleep Cycle. In addition, the study aims to be a channel that experts can use to
understand the circadian rhythm of college students here in the country and lessen the amount of sleep deprivation

On the other hand, the relationship between age and the academic performance of graduate students was found to have 
a positive correlation as seen in the Unstandardized B value in Table 8. This indicates that the academic performance 
of graduate students increases as they age.  
 
6. Conclusion  
To conclude, academic performance is not affected by a student’s sleep quality and task workload, but is however, 
affected by age. The results achieved the main objective of the study, which was to determine the correlation among 
the aforementioned variables. In addition to this objective, the study was able to discover the conditions of students in 
terms of their academic performance, sleep quality, and task workload.

Abstract 
 
This paper investigates and analyses the features of sustainable warehousing by conducting a systematic literature 
review (SLR) to create a significant insight of the expanding and growing trends of sustainable warehousing, to fit 
perfectly within the net-zero supply chain strategies and adapting to the new value adding practices of Industry 5.0.   
Using a set of 65 publications, including journal papers, conference papers, and reviews, for the last 10 years, 
between 2013 and 2023, the SLR highlights and considers several green logistics areas that are essential to help 
redesign the features of sustainable warehouses. The paper also emphasizes the need for further research to develop 
new models for warehouses that can be implemented in the Industry 5.0 supply chain to achieve net-zero goals. In 
other words, the paper is trying to understand the current state of sustainable warehousing and identify areas where 
improvements can be made to make warehouses more sustainable and environmentally friendly, and to help the 
industry move towards a net-zero supply chain. Additionally, the paper is suggesting that there is a need for more 
research to be done to create new models for warehouses that can be applied in the Industry 5.0 supply chain, in 
order to reach net-zero goals.

1. Introduction  
Warehouses are major contributors to the rise of carbon emissions in supply chains. Thus, it is not shocking that the 
consideration of scholarly research to sustainable warehousing has been growing in recent years. 
 
The contribution of warehouses to the creation of carbon and other greenhouse gases (GHG) and their impact climate 
change can no longer be unseen. Warehousing activities contribute almost 11% of the total GHG emissions caused by 
the activities and operations of the logistics industries across the whole world (Doherty and Hoyle, 2009). Therefore, 
organizations are taking considerations to environmental and social issues of warehouses other than the economic 
objective. As these two aspects of sustainability have been neglected as important measures by many organizations 
(Elkington, 1998).  
 
The remainder of this paper addresses the following topics: the research methodology is explained in Section 2 
followed by an overview of published literature and outcomes leading to the main features of a sustainable 
warehouse in Section 3; Section 4 discusses the possibilities of the implementation of the model in the era of 
industry 5.0; and finally, Section 5 delivers the conclusions. 
 
2. Research Methodology  
Systematic literature review (SLR) is a structured methodological technique to reach a profound understanding and 
insights about specific topics (Briner and Denyer, 2012). SLR has become one of the main methodologies applied for 
evidence-based practice (Hohenstein et al., 2015). This study examines published literature by applying an SLR 
approach adapted from the five-step guideline by Garza-Reyes (2015). Figure 1 offers an overview of the SLR.

Abstract 
 
Companies seek to utilise sustainability strategies to gain a competitive advantage and improve their performance. 
This research focuses on the role that sustainability plays in companies and its impacts on the firm performance and 
competitive advantage by taking Ikea as a case study. Ikea has made significant efforts to promote sustainability. 
The environment and local communities have benefited greatly from it. Ikea creates a variety of environmentally 
friendly items, such as those that conserve water or energy. It has also adopted new packaging techniques that can 
cut down on shipping and emissions. Additionally, many of Ikea's stores, shopping centres, etc. now have solar 
panels installed. Ikea engages in several sustainability strategies that are effective in preserving resources. Despite 
all of Ikea's environmental initiatives, the research revealed that Ikea sees sustainability as a competitive advantage. 
However, focusing on other sustainability practices in the future may have a positive impact on the company's 
performance. Starting with customer awareness of and interest in sustainable development, as well as customer 
satisfaction with the company's sustainable products, the impact may be felt over a longer period.

2732","1. Healthy and Sustainable Living 
For the goals of ""healthy and sustainable living"", IKEA use households as a perfect example that use 1/3rd of global 
energy and 10% of water. IKEA enabled people in generating renewable energy instead of water consumption and 
home energy that would have a significant impact on environmental sustainability (Edvardsson and Enquist, 2011). 
In this manner, the consumer base expected IKEA to have made a living more sustainable and innovative. Besides 
that, IKEA in the catering and food industry ensures nutritious and healthy food. According to IKEA (2018), the 
company had been sustainably offering resources and energy efficiency, and in future, the company has the aim to 
influence the mindsets of customers toward healthy living. The company aims for 2030 and committed to creating a 
social movement, enabling, and inspiring people towards a healthy lifestyle and promote sustainable consumption 
(Frödpromoting Lawrence, 2010). 
 
2. Circular and Climate Positive 
To remain environmental-friendly, IKEA has focused on preserving natural resources. According to IKEA (2018), 
fisheries and agriculture, pressure on forests, loss of wildlife and biodiversity are and profoundly being affected by 
an organisation's operations. To develop “people, planet and planet positive”, IKEA has developed responsible 
programs to ensure improve and efficient use of scarce improves. By the year 2030, IKEA aims to transform into a 
circular business that uses sustainable ways of using resources, to become climate positive, and regenerate resources 
(Jones and Comfort, 2020). 
 
3. Fair and Equal 
IKEA has always looked forward to challenging inequality within society. Thus, IKEA has embraced change in a 
way to make people's lives better. IKEA has been producing decent and fair products to create a ""fair and equal"" 
society. By 2030, IKEA aims to provide and support meaningful and reasonable products throughout the value 
chain, to become an inclusive business and to promote equality (Bookman and Hall, 2022). 
 
Conclusion 
Ikea has extensively switched with sustainability. It has done a lot to preserve communities and the environment. 
Regarding the Sustainable Development Goals framework, Ikea produces a range of sustainable products, for 
example, products that save energy or water, it has also employed new packaging ways which can reduce the 
number of shipments, and thus, reduce emissions. Additionally, Ikea has installed solar panels in many of their 
stores, shopping centres, etc. there are many sustainability practices that Ikea uses which are really contributing to 
sustaining res 
Despite all the sustainability practices that are followed by Ikea, the research found that sustainability is considered 
as a competitive advantage of Ikea. But it can be in the future may focus on other sustainability practices may 
positively affect the firm perform that performance, starting from customer’s awareness and interest in sustainable 
development, and customer satisfaction with the company’s sustainable products, the impact may be noticed in a 
longer time.

Abstract 
The study aims to develop an application that, conditioned on an image, generates a Filipino news article that is similar 
to a real article. It explores the capabilities of current NLP algorithms for language generation in the low-resource 
Filipino language. In order to carry out the study, a dataset of Filipino news articles with accompanying images will 
be collected. With this, the study also sets out to publish a dataset for conditional language generation in the Filipino 
language.

1. Introduction
Natural language generation is a powerful AI technology that has many useful applications today. It is being used 
commercially with voice assistants, chatbots, automated journalism, summarizing medical records, etc. The study is 
investigating the capabilities of current NLP algorithms in the under researched area of text generation in the Filipino 
language. It specifically investigates current approaches to conditional language generation, where the computer 
application generates text using some context, such as with machine translation or text summarization.  
There have been many previous papers in the field of NLP for the Filipino language. There has been previous work 
in NLP tasks for text classification (Cruz & Cheng 2020), part-of-speech tagging (Nocon & Borra 2016), and named-
entity recognition (Cruz et al. 2018) to name a few. There has also been a few research on text generation and language 
modeling (Cruz et al.  2020). However, there has been no research on conditional language generation for the Filipino 
language. There does currently exist an unlabeled corpora for Filipino called WikiText-TL-39 and a Filipino news 
article dataset called NewsPH although the news articles in that do not have associated images with them. The Filipino 
language suffers from data scarcity which makes it difficult to develop NLP applications for it. 
The research will be carried out to develop an application that will generate Filipino news articles. The research will 
be beneficial to future researchers in NLP as this study explores the capabilities of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) 
neural network architectures with a low resource language like Filipino on conditional language generation. A dataset 
for conditional language generation will be created for this study which can be used for further research with various 
other NLP tasks with the Filipino language. 
1.1. Objectives 
The study aims to utilize a Transformer architecture to develop an application that when given an image, generates a 
Filipino news article relating to that image that would be similar to a real article. A dataset consisting of Filipino news 
articles and associated images will be collected to be used as training data for the model. A previously pre-trained

The news articles gathered have four main components: Title, Body, Image, and Category. They can be used in many 
different combinations to explore different tasks. Some of these tasks are: 
●
Abstractive Summarization - Generation of a summary of a text from its main ideas, not by copying verbatim.
Given the article body, generate a title.
●
Prompt-conditional Language Generation - Generation of text from a pre-specified text prompt. Given the
article title, generate a body.
●
Text Classification - Assign a set of predefined categories to text. Given the article title and body, classify
the category.
●
Text-conditional Image Generation - Generation of an image from a text prompt. Given the article title and
body, generate an image.
5. Conclusions and Future Research
We developed a Transformer-based language model that was fine-tuned on Filipino news articles and images. For 
both image-conditional and class-conditional language generation tasks we were able to observe improved results 
compared to baseline models and show that current NLP architectures are capable of working with the low-resource 
Filipino language for conditional language generation. Future work may employ other recent architectures that have 
emerged in the fields of image captioning, visual storytelling, and similar fields. 
The dataset gathered for this study can be used to explore many other different NLP tasks for the Filipino language. 
Image-conditional language generation and text-conditional image generation in particular are two NLP tasks that this 
dataset has made possible that wasn’t feasible to explore before with the current datasets. This research along with the 
dataset intends to aid future work on NLP with Filipino and other low-resource languages.

Abstract 
The Pasahero application will be developed as part of this research with the intention of enhancing 
commuters' productivity, efficiency, and level of customer service. Our study's main objectives are to 
shorten wait times at bus stops where people use the Pasahero app to time their walk to a stop or station, 
reduce travel times where users can adjust their travel schedules in accordance with the time provided 
by the Pasahero app, and boost transit use where users are content with the shorter wait and travel times. 
The ""Design Thinking"" methodology is used by researchers and designers to pinpoint issues and generate 
solutions, while it explores what might be and generates desired results that are beneficial to the end user 
using logic, creativity, intuition, and experience. The Input-Process-Output (IPO) model offers a 
framework for a life-cycle analysis approach that identifies performance indicators and standards for 
evaluating the use of nanomaterials to increase a system's sustainability. The data was collected with a 
survey. Using a four-point grading scale, testing the functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, 
maintainability, and portability. And the results show that users strongly agree that it meets all of these 
factors of the Pasahero application.

1. Introduction
Public transportation is a vital part of the community. There are a bunch of benefits for having great 
public transportation. For every ten million dollars of transit investment made, business sales increase 
by thirty million dollars. During the 2006 to 2011 period, residential property was an average of 42% 
more valuable if located near high-frequency transit service, which means cities reap greater tax revenues 
(Breggren 2017). Good public transportation gives an economic boost to the cities.  
In this modern era in the Philippines, vehicles are very common. People tend to buy their own vehicles 
due to the fact that the Philippines have a bad public transportation system. Commuters cannot trust the 
reliability of the public transportation system. Also, having too many vehicles on the road will create 
congestion and traffic. According to CNN Philippines, The Philippines is now losing ₱3.5 billion a day 
due to traffic congestion in Metro Manila, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) said 
Thursday. In its 2014 report partnering with the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA), 
the country suffered ₱2.4 billion losses daily due to Metro Manila traffic. The report then projected ₱3.5

location have been used for the Clark area specifically, and with the improvement of future studies that 
will be conducted off of this study can expound the limits of the chosen area. The limits in terms of 
software can also be improved. With the applications’ functions expressed in this study, future 
researchers can make use of evolving the processes to achieve more efficiency and stability when using 
the application.  
 
6. Conclusion  
Transportation has really become a vital part of the community and so has the progression of today’s 
technology. Using technology with transportation in the Philippines has only been familiar with the 
common modes of transportation such as taxis, compact vehicles, and airplanes. Having programs and 
apps for buses are very uncommon. As the common transportation such as jeepneys, and tricycles, do 
not have the need to apply such technology. But technology will continue to be a part of people’s 
everyday lives and there will be a time that the need for technology will be adapted in different aspects 
of transportation in this case. This research has proven that this application can help commuters that ride 
the bus as their daily mode of transportation. It helps finding specific routes for different commuters and 
also providing certain information needed in order for the commute to succeed.

Abstract 
This study is to investigate the effect of human resource competence on the quality of accounting information systems 
and their impact on the quality of financial reports in State-Owned Enterprises in Indonesia. The data were analyzed 
using the Structural Equation Model (SEM)-LISREL method. The results of the study indicate that the competence of 
human resources has a positive effect on the quality of accounting information systems. Higher competence in human 
resources will increase the quality of the accounting information system. Likewise, when the quality of the accounting 
information system increases, the quality of financial reports will also get better. The competence of human resources 
has a positive influence on improving the quality of financial reports. Overall, the influence of human resource 
competence plays an important role in improving the quality of financial reports either directly or indirectly through 
the quality of accounting information systems as an intervening variable.

Abstract 
The study of sustainability and renewable energy is very important in the present decade, as they help achieve the 
countries' sustainable development goals by 2030. Education, science, technology, and innovation play an essential 
role in supporting the growth and quality of sustainable development. Therefore, in the present work, we aim to study 
the impact of school enrollment (SE) and GDP on clean energy usage in various countries. The data are downloaded 
from the World Data Bank. The results are obtained by applying descriptive and inferential statistical methods. The 
results reveal that SE and GDP are negatively correlated with renewable energy consumption (REC). The regression 
analyses are also performed to explain the renewable energy by the two variables. Different regression models are 
compared, and it is concluded that cubic regression models can be used to predict REC based on SE and GDP. 
Keywords 
Renewable energy consumption, Sustainable development goals, Regression analyses, School enrolment, GDP. 
1. Introduction
The industry has entered a new phase with the latest Industry 4.0 solutions (Zhang et al. 2021), in which digitalization 
of manufacturing processes, circular economy, and sustainability play important roles. The digital revolution, 
sustainability, climate protection, and closing material cycles have become the leading drivers for transformation and 
development from globalization and specialization toward digitalization and a circular economy (Mohan and 
Katakojwala 2021). Education, science, technology, and innovation also play an important role in supporting the 
growth and quality of sustainable development. With the advancements in economic developments, consumption, in 
general, has also been increasing, including the consumption of energy, particularly electric energy (Kwilinski 2018). 
Several sectors have reported high electric energy consumption (Kwilinski 2018). The industrial sector occupies the 
top of this list. The transport sector and households are as well leading in electric energy consumption. 
The main issue with the increasing tendency of global energy consumption concerns environmental pollution and 
climate change. Therefore, many countries consider the possibility of using renewable energy and green innovation 
technologies. It is of great interest to study the development of renewable energy sources and consumption, as they 
offer the possibility to substitute fossil fuels and they can help in reducing CO2 emissions (Miskiewicz 2021). As 
explored by UNESCO in their Science Report (UNESCO, 2015), education plays a vital role in achieving the 2030 
Agenda for Sustainable Development goals. Education helps increase the quality of the economies, and researchers 
greatly contribute to improving innovative technologies. The Science Report of UNESCO (2021) pointed out the 
importance of gross domestic expenditure on research and development. With the help of such support, researchers 
have published more than 150 thousand scientific works on modern technologies, including artificial intelligence, 
energy, biotechnology, etc. The importance of renewable energy is the focus of many researchers, particularly the 
study of factors that might influence the level of renewable energy consumption.

5.2 Proposed Improvements 
In both of the models, although the R2 are not high enough, they are the highest of the models that only GDP and SE 
are considered. The main reason for observing relatively low R2 values is the effect of factors that are not presented 
in the models.  
 
6. Conclusion 
The study's main objective is to investigate how education and countries’ economy contributes to the use of clean 
energy in different countries. We considered secondary school enrollment and GDP as the indicators for the factors, 
and the results show that SE negatively and significantly impacts renewable energy consumption. Also, the results 
show that when the GDP increases, then REC also decreases which means GDP has a negative impact on REC. The 
regression analysis results show that the cubic regression model is the best model that can be used to explain the REC 
by SE compared to the other nonlinear regression models. Similarly, the cubic regression model with log 
transformation of the independent variable is the best fit for the REC based on the GDP.  
This study is limited to 2 variables. Although these variables impact renewable energy consumption, the R2 values 
and model results show that new variables should be added to the models.

Abstract 
The use of photogrammetry in the manufacturing process is one of the most promising quality control techniques in 
the industry. In this paper, we Assess the possibility of integrating scanning technology, namely, Spider 3D scanner 
and inspection software called Control-X software to aid local aerospace manufacturing company in the development 
of their inspection and quality control process. The Spider 3D scanner is an example of the evolving technology that 
was found useful to our research project. The scanner can extract the measurements of parts providing readings with 
high accuracy up to three decimal places without any errors. In addition, the Control-X software is used for several 
applications, however, inspection features such as reverse engineering and quality control features are found possible 
using the integration of these two technologies. As comparing between the conventional methods and the latest 
photogrammetry technology is used to develop this research. The results of this research project show that 
measurements are accurate and within the acceptable range of error in terms of linear geometric features. On the other 
hand, Photogrammetry is found superior compared to manual methods in terms of inspection of form and shape 
geometrical features dimensions such as, length, thickness, and various other feature of interest.

1. Introduction
The aviation industry is one of the most important industries, connecting people and cultures across continents. The 
growth of the aviation sector has always been increasing annually, and it is estimated to have an average increase of 
4.3% for the next 20 years. Assuring the safety of the passengers, cargo, and goods is an issue of high importance, 
therefore, maintaining a high quality of manufactured plane parts is crucial.  
Utilizing the latest advancements in technology is essential to sustain the continuous growth of the industry. One of 
the latest advancements is the 3D scanning technology, it is the process of analyzing and collecting data from an object 
and transforming it into a 3D model. Like a camera, a 3D scanner collects color data with the addition of distance 
data, using three-dimensional positioning, the data is then processed by the integrated software to produce 3D model 
which contains both color and distance details.

6. Conclusion  
• 
The researched showed positive results as the combination of 3D scanners and the Control-X software were 
very effective in terms of being fast, efficient, accurate, and flexible. Spider 3D scanner was an example of 
the evolving technology that was found successful choice to implement the proposed photogrammetry 
approach. It demonstrates clear potential to help the company I their quality inspection department, save them 
effort and money. 
• 
Meanwhile the Control-X software is found very suitable for the case of the researched company; because of 
its flexibility, diversity of applications, and providing solutions that serves what the company needs; like 
quality control and reverse engineering solutions. Spider 3D scanner along with Control-X software are fast 
to setup and get on the go, they also can be used on the manufacturing line. The applications of 
photogrammetry are wide and implementing it in manufacturing is believed to increase the efficiency and 
the accuracy of the inspection and quality control process.  
• 
Based on the result and experience gained in this research project, it is recommended to use photogrammetry 
in quality control inspection for manufacturing industries. Though the scope of this research project is 
inspection of supplied parts. Yet, the application of photogrammetry can be extended easily to online 
inspection directly on the production line. Aerospace and similar industries might need further certification 
of this technology, while other industries can implement it directly.

Abstract 
The paper discusses the problems of cyber-attacks on supply chain management systems in different sectors and 
industries. It causes high severity and economic losses. Along with various technical terms, the countermeasure 
technique, both theoretically and in application, are discussed. If developed countermeasures are applied in every 
sector, it will reduce the cyberattack problem on supply chain management systems. It will create more job 
opportunities, more secure information, more awareness among people, and more economic generation for any 
country.

Introduction 
1.1 Supply Chain Management 
It is defined as managing everything like the materials, information and services used in the process(es) that are 
concerned with the supply chain and its associates. Supply chain is a crucial factor in manufacturing of a material. 
1.2 Cyberattack 
A cyber-attack can be termed a value chain attack in which an infiltration from an outside source tries to access the 
system and misinterprets the data. It is one of the risks on the supply chain creating a loss of public resources and 
bringing various levels of structural instability to the organization and the public. 
2. Problem/ opportunity explored: Risks in management of supply chain due to cyberattack?
2.1 Research questions/ Objectives 
1) How to prevent cyberattacks in supply chain management in different sectors?
2) How to catch up with cyber attackers while managing the supply chain?
3) How to develop a managing technique for self-proofing the supply chain against cyberattacks?
2.2 Methodology 
Step 1: This review is done by searching conference papers and journals from Google Scholar and MavScholar, an 
online search platform by the Minnesota State University, Mankato (MNSU) library. While searching in Google 
scholar regarding my assigned topic of research, it showed about 22k papers including articles from conference and 
journals. So, I customized my search years from 2000 to 2022 available on the left side control panel, then it started 
showing around 17.5k papers. This amount of paper was reduced to 17.2k papers when the search year is from 2010 
to 2022. The summary from the papers is in discontinuous form. Information is first taken from the keywords and then 
sorted as per the relevance of the given topic. Similarly, data from Mavscholar are taken from articles, books, 
magazines, videos, maps, and newspapers in addition to journals and conference paper. 
Step 2: The flowchart for screening of paper for literature review is as shown:

of the technology at reduced prices and continuous supply. Apart from the manufacturing industry, this concept can 
be implemented in transportation, power, and energy-based industries, including the smart industrial sectors (Zainab 
Fatima, 2022). Previous analysis has shown that cyber security cannot be fully done by using Firewalls, antivirus 
software, and other technology for the protection of personal data and computer networks. The awareness about cyber 
ethics, cyber safety, and cyber security needs to be raised early in the education sector. The features of getting security 
from cybercrimes are technology, operation and awareness, training, and education (Priti Saxena  2012). 
 
4. Results 
The literature reviews the problems of cyber-attacks on supply chain management systems in different sectors and 
industries. The countermeasure technique, both theoretically and in the application, has developed and needs to be 
applied in every sector. 
 
5. Discussion 
My finding on a cyberattack on supply chain management systems in different industries and relative sectors is that it 
causes high severity and economic losses. Society needs to be more aware of this topic through online resources, 
debates, quizzes, and other marketing platforms. The future of counter-measuring the cyber-attack in supply chain 
management is very advanced as it will create more job opportunities, more secure information, more awareness 
among people, and more economic generation for any country. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This piece focuses on remodeling and resolution making of network for the supply chain after a cyber-attack in which 
crucial services are lost. The administrator is the chief in charge of taking any resolution for the restoration of the 
supply network. The modeling is done in two steps: 1) Determining the previous damages by the administrator to get 
the complete data; 2) Randomly determining programming which involves different recovery cases. Using a literature 
survey, a real case study is developed. The results of steps 1 and 2 are contrasted, which shows that the deterministic 
model in an unpredictable case does not generate good solutions; hence a stochastic programming model is suitable 
in uncertain cases (Emily A Heath  2018).

Abstract 
In the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreements, United States has continued to enforce trade agreements with 
many countries through the World Trade Organization (WTO), with 14 of the 20 countries being active participants 
in these agreements. Free trade agreements (FTAs) have grown in importance as essential trade agreements that 
facilitate trade negotiations among member countries. These FTAs could have a wide range of positive effects, 
including the ability to strengthen a country's overall economy and open new economic opportunities. Whether they 
support or oppose trade agreements, economists can agree that they are good for the economy. Trade agreements, in 
a brief, are the ""rules of the road"" that guide American companies on how to do international business while 
simultaneously defending American interests and utilizing international trade regulations.  According to recent data, 
the US has continued to enter trade deals with several other countries, including the UK, Mexico, and Canada. One of 
the most important trade agreements for the US in recent years is the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement 
(USMCA), which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) provides a crucial framework for 
commercial relations with these neighboring nations. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade 
and Investment Partnership (TTIP), two other recent trade deals, intended to improve trade ties between countries in 
the Pacific Rim and the European Union, respectively. Businesses in the United States can sign a variety of trade 
agreements, including Free Trade Agreements, Agreements with the World Trade Organization, Suspension 
Agreements, Bilateral Investment Treaties, Agreements on Intellectual Property Rights, Trade Agreement Guides, and 
the Florence Agreement Program. The purpose of this paper is to provide valuable insights into the benefits and 
drawbacks of these trade agreements and their long-term effects on the US economy and future generations. 
Keywords 
Free trade agreements with the US, trade agreements, bilateral trade agreements, future of free trade agreements, the 
impact of free trade agreements 
Introduction  
There are several ways that the country's overall economic conditions are impacted when businesses are permitted to 
trade internationally. Businesses may perceive it as both profitable and detrimental. The enforcement of FTAs results 
in an increase in manufacturing output and manufacturer competition, which in turn creates job opportunities. 
However, as competition rises, small businesses tend to shrink. Products of higher quality and lower prices are 
available to consumers. As a result, although trade expansion may not be beneficial to all workers and businesses, 
economists agree that it can be more beneficial. Trade agreements are done keeping economic and political gains in 
mind. Therefore, establishing free trade agreements is a difficult process. Free trade would be an optimal trade policy 
for any country involved with the production. However, the process of free trade becomes complex if, for example, a 
larger country tries to manipulate the trade terms which leaves the trading partner country with a weaker hand. 
Additionally, free trade agreements can lead to an increase in environmental damage as countries may be incentivized 
to lower their environmental standards to remain competitive. To protect such instances, trade agreements are created. 
Trade agreements become difficult to comprehend and implement due to the complexity of a nation's production and 
economic power. To create trade agreements that are in everyone's best interest, economists and political bodies have 
conducted extensive research for many years. The United States economy has benefited from free trade agreements 
(FTAs) in several ways, including reduced tariffs, improved intellectual property protection, and new opportunities 
for trading production with partner nations.

2276","instance, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was viewed as a means for the United States to strengthen its relations 
with the Asia-Pacific region and counter China's growing influence. The Trump administration's withdrawal from the 
TPP, however, brought attention to the difficulties in maintaining political support for FTAs. The current situation 
makes it simpler for member nations to trade goods and boost their national incomes at the same time. The impact of 
BFTAs on trade size will have a direct impact on economic growth in developing economies. Since the advantages of 
FTAs have influenced most governments in the past, we can anticipate a positive future for them.  
Conclusion 
In general, the evidence indicates that FTAs have benefited the American economy. They have contributed to lower 
prices for American consumers and have boosted growth and employment. Better policies ought to be implemented 
by political parties in order for these benefits to continue. Due to different views on trade agreements, this is still 
uncertain. As a result of trade negotiations and open trading agreements, member nations have seen economic, 
political, and production growth. By examining the overall effects of FTAs with the United States, this study 
contributes to the existing body of research on the topic. The United States of America and its allies have demonstrated 
economic and political expansion, as well as an increase in imports and commodities. The impact on a smaller business 
in the economy and the formation of a group of opponents are key outcomes here. We have observed that, in the grand 
scheme of things, free trade regulations benefit the majority of businesses, and smaller businesses can pivot or expand 
to maintain market relevance. Trade agreements are a crucial tool for nations seeking to promote prosperity and 
economic growth. To balance the interests of all parties, they must be properly developed.  
 
By its participation in organizations such as the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, the United States has been a pioneer in advocating free trade. It will be essential for nations to keep 
cooperating to develop trade policies that are advantageous to all parties as the global economy develops. Dealing 
with issues related to environmental and labor standards is one of the major difficulties in FTA negotiations. FTAs 
have the potential to enhance economy, but there is also a chance that they may lead to worsening labor conditions 
and environmental deterioration. To address these issues, there has been an increasing focus on including labor and 
environmental measures in recent years. For instance, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has 
clauses that protect the environment and the rights of workers by, among other things, mandating Mexico to tighten 
its labor laws and undertake pollution control measures. By addressing social and environmental issues, these clauses 
can ensure that FTAs encourage sustainable and equitable growth. 
 
FTAs have emerged as a popular mechanism for enhancing economic growth and fostering closer political ties 
between countries. While some of these agreements primarily focus on boosting trade and the economy, others are 
aimed at improving diplomatic relations between nations. Future research on this topic should examine the impact of 
such agreements both before and after their implementation, taking into account political changes that could affect 
their success. It is important to assess which industries stand to benefit the most from these agreements, to identify 
potential areas of growth and expansion. For example, the United States has recently shown an increased interest in 
executing trade agreements with smaller nations. Such agreements hold promise for the future of economic growth 
and closer political ties within the United States and its partners. However, the success of these agreements is often 
contingent upon the prevailing government's political stance, making it imperative to consider the broader political 
context when evaluating their impact. To fully understand the effects of these agreements on economic growth and 
diplomatic relations, more research is necessary to assess their effectiveness in different regions and industries. 
Policymakers can use these insights to make informed decisions and ensure that free trade agreements promote 
sustainable economic growth and foster closer political ties between nations.

Abstract 
This paper presents a systematic review of halal practices on the topic of halal food supply chain (HFSC). HFSC is a 
developing concept (since 2010) as a development of the classic supply chain concept due to the increasing awareness 
to provide halal food for Muslim and non-Muslim customers. This study has reviewed 120 papers (60 empirical 
papers) and provides four main findings. First, from a theoretical point of view, the theory of planned behavior, the 
theory of reasoned action, and the arc integration approach are the most widely used theories to study halal practices 
in HFSC. Second, the choice of quantitative methods dominates empirical papers on Halal Practices in HFSC studies. 
Third, the majority of Halal Practice Studies at HFSC are conducted in Muslim countries with the food and beverage 
industry as the main sector studied. Fourth, based on the results of social network analysis, halal practices in the HFSC 
study are grouped into three research themes, namely issues related to HFSC and food issues. This study suggests a 
future research agenda such as elaborating theoretical and methodological aspects by examining three research themes. 
This paper will contribute to the HSC body of knowledge.

1. Introduction
The Halal trend is currently experiencing rapid development and has penetrated various countries, especially food 
(Tieman  2020). The halal market offers an alternative amidst the hustle and bustle of conventional market segments, 
both in Muslim and non-Muslim countries. Its popularity is increasing due to the increasing demand for high quality, 
safety and concern for environmental issues. Muslim people choose Halal products because of religious requirements

the antecedents of the intention to consume halal products. The use of existing theory is often independent of the 
purpose of the HFSC study. The main aim of the existing studies at HFSC is theory testing. To provide a 
comprehensive understanding of the HFSC phenomenon, or combine minus two relevant theories/approaches for the 
future. Also, explore or understand product processes using more process-oriented theories. In addition, exploring or 
understanding halal product processes by utilizing more process-oriented theories (such as dynamic capabilities, 
institutional theory, stakeholder theory) is an interesting agenda for research. future). 
Second, related to research methodology, most of the research uses quantitative methods with surveys as the main 
data collection while qualitative methods are rarely used as well as modeling. As indicated in the previous suggestions, 
there is a need to understand how and why organizations adopt and apply HFSC principles, a more inductive approach 
or interpretivist paradigm such as multiple case studies or phenomenology etc. is essential. Third, our results show 
that most of the research was conducted in the food and beverage industry, especially in Muslim countries such as 
Malaysia and Indonesia. Relatively little is done for other sectors such as halal infrastructure, tourism and hospitality, 
financial services, health, beauty, pharmaceuticals, public education, real estate, and toiletries. In addition, other 
Muslim countries or non-Muslim countries and combined with various relevant potential sectors to be explored for 
future research agendas. Finally, our research identified three groups of research themes that are also relevant for 
further research. For example, future research could focus on some of the possible topics such as examining more in 
depth the potential relationship between the supply chain and HFSC, exploring in detail issues related to Halal 
practices within HFSC, or focusing more on factors related to support systems for HFSC implementation.

Abstract 
This study presents the life cycle assessment of various power generation technologies based. The assessments cover 
impacts from extraction, processing and transportation of fuels, construction of power plants   and power generation. 
Life-cycle assessment (LCA) to power generation technologies is very useful as the world seeks ways to meet growing 
electricity demand with less health and environmental impacts. LCA is an evolving methodology with several barriers 
and challenges but has helped in improving the understanding of the lifecycle energy, greenhouse gas emissions, air 
pollutant emissions, and water-use implications to power generation. The application of LCA tools facilitates an 
analytically thorough and environmentally holistic approach in assessment and comparison of power generation 
technologies. Most LCAs show that the best power plants are hydropower, both run-of-river and with reservoir, 
nuclear energy, and   wind power. Fuel combustion directly leads to emissions and potential environmental harm. The 
cradle-to-grave approach considers all steps between material and fuel extraction from the environment until they are 
returned to the environment. The methodology used in lifecycle assessment (LCA) includes the effects of all the 
production phases, use and recycling on the environment. The complete LCA involves factors like water and air 
pollution, and noise. Exergy which is the maximum useful work that can be extracted from a system as it reversibly 
comes into equilibrium is used in various fields such as industrial ecology and environmental engineering, for efficient 
use of energy and to minimize harmful environmental impacts. Exergy analysis has been in application since the late 
1990s and is extended into the realm of resource and environmental analysis, to develop integrated analytical 
frameworks. Exergy analysis can be used in decision-making by policy makers in making sustainable choices. 
 
Key words: Energy payback ratio; emissions factor; exergy assessment; greenhouse gas emission; lifecycle 
assessment; LCA; sustainability assessment. 
 
1. Introduction 
Energy is an essential resource for modern society used for many applications like lighting, transport, communication, 
heating, air conditioning, manufacturing among others. The evaluation of energy production technologies considers 
all aspects like energy and raw-materials consumptions, energy efficiency, and environmental impacts must be 
considered. The environmental impact is an  important factor in the evaluation of  power generation 
technologies(Petrescu et al., 2017).  Electricity systems account for 38% of primary energy use globally and are set to 
rapidly grow as demand for electricity-based services increases such as looking, lighting, sanitation, heating and 
cooling, and information and communications. The current global electricity mix is dominated by fossil fuels led by 
coal, natural gas, nuclear, and petroleum which are all nonrenewable (Edenhofer et al., 2013; Moses J. B.  Kabeyi & 
Oludolapo A. Olanrewaju, 2022).      
           Assessment tools like the  Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Exergy Analysis (ExA), and Emergy Analysis (EmA) 
are used to account for  sustainability indicators in  social, environmental,  and  economic, dimensions, and hence are 
applied to  carry out assessments  under these three dimensions (Cano-Londoño et al., 2022).  Life cycle assessment 
(LCA) is a holistic approach applied in evaluating the environmental impacts of products and systems through their 
entire life. Life cycle analysis is needed to foster the development of energy technologies in a sustainable manner 
(Moses Jeremiah Barasa Kabeyi & Oludolapo Akanni Olanrewaju, 2022c; Paredes et al., 2019). Life cycle 
assessment (LCA) is a decision support tool which assesses environmental burdens of products and processes right 
from materials extraction to disposal popularly referred to as cradle-to-grave or even cradle-to-cradle. For accuracy, 
the power generation life cycle assessments should better characterize spatial and temporal characteristics(Jordaan et

Abstract 
Energy storage systems provide an important solution for improving the reliability of electricity networks due to 
challenges of integrating intermittent electricity from variable sources like wind and solar. Factors considered in the 
selection of storage batteries are cost and performance since. prices for every kWh injected into the network and 
battery energy storage system (BESS) costs vary. Energy storage systems play an important role in improving the 
reliability of electricity networks due to increasing contribution of electricity from intermittent sources like wind and 
solar. The main considerations in choosing a suitable storage system are cost and performance. Since the price for 
every kWh supplied to the network and battery energy storage system (BESS) costs are dynamic, consumers interested 
in   a battery may have challenges in choosing between the various batteries available in the market. This study presents 
a the Levelized cost of storage as a suitable method or approach for selecting the most suitable battery technology for 
household and industrial consumers. The future power plants are expected to have large proportions of intermittent 
energy sources like. wind, solar or tidal energy that require scale-up of energy storage to match the supply with hourly, 
daily, and seasonal electricity demand profiles. Available storage technologies include batteries, pumped 
hydroelectricity storage, compressed air energy storage and power-to-Gas storage. The energy transition to renewable 
energy supply calls for increased application of energy storage. Identification of   optimal solutions requires a holistic 
view of the energy system beyond the electricity-only focus. In this study, an integrated cross-sector approach is 
adopted to identify the most efficient and least-cost storage options for off grid and grid scale application.

1. Introduction 
The global increase in use of small-scale and distributed generation, and use of variable renewable have led to high 
demand for electrical energy storage systems (ESS), which applies different storage device. They include 
electrochemical storages, super capacitors, gravity   batteries   etc. The challenge is that we have no universally  
accepted economic indicator which for use in comparing  compare different energy storage systems unlike in power 
plant   planning where  “Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE)” has been accepted(Melnikov et al., 2018). Combining 
storage and renewable in a power system improves flexibility, which promotes adoption of renewable energy by 
ensuring security of the power grid. The future energy systems dominated   by renewable energy will require largescale 
and wide application of  energy storage technologies (Xu et al., 2022). 
        Grid-scale energy storage has an important role to play in the net Zero Emissions target by the year 2050 Scenario 
by providing services ranging from short-term balancing and operating reserves, provision of ancillary services for 
grid stability and deferment of capital investment in capacity increase and power distribution system extension, long-
term energy storage and grid restoration after blackouts. There are various types of energy storage systems with 
pumped-storage hydropower being the most widely used storage technology. with total installed capacity of about 
160 GW in 2021. Its global capability was about 8 500 GWh in 2020, which accounted for about 90% of total global

2756","Electricity storage is approximately 100 times more expensive than thermal storage and much more expensive 
than storage for gases and liquids. It is therefore advisable to apply thermal and fuel storage since it is cheaper and 
more efficient solution to utilise thermal and fuel storage technologies for integration of fluctuating renewable energy, 
such as wind and solar power, thane rely on electricity storage which however requires strong integration across 
different energy sectors. The cross-sector smart energy systems approach leads to better and much cheaper options in 
terms of thermal, gas and liquid fuel storage combined in a cross-sector energy conversion technology.  Use of heat 
pumps, in each building in rural areas or in district heating system in the urban areas, can efficiently connect the 
electricity sector to thermal storage, while electric vehicles and electro-fuels can interconnect the electricity sector and 
storage in the transport sector. The use of more efficient and cheaper options eliminates the need for other options in 
the electricity sector required solely for the integration of renewable energy. Large electricity storage capacity is not 
economically viable within any of the steps between now and a future 100% renewable energy supply.  
          Large-scale integration of fluctuating renewable electricity sources, and electricity storage should be avoided to 
encourage other storage types to provide optional system balancing and flexibility at lower costs. Direct electricity 
storage can be put to other applications but should not be prioritized if its objective is to supply electricity to the grid.  
Storage may not be the optimum solution to integrate large fluctuating renewable energy, since due to availability of 
more efficient and cheaper options for integration of electricity with other parts of the energy system and creation of 
a Smart Energy System. However, storage remains important for large scale integration of variable renewable to the 
electric power systems.  
        For Chinese case, studies established for application scenario of energy storage peak shaving, due to the abundant 
lead resources and mature lead-carbon battery recycling system, the initial cost of lead-carbon batteries is much lower 
than others while the LCOS of lead-carbon is about 0.84 CNY/kWh.  The LCOS of lithium iron phosphate batteries 
is about 0.94 CNY/kWh mainly because of long life cycle but high end-of-life cost. As a result of high recycling value 
and high investment cost, the vanadium redox flow technology is still evolving but has LCOS of 1.21 CNY/kWh, 
which is the highest of the three common types of batteries. 
         A possible pathway to increase the business case for electricity storage is through multiple services using the 
same device which brings multiple revenue streams also called “benefit-stacking”. The nominal power capacity is 
based on the largest service i.e., sequential stacking or the sum of all service provided at the same time i.e., parallel 
stacking. The discharge duration reflects the sum of durations required by all services for sufficient energy capacity 
when all services are needed in parallel or directly one after another. The full equivalent cycles also reflect the 
respective sum for all services provided by the system. Average electricity price could be the sum of prices captured 
during  charging for individual services weighed by the full equivalent cycles attributed to them(Schmidt et al., 2019). 
6. Conclusion  
Energy storage systems provide an important solution for improving the reliability of electricity networks due to 
challenges of integrating intermittent electricity from variable sources like wind and solar. Factors considered in the 
selection of storage batteries are cost and performance since. prices for every kWh injected into the network and 
battery energy storage system (BESS) costs vary. Energy storage systems play an important role in improving the 
reliability of electricity networks due to increasing contribution of electricity from intermittent sources like wind and 
solar. 
      Levelized cost of storage (LCOS) refers to the cost of kWh or MWh electricity discharged by a storage device 
when accounting for the entire costs incurred, and energy generated throughout the lifetime of the storage device. 
Energy storage is a high-quality flexible resource, with an important regulatory role in a high increasing the uptake of 
variable and intermittent renewable energy resources. The various elements of Levelized cost of storage are the 
Capex, Opex, charging cost, tax cost, replacement cost, and end-of-life cost. From the cost breakdown, it is indicated 
that the proportion of Capex and charging cost is the largest, while the proportion of tax cost and Opex is the smallest. 
Batteries with a short life cycle and many replacements have the highest cost.   Levelized cost of storage varies with 
different application scenarios e.g., for transmission and distribution applications LCOS is the lowest when lithium 
iron phosphate batteries ae used because the batteries only need one replacement thus take advantage long life.

2765","Therefore, improving round-trip efficiency and storage duration, reducing the unit initial investment cost, and giving 
full play to the advantages of different technology types when laying out EES can be used to reduce costs.  
         The use of LCOS is dependent on economic storage characteristics and, unlike the traditional Levelized cost of 
energy (LCOE) which also depends on the temporal characteristics of the electricity price profile. Hence an analysis 
the whole power system will provide more information than a single Levelized cost measure to compare different 
storage technologies in the electricity market.

ABSTRACT 
Energy production has several direct environmental challenges which include climate change, air pollution, water 
pollution, land contamination, thermal/heat pollution, and solid waste disposal. Energy related air pollution is a major 
environmental challenge facing urban areas.  Fuel combustion leads directly to emissions and potential environmental 
harm, while use of electricity does not lead directly to environmental impacts, but its production from fuels leads to 
emits significant quantities of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts. However, if electricity is 
produced from renewable and low carbon sources like  wind turbines , solar photovoltaic cells  and nuclear  has limited 
direct emissions compared to fossil fuels. Assessment of environmental impacts of energy carriers considers processes 
from resource extraction, its conversion into secondary energy carriers, consumption, and waste disposal or recycling. 
The cradle-to-grave approach captures all steps between extracting materials and fuels from the environment until and 
their returned to the environment. The attainment of decarburization targets and keeping global warming below 2°C 
threshold requires well-informed energy policy design. Low-carbon electricity supply for all needed to attain the 2°C-
compatible energy system, will entail electrification of most of our economy. Life cycle assessment facilitates 
evaluation of a product over its life cycle, and across various environmental indicators. Energy resources and 
technologies for power generation are a mix of renewable and nonrenewable e.g.    coal, natural gas, hydropower, 
nuclear power, concentrated solar power (CSP), photovoltaics, and wind power. Life cycle assessment is a tool used 
to evaluate the environmental impact of energy sources. One major limitation of the standard life cycle assessment 
methodology is that it ignores the impact of the impact of greenhouse gases. Life-cycle impacts decrease substantially 
when current fossil fuel technologies diminish in the energy mix, particularly coal. Natural gas use may play an 
important role during the transition while installation of new fossil options without CO2 capture should be avoided to 
minimize emissions. The endogenous integration of life-cycle indicators into energy models adds value to both life 
cycle assessment and energy systems modelling in their support in energy decision as well as policymaking for 
sustainable energy transition. 
Key Words: Greenhouse gas emissions; life cycle assessment; greenhouse gas emissions; energy 
sources. 
1. Introduction       
Globally, countries are devising low carbon energy and electricity policies as a result of the double constraint of 
depleting fossil resources and climate change from greenhouse gas emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) identified electrification of the global economy combined with the rapid decarbonization of 
the grid as a key option to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and keep global warming under 1.5°C or 2°C. The 
energy related activities ranging from extraction, conversion, intermediate and final use, are responsible for three 
quarters of greenhouse gas emissions with most of it coming from combustion of oil. gas, and coal in power 
generation(García-Gusano et al., 2016).  It is important to note that the physical bounds of planet earth are finite with 
growing need for resources leading to   environmental and social concerns. These issues include high level greenhouse 
gas emissions, climate change, water scarcity, pollution, human health, and land use. Coping measures should focus 
on reducing consumption of nonrenewable resources and   verification of their suitability in terms of sustainability. 
This is linked to the energy transformation processes taking place under these circumstances. By combining Energy 
Systems Modelling (ESM) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies produces research field for both analysts 
and energy planners(García-Gusano et al., 2016; Junne et al., 2021). A key step forward involves the endogenous 
integration of life-cycle indicators into energy system management (ESM) which is based robust optimization 
procedures(García-Gusano et al., 2016).

the highest lifecycle emissions. The production of sugarcane which produces bagasse fuel transfers about 241 kg of 
CO2 eq /ton of sugar produced. Each hectare of sugar cane transfers about 2,406 kg of CO2 equivalent per year(Baker 
& Lahre, 1977). 
6. Conclusion 
The attainment of decarburization targets and keeping global warming below 2°C threshold requires well-informed 
energy policy design. Low-carbon electricity supply for all needed to attain the 2°C-compatible energy system, will 
entail electrification of most of our economy. Life cycle assessment facilitates evaluation of a product over its life 
cycle, and across various environmental indicators. Technologies assessed include   coal, natural gas, hydropower, 
nuclear power, concentrated solar power (CSP), photovoltaics, and wind power. Life cycle assessment is a tool used 
to evaluate the environmental impact of energy sources. One major limitation of the standard life cycle assessment 
methodology is that it ignores the impact of the impact of greenhouse gases. Life-cycle impacts decrease substantially 
when current fossil fuel technologies diminish in the energy mix, particularly coal. Natural gas use may play an 
important role during the transition while installation of new fossil options without CO2 capture should be avoided to 
minimize emissions. The endogenous integration of life-cycle indicators into energy models adds value to both life 
cycle assessment and energy systems modelling in their support in energy decision as well as policymaking for 
sustainable energy transition. 
         Total life cycle GHG emissions from nuclear power and renewable energy resources are lower and generally 
less variable than those of fossil fuels. The cradle to grave, coal-fired electricity produces about 20 times more GHGs 
per kilowatt-hour than solar, wind, and nuclear electricity based on median estimates for each technology.  Renewable 
energy and low carbon energy sources play an important development of sustainable electricity system. The study 
demonstrates that renewable power has a great advantage over thermal power, among which traditional hydropower 
has the lowest GHG intensity. Solar PV power generation has a lower GHG intensity in high-radiation areas such as, 
wind power has more advantages in coastal areas and some areas with rich wind resources.  
The deployment of wind turbines and solar contribute to the climate impact of power generation. A significant 
reduction in life cycle GHG emissions is realized by deployment of wind offshore, CSP and nuclear power. 
Additionally, nuclear is a reliable base-load power plant with capacity factor greater than 0.9 but can easily cause 
considerable cost increases by up to 63% higher than possible minimum cost solution. Hydrogen can play a leading 
role in life cycle peak load supply as life cycle emissions of the power system continue to diminish. Although 
renewable energy sources have some environmental impacts, they compare favorably to fossil fuel sources   and 
therefore they remain key to the energy transition.

Abstract 
The cost of power generation and related technology is an important dimension of energy sustainability since it affects 
the final price of electricity, choice of technology mix and overall sustainability of the power system. Levelized cost 
is a simple metric hence widely used to compute the unit cost of power generated from power generation technologies. 
Limitation of the metric includes lack of consideration for key parameters like inflation, power integration costs, and 
system costs whose integration would provide a more comprehensive metric for evaluating power generation projects, 
and the entire power system.  The study showed that the Levelized costs of electricity generation for the low carbon 
technologies have reduced significantly and are now cost competitive with the conventional fossil fuel generation 
technologies although specific costs are country specific. It was demonstrated that large solar power plants supply 
cheaper power compared to onshore wind, coal power plants and natural gas power, although it may vary in some 
factors based on local condition since various factors affect the cost of generation from one place to another.  The 
capital cost of power plants varies widely based on technology as well as within same technology. Fuel cells have the 
highest capital cost among power plants investigated followed by offshore wind and advanced nuclear power plants. 
Gas turbines have some of the lowest capital costs. noted that the average price of unit cost of renewable sources 
namely small PV, largescale PV, onshore and offshore wind as well as biogas has been on a declining trend over the 
last decade. On the other hand, the average unit price of fossil fuel sources i.e., natural gas, hard coal and lignite coal 
has been growing. Nuclear, which is a clean non fossil fuel experienced growth in unit price of power which may 
affect its competitiveness in the energy transition.

1. Introduction  
Power generation technologies incur a variety of different costs that can be divided into ,three general categories 
namely wholesale costs which are  costs paid by utilities in acquiring and distributing electricity, retail costs which 
paid by electricity consumers, and  external costs, or externalities, which are costs imposed by the society or 
community(M. J. B. Kabeyi & A. O. Olanrewaju, 2022) . The Levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is a techno-
economic parameter used to describe the unit cost of power generated from a selected power plants by taking into 
account costs like initial investment, operation and maintenance costs among others for an objective comparison of 
energy sources(Elisa  Veronese et al., 2021).  The main drivers for electricity generating costs are the construction, 
fuel costs, CO2 emissions costs, and operation and maintenance costs. These factors are influenced by the size of the 
units used, hence the effect of economies of scale which tend to reduce unit costs for larger units. Even though wind 
turbines and solar PV ae modular in nature, there is significant cost reduction developed in wind or and solar 
farms(International Energy Agency, 2020). 
        The Levelized cost of energy (LCOE), or Levelized cost of electricity, is used to measure the lifetime cost of 
energy generation or production by a given system. The LCOE facilitates the comparison of costs associated with 
various forms of energy. The metric is applied to determine the average cost of producing one kilowatt hour (kWh) of 
electricity over the generating asset lifetime. LCOE computes   costs associated with a system like installation, 
operation, maintenance, and fuel costs all presented as a single figure.  It is very straightforward and easy to understand  
and apply in comparing various energy sources and technologies  (Hoymiles, 2020; M. Kabeyi & O. Olanrewaju, 
2021).

Abstract 
Off grid power generation options offer a cheaper and sustainable approach to electrify remote and rural communities. 
The main challenge associated with the use of a   single technology is the danger of oversizing of the power systems 
at the project beginning hence high capital investment. Other limitations are high greenhouse gas emissions and low 
system reliability. Using a hybrid system and storage can overcome the intermittent nature of renewable energy 
sources and the problem of oversizing and improve the reliability of energy supply while at the same limiting the 
environmental impact related to use of fossil fuels. In this study, a performance analysis of Garissa power Station in 
Kenya was done. The study showed   the power station had 6 diesel engine generators with a total installed capacity 
of 4,257 kW and effective capacity of 1,950 kW against peak demand of between 3600 for Garissa Town at the time 
of the study. Therefore, the town had a power deficit of 1650 kW during peak hours and therefore requires installed 
capacity of about 2053 kW (with engines availability factor of 80%) to meet the demand. However, based on the 
effective capacity factor, up to 3,587kW in new capacity was needed. This deficit was partially addressed temporarily 
by overhauling two engines of capacity 1064 kW that were out of service and which had been derated from a capacity 
674 kW to 250 kW due to mechanical defects. Th study showed that generation improved by 44 by overhaul of engines 
1 and 2 even though the generation from engines 5& 6 diminished due to expiry of after sales service and hence delays 
in maintenance. The study demonstrated the importance of proper and timely maintenance of diesel engines for reliable 
power supply and challenges associated with use of single technology in power supply for off grid systems.

1. Introduction 
The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 seeks to achieve universal access to modern, affordable, reliable, and 
sustainable energy by 2030. About 789 million people worldwide had no access to electricity in the year 2020. As a 
result of this, it is difficult to sustainable development in these mostly rural and remote areas with no access to 
electricity. A more reliable power supply is necessary to significantly improve the living conditions of remote 
communities having no access to grid electricity. The benefits of rural electrification include better health care, better 
education, higher incomes, and employment opportunities, and thus poverty reduction. Off-grid energy solution which 
include solar, wind systems and diesel generator sets present solutions to electrify the remote off grid regions and help 
in closing the electricity  access gap and lower costs  and reduce the waiting times until when compared  to access 
through electricity  grid extensions(Aberilla et al., 2020).  
          Mini grids or microgrids broadly incorporate power generation sources complemented by energy storage 
systems   as a form of a distributed generation to deliver electricity to isolated loads. Mini-grids or microgrids have 
ability to independently operate  with a  single or multiple generation sources (hybrid systems), to  provide power to  
underserved populations in rural and remote areas(Hoeck et al., 2022). Access to modern energy, especially electricity, 
is linked to improvements in health, education, and social welfare.  
         The problem of low electricity access is more acute with remote communities and communities on islands. One 
of the characteristics of rural communities is low population density. The families that make up these populations are 
widely scattered, making it difficult to meet energy demands and making electrical transmission networks expensive. 
Complex geographic conditions and low energy demand make providing electrical energy by conventional methods 
impractical (that is, extension of electrical transmission networks and substations), especially in developing countries, 
where electricity is vital for economic participation and the social welfare of rural communities. Areas that do not 
have electricity generally also lack essential infrastructure like schools, medical centers, means of communication, 
access to potable water and others, which is reflects the fact that the human development indices of electrified 
communities are higher than those of communities without electricity(López-Castrillón et al., 2021). 
        A widely used method for generating electricity for remote communities is distributed generation systems, which 
are characterized by using generators to produce electricity by burning fossil fuels, in particular diesel. Diesel

2798","e.g., areas around water sources have huge availability of water hydro energy resources but limited access to biomass 
and geothermal energy. They also have but significant access to strong offshore winds and solar. On the other hand 
remote islands  have more access to water and biomass for  small-scale hydro power, high and low enthalpy geothermal 
energy source, and widespread access to wind and  solar radiation (López-Castrillón et al., 2021). 
   Diesel is the main fuel for use in industrial, transport, and in diesel power plants; unfortunately it is polluting and 
non-renewable (Arefin et al., 2020). Hence, there is a dual need to reduce emissions and cost of power from diesel 
engine power plants (Niemi, 1997). Reliance on diesel power, especially during low rains contributes to the high cost 
of grid electricity. The current trend of using diesel fuel has a negative impact to consumers in terms of huge electricity 
bills (Andae, 2017).The environmental impact of diesel power plants includes emission of Sox and NOX emissions 
e.g. SO2 which  undergoes chemical reactions with moisture in the atmosphere  to form sulfuric acid (Barasa, 2020; 
Jeremiah, 2018). The emissions also react with the ozone layer leading to its depletion(M J B Kabeyi & A O 
Oludolapo, 2021). The greenhouse gases are responsible for the global warming in addition to other health effects to 
humans like chronic respiratory diseases, lung cancer, heart diseases, and damage to brain, liver and kidneys(M. J. B. 
Kabeyi & A. O. Olanrewaju, 2020; M J B Kabeyi & A O Oludolapo, 2020a, 2020b). 
       It costs  about KES  6.00 to produce 1 kWh of electricity using natural gas (Eurostat, 2020) which is much  lower  
compared to diesel power generation which costs about KES 30.00 (Andae, 2017; Kabeyi & O. A. Olanrewaju, 2020). 
Therefore, conversion to natural gas will reduce the cost of power generation.  Diesel generators (DG) are 
economically cheaper to purchase, but technically more y expensive to operate and maintain, especially during partial 
load conditions which are less efficient because of high fuel cost delivered to the power plant from far away. Diesel 
engines also have many moving parts leading to high rates of failure and increased cost of operation and 
maintenance(M. Kabeyi & O. Olanrewaju, 2021a; M. J. B. Kabeyi & O. A. Olanrewaju, 2021b).   As a double 
coincidence, diesel fuel is often delivered to remote power stations by tracks and rail powered by diesel engines. On 
the contrary large-scale gas supply is often delivered by gas pipelines which are cheaper to operate and maintain(M. 
Kabeyi & O. Olanrewaju, 2021b; Moses  Jeremiah  Barasa Kabeyi & Akanni  O Oludolapo, 2020a).  
·      As far as the environment is concerned, the diesel power plants have significant environmental impacts besides 
the power plants being non-optimal and expensive to operate and maintain. Operation of diesel engines contaminates 
local air and soil and emits significant amounts of greenhouse gases. Since the use of  these diesel generators is not  
optimal and is additionally  very expensive, there is growing need to identify alternative fuels and means of generation 
to  reduce cost  of  generation and environmental  impact of diesel power plants (Issa et al., 2019). 
7. Conclusion 
The power station under the study had 6 diesel engine generators with a total installed capacity of 4,257 kW and 
effective capacity of 1,950 kW against peak demand of between 3600 for Garissa Town at the time of the study. 
Therefore, the town had a power deficit of 1650 kW during peak hours and therefore requires installed capacity of 
about 2053 kW (with engines availability factor of 80%) to meet the demand. However, based on the effective capacity 
factor, up to 3,587kW in new capacity was needed. This demand could be met by repairing Engine 1 with capacity of 
1064 kW which was on forced outage, Engine 2 of capacity 674 kW which had been derated to 250 kW, and the 
engines 5 and 6 also performing below optimum capacity. This could solve the problem in the short term. However, 
as a long-term measure extra capacity from the new generation is needed to take care of emergencies and the ever-
growing demand.  
       The main challenge facing Garissa power station is the use of a single technology which generally leads to 
oversizing of the power systems at the start of the project hence high capital investment. Other limitations are high 
greenhouse gas emissions and low system reliability. Using a hybrid system and storage can overcome the intermittent 
nature of renewable energy sources and the problem of oversizing and improve the reliability of energy supply while 
at the same limiting the environmental impact related to use of fossil fuels.   
        This study demonstrated the serious challenges resulting from use of diesel generators as single energy sources 
for the off grid power and the significance of proper and timely maintenance of engine prime movers for power plants 
to guarantee reliability and capacity in power generation.

Abstract 
Aquaponics is a food production method that combines hydroponic and aquaculture to form a system. A fish tank 
for the aquaponics system and non-aquaponics system was constructed, the start up and running the system was 
monitored for 4 months. The fish grown in the fish tank and the plants grown in the pot with pebbles and supplied 
with local water. Electric energy use for water pumps was measured to reach close to 5.76 KW-HR per month per 
container. 
The fish growth was monitored and found that the fish in aquaponics system gained more weight than the fish in 
non-aquaponics system. The plants growth was monitored also and found that the plants gained more weight in 
aquaponics system than in non-aquaponics system as well as the water temperature monitored and found that the 
water temperature in aquaponics system is less than the non-aquaponics system. 
From the results in this study, Aquaponics system seem to be higher in fish growth in weight, higher in plants growth 
in weight and less in water temperature. Continued studies would do well to investigate plant growth using soil as 
well as physical properties of water for fish growth.

Abstract 
The fourth industrial revolution (4IR) has brought with it an excess of possibilities for automation within various 
industry sectors.  The 4IR will be achieved by using technology to change the way of life, to change how 
products/services are produced/provided by manufacturers and to change the mechanics of globalization significantly 
if not completely.  This new way of life will see many occupations being replaced by automation while completely 
new ones are created.  In the South African context, there is evidence from the banking sector where, occupations that 
previously required human consultants for customer queries have been replaced with self-service platforms for 
consumers.  This phenomenon has led some big companies in SA have plans to close down their call center 
departments.  Additional reports on 4IR point to the unfortunate eventuality of job losses in the auditing, legal and 
health industries just to name a few.  This paper looks into the future of this advanced wave of automation in the 
context of the South African manufacturing sector.  It examines the subject of automation in manufacturing in South 
Africa, a means to gauge the state of automation compared to global competitors.  The intention was to determine how 
this automation has been implemented on a global scale and how this has eventually affected the human operator. The 
necessary pre-conditions for automation have been investigated.  Their linkages with the levels of automation were 
examined.

Introduction and background 
As business companies strive towards more agile and responsive production systems, many companies have employed 
or at least have considered employing automation within their manufacturing value chains.  The input factor to this 
change in pace within the market is the ever-changing needs of the modern-day customer.  As such, most companies 
try to be ahead of customer needs while ensuring that the innovation rate within the organization is greater than or 
equal to the innovation rate outside the organization.  Although innovation can, to a large extend, be influenced by 
customer needs, it can also be influenced by market forces through competition.  Organizations constantly seek ways 
to minimize production costs and maximize throughput while aiming to transfer the savings in production costs to the 
customer through lower products’ prices.  Accordingly, manufacturing facilities have been filled with automated 
machines to perform some of the repetitive activities that were previously performed by humans.  Advances in robotics 
have seen robotic arms performing welding operations that were previously performed by artisans.  Such robots are

Abstract 
Indonesia has many palm oil mills and plantations spread across various regions. As a result, the increasing 
number of palm oil mills is accompanied by an increase in waste. Biomass is waste from palm oil mills that 
impact environmental pollution and is used as a source of electrical energy. This study aims to make 
decisions on the potential utilization of biomass for electricity bioenergy at one of the palm oil mills in 
Riau. Interviews, observation, and distribution of pairwise comparison questionnaires were carried out for 
data collection. This study begins with identifying the criteria for potential biomass utilization from oil 
palm. Then, it is formulated into a decision-making hierarchy to determine potential biomass for bioenergy 
development based on utilization goals and use of technology processed by the Fuzzy AHP (Analytical 
Hierarchy Process) method. The finding shows the main purpose of utilizing biomass is to meet energy 
needs in the production process at palm oil mills. Then, the appropriate generation technology for electricity 
bioenergy is biogas, and the selected biomass potential is Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME). The implications 
of this study provide recommendations to management and policymakers to utilize palm biomass as a 
source of bioenergy electricity.

1. Introduction
Indonesia to meet its economic needs mainly come from the agricultural sector. One of the most potential 
commodity sectors in Indonesia is palm oil. Palm oil is Indonesia's most potential agricultural commodity. 
The increasing area of oil palm agricultural land, along with the increasing number of companies operating 
in this sector, leads to a high intensity of waste produced from the production process which can impact 
environmental pollution. The Indonesian government continues to strive to maximize the use of agricultural 
commodities, especially palm oil, to meet national energy needs (Papilo and Bantacut 2016). Thus, 
Indonesia needs to find out the status of the sustainability of agro-industry development by taking into 
account the potential utilization of waste as bioenergy development. 
Bioenergy is energy from living things or other organic materials. A study asserts that bioenergy is a 
renewable energy with good prospects for development due to limited petroleum in Indonesia (Langer et 
al., 2021). Bioenergy generally consists of three types: biofuels (bioethanol, biodiesel), biogas, and biomass 
(wood chips, bio-bonding, and agricultural waste) (Papilo et al. 2018). Factories are asked to continue 
looking for the latest innovations to reuse the waste they produce. This innovation can produce energy to 
replace fossil energy sources with palm oil-based renewable electricity. Several modern bioenergy 
technologies are currently being developed using biomass, such as biodiesel, bioethanol, fuel oil, and biogas 
(Ambaye et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2019). Biodiesel is used as an alternative fuel to new or used vegetable 
oil (Huang et al., 2012). It is processed through transesterification, esterification, or a combination of the 
two processes . The technology currently being discussed is bioethanol. Bioethanol is ethanol produced

5. Discussion 
This study has shown each oil palm biomass's potential level in a palm oil mill. The data processing results 
using the Fuzzy AHP method found that 
1. the T1 value (Alternative to meet energy needs in the factory production process) is 0.288 with the 
first rank. Then, T2 (reducing production costs) is 0.282 in the second rank, T4 (provision of 
employment) is 0.233 in the third rank, and T3 (reducing environmental impact) has a weight value 
of 0.198 in the fourth rank. 
2. The power plant technology level shows that biogas (P1) has a weight value of 0.535 with the first 
rank, biodiesel (P2) has a weight value of 0.248 with the second rank, and co-firing (P3) has a weight 
value of 0.217 with the third rank. 
3. In the alternative level, the value of liquid waste/POME (palm oil meal effluent) (A5) is 0.364 with 
the first rank, palm shells are 0.186 with the second rank, empty fruit bunches is 0.140 with the third 
rank, fiber is 0.138 with the fourth rank, fronds have a weight value of 0.092 with the fifth rank, and 
stems have a weight value of 0.080 with the sixth rank. 
 
The implications of this study have provided recommendations to decision-makers below. Based on the 
expert's assessment, at an objective level, the results of T1 (Alternative for fulfilling energy needs in the 
factory production process) are considered as the main goal in finding the most potential biomass for 
sustainable palm oil-based bioenergy. Then for the selection of generator technology that can be used as a 
recommendation for companies, biogas (P1). Biogas is considered the most effective for use in palm oil 
mills because quite a lot of palm oil mill waste (POME) biomass is produced, which is around 0.6 tons, 
obtained from processing 1 ton of FFB. POME conversion to biogas is carried out by processing oxygen 
(aerobic). In terms of aerobic treatment, plants tend to be cheap compared to anaerobic. The data processing 
results show that the most consistent alternative recommendation used as biomass for the sustainability of 
palm oil bioenergy in this study is Liquid Waste/POME. Liquid waste is considered the most potential 
because its utilization can reduce environmental impact. Then, liquid waste is one of the most produced 
biomass in each production, which has the highest BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) and COD (Chemical 
Oxygen Demand) (organic content) content and is still used for biogas. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study has succeeded in assisting decision-makers in the bioenergy sustainability of palm oil mills. 
Selection on the potential utilization of biomass for electricity bioenergy at one of the palm oil mills has 
been obtained. Then, this research recommends conducting a sustainability performance assessment on 
using palm oil mill effluent (POME). This study is needed to support the government's policy in 
implementing suitability in the palm oil industry.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing can be considered one of the major sectors of businesses. Firms often look for opportunities and defects 
in the system so they can overcome them. Logistics is the key of manufacturing as it ensures optimal use of resources. 
Reverse logistics is a small part of logistics. We can define reverse logistics as “The process of planning, implementing 
and controlling flow of raw materials, from the consumers to the point of origin”. In other words, Reverse logistics is 
the process of flow of materials from users to the re-users. This paper contains the basic concepts of reverse logistics. 
It also covers the reverse logistics activities and how it affects the internal management. 
The globalization and automation of operations and supply chain has resulted in mass production and mass supply to 
consumers. Hence the rise in reverse logistics is evident, this also leads to an amount of industrial waste. Objectives 
of this study are: To identify best practices in reverse logistics in Indian context, identifying the key factors to be 
considered in best practices implementation of reverse logistics. 
Definitions of Reverse Logistics:  
DHL, a renowned third party logistics company uses the following definition for reverse logistics Hans-Chritian 
Pfohl, (2004) “Reverse logistics can be defined as the application of logistics concepts to residues in order to 
create an economically and environmentally efficient residue stream by using all activities of spatiotemporal 
transformation, including changes in amounts and types.” 
Dale S. Rogers and Ronald S. Tibben-Lemke(1998) use the definition for Logistics as “the process of planning, 
implementing, and controlling the efficient, cost effective flow of raw materials, in-process inventory, finished goods

6. Conclusion 
Reverse logistics consists of four processes, according to our study: collection, sorting, recovery, and redistribution. 
To increase the effectiveness of their returns management, the organizations must concentrate on these. The instances 
involving Amazon and Apple demonstrate how mishandled returns result in unnecessary dumps and environmental 
risks. For the enterprises, effective collection and processing are essential. For instance, Amazon has made Kiva robots 
available for effective dump sorting. 
Case studies demonstrate that effective returns management also generates goodwill and value. Apple is committed 
to safeguarding the environment, the health and safety of its employees and customers, as well as the entire world 
from environmental dangers. Since then, the company has removed the poisons from its products, making it the first 
laptop maker to do so. Dell stands in the next place for donations, the returned goods are refurbished if necessary and 
sent for donation. Using  text analytics-Bigram  :  generic configuration, late postponement, life cycle asset recovery

Abstract 
The branch of business management that deals with inventory planning and control is known as inventory 
management. It comprises keeping track of supply levels and forecasting demand, as well as scheduling when and 
how to plan. Keeping excess inventory results in a loss of money takes up physical space, and raises the risk of damage, 
spoilage, and loss. On the other hand, too little inventory frequently causes operations to be disrupted and raises the 
possibility of low customer satisfaction, both of which can be detrimental to a company's reputation. The United 
Victorious Feed Mill Corporation's present inventory management practices were assessed in terms of inventory level, 
warehouse allocation, ordering frequency, shelf life, and production requirement. To help the company achieve their 
optimal level of inventory, a mathematical model was created using Integer Linear Programming. Due to the season, 
the goal function was to reduce the cost of purchasing US Soya and Yellow Corn. Warehouse space, annual production 
requirements, and shelf life were all considered. To ensure that the user only uses one application to record all relevant 
information, like production output and delivery, the researcher built a Visual Basic system. Additionally, the 
technology allows management to change the model's parameters.

1. Introduction
Inventory management is the area of company management that deals with the planning and control of inventories. 
Inventory Management is defined as a framework used in firms to control their inventory interest. It entails recording 
and monitoring stock levels, estimating future demand, and deciding when and how to arrange. Keeping excess 
inventory takes up physical space, increases the likelihood of damage, spoilage, and loss, and results in a financial 
loss. Too little inventory, on the other hand, frequently disrupts operations and increases the likelihood of poor 
customer satisfaction, which can harm an entity's reputation. 
Managing inventory in feed mills is a critical process because some raw materials are seasonal, and mistakes in 
inventory can lead to future shortages that affect production. Most feed mills do their inventory manually, which 
usually results in data variances, with no tally of actual count versus existing record. Feed production will be halted 
during manual inventory to prioritize actual counting. Furthermore, some feed mills will be unable to complete their 
inventory because it will take several days without production. 
United Victorious Feed Mill Corporation is a feed manufacturer based in San Jose, Batangas. San Jose, known as the 
Egg Basket of the Philippines, has many poultry farms that will require a large amount of feed. The company not only 
supplies feed to San Jose Batangas, but also to other nearby cities. Their warehouse is 1000 square feet in size. meter, 
where they kept all their ingredients, a total of 41 different types of raw materials. Yellow corn, along with US soya, 
consumed nearly 90% of their warehouse. These raw materials were stockpiled based on batch, quality, and material 
type. Yellow corn is a seasonal raw material that is used as one of the main ingredients in feed. It can be purchased at 
a reasonable price during its peak season, which runs from July to September; however, during the off-season, its price 
usually rises by around 12%, which has a significant impact on the company's profit.

6. Conclusion 
The level of inventory, warehouse allocation, ordering frequency, shelf life, and production requirements were used 
to assess the company’s present inventory management position. The researcher discovered that the company used to 
keep a safety stock sufficient for three weeks of production. The warehouse allocation was also determined by 
measuring the actual size of raw material packaging. The company also used to order every three weeks, which equated 
to 17 orders per raw material regardless of season. Each raw material is considered good for production even if it is 
stocked for 6 months, especially if it is of high quality. Finally, the number of raw materials to be stocked was 
determined by the monthly requirement, which is 18,000 bags of feed mill. 
 
A mathematical model was developed using Integer Linear Programming to assist the company in achieving their 
optimal level of inventory. The goal function was to reduce the cost of purchasing US Soya and Yellow Corn due to 
the season. Warehouse space, yearly production requirements, and shelf life were all considered. This model also 
restricts all decision variables to integers, ensuring that all orders are exact numbers of sacks. The decisions that will 
be made will be equivalent to the quantity of raw materials per order. 
 
To reduce the number of repetitive computations in solving linear programming, a Microsoft macro was used. A 
Visual Basic system was also offered by the researcher to make sure that the user only needs to utilize one program 
to record all relevant data, such as production output and deliveries. The system also allows the management to modify 
the model whenever the parameters change. 
 
The researcher explained the system to the business owner. Owners like the method because it allows them to keep 
track of their employees' progress and reduces the need for repetitive tasks. However, because the company is currently 
preparing for the relocation of company buildings, actual testing of the system is not possible. The researcher 
concluded that this system will be useful because it will be simple to change the parameters because of their recent 
acquisition of a larger warehouse and new building. 
The proposed system will be used to monitor the raw materials of the feed mill; however, the system will not be used 
to determine the quality status. As a result, stocking and using raw materials will have no effect on the model's output. 
For further research, the system can be modified by incorporating all raw materials, allowing the company to monitor 
all ingredients and reduce manual inventory.

Abstract 
Amid intense competition and fast market dynamics, companies must keep innovating to stay competitive. Hence 
innovative capability is critical. Through action research, this study aims to improve the innovative capability of a 
trucking company in Indonesia. A series of improvement actions, divided into five stages, have been performed from 
December 2021 to May 2022. The level of innovative capability is measured using a maturity model. Further, the 
values before and after the improvements are compared. The results showed an increase in the company's innovative 
capability. Hopefully, these findings will provide practitioners with valuable insights and serve as exciting triggers for 
further research.

1. Introduction
Indonesia's Trucking companies have played significant roles in the country's economy. They do 90 percent of the 
country's cargo movement (Sugianto et al. 2023). Their role is to deliver goods from one place to another, from the 
delivery of raw materials to places for final consumption. The trucking industry in Indonesia is characterized by a 
large number of players, low entry barriers, and, therefore, tight competition (Lookman et al. 2022a). Further, trucking 
companies need to be able to differentiate their services to remain competitive. Amid intense competition and fast 
market dynamics, trucking companies must acquire relevant capabilities (Danneels 2008), (Lintukangas et al. 2019). 
Innovative capability is needed to stay competitive (Hwang et al. 2020), (Ferreira and Coelho 2020). 
The innovative capability is the ability to transform, adopt and implement new ideas and knowledge and continuous 
processes, systems, products, and services for the company's strategic interests through innovative behaviours (Hurley 
and Hult 1998), (Lawson and Samson 2001), (Wang and Ahmed 2004), (Shou et al. 2016), (Yang 2012). Our earlier 
study suggested that innovative capability is influenced by market orientation (customer and competitor orientation), 
technological capability, and good supplier relationships (Lookman et al. 2023). This study aims to improve the 
innovative capability of a trucking company through action research. 
Action research is a tool to help companies to change from their current conditions and implement those changes 
(Salehi and Yaghtin 2015). Interactive relationships between the company and researcher will enrich the results by 
combining diverse knowledge to solve problems (Macintosh et al. 2007). In addition, collaboration with academics 
and practitioners aims to create and develop new ideas (Salehi and Yaghtin 2015) that can be used as solutions for 
stakeholders (Kocher et al. 2011). 
The capability maturity model is then used to measure the maturity level of the company's innovative capability. The 
capability maturity model is a measurement model for evaluating organizational capabilities (Lahrmann et al. 2011). 
There are five levels of maturity for the capability maturity model in this study (Paulk 1993), (Herbsleb et al. 1997), 
(Vakaslahti 1997), (Chen and Wang 2018), (Facchini et al. 2020). This model determines the degree of change and 
the success of this research on the company.

Abstract 
Due to social distancing laws and crowd control as a means of avoiding the spread of COVID-19 since 2020 had 
required retail companies to adopt digital transformations in their business systems. Consumers who formerly shopped 
mostly offline at shopping malls are more likely to shop online at E-Commerce/Marketplaces because of these social 
restrictions. With the following fall of certain spending, businesses must engage in marketing operations to preserve 
income in times like these, whether it's prospecting for new potential customers, remarketing potential customers, or 
keeping relationships with existing customers. This opens a new opportunity for vertical e-commerce with narrow 
target audience’s category to optimize their revenue growth using Customer Relationship Management (CRM) 
technology. However, with direct impact to operational cost, retail companies could face a complex challenge to 
choose the CRM software that best fits their needs and consider. Therefore, this study tries to explore the complexity 
to help them choose the best CRM software solution during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in 
Indonesia. Soft system methodology approach that includes system diagram and multi-actor analysis will be used in 
this research to give clear understanding on the problem and criteria to help the decision-making process by the E-
commerce company.

Introduction 
The COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2020 has had a significant impact on business conditions and consumer 
behavior on e-commerce platforms, both horizontal e-commerce that sells products from various categories and for 
various market segmentations, and vertical e-commerce that is focused on selling category products to a more specific 
market segmentation. Digital-based start-up businesses and companies continue to analyze various marketing efforts 
during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and have found that digital-based marketing platforms are useful tools to 
reach target audiences (P. Patel et al. 2020). In this regard, e-commerce combines the internet network and the 
development of communication technology to change the way business connects, interacts, and communicates 
persuasively to the target audience to purchase products sold on the platform. (Abdul Khan 2016) (P. Patel et al. 2020). 
This refers to the term known as e-marketing or digital marketing, which is digital-based marketing.

The chief marketing officer as the owner of the problem will make the decision within the area of the policy 
intervention: pitch regulation, company’s investment capabilities, and CRM plan and business needs. Digital 
marketing team will help define the criteria and evaluate all the alternatives based on those criteria. Finance team will 
decide how much budget that can be utilize as a cost budget and procurement team will foresee the pitch process from 
find the alternatives, scoring process, until the final decision-making process. 
 
The system’s objective is to decide the best fit CRM platform for ORAMI. Inputs to the system are commercial 
package, technical functionalities, and user experience. The outputs generated by the system are return of investment 
(ROI), CRM capabilities, and digital marketing team operation efficiency.

Conclusion 
The decision making process for selecting the best fit CRM software for ORAMI needs to be conducted to help for 
the stakeholder, namely the chief marketing officer, the digital marketing team, the procurement team, and the finance 
team as it will help the process selecting the best alternative. 
 
The result of this study have identified stakeholders and their relationships as actors who need a decision-making 
process. The systemic framework analysis using the SSM has provided benefits in this study. The use of SSM could 
clarify the essential aspect that must be considered in conducting a decision making mechanism following the multi-
actor mapping and other variables. In future research, it is necessary to conduct multi-criteria decision making process 
to obtain analysis an indicators of the best fit CRM software by considering the VUCA situation on e-commerce sector 
at post-pandemic era.

Abstract 
Environmental management is a critical issue for the readymade garment (RMG) industry, as it is a significant 
contributor to environmental degradation and pollution. Effective environmental management planning (EMP) is 
crucial for RMG factories to reduce their environmental impact and promote sustainability. This research focuses on 
the development of a sustainable EMP as a case study for an RMG factory, intending to address the environmental 
challenges facing the industry. The factory was segmented into 24 different sections, and activities for each section 
were enlisted to determine their environmental impact. Using a risk matrix analysis, the study identified noise pollution 
from various sources, such as from winding, auto placket, back winding, electricity generator, and compressor section, 
as well as water pollution from the washing section and stack air emission from the generator and boiler section, as 
the biggest environmental risks. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the environmental impact of 
the RMG industry, highlighting the challenges it faces in terms of sustainability. The study underscores the need for 
effective management strategies to address these challenges and promote sustainability.

1. Introduction
The readymade garment (RMG) industry plays a significant role in many countries' economies and employs millions 
of people worldwide (Zor 2023). However, the industry has faced criticism for its negative impact on the environment 
and its labor practices (Saha et al. 2023). To address these challenges, many companies in the industry are looking to 
adopt sustainable and environmentally responsible business practices (Yang et al. 2023). This case study focuses on 
the development of a comprehensive environmental management plan (EMP) for an RMG factory, intending to reduce 
its negative impact on the environment while ensuring its long-term viability. The purpose of this study is to explore 
the design and implementation of such a plan and to evaluate its effectiveness in achieving its goals.
The RMG industry is vital for Bangladesh for several reasons. Firstly, it is the largest contributor to the country's 
economy, accounting for more than 80% of the total exports and providing employment to millions of workers (Siraj 
et al. 2022a). Secondly, the industry has played a key role in the development of Bangladesh's economy, helping to

Abstract 
With the tremendous growth of the halal industry, many non-dominant Muslim countries particularly Japan, have 
shown interest to tap into the halal market. To ensure the availability of halal products, therefore, it is crucial to have 
a comprehensive and well-managed halal supply chain. Integrating both “halal” (permissible) and “tayyib” 
(wholesome) throughout all the phases in the supply chain indicates that halal-certified companies need to comply 
with certain sustainability practices which are aligned with the halal certification systems. Nevertheless, there is 
always curiosity among the customers on the halal integrity across the supply chain and they will feel more confident 
if the products are halal certified. Apparently, halal certification bodies played a significant role to enhance the 
sustainable performance measures in the halal supply chain.  Currently, there are more than 30 halal certification 
bodies (HCBs) in Japan. Their backgrounds are diverse from Muslim local residents and community members in 
Japanese cities and individual Muslim academics specializing in agriculture and food systems, to Japanese 
businesspersons who are familiar with Islamic countries and religious organizations. Despite the vast opportunities, 
inevitably there are numerous challenges faced by the HCBs that may influence the sustainability of the halal supply 
chain in Japan. Hence, this motivates this paper to explore the management of the halal certification process and how 
it may affect halal supply chain sustainability. Based on the in-depth interviews with 5 established HCBs, this paper 
aims to explore the sustainable practices and the challenges in the halal supply chain that may contribute to the 
betterment of the halal industry in Japan.

Abstract 
Higher Education Institutions (HEI) in the Philippines try to adhere to various accrediting standards and 
qualifications as well as several quality assurance (QA) mechanisms locally and internationally, including the 
Philippine Quality Award (PQA) Criteria for Performance Excellence, which is modeled after Malcolm Baldrige of 
the United States of America.  The PQA program is a worldwide competitiveness model that encourages and engages 
public and private sector organizations and other stakeholders to strive for and achieve performance excellence. The 
study investigated the compliance of selected Philippine HEIs on the PQA process categories, namely, categories 1- 
leadership, 2- strategy, 3- customer, 4- measurement, analysis, and knowledge management, 5- workforce focus, 6- 
operations focus (categories 1-6) and 7- results (category 7).  It explored the first two categories of the leadership 
triad of the PQA, i.e., leadership and strategy, that emphasize the importance of 'leadership focus' on strategic 
planning. By looking at the differences in the level of compliance on PQA requirements when grouped according to 
HEIs’ firmographic profile, it showed that the level of compliance of HEIs under the leadership requirement is 
consistently very high while strategy requirements are from high to very high. Readiness among the HEIs in terms 
of Level 1 PQA criteria is present, despite the non-submission for PQA assessment. To ensure full and sustainable 
quality assurance compliance, a continuous quality improvement plan was recommended to help senior leaders of 
the organizations improve compliance on basic, overall, and multiple requirements required by both categories of 
the PQA Criteria for continuous performance excellence.

1. Introduction
There are several Quality Assurance (QA) mechanisms locally and internationally among which is the Philippine 
Quality Award (PQA) Criteria for Performance Excellence patterned after the Malcolm Baldrige of the United States 
of America. To date, this framework is gaining attraction for many universities and colleges in the country. 
The Malcolm Baldrige National Award (MBNQA) program, established by the National Institute for Standards and 
Technology (NIST) in 1987, has become a recognized framework to measure, assess, and improve manufacturing, 
service, and small business performance (Young 2002). However, with the increase among schools in the use of 
quality management principles, Young added that the MBNQA system and its criteria are now used as the basis for 
educational management. As a result, the quality as a system for improvement has expanded from business to 
education (Halloran 2008).  
In the Philippines, Higher Education Institutions (HEI) attempted to adhere to accrediting standards and qualifications 
to improve the quality of education they delivered to their students. Quality assurance is critical among HEIs. It is still 
a fascinating subject of education research (Sipacio 2015). He went on to say that different stakeholders' definitions 
of quality assurance mean other things and that, as a result, he believes that quality indicators should be clearly defined. 
The PQA however is different from accreditation in a way because it assesses the organization’s performance and 
continuous improvement mechanisms by looking at not only on their approaches on the key items of the process

Abstract 
Designing an effective wayfinding system is very crucial in a hospital. Many hospitals in developing countries like 
the Philippines create increasing pressure on patients when no proper signage is to be followed in times of 
emergencies. Wayfinding signages aim to provide patients with correct directions without extensive explanations or 
complex maps. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review on different hospital wayfinding signage 
system evaluation methodologies that may be necessary to establish a standard assessment guide. A comprehensive 
search using Google Scholar is applied to identify initially relevant studies. There is a total of 1, 780 articles identified 
from the search for the last ten years (2012-2022). The review found a trend in the evaluation of hospital signages, 
including the types of signages evaluated, design elements considered, and evaluation methods. The conclusion 
highlights the need for future research to establish methods that consider multiple design elements for improved 
hospital signage design.

1. Introduction
Hospital wayfinding signage systems in hospital settings are usually poorly designed particularly due to the expansion 
of original facilities. Garling, et al.  (1986)  stated that signage has a significant impact on wayfinding behavior and it 
must be included in the overall plan arrangement of a structure. Thus, the main purpose of establishing signages is to 
boost the wayfinding experience of a user (Tang et al.   2009). Another benefit of having a good signage system is 
time efficiency. It saves time and makes activities easier to complete. As a result, in public facilities, especially those 
with a significant number of visitors and users, such as hospitals, a signage system is critical (Basri and Sulaiman 
2013). 
Healthcare institutions like hospitals, according to Bubric et al. (2020), are in the service sector and should deliver the 
highest quality possible experience to their customers. Furthermore, visitors, like their patients, are generally there for 
various reasons. Frequently in pain, discomfort, and anxiety. The hospital's complicated wayfinding systems, 
specifically the signage systems, are one component that adds to the uncomfortable experience that visitors and 
patients have (Pati et al. 2015). Moreover, the hospital's signage system is a significant component that influences the 
wayfinding system's effectiveness. 
Hospital signage plays a major role in helping hospital users to navigate and arrive at their desired destination. Existing 
studies have already developed signage design principles, guidelines, and design recommendations that aim to help 
improve the effectiveness of hospital signage. However, these principles and guidelines are not always considered 
when designing hospital signages. This poor compliance with standards and guidelines can be attributed to the lack of 
regular evaluation for hospital signages. 
This paper aims to present a literature review on hospital signage evaluation, focusing on the application, design 
elements considered, and their methods.

5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
The concerns of hospital stakeholders such as patients and visitors regarding their wayfinding experience continue to 
exist. One of the contributing factors to this wayfinding experience is the effectiveness of hospital signages. To 
continue to improve on the effectiveness, several studies pursued different approaches in evaluating hospital signage 
considering the different types and different design elements. Due to research limitations, some studies can only 
consider two or three elements in the evaluation. Because of this, hospital signages are improved only by some aspects 
of the design but not the whole. This approach only leads the design to myopic improvement which would require 
future changes as new design elements are evaluated and found to be unsatisfactory. With this, it can be concluded 
that it is still relevant to establish methods that can consider multiple design elements to provide a more suitable design 
improvement.  
 
Other areas of study that researchers could explore are the determination of the importance of design elements based 
on the type of signage, and the further study of other approaches in evaluating signage such as nodal analysis, and the 
PDSA method. Furthermore, studies may explore the least studied design elements such as type size, text layout 
grouping, and text and arrow alignment.

Abstract 
Consumers will perceive the impression of professionalism in packaging that the product quality is relatively good. 
Packaging becomes an aspect that has an essential role for companies to implicitly explain the details of the products 
to be sold and as the main points that explain how consumers are interested in consuming because of the cognitive 
transformation process provided by packaging both in terms of color and other features. Packaging has a broader reach 
than advertising and differentiates it from competitors. Packaging promotes and drives purchasing decisions when 
purchasing and every time the product is used. Packaging with different sizes can expand a product to new target 
markets or help overcome cost barriers. This paper discusses packaging and consumer behavior in response to existing 
packaging. So far, almost all manufacturers when making packaging designs are only based on studies conducted by 
these manufacturers without any customer involvement. By understanding consumer behavior, it is hoped that in the 
future the packaging design created will involve consumers by paying attention to the aspects needed and desired by 
consumers. So that the packaging design that will be produced can further increase the value of the product and 
increase consumer interest in purchasing a product. 
Keywords 
packaging, consumers, cognitive, communication, decisions 
1. Introduction
The product's characteristics can be seen from the packaging, unique design, and neat and attractive design that will 
attract consumers to buy. Before looking at the product, consumers will pay attention to the packaging aspect that 
wraps a product (Juárez et al. 2020). Consumers will perceive the impression of professionalism in the packaging that 
the product quality is relatively good. Packaging is an aspect that has an essential role in companies to implicitly 
explain the details of the products to be sold. The main point explains how consumers are interested in consuming 
because of the cognitive transformation process of packaging in terms of color and other features (Yang & Hsu  2020). 
Packaging with specific characteristics following consumer perceptions will be more attractive to consumers and give 
a positive impression compared to similar products belonging to competitors, with packaging less attractive to 
consumer perceptions (López et al. 2022).  
Packaging is a place or medium where the symbol of the company or product is easy to recognize and further 
strengthens the perception of consumer confidence in the company (Magnier & Schoormans 2015). In addition, 
packaging will be perceived as a product with specific market segmentation, target consumer, and brand positioning

Consumer behavior is said to be dynamic because the thinking, feeling, and reaction processes of individual 
consumers, consumer groups, and extensive consumer groups are constantly changing. Most consumer behavior is 
based on thought patterns and feelings or memories acquired during the use of a product. So experience during product 
use will significantly influence consumer behavior (Yudiatantri & Nora  2019). Activities indicate consumer behavior 
to obtain, consume and spend the product purchased (Juárez et al.2020). Consumer behavior is a process and individual 
activities directly related to the search, purchase, sale, use, and evaluation of goods and services to meet consumers' 
needs and desires (Zhao et al. 2019). 
Mohsen & Nosrat (2016), consumer behavior is the study of how individuals make decisions (decision units) when 
purchasing a product. (Nemat et al. 2019), consumer behavior is how individuals, groups, and organizations select, 
buy, and use products, services, ideas, or experiences to satisfy their needs and wants. Rettie & Brewer (2000), 
consumer behavior is a process study of the involvement of individuals or groups in choosing, buying, using, or 
managing products, services, ideas, or experiences that satisfy the needs and desires of consumers. Svanes et al. (2010), 
Consumer behavior is the study of the behavior of individuals, groups, and organizations to choose, buy, use, and how 
goods, services, ideas, or experiences satisfy their needs and desires. Yu, & Sinigh (2021), consumer behavior is the 
activities of individuals directly involved in obtaining and using goods or services, including the decision-making 
process in preparation for determining these activities. 
Packaging will reflect the contents of a product and its brand (Kumar 2014). This causes some consumers to think that 
packaging symbolizes the ability to buy a product, and many want to get the recognition that consumers can get the 
best product (Munthiu, 2009). Packaging as a practical function is due to the following factors: If the need for the 
product is met, consumers will express it by encouraging others to buy (Ramya & Mohamed  2019). Trying to imagine 
the product's superiority through stories, excitement, or educational tendencies through the information on the 
packaging. Sharing the experience of using the product (experience sharing) if there is an experience that is the same 
or similar to that felt by the user (Kumar  2014) 
Consumers will tend to choose food products with attractive packaging, compared to products whose packaging is 
plain or simple and unattractive. Even with the same product using different packaging, it can affect consumer buying 
interest. Consumer interest in a product can be caused by the features or attributes contained in the product. The ideas 
generated from comparisons with competing products become a benchmark for the reputation of some company that 
makes the product and the technology used to make the product (Rundh  2005). Svanes et al. (2010) The learning 
process during selecting and using products will lead to consumers' perceptions in determining a product's purchase. 
High buying interest will lead to motivation that always appears and is recorded in the minds of consumers so that it 
becomes a strong desire always to use the product because it suits the needs and desires of consumers. 
Consumer behavior is an activity related to the process of buying a product that is strongly influenced by habits (habit), 
mindset (awareness), attitude (attitude), desire (desire), and cognitive behavior. Consumer behavior is generally 
formed over a long time so that consumers will have a particular perception of a product (Zekiri  2015). When 
consumers decide to buy a product, consumers will imagine and consider aspects of price, quality, and function. 
Consumer behavior will be described starting from search behavior, research, and product evaluation (Ahmed 2015; 
Abbasi & Aghaei 2016). 
3. Conclusion
Packaging contributes to competitive advantage to market products to consumers concerning strategic decision-
making to make a purchase. Packaging is considered an essential component of communication activities with 
consumers during the product marketing process, ensuring it remains safe during the distribution process and is a safe 
place during the storage process. Good design, with a mix of matching colors and optimal use of materials, will be 
able to create packaging that consumers highly desire. 
Consumer behavior is dynamic, and consumers have rapidly changing desires, demanding the creation of packaging 
that can fulfill the desires of consumers both from the aspect of consumer needs and desires for existing packaging. 
The function of packaging as protection, fulfilling safety aspects, attractive appearance, high level of usability, and 
sustainable packaging is what consumers need. Meanwhile, some things that consumers want regarding packaging 
include packaging with good strength, moisture resistance, recyclable, writable surface, and lightweight.

By considering packaging design with a cross-cultural perspective, the company obtains information related to aspects 
that are important in packaging design, so that the company is able to maximize entities and resources at optimum 
cost to produce high value packaging.

Abstract 
This paper is conducted to develop a system that can aid universities in tracking students' academic progress by 
accurately determining dropout rates using machine learning techniques. This has been done by collecting and 
organizing data into machine readable forms, using predictive methods that determines significant patterns and trends, 
constructing different models involving machine learning techniques: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and 
Neural Network, for forecasting and predictions, and finally interpreting the statistical results of the model. After the 
evaluation, it has been concluded that the Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 95.00%, precision of 
97.78%, and F1 score of 96.70%. Despite these results, the researchers recommend developing a more interesting and 
engaging prototype GUI and utilizing a more balanced and diverse dataset that will enable higher accuracy and deeper 
understanding of the results.

1. Introduction
Education is one of the most important things that all or any students of the coming generation must have. The 
education of students is crucial to the country's overall progress. However, numerous individuals are considered 
capable of dropping out of school for a variety of reasons. Several of the possible factors include family issues, 
financial difficulties, and numerous more. There is a desire to predict the number of students who will drop out of 
school due to a variety of factors. This prediction would be beneficial in assisting students in comprehending the 
precise reasons for their call in, as well as assisting other institutions to produce options in determining what could be 
done to eradicate that. (Selvan et al. 2019). 
For other students, dropping out is the culmination of years of academic obstacles, blunders, and missed opportunities. 
For others, dropping out is a result of conflicting life circumstances, such as the necessity to financially support their 
family or the responsibilities of caring for siblings or their own child. Sometimes, students drop out because they are 
bored and find no link between school and the ""real world."" It's about the youth feeling detached from their friends, 
instructors, and other people. Insufficient resources in schools and communities to satisfy the diverse emotional and

2393","In the prototype, the researchers observed that the algorithm Random Forest has the highest percentage of the students 
passing their grades. The researchers also noticed that the algorithm Logistic Regression has the highest percentage 
of students failing their grades.  
Table 2 shows the final results of the model evaluation where the researchers show if the algorithm used is accurate 
enough to know what percentage students pass or fail. Based on the results, the highest percentage is the Random 
Forest, it is more visible and more accurate to analyze to know how many are failing and passing. 
5. Conclusion
In the study among the three machine learning techniques the Random Forest Classifier had the highest accuracy, 
precision, and F1 scores, as well as the second highest recall value. Upon analyzing the data it showed that the 
researchers had implemented normalization on the data before feeding it to the model, both in training and evaluation. 
Moreover, the researchers also used the same, fitted normalizer from the training process in the evaluation process to 
ensure consistency. Unlike in the mother journal, normalization seems to only be applied in the data preparation during 
the training process. Given this scenario, it would be expected that the model may perceive significant differences in 
evaluation if input data is not normalized as to how the training data was normalized during the training process.

Abstract 
Infrastructure development for Gresik Smelter Project requires a substantial amount of precast spun piles. The current 
factory capacity of 50 piles/day does not meet the minimum project's daily needs of 80 piles/day. The current 
production line still shows an imbalance output on each existing work station, which caused a numerous problems 
such as delays, bottle necks and ineffective production flows leading to a reduction in production capacity. This study 
is conducted using the Line Balancing method, Process Activity Mapping and Root Cause Analysis. Using this 
method, you can find out the existing conditions of each work station, understand the production flows and identify 
waste by grouping the stages of the production process into activities that are Value Added, Non Value Added and 
Necessary but Non Value Added. The Takt Time value needed is 15 minutes/unit, the results of this study indicate 
there are 4 work stations with Station Time above Takt time and have an NVA value of 14.71%. After analyzing and 
improving the 5 research variables the NVA value can be reduced to 4.58% and the overall Station Time has a value 
under 15 minutes/unit resulting on the fulfillment the target of 80 piles/day.

1. Introduction
In Indonesia, the world of precast is currently growing rapidly. Every company is competing in developing and 
speeding up the construction time through precast. One thing that needs to be considered in precast production is that, 
it is required to be fast, précised and efficient. PT. Adhi Persada Beton is precast manufactured company where one 
of it’s plant is located in Mojokerto, East Java. The company is currently supporting the construction of smelter for 
PT. Freeport Indonesia by supplying concrete Spun Pile. The minimum capacity to fulfilled this project’s requirement 
is 80 piles/day. However, the previous record shows that the average capacity of this plant was only at  <50 piles/day. 
Based on the above issue, Mojokerto plant faced on the potential of not being able to supply the concrete spun pile as 
per project’s capacity requirement. In terms of timeline, there will be a potential setback from the original contract’s 
period of 12 months to 18 months. As for the contract volume, there will be a potential reduction of values as much 
as 33% from the original contract’s volume. To avoid these from happening, it is necessary to evaluate the production 
flow to observe and locate which part of the process that brings about the bottleneck that needs to be improved 
1.1 Objectives 
Tabel I. Capacity Comparison For Each Work Station clearly shows that the output produced by each work station 
has quite a significant variations. There are a few work stations with capacity below 50 unit/day whilst other work 
station might produced up to 170 unit/day.  So it is essential to balance the capacity of each work stations using the 
Line Balancing method. The definition  of Line Balancing according to two experts is as follows: (1) Balance is the 
similarity of output or yield or overall production on each sequence of production lines (Buffa Elwood 1983). (2)  Line 
balance aims to obtain a smooth flow of production in order to gain high utility of facilities, labor and equipment 
through balancing work time between work stations (Herjanto 1999). This research will identify what causes this 
imbalance and will evaluate how to balance the production line to achieve a capacity of 80 piles/day. The concept of 
line balancing is aimed at minimizing total idle in the production process (Biegel  1981). In accordance to the goal of

6. Conclusion
The results of observation and data processing using the line balancing method show that there are currently 4 work 
stations on existing production process with station time exceeding 15 minutes/unit Takt Time, namely cutting, setting 
molding, casting and demoulding. Results from PAM and RCA analysis showed that the existing production line has 
a total operating time of 157.02 minutes, the value of activity time that has no added value (NVA)/delay is 17.71% 
due to problems with the 5 observed variables. 
The recommendations given were able to make the overall station time goes below the takt time of <15 minutes/unit,    
operating time to 135.03 minutes and reducing the NVA value to 4.58%. The results of the Line Efficiency (LE) 
calculation are 90.02% and the Smooth index (SI) value is 6.07. Thus, according to the calculation of production 
capacity, it is capable of producing a capacity of 80 piles/day as per planned output. The results of the Investment 
Feasibility Analysis also show that the improvement is feasible.

Abstract 
In traditional linear supply chains, productions and consumptions follow the “take, make, use, dispose” approach. 
In this model, the growth is subject to the continuous consumption of resources that are assumed to be readily 
available. In such a linear economy, value creation is supported by making and selling products to the greatest 
extent possible. Conversely, in a closed-loop circular supply chain, products do not simply become waste but are 
rather transformed into valuable resources presenting sustainable business opportunities. The 4th Industrial 
Revolution supported technologies are the primary enablers of circular strategies and business models in supply 
chains. This study aims to provide a comprehensive review of these innovative technologies to appraise their roles 
in facilitating such a transition into circular supply chains.

Addressing the Methodological Challenges Associated with 
E-waste Estimation

Abstract 
E-waste management is a growing concern for governments across the globe, majorly because of its composition. E-
waste contains both hazardous as well as precious metals. The hazardous metals pose a serious threat to the
environment and human health if not disposed of properly. Whereas precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum,
and copper, could be recovered and reused, thus eliminating the need for virgin materials. Additionally, rapid
urbanisation, increasing consumer demand, and shorter product lifespan have led to an increase in the consumption of
electrical and electronic equipment, which would ultimately become e-waste (Duman et al. 2020). Given the
importance of e-waste, the concept of reverse logistics (RL) has increasingly gained the attention of policy-makers,
decision-makers, and academicians in recent years (Govindan et al. 2015). The RL aims to collect the End-of-life
(EOL) products from the end-user to recover or extract the materials or components from EOL products which could
re-enter the value chain. Recovery or extraction could include remanufacturing, reuse, and recycling. Moreover,
unrecoverable and hazardous materials are disposed of or landfilled in an environmentally friendly manner (Dev et al.
2020).
Scholars highlight that setting-up of an efficient and effective recovery network in the context of WEEE requires an 
accurate estimate of the quantity of e-waste generated in the past, present, and future. For example, an accurate 
estimate could help in deciding the location of collection centers for WEEE collection, technology and capacity needs 
of the remanufacturing and recycling facilities could be decided, and the determination of location-capacity of the 
landfill sites. Thus, ensuring that hazardous materials do not directly or indirectly impact human health. Although lack 
of information arising due to error in estimation plays an inevitable part in RL network design decision-making, efforts 
are needed to develop methods for improving forecasting accuracy and reducing errors.  
In this regard, the researchers have proposed various e-waste estimation methods ranging from simple material flow 
methods to non-parametric approaches to complex machine learning techniques. However, the choice of the WEEE 
estimation method, rather than being driven by the accuracy of the forecasting method, is more often driven by data 
availability. Hence in this study, we focus on reviewing various e-waste estimation methods proposed so far. The 
objective is to provide an in-depth understanding of the estimation methods, their pros which are majorly driven by 
the data availability, and the cons arising as a result of assumptions. Also, we shed some light on various sorts of data 
or proxies that could be used to make accurate WEEE predictions. Therefore, this article, by providing an in-depth 
understanding of the available e-waste estimation methods, could assist the reader in choosing the estimation method 
as per their needs and data availability. Moreover, it provides avenues for researchers who may want to delve deeper 
into the topic.

Abstract 
Occupational Stress (OS) and Mental Workload (MWL) are some of the common things that employees are facing 
during their work. These two factors can happen because of responsibilities, rules of the company, lack of support, 
and the environment. This can lead to a reduction in productivity which is something important for every organization. 
So, OS and MWL are two important factors that we intended to reduce both of them for a better result in any 
organization. Many organizations want to decrease the level of occupational stress and mental workload of workers. 
We seek to investigate occupational stress in the manufacturing sector by establishing its causes and recommending 
on industrial engineering solutions to reduce it. The prime objective of this study is to investigate occupational stress 
and mental workload in the manufacturing sector by reviewing the various causes and effects of occupational stress 
on the sector.  
Objectives of this study can be itemized as follows: 
•
Understanding of OS and MWL and the Measurement of OS and MWL
•
Understanding of Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and NASA-TLX
•
Measuring OS and MWL in a Manufacturing Company
•
Reducing the OS and MWL for the Company by using IE tools
The team members started by understanding the concept of MWL and OS and their measurements by doing literature 
reviews to know how may affect the performance. And after the investigation of MWL and OS, we decided to use the 
NASA-TLX to measure the MWL and PSS-10 to measure the OS of the decision makers in a manufacturing company. 
Also, we constructed NASA-TLX and PSS-10 based surveys to identify whether decision makers are facing MWL 
and OS or not. Then these surveys were distributed to all of the decision makers, in the manufacturing company. Then 
After collection of surveys from 32 participants, analysis of the surveys for MWL and OS for 32 participants are done 
by using Excel. We found out that Company’s Stress level was moderate because they had a score of 20.06 in PSS-
10, and their MWL level was high because they had a 50 NASA-TLX score. In addition, we found out that the highest 
stressors in the Company were “too much work”, then “lack of career progression”.

Abstract 
Managing workload for Industrial Engineering (IE) students could be a challenge that affects their academic 
performance and overall well-being. Nevertheless, unmanaged student workloads can lead to burnout. Therefore, this 
study aimed to measure the students’ burnout level through various validated surveys, and to analyze the collected 
data to determine the burnout prevalence among IE students, also investigate the correlation between burnout and 
engagement levels, with the aim of understanding the relationship between these two critical factors. An online survey 
was conducted to undergraduate IE students (63 from Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta, Indonesia and 53 from 
Bulacan State University, Philippines), that agree to follow all procedures. The survey collected demographic 
variables, MBIS-S, and UWES-S questions. As the result of correlation test, study engagement level is moderately 
correlated with emotional exhaustion (r=-0.407; p-value <.05), low correlated with depersonalization (r=-0.327; p-
value <.05), highly correlated with academic efficacy decline (r=-0.639; p-value <.05), and moderately correlated 
with overall burnout index (r=-0.556; p-value <.05). There are significant effects of batch to emotional exhaustion, 
study place to depersonalization and academic efficacy (p-value <.05). By more detailed assessment, was found that 
IE students' efforts to engage with the academic process may help minimize the occurrence of academic burnout.

1. Introduction
As an Industrial Engineering (IE) student, managing one's workload can be a major challenge that affects both 
academic performance and overall well-being. The curriculum of IE is demanding, requiring students to be 
consistently engaged with their coursework, assignments, and projects (Despeisse 2019), (Loyd and Gholston  2016), 
(Sánchez et al. 2019). The various fields in IE body of knowledge also potent to increase the student workload 
(Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers (IISE) 2023).  This can lead to students feeling overwhelmed, stressed, 
and lacking sufficient time to manage their personal and academic responsibilities. 
One of the adverse effects that is resulted from unwell-managed students’ workload that can be faced by IE students, 
is the risk of burnout. The continuous stress and pressure to perform can lead to feelings of exhaustion and 
disengagement (Chipchase et al. 2017), (Fredricks et al. 2019), taking a toll on students' physical, mental, and 
emotional well-being (Smith 2019), (Rummell 2015). Burnout can be a severe problem for industrial engineering 
students, affecting their academic performance (Ghadampour et al. 2016), (Paloș et al. 2019), motivation (Walburg

The characteristics of Philippines IE students are also unique compared to Indonesian students. Most of Philippines 
students live with their parents even though they need to spend around 2 hours from their house to school, every day. 
This results in higher depersonalization level on Philippines samples compared to Indonesian. However, this effort 
impacts on better academic efficacy decline prevention compared in Indonesian students’ group. 
6. Conclusion
Based on the result and findings of this study, the overall burnout index of IE students was low to moderate burnout 
index and moderate for study engagement of IE students. A significant difference was found in the comparison 
between emotional exhaustion and entering batch year which shows a high correlation between the batch before 2019, 
2019, 2020 and 2021 except for batch 2022. Significant differences also be found in the comparison between 
depersonalization and place of study which shows that IE students in the Philippines had higher depersonalization 
level than students in Indonesia. For the comparison test between academic efficacy decline and place of study also 
had a significant difference which shows that IE students in Indonesia had a higher academic efficacy decline than 
students in the Philippines. Nevertheless, study engagement level was found moderately correlated with emotional 
exhaustion, low correlated with depersonalization, highly correlated with academic efficacy decline and moderately 
correlated with overall burnout index. This finding means that IE students' efforts to engage with the academic process 
may help minimize the occurrence of academic burnout. A more detailed analysis also revealed that the most affected 
factor was poor academic performance or academic efficacy decline, which was strongly negatively correlated with 
student engagement. This insightful result demonstrates student engagement in helping IE students to achieve their 
academic achievement.

Abstract 
This study uses the Data Envelopment Analysis method to examine the health sector's performance efficiency. The 
study measures the efficiency of three departments of 6 public and 5 private hospitals in Kuwait ihealth sector. Data 
Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method with Constant return to Scale (CRS), Variable return to Scale (VRS), and scale 
efficiency were used to estimate public and private hospitals' technical and managerial efficiency regarding staff, 
doctors, health services, and the number of patients indicators.

Introduction 
Public and private medical institutes are often considered essential components of a country's healthcare 
system. Healthcare is often seen as a critical determinant in fostering people's overall physical, mental, and 
social well-being. In addition, proper management and organization of healthcare systems may contribute 
significantly to a country's economy, development, and industrialization when done successfully.  
This study used DEA models to analyze the efficiency of three selected health departments in Kuwait 
hospitals. In addition, efficiency measurements of different public and private hospitals' surgical, 
orthopedic, and dermatology departments were done.  
The total population of Kuwait increased from about 1.9 million in 2000 to 4.3 million in 2020 
(worldmeter  2023), and an increasing trend followed in the total life expectancy at birth from 76 
to 80 for the same years (wrldbank.org  2023). However, while the total population and life expectancy 
at birth factors increase, demand in the healthcare sector also increases (Alsabah  et al. 2020).  
Increased demand for health services makes the health system more challenging in Kuwait. That is why 
efficiency and performance measurement of the Kuwait hospitals is crucial for getting information about 
the strong and weak points of the inefficient departments. This way, improvement analysis, and future 
projections can make the system more stable and efficient.   
DEA models were used to measure and compare the technical and managerial performances of selected 
departments of Kuwait hospitals. It is identifying ways of best practice with accurate available data.  
The DEA method, also called frontier analysis, was first proposed by Charnes&Cooper (1978). The DEA 
technique is a practical benchmarking tool that suggests using a reference group of ""efficient"" DMUs as a 
standard against which to measure the ""inefficient"" ones. As a result, managers of organizations (in this 
case, hospital administrators) may quickly do projection analysis to determine the strengths and weaknesses 
of their organizations. Also, it is the most effective and practical methodology that can be used for examining 
organizational efficiencies of any sector like healthcare (see, e.g., Kohl &  Fügener (2019)), finance (see,

Abstract 
Drug shortages are a global issue that every country has suffered from. It appears when a specific product is not 
meeting the demand of a hospital. It has many causes and effects that can intensely harm the patient's health. 
This study aims to introduce a management strategy for controlling and handling the inventory of drugs in Kuwait's 
healthcare facilities in case of any drug shortages. The linear Programming mathematical model method is used to 
minimize the occurrence of drug shortages among healthcare facilities, manage the drug inventory in the hospitals, 
and control drug shortages in healthcare facilities. The proposed solution method's results show that the drug shortage 
problem can be solved optimally by distributing drugs between health centers. In addition, the solution methodology 
can shed light on health sector managers about the solution to the drug shortage problem.

1.Introduction
Drugs are an essential part of healthcare since they improve the health and well-being of patients (Phuong J.M. et al. 
2019). Drug shortages are a global issue that every country has been through. The shortages appear in the system when 
a specific product is unavailable to meet the demand. This shortage in healthcare is an important problem due to health 
consequences that impact patient treatment, medication errors, and quality-of-care services. Even though a large 
budget is allocated to healthcare facilities every year, specifically for costly hospital development programs, many 
hospitals have undeveloped systems for information technology and inappropriate transport facilities. Drug shortages 
in healthcare institutions and emergency units increase the cost of medication and reduce patient recovery rates. Some 
hospitals face drug shortages because of hospital size, number of patients, and graphical location. In addition, they are 
dealing with solving this problem and forming new strategies to get things under control. Hospitals deal with drug 
shortages by purchasing off-contract with their vendor, dealing with another vendor, purchasing pharmaceutical 
replacements, and using the pharmaceutical in stock. 
Official healthcare administrators and other supply chain partners struggle to ensure that medicine is available to 
patients at healthcare centers. Numerous factors influence drug availability, including inventory management, supply 
chain constraints, demand from healthcare facilities, and supply from pharmaceutical industries. Many leading causes 
increase drug shortages problem. The first main cause of drug shortages is the drug manufacturers' response according 
to their earning profits and mitigating losses. The drugs manufacturing may face some quality problems, which can 
lead to a reduction in producing the drugs and restricted distribution. Moreover, the drug manufacturers' economic 
situation is also related to the number of products produced. These issues are related to the drug manufacturers' earned 
profit. For example, the number of products produced depends on the company's profits. If the earned manufacturers' 
profit remains stable, then the number of products being produced will remain constant, directly affecting the drug 
shortages in the healthcare facility. Moreover, the bad management of the supply chain and the inaccuracy in the 
workflow plan exacerbated the problem of drug shortages. Also, lead to delays in healthcare supplies. In addition, 
natural disasters can also affect drug shortages by impacting the availability of raw materials.

Abstract 
A popular furniture manufacturing company (AB) in Kuwait has been experiencing significant delays and increasing 
expenses, in their delivery service. For the furniture industry, home delivery is critically important service to achieve 
higher customer satisfaction levels. AB owns over 100 trucks of different capacities and cover the all areas of Kuwait. 
AB uses a computerized approach to manage their trucks considering the different truck capacities, the different 
product categories and sizes, the installation requirements at customer’s premises, in addition to customer preferences. 
The current approach merged all trucks to serve all areas, and often combine several orders in one truck to utilize the 
truck size. Customers, however, started to complain because of late deliveries. The current system is rigid as expressed 
by the logistics department.  
In this work, the problem is studied with the purpose of developing a simpler, efficient, and more user-friendly 
application to handle the truck routing issues. The objectives set for the project were: 
•
Evaluating the current situation to identify the potential source of the customer complaints
•
Addressing the truck routing task at AB with the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) model
•
Developing a spreadsheet implementation of the VRP model, applied to AB’s settings, to allow more
flexibility in rescheduling
The analysis of the current work method, pointed out that using large-sized trucks to combine several orders 
contributed to the difficulty of handling the missed deliveries. Drivers head to the delivery addresses but find no 
receiving customers and no responses when calls. This occurs more than expected. They proceed to next deliveries, 
and later get contacted to return to the earlier deliveries. If feasible to do in the same day, it causes significant waste 
of time and higher fuel and truck consumption. The problem is complicated with the usual traffic jams on the roads. 
In the analysis, it was proposed to use smaller trucks and limit the number of orders per truck. Thus, categorizing the 
use of the trucks was recommended. We modeled AB’s system as a capacitated VRP and included our 
recommendations in developing a user-friendly spreadsheet application, to test the proposed operational settings. The 
spreadsheet application was built with MS Visual Basic for Application in Excel and it offered simple users’ interface 
for data entry and results output. The Clarke and Wright’ Saving algorithm was utilized as the solution approach.

cost would be saved, if the proposed approached was used.

Surrounding High-Speed Rail Hub

Abstract 
Thailand agreed with China to promote the strategic partnership through a memorandum of understanding on the 
cooperation on Thai railways infrastructure development on the strategic framework for the development of 
Thailand’s transportation infrastructure 2015-2022 Since Thailand is located a hub of land transportation 
connectivity among ASEAN countries. Thai-Chinese high-speed rail project (phase 1: Thailand’s capital Bangkok 
to Nakhon Ratchasima province) is one of the megaprojects in long-term benefits under the strategic framework 
by the government-to-government process. 
This high-speed rail (HSR) project was approved by the Prayut cabinet in July 2017 and was expected to operate 
in 2025. There are two primary reasons why Thailand decided to invest in the HSR project. The first reason is to 
support the strategy of the development of the international railway network and the second reason is to boost the 
regional economic development along the pathway. 
However, a feasibility study of the HSR project was not feasible since the (direct) economic benefit was 8.56 % 
and financial benefit could not evaluate the value. Both values are lower than the benchmark in economic benefit 
(12 %) and financial benefit (5 %) based on the Office of National Economic Development Council. This is 
Thailand’s government is facing how to drive it to sustainable development in the long run. 
A feasibility study still recommended that if the Thai government utilized the land development around the HSR 
hubs (or transit-oriented development), an economic benefit would increase from 8.56 % to 11.68 % and approach 
criterion. Hence, TOD becomes one of the alternative strategies to boost economic value. Yet, Thailand’s 
government does not have the practical know-how and experience in how to make it happen around the transit 
stations. Meanwhile, Thailand faced a limitation of land development surrounding the transport station, such as 
the Town Planning Act 1975, the Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand 2017, and Expropriation and 
Acquisition with Immovable Property Act 2019. 
This dissertation is originated from a feasibility study of the HSR project and aims to develop a comprehensive 
study to provide the TOD strategies around the HSR hub toward sustainable development in Thailand. The 
strategic deliberation is based on the components of TOD in terms of the HSR hub and urban development. The 
research gap is sixfold: to investigate the barriers of the Thai government for the HSR project, to explore the 
international policy ideas, measures, and tools to implementation; to describe the change of macroeconomic and 
indirect economic benefit, to examine the size of the station catchment area, to determine the primary and 
secondary feeder access mode choice to the HSR hub, and to examine the tension between HSR hub and urban 
development. 
The result shows that TOD plays a significant player among four principal barriers (operation service, TOD, new 
organization and panel, and fate structure) to drive the HSR project to sustainable development based on the 
mechanism of the barriers of the Thai government for the HSR project. However, TOD is a combination between 
transport planning and urban development by improving a relatively high level of transport connections and high-
density, mixed-used-use, cycling- and pedestrian-friendly land use surrounding transit stations. Other barriers are 
necessary for the HSR project and need to solve in the initial phase. 
The operation service is the political issue about signaling and telecommunication with track work in the section 
of Bang Sue and Ban Phachi. If the Thai government determines to use shard tracks in this section, the safety and 
reliability should perceive for railway passengers in advance. The new organization and panel to drive the HSR 
project should act for railway operation and urban development since the HSR is an advanced technology and

Abstract 
Cars stuck in remote places may lead to catastrophic consequences, especially with the lack of suitable tools and the 
lack of food or water. most of the drivers may not know how to deal with a sticking situation, especially in a place 
where there is no one to help. Some even pass away because the help arrives too late. All these motivate us to think 
about a simple mechanism which could be installed in the car which could be battery operated to get the car away 
from the sticking spot. The proposed mechanism will run for many purposes, but it will mainly focus on getting the 
car out of its stuck. The mechanism will first lift the car a reasonable distance above the sticking place and after that, 
the car will be moved forward or backward. The mechanism will be fitted on the lower side of the chassis of the car, 
which is not that room taking, and it will be operated by the same car battery, or any external DC current whenever 
needed. The two prime movers of the two motions in the mechanism are operated and controlled by a hydraulic system. 
The goal of our design is to build a mechanism that is reliable, safe, and easy to operate compared to its function. The 
methodology we followed was to set the components of the mechanism with the right dimensions which fits certain 
categories of safari cars. Second, the mobility of the proposed mechanism was calculated to come up with enough 
inputs to fully control the motion of the mechanism. After that the force analysis was conducted at the worst position 
of for the best follow up design. Because of the limited time, we used two commercial codes to conduct the stress 
analysis for the stress validation purpose, where the Von Miss’s theory of failure is adopted. Choosing the type of 
weld, materials and international standards is part of the methodology as well. As the project is still in progress, we 
are planning to manufacture a full-scale model and conduct some practical tests and hoping the success of the proposed 
mechanism to we can benefit our community and the international society as well.

1. Introduction
Since the introduction of cars companies tried their best to make their vehicles as safe as possible, from the introduction 
of seatbelts, airbags, and other essential safety systems, companies were inventing something new with every 
generation that could save the lives of people on the road, however, when it comes to the accidents that may happen 
off the road, there is not a lot of attention to said problem. Off-road accidents may vary, rollovers, crash, or even 
getting stuck in a difficult environment such as mud, sand and snow. When a car gets stuck in difficult environments,

Proposed Improvements  
As indicated by the outputs of Ansys, the results were successful. For more durability, we can add a linkage between 
the lower plate and piston for the forward and backward movement. A better material could be used for safety and 
space saving purposes. The hydraulic circuit could be replaced with a motorized power screw system as one of the 
prime mover alternatives that suits different non-dusty environment.

Discussion 
In the provided project the target is to design a system that eventually lift a car with a weight of 3000 kg maximum. 
So based on the best result that we can get form our calculations the design should be considered. With the designed 
mechanism, a hydraulic system will operate the whole mechanism and it will be connected to the car battery to get the 
needed power. Whenever the mechanism should be used, this hydraulic jack will operate the mechanism to move for 
the preferred situation depending on what chassis should be considered and after placing the system the hydraulic will 
give an efficient amount of force to lift up the car and move it backward and forwards. 
 
7. Conclusion 
Based on the results of the kinematic and the stress analysis, the proposed mechanism is practically applicable and 
could be easily and cost-wise manufactured and installed on certain categories of safari cars.  The proposed mechanism 
is a multi-purpose mechanism that could be safely and easily used in emergencies and maintenance situations. with 
the selection of better material, a smaller models could be manufactured for a smaller cars for the same purposes 
without any changes in the car chassis and affecting the structural integrity of the car.

Abstract 
According to several studies, Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), a well-known strategy by companies which 
operates the non-core functions of a company, is experiencing a downturn in the industry according to the huge turnout 
of employee attrition which impacts the company’s performance and competitiveness.  Thus, the study aims to identify 
factors affecting employee retention in the Philippine BPO industry by integrating Job Embeddedness Theory utilizing 
Minitab 19 Statistical software to perform Multiple Regression Analysis. A self-administered questionnaire was 
distributed through convenience sampling, gathering 710 respondents at least 18 years old and currently/previously 
employed in a Philippine BPO company. Results show that Rewards and Recognition, Employee Engagement, Fit, 
Job Satisfaction are significant variables affecting employee retention among employees in the Philippine BPO 
Industry. The researchers have provided a strong model and important findings to easily understand the significant 
factors which will enable BPO companies in the Philippines to strategically position themselves by improving 
company policies to avoid unnecessary costs about monetary and performance-related setbacks.

1. Introduction
Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) is a well-known strategy by companies in which a defined part of the company’s 
operations or non-core functions is passed on to specialized external service providers (Mukucha, et al. 2020). Some 
of the commonly availed non-core functions include back-office activities and support activities, making outsourcing 
optimal for companies to focus more on the core activities. Meanwhile, remaining competitive in the market by 
improving product quality, customer service satisfaction, and the overall performance of the business process 
(Isaksson and Lantz  2015; Krysinska et al. 2018 & Gažová et al. 2022). 
Employee attrition in the BPO industry has already been a challenge since its very beginning averaging approximately 
25% attrition rate each year which reveals the organization's internal power by exposing its weakness in retaining its 
employees, making it harder to attract potential workers (Delle-Vergini 2018; Mishra and Solanki 2018). Hence, the 
causality of having higher attrition levels indeed vastly affects a company in monetary aspects such that it accounts 
for costs incurred from the recruitment process, training, and time which adversely affects a company’s overall 
productivity and performance (Malhotra & Gautam 2016). 
The increasing attrition rate in the BPO industry is indeed alarming; thus, a company needs to be able to identify the 
reasons for its employee attrition which could be done through a practical internal assessment of a company. Within 
its existing aspects and by having it addressed through intervention schemes which in the end would also aid the 
significant increase in employee engagement within a company (Negros  2021). Through this study, the researchers

employment status and Occupational Health Problems have weak negative correlation with the dependent variable. 
Lastly, Sex, Age, Education, Civil Status, Age Joined BPO, Monthly Income, Company Location, and Years of 
Experience exhibit a negligible correlation over the Perceived Employee Retention in the Philippine BPO industry. 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendation 
The research is conducted to identify and also understand the statistically significant factors affecting employee 
retention among Filipino BPO employees. The variables presented in this study were examined carefully and were 
grounded according to the application of the Job Embeddedness Theory. Alongside, using the Multiple Regression 
Analysis the said variables were evaluated. The results indicate that the management should focus on increasing 
Rewards and Recognition (RR), Fit (F), Employee Engagement (EE), and Job Satisfaction (JS) as these are statistically 
significant factors affecting employee retention in the Philippine BPO industry with a model fit of 80.63%.  
 
Moreover, the researchers recommend prioritizing employees’ rewards and recognition (RR) in terms of re-evaluating 
employee compensation and aligning them to their key performance indicator which also relates to employee job 
fitness (F), which impacts the whole organization itself. In addition, the researchers recommend improving employee 
engagement (EE) through town hall meetings to assess the current work relationship among employees and the overall 
work environment. Lastly, increasing Job Satisfaction (JS) in ways such as ensuring a cohesive work environment, 
aligning management structure and providing more growth opportunities like training and personal development 
programs shall make employees feel more satisfied towards their jobs. Hence, it will reduce incurred training costs 
and turnover rates for the company while allowing it to achieve increased profitability as an organization. Furthermore, 
future studies may also apply other hypotheses that would be relevant in reducing employee attrition among BPO 
employees.

Abstract 
Biodiversity conservation is one of the key magnesium to preserve and protect the variety of natural environment 
and animals for the next trend of future generations to come. The biodiversity including plants, animals and sea 
or water creatures are equally important to be conserved and sustained as they play a key role in the preservation 
of ecosystem which ultimately maintains and balances the life of the planet including human being. The pacific 
island countries are blessed with varieties of unique breeds of plants and animals including birds and reptiles 
which are not found anywhere else around the world. Due to recent industrialization and increase in technology 
with the want of money or earning profits from huge companies, they have turned the forests, seas and 
environment into desert or polluted and completely change the phase of the natural beauties. This includes mining 
of both underwater and land which vastly destroyed the plants and animals or fishing without any sustainability 
mechanism to mitigate and minimize complete deterioration. In the recent past, the pacific islands country’s hard 
woods have profoundly attracted logging companies and mining industries have played a key role in depleting 
natural resources and thus, biodiversity are vulnerable to destruction and depleting in the process. The government 
need to sustain the natural beauties including plants and animals for the benefit of the future and to maintain 
balance in ecosystem. This is so much concern and because more plants are destroyed, it leads to rise in sea level, 
increase in greenhouse gas and eventually small islands are sinking in the pacific. This is happening at the alarming 
rate and thus requires immediate actions to preserve and protect the biodiversity in the pacific and around the 
world.

Introduction 
The sustainable biodiversity preservation is the use of natural resources at the rate at which the earth can renew 
them. Pacific island countries stretch across the equator and are considered has tropical countries and home to 
varieties of natural resources and environment or ecosystem including sea and land species. The tropical climate 
of the pacific countries has endowed them with best natural resources such as different breed of animals wild and 
tame, reptiles, mammals’ various types of both freshwater and saltwater fish (Biology et al. 2014). The countries 
are also rich in forest with different species of trees and plants of unique features which includes colourful flowers. 
 Furthermore, the pacific countries have different species of birds in each country of which are not found anywhere 
in the world and this makes the pacific countries some of the unique and beautiful places to live. Due to the nature 
of locality within the tropical climate, pacific countries are home to vast tropical rainforest with rich in all types 
of woods from soft to hardwood. Few countries in the Pacific Ocean are also blessed with natural resources such 
as gold, silver, oil, gas and other non-renewable minerals (Kinch et al. 2010).  
However, with the engagement and entertaining different profit making companies have ultimately convert these 
once beautiful natural environments to deserts and pollution everywhere in the streams, rivers and seas. The 
pacific countries have been long overdue to effective coordination, management and sustainability mechanism to 
preserve the ecosystem by applying stringent environmental conservation policies. The continuous logging and 
persistent mining of both underwater and surface mine have turned the once beautiful virgin forests and beautiful 
beaches into deserts and pollutant thereby depleting the microorganism including plants that plays vital role in

Conclusion 
One of the best mechanism and strategy to use and to sustain biodiversity around the pacific island countries is 
by enacting tough laws within their own countries. this will effectively regulate, sustain and protect the country’s 
most diverse and unique species without further extension as its very important for the benefit of humankind. The 
western countries such as Australia and US needs to step in to address the pacific countries on the importance of 
the biodiversity preservation and educate people of the environmental sustainability and conservation. This needed 
to be conducted in conjunction with world environmental protection acts and to fund adequate money for the 
betterment of all pacific island nations. A lot of mining activities popping everywhere in the pacific including 
undersea mining have drastically affected the biodiversity conservation. The major companies have reluctantly 
deployed enough machineries and hazardous chemical which are more harmful to the environment and thus 
consequences are catastrophic. The oil and gas companies have also setup complicated facilities which when 
spillage or mismanaged are somewhat very terrible to the environment therein.  
Places like Papua New Guinea have experienced such hazardous chemicals as it entertained various companies 
which can mine minerals as well as oil and gas. This also includes fishing and logging where major destructions 
are expected (Jupiter et al., 2014). Logging being the main disadvantages as it profoundly exploits significant 
amount of forest thereby leaving nothing but the naked soils with missing and or destroyed biodiversity. As trees 
continued to be cleared in mass quantities where tonnes of logs are shipped overseas without stringent sustainable 
methodology to preserve, we gained nothing useful accept naked soil and destroyed environment.   
Additionally, Papua New Guinea prime minister Hon. James Marape has condemned carbon emissions in the first 
world countries which gives rise to the sea level. The size of biodiversity in the pacific islands countries are really 
affected due to continuous logging and mining including carbon emissions. This is one of the greatest concerns 
ever and address by PNG prime minister in United Nations General Assembly recently. The lungs of the world 
are fed by the worlds rainforest and biodiversity including 13% contribution from PNG and the south pacific 
biodiversity. As such, the strongest possible contamination and pollution in the world which gives rise to sea-level 
in the pacific is failure to sustain, preserve and protect the environment’s biodiversity and effectively apply 
environmental laws and educate the people concern from the top to the bottom for the benefit of all doubts and to 
provide better environment for our planet.  
World leaders have no concern and are ready to take necessary actions to ensure the worlds carbon emission and 
biodiversity depletion to be minimised and ensure to provide effective and stringent mechanisms to sustain and 
conserve biodiversity in the south pacific and around the world. United States of America, Chain and other first 
world nations are now concern to reduce the amount of carbon emissions which is one of the world’s enemies that 
continue to impact the small islands nations by increasing sea-level thereby increase in global warming. The 
people are now ever convinced that if the world leaders have not taken actions and only talking, it would bring 
nothing but destructions in our very eyes and then it’s too late to act when islands are already sinking.

Abstract 
The Pacific Island countries are underdeveloped countries on earth with different traditional backgrounds and thus 
yet to adapt to western cultures.  For the past few months, the pacific island countries have been hard hit by the 
second wave of covid-19 where people who were considered above 45 years have been vulnerable and susceptible 
to death. This was happening on our very eyes and confounded and scary because such as never experienced 
before. From first wave of coronavirus, it has been treated and considered spineless ineffective disease which the 
people of the pacific islands countries were naturally immune including Papua New Guinea until the second wave 
hit the hardest. The countries in the pacific islands are completely and totally vulnerable to death due to lowest 
economy, poor health systems, and unreliable public service and most importantly underdeveloped. Economies 
were crippling at the steady rate when government considered lockdown and people have suffered greatly thus 
implications are of very severe. The Pacific countries are considered most crippling nations by covid-19 because 
the size and magnitude of our economy, health facilities and the people’s lifestyles have profoundly affected and 
contributed towards the escalating trend of covid-19 pandemic. The issues faced now is to mitigate spread and 
combat sustainably from the pandemic.

Introduction 
Coronavirus has recently hard hit in the pacific by its second wave after the first wave has been eased. People in 
the pacific countries have entirely depend on their traditional ways for survival and gather food, fishing and other 
occasions which do not comply to restrictions. As people continue to survive in their old fashion, the covid-19 
have threatened the lives which the people in the pacific are vulnerable to death especially 45 years and above.  
People are dying unlike the first wave that hit the pacific. This includes Papua New Guinea where there are many 
people dying every day concurrently with limited mitigation strategy to combat the issues by sustainably 
preserving the lives of people above 50 years old. The pacific island countries are vulnerable and are not able to 
withstand the second wave because their lifestyles are completely different as that from the western world. people 
gather in public places in thousands including stores and anywhere. This includes unhygienic ways of cooking, 
eating and sleeping or building homes as it’s part of life. As such, pacific islands people have found it very difficult 
to adapt to new normal or wearing facemask and keeping distance when talking or walking as imposed lately as 
health rules (Authorities et al. 2020). However, due to complacency and ignorant and governments lack of 
sustainable policy, people are dying due to failure to comply with health rules and take vaccinisations as majority 
of the population do not agree with the covid-19 vaccine.   
The business houses are about to close and if proposed to shut-down the country one more time would mean 
pacific island countries economy will collapse (Zhang 2020). This is evident and is happening as international 
boundaries are closed and no longer allowing people entry and thus foreign currencies will be insufficient thus 
ways of controlling and mitigating the virous would be complicated. Health of the people especially elders are in

Conclusion 
Due to covid-19 outbreak, Pacific islands countries like PNG, Fiji, Vanuatu and rest of the other pacific countries 
will be vulnerable to both health and economic threats due to lake of sustainable economic recovery plan. 
Developing countries in likes of economic and technology including infrastructure with minimal strength in 
currency will surely fall when more lockdown of these countries are imminent. It is more advisable and 
encouraging to allow the country to operate on stringent government regulations and sustainable policies that will 
also mitigate and effectively bail out dying economy. This will surely assist to ensure our economy is maintained 
at a certain limit without deterioration.  
Health and hygiene of the people are in the pacific countries are norm to traditional ways of survival though 
moved into twenty-first century in this changing globe. People are dying due to lake of knowledge and ignorance 
and failure to comply with certain rules like taking vaccines and other health protocols. The importance of having 
health protocols are merely taken as ordinary rules which is the main reasons why people are dying in this second 
wave of the covid-19. Furthermore, people are complacent within their own ways and have faith in their 
sustainable immune systems which is also one of the reasons people started contract this disease. If people 
continue to live carelessly and do not pay attention to the health protocols including get vaccinated, pacific island 
will be another evil place to live when all will be gradually queued up for grave. This is imminent and already 
happening because it’s bad for the country and thus effective sustainable policy to mitigate virus spread is 
paramount.

Abstract 
The Impressed Current Cathodic Protection is one of the key methods of protecting steel structures including, jetties, 
gas pipelines, oil tanks, harbors wharfs, ships and bridges. Impressed current method is applied throughout the world 
as the advanced and modified method of protecting structures from rusting or evade possible corrosion.  The method 
is also considered to be fit in an environment to ensure its free from releasing hazardous substances that may cause 
destructive to surrounding wildlife’s and its natural beauties. In Papua New Guinea, the impressed current method of 
protecting structures from corrosion are practiced by both state and companies established to arrest and mitigate 
corrosion. The polarization and depolarization of currents or electrons vigorously mitigate the flow of electrons from 
anodes to cathodes. The electrons then tend to migrate (lose electrons) from the more active metals (anode) to less 
active (structure, cathode electrode). In the process, active metals decays and corrode thereby protecting the less active 
metals (steel pipelines and tanks). in the process, production of pollutants is imminent from anodes used and thus 
necessary steps are undertaken to ensure all is minimized and mitigated. Current from the transformer rectifier flows 
on a consistence manner which supplies negatively charged electrons from the cathode (structure) and proceeds it 
through connection cables towards anodes (polarization). At anode, the oxidation reaction takes place thereby gaining 
oxygen ions and loses hydrogen ions. Reduction reaction occurs at the cathode where the hydrogen ions are gained 
and releases oxygen ions and thus, the process continues until the design life of the anode elapse and the active element 
sacrificed and corrodes and worn-out for possible replacements.

Introduction 
The Impressed Current Cathodic Protection system is applied widely in major structures such as sea bed pipelines, 
tanks, jetties and harbors. It is first developed to arrest the corrosion rate by defusing electrons from an anode to 
cathode (Loto et al. 2019).  The ICCP protection system is also important in protecting corrosion from reinforced steel 
structures. In impressed current cathodic protection system, the oxidation reaction occurs at the anode thereby gaining 
all oxygen ions and losing or transferring hydrogen ions towards cathode (B. Mainier FR, 2014). Associated reduction 
reaction is taking place at the cathode where all hydrogen ions are withheld and loses oxygen ions.  
Transformer rectifiers stationed on site controls the current from anode to cathode. The rectifiers are the external 
power sources which are applied in impressed current cathodic protection system to convert alternating current (AC) 
to direct current (DC). It is useful in that the electrons or currents are discharged off the anode and onto the cathode 
or structure to prevent corrosion. The transformer converts the current from the power source to required output 
voltage and then to direct current DC (Johns 2005).

Abstract 
The cathodic protection of steel structures for Puma Energy in Papua New Guinea have been deteriorating since 
construction due to inadequate potential supply from the anodes. The magnitude of protection using sacrificial anodes 
have been considered inadequate and thus amount to failing CP systems throughout all parts of the country. This has 
been revealed via various other CP companies and commissioned by Puma Energy PNG Limited to carry possible 
inspection and maintenance on established structures. Because the sacrificial anodes entirely depend its potential 
difference between the cathodes and anodes, it is quite tedious and complex to adequately supply protective current 
throughout all intended structural path for effective protection. The sacrificial anodes cathodic protection system 
established throughout all Puma Energy terminals in the country have reported to have been failed. Massive and 
complex structures such as steel tanks of both underground and surface or pipelines have inadequately protected by 
the sacrificial anodes. As such, the company is looking for recommendations to improve sacrificial anodes to 
impressed current cathodic protection system. Port Moresby’s Idubada CP terminal and Weak, East Sepik provinces 
have faced the same problems and is widely faced throughout the country. Puma Energy’s facilities are deteriorating 
and failing CP protection and thus have been greatly recommended by various CP contactors to looking into possible 
replacement with impressed current method as it rendered effective protection than sacrificial anodes.

Introduction 
Corrosion is inevitable in nature and cannot be stopped even by deploying sophisticated techniques. This is because 
iron ores when extracted from mines, it gradually went through many processes to become steel. However, when 
nature intense to converts into its original or stable states, it gradually forced through the process known as corrosion. 
The iron ores are in stable stage but when processed through various temperatures and convert to milled steel, it is 
known as unstable stage.  
The corrosion occurs due to the presence of anode, cathode and an electrolyte. Without anyone one of this means no 
chemical reaction. Port Moresby and Wewak are located in the coastal where there’s a lot of dissolved chloride content 
imminent. The chlorides are driven by wind from the coast and deposited into the structures where it eventually reacts 
with the steels and corrosion occurs. In these two centers, the type of protection is again sacrificial anodes and amount 
of cathodic protection is insufficient and very less (Mohamed  2015). Because the protective current from the 
sacrificial anodes systems entirely depends on its potential difference, the amount of current supplied is sometimes 
stray and impedance or weak. Such is true for all other centers throughout the country.

As per the Australian and New Zealand standards CP manual AS2832.1.2015, the protected portion (figure 7) values 
steady at -850 millivolts (mV) and is considered pass for sacrificial anodes.  However, the data collected above were 
in random order and fluctuates but do not fall below -0.85 V. The protected sections of the facilities were considered 
pass but this does not mean all were safely and effectively protected. According to the CP manual, the facilities 
considered to have stray current and formation of calcareous materials. This is why the values for protected sections 
were considered pass.  
The unprotected sections of the facilities in Puma Energy based PNG limited were also failing and data do not give 
sufficient guarantee of optimum stability. The corrosion engineer needs to check the structures and if possible call for 
rectification as soon as possible. This is because values of unprotected structure fall way below -0.5 which the 
corrosion engineers consider to have no CP protection or failing CP. The structure is in danger according to table 6 of 
the Australian standard manual AS 2832.1.2015.  
Conclusion  
As noted from data and graphs, it can be concluded that the amount of CP protection rendered to the facilities were 
considered to be insufficient and weak. This is due to stray current but most probably because of the weak nature of 
the potential supplied by the anodes which profoundly resist the flow of impressive current.  
As such, it is highly recommended that Puma Energy PNG limited needs to install impressed current cathodic 
protection system because it effectively protects the structures from corrosion. The amount of protective current 
rendered by impressed current is more sufficient and adequate to protective even a larger structures compared to 
sacrificial anodes. The main advantage of impressed current method is the external power supply source that reinforces 
its natural potentials from the installed anodes. Thus Port Moresby and Wewak needs to improve its sacrificial anodes 
systems to impressed current methods including other centers around the country.

Abstract 
The procurement process is an efficient way of contract awarding system to the qualified contractors based on the 
record of similar years of experience. Contract documents are composed of executable items by the contractor from 
employer and is agreed by both parties for possible implementation per the agreement. One of the most efficient 
methods in drafting contract document is the efforts used to ensure contractor is well guided by the environmental 
management plans (EMP) which forms part of the contract. This is to ensure the surrounding communities are 
protected and simultaneously sustained by the tangible projects like building, roads and bridges, etc. Through recent 
COVID-19 pandemic that bombarded the world in less than a week or two, kept millions indoors and thousands in 
hospitals and graves, this will be one of the major issues that may be considered for possible inclusion to avoid undue 
hiccups in the future. The results of these items to be included and others on next set of conform contract amendments 
to the bill or considered for possible execution. The data or results when executed will yield positive outcome on the 
technical side on the benefit of procurement process. this will also watch and guide contractors on the importance of 
the pandemic experienced so far and take as a precautionary measure to protect the personals on site and thus avoid 
spread of the virus and in emergency. Sustainability of the environment and other surrounding properties within the 
vicinity of project site is paramount important. Thus, the EMP comes to play a vital role in ensuring all things found 
through the zone of influence must be protected and sustained. Thus, per the contract agreement, all are protected and 
sustained but at the expense of the employer. For the COVID-19 pandemic to be incorporated into the contract 
agreement, it will certainly improve the document to more proper and standard in considering all emergency measures 
into consideration plus the safety of the construction works on site who are vulnerable by airborne disease may use 
masks or hand sanitizers not only for COVID-19 but for safe health practices. Thus, this will be used in avoiding and 
addressing, social responsibility, environmental sustainability, economic improvement and effective healthcare 
system including immediate issue which may be imminent ahead in the future.

Introduction 
The sustainable procurement process is the public protocol whereby goods and services are purchased through 
consideration of imminent impact it may possibly have on the environment, social responsibility and its effectiveness 
on the implementation on the progress phase. Process will further elaborate and make effective amendments on the 
sustainability of the waste management during delivery on site or how to reduce inefficiency during emergency. The

The sustainable public procurement is a process whereby organizations meets their need for goods and services or 
works and utilities in a way that achieve value for money in a whole life bases in terms of generating benefits not only 
to the organization but also to society and the economy whilst minimizing damage to the economy.  At such time of 
economic recession and coroner virus pandemic, business, industries and major companies including government have 
suffered for the last few months. Travels have been banned, restrictions were in place, people going through and fro 
been halted including goods and services, thousands remained stranded on airports or on foreign soils.  
When such unexpected incidents happened, there were no time for talk when it concerns with purchasing drugs in 
bulks or mass quantities. This is because, while allowing for normal protocol, people were dying and lateralling dying 
and thousands died in hours. To avoid such, the state and reliable government Agencies have convened to invoke and 
amend sustainable public procurement which will give full authority to the concern department to immediately 
purchase the emergency need without consulting other government departments as is the custom or protocol. The 
sustainable procurement process has set to immediately access public funds designated for emergency goods and 
services forthwith. When financial transactions are done on time or even too quickly, it may give ample time to 
supplier to prepare and have it packed for immediately delivery.  
There is still not much works done when to improve the procurement process as in likes of considering basic elements 
that associates with environmental policy to verify whether or not; The sustainable procurement encompasses all 
environmental management plan that may reduce or minimize imminent damages to the surrounding. Possibility of 
the contractor’s capability to deliver much needed service to the receiver without sustaining major damages to the 
environment. After the service has been used, the supplier or the user be able to dispose off, used service or goods in 
accordance with 2050 sustainable development goals (SDG). The sustainable public procurement reliable and 
competent enough with any suspiciousness for fraudulent acts involve.  
The process is competent enough to get goods and services on time or is it still same as the original process. The 
sustainable procurement has to have proper management plan to dispose wastes and unused chemicals or drugs 
purchased for the purpose of COVID-19 pandemic. The process to balance and ensures there’s value for the service 
purchase in shortest time possible for the benefit of all people. Ensure goods and service purchased from supplier has 
to be quality and must arrive on time regardless of the distant location. The sustainable procurement ensures all goods 
and services destined for good course and meets the demands for the organizations and deliver on site or point of 
request whilst defining reducing or minimizing possible damages to the environment.  
Recommendation 
For the benefit of the general public and emergency events as in case of COVID-19, sustainable procurement be 
practiced including unforeseen events that may or may not to be imminent. The best possible option in any trade 
between or within organizations would practice sustainable procurement which will enhance immediate and effective 
trade. The service that would have profound impact through sustainable procurement and thus recommended of the 
following:  
Sustainable public procurement to be practiced throughout all sectors of an organization or government department. 
Amend it into law and invoke fastest sustainable procurement in cases of emergency Ensure all necessary acts are 
considered to be taken care of including environmental protection in the long run. The disposable goods and services 
to be also considered in sustainable procurement when procuring when in emergency. Also consider whether the goods 
or services procured are biodegradable and can be dissolved without any harm to the all layers of spheres including 
earth and water. The items disposed should have less or minimal damage to the surrounding and thus such should also 
be taken care of in sustainable procurement  
Conclusion 
By analyzing the effect of coronavirus outbreak and consequences, lessons learnt, and other results, it is necessary and 
fitting for the government to invoke fastest procurement and sustainable procurement to be established and enacted 
into law. This will relieve pressing issues in relations to importing drugs rather than taking too much time waiting. 
Waiting would mean more people death and the disease is already uncontainable. Thus it is the prerogative of the 
government and should be a prerequisite for the all countries after learning what happened and thus expedite the 
process of purchasing goods and services that are considered worthwhile and useful for the benefit of the general

Abstract 
This study aims to evaluate the performance quality of microbus-based public transportation facilities in Sorong City. 
Route A is the longest route with various land uses for trade, hotels, ports, stadiums, housing, schools, and offices. 
The COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of online taxi bikes have reduced the potential for this public transportation 
line. The research method is observation and analysis of service performance based on the Decree of the Director 
General No. 687/AJ.206/DRJD/2002. The evaluation results show that service time performance is in the medium 
category because there is no information on operating hours from 06.00-17.00 EIT, travel time is less than 12 km/hour, 
speed below 5 km/hour, and load factor less than 70-110%. However, the frequency of the number of vehicles 
operating, the headway, and the waiting time are optimal.

1. Introduction
High levels of population growth, migration, and vehicle ownership each year result in congestion on several roads. 
So, the availability of public transportation balances the density of roads due to high traffic volume and meets 
transportation needs (Mandaku  2021). The route in the city of Sorong has a circuit pattern with a starting and ending 
point route at the Pasar Remu, a type B terminal covering an area of ± 2160 sqm. According to the local Department 
of Transportation, there are four lines: Line A along ± 10.2 km with a total fleet of 408, Line B of ± 9.9 km with 397 
units, Line E of ± 8.5 km with 158 fleets, and Line H of ± 8.9 km with 151 vehicles in 2022. Unfortunately, the WFH 
policy during the pandemic and the proliferation of online taxi bikes reduced the number of passengers. This research 
will use route A as a case study because it is the longest route with complex land use, including trade centres, hotels, 
settlements, offices, education, and other public facilities such as places of worship and stadiums. According to Vian 
Andrias Mabruwaru (2017), in his research entitled Analysis of Passenger Transport Performance in the city of Sorong 
Case Study of Route A, the overall performance on weekdays, weekends, and holidays is in a good category through 
static and dynamic surveys. Public transportation needs 12 units for one cycle and 46 units during peak hours with a 
headway of 4.6 minutes. However, the research was conducted in 2017, before the pandemic and the rise of online 
transportation applications. In addition, although the performance of the route service has decreased, its existence is

© IEOM Society International 
So, the more vehicles pass, the shorter the time between them. Based on the analysis graph above, it is found that 
the longest headway is in off-peak hours at 12.00-12.59 of 6 minutes, while the fastest one is in the morning and 
evening rush hours at 06.00-06.59 and 16.00-16.59 of 3.5 minutes. Headway is directly proportional to the waiting 
time obtained from calculating the average time value of passengers who stop on the observed road. From the 
analysis results, it can be concluded that the longest headway at off-peak hours is 12.00-12.59, the waiting time 
value is directly proportional to 3 minutes, and the fastest one is 3.53 minutes with a waiting time of 2 minutes. 
The results are then compared with the performance of public transportation in the Decree of the Director General 
No.687/AJ.206/DRJD/2002. According to a good standard, the frequency value is > 6; the lowest frequency at 
off-peak hours at 12.00-12.59 is ten vehicles/hour. Then for the best headway by standards of less than 10 minutes, 
the highest on the field at the same off-peak hour is 6 minutes. However, the waiting time is good if the value is 
less than 20 minutes, while the longest waiting time is 3 minutes. Overall, it can be said that the route's 
performance in terms of frequency, headway, and waiting time is good. 
5.3 Travel Time and Speed  
The longest travel time in one cycle on weekdays and weekends is 19.33 minutes/km during off- peak weekends, 
which is more than 12 minutes/km. The assessment standard is not good based on the 2002 Land Transportation 
Service regulations. The waiting time is very long because many drivers wait for passengers at the terminal. The 
lowest speed on weekends or holidays of 3.6 km/hour, less than 5 km/hour, which means the standard is not good. 
The speed is in segment one, from the terminal to the Simpang Polresta, an office area. 
5.4 Comparison Of Load Factor With Number of Passengers 
The dynamic load factor is expressed as a percentage. The calculation is done by dividing the number of 
passengers by the carrying capacity to get the average value each day, both during busy times, usually in the 
morning or evening, and during quiet hours, weekdays (Monday), weekends (Saturday), and holidays (Sunday).

The calculation above shows the largest percentage occurs in the morning rush hour on weekdays at 45%. However, 
this percentage is far below the standard set by the Directorate General of Land Transportation of 70-110%. It indicates 
that the public transport route passengers are less than optimal in serving the movement of passengers. 
6. Conclusion
The discussion above concludes that several things cause poor route performance. The first is the unavailability of 
information on service times at the terminal or the stopping point. Second, travel time and speed because the lowest 
rate is below 5 km/hour. The longest travel time is less than 12 km/hour in segment 1, which has office land use from 
the Remu-Simpang Polresta Terminal on holidays. Third, the largest dynamic load factor value of 45% is less than 
70-110% in weekday morning rush hour. It indicates that the route is less than optimal in serving the movement of
passengers, which can be due to the pandemic's movement restrictions and the increasing number of online taxi bikes.
However, the frequency of vehicles, the time between, and the waiting time are optimal with good service.

Abstract 
The freshness of beef becomes the most important factor affecting the quality of the meat. The need for beef continues 
to increase, indicating that awareness of the importance of eating meat is getting higher and higher. With the high 
price of beef in the market, it makes some people who cheat mix the quality of beef with cut meat that has been stored 
for a long time. The purchase of beef is usually carried out to identify the freshness of the meat with the naked eye 
and sense of smell as well as direct contact by suppressing the texture of the meat. However, this method has the 
disadvantage that consumers are not observant and have difficulty distinguishing the quality of beef freshness. 
Therefore, in this study, we tried to examine the level of freshness of beef by using the TGS 2602, MQ - 135 gas 
sensors as detectors of voc and ammonia compounds produced by meat and the TCS3200 color sensor by using RGB 
values as identification of the beef. This study also analyzed the level of beef freshness with indicators obtained from 
the three sensors using the K- Nearest Neighbor method. In this study, there were 3 conditions of the level of freshness 
of the meat tested, namely fresh meat, slightly fresh meat, and non-fresh meat with an accuracy rate of 93%.

Introduction  
Beef is a livestock product as a food ingredient with high nutritional value because it is rich in protein, fat, minerals 
and other substances needed by the human body for growth and health. In addition, when viewed from amino acids, 
meat has a complete and balanced amino acid composition [1]. The need for beef continues to increase, showing 
awareness of the importance of eating meat is getting higher and higher so that beef is expected to have good quality 
and is suitable for consumption by the human body, with the high cost of beef in the market, there are some people 
who cheat to mix the quality of beef with cut meat that has been stored for a long time. The purchase of beef is usually 
identified by identifying the freshness of the meat with the naked eye and sense of smell as well as direct contact by 
pressing the texture of the meat and seeing the color of the meat. However, this method has the disadvantage that 
consumers are not observant and have difficulty distinguishing the quality of beef freshness. Therefore, it is necessary 
to test the quality of beef freshness before consumption.   
Several studies have been conducted, among others designed a system that can identify the level of freshness of meat 
implemented into the Raspberry Pi by using the Neural Network as a method to perform pattern recognition at the 
level of freshness of the meat being tested. Another study conducted [2] designed a system that can identify the level 
of freshness of fish quickly. The system was implemented into Arduino uno and used K-Nearest Neighbor as a method 
to perform freshness recognition of the tested fish. Further research conducted [3] this tool is designed to recognize 
gases or scents that have a function like the human senses on the nose. The MOS Gas Sensors used in this study were 
TGS2600, TGS2602, TGS2620, MQ135, TGS813. By using all five MOS sensors the output of the Neural Network 
feed forward calculation sensor is entered into the Microcontroller.  
Objectives 
Based on these problems, a ""Beef Freshness Detection Tool Based on Gas and Color Sensors Using the K- Nearest 
Neighbor Method Based on ATMega 328"" was created in this study to examine the level of freshness of beef using 
the TGS 2602 gas sensor, MQ - 135 gas sensor as a detection of VOC and ammonia compounds produced by meat 
and a TCS3200 color sensor using RGB values as identification of the beef. This study also analyzed the level of beef

Conclusion 
Based on testing on the color sensor block, the color sensor can respond to differences in the level of redness that is 
the parameter of meat freshness. In the gas sensor test, different voltage patterns were obtained for the two sensors 
against 3 meat samples with different levels of freshness. Through the use of the K- Nearest method, the system built 
can determine the level of freshness of beef well. The more training data values and the smaller the K value, the better 
the accuracy of the system. The first conclusion of the system as a whole is the use of a color sensor and two gas 
sensors can be implemented to properly classify the level of freshness of beef. In addition, the use of human sense of 
smell and vision in determining the level of freshness of beef can be replaced by electronic devices in the form of gas 
sensors and color sensors. And the last one is that through the use of the K- Nearest Neighbor method, the system built 
can determine the level of freshness of beef with a success rate of up to 90%.

Abstract 
This paper provided a thorough comparative analysis between the light-dependent resistor (LDR)-based light system 
and the commercialized automatic solar- powered light system. It aimed to developed a better system of streetlights 
in the location of the study. The proposed work was carried out by creating a prototype of an automatic streetlight 
using a light-dependent resistor (LDR) and purchasing an automatic solar-powered light system from online retailers. 
An LDR sensor was used as a switch in the automated LDR-based street lighting system. The researcher’s goal was 
to compare and analyze which streetlight system was more beneficial for the community of the location site. This 
project provided the most effective solution to the streetlight issues as well as the cost and durability of a better 
streetlight system. Additionally, the study analyzed both streetlights to determine which will be more beneficial in 
terms of total investment cost (by getting the total unit of Pesos), output efficiency (by getting the Lumens per watt), 
and durability (by using a table of literature review). This comparative analysis between the two streetlight systems 
was done at the study location. After the study, the final conclusion obtained was that the LDR-based light system 
was better in terms of output efficiency and durability. While the commercialized solar-powered light system was 
better based on the total investment cost that the researchers computed. The study concluded that the LDR-based 
streetlight system was chosen as the preferred alternative as an automatic streetlight system for the community of the 
location site because of its output efficiency savings and durability. The LDR- based streetlight system also proved to 
be an environmentally friendly, highly efficient, and durable type of streetlight system. Additionally, this study did 
not bothered residents since they were notified about the study being conducted. In addition to this, researchers also 
concluded that all of the hypotheses are valid.

1. Introduction
Road accident cases are becoming a significant threat to society as they occur regularly and vary in danger. One reason 
is the inability to provide good street lighting. According to Abalos (2021), street lights are important to lessen and 
avoid fatal road accidents. Without the street lights, drivers and commuters are in danger. Part of road safety is making 
the road visible to all its users.  In the Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018 published by the World Health 
Organization, According to Weiler (2018), there are existing bills on pedestrian safety, transportation safety, and 
emergency medical systems like in the country of the Philippines. Death rate from road crashes has continually 
increased over the years despite various efforts by the government and other road safety stakeholders. Data from the 
Philippine Statistics Authority indicates that there were 11,274 deaths from road crashes in 2016. Through its 
Philippine Road Safety Action Plan 2017–2022, the government now aims to reverse the trend and cut road traffic 
deaths by 20% by 2022. In unfortunate cases, road accidents lead to fatalities. If the numbers above were daunting,

The study between the two streetlight systems was carried out in the proponent’s home in Barangay Payatas (A), 
Quezon City. The two streetlights are small in scale and thus also imply that it will be conducted inside the backyard 
of the proponent’s house. This comparative analysis between the two streetlight systems was done at the study 
location. After the study, the final conclusion obtained was that the LDRbased streetlight system is better in terms of 
output efficiency and durability. while the commercialized solar-powered streetlight system is better on the total 
investment cost. Both streetlight systems have been observed throughout the day. According to the study's findings, 
the LDR-based streetlight system was chosen as the preferred alternative as an automatic streetlight system in the 
study area due to its output efficiency and durability; thus, it has been demonstrated to be a highly output-efficient and 
durable type of streetlight system. In addition to this, researchers also concluded that two of the hypotheses are valid.

Abstract 
Tool failure is one of the primary causes of failure in computer numerical control (CNC) machine tool machining. 
Such necessitates condition monitoring of CNC machine tools to improve the effectiveness of failure-free operation 
and decrease the probability of waste and equipment failure caused by tool failure. This paper proposes a novel method 
based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and Petri nets (PNs). In the first iteration of the proposed method, a PN model 
is designed to represent the milling machine and guarantee the model's liveness. Then, the developed model is 
integrated with the IoT model to monitor the tool condition based on the obtained data from the sensors. The 
experiment results demonstrate that the developed method can represent the tool's wear state and provide a timely 
reminder to replace the tool.

1. Introduction
Increasing the productivity of CNC milling machines while maintaining a high level of accuracy and surface roughness 
is a top priority for many manufacturers. How to control frequent failures in CNC machines, including ""tool wear,"" 
""noise,"" and ""tool breakage,"" is a challenge (Kaid et al. 2023). Tool wear (TW) is difficult to manage because it is not 
a linear process; it degrades rapidly initially, then at a moderate rate for a period of time, and then accelerates until 
breakdown. TW is a frequent and undesirable issue in most machining operations. It introduces several challenges to 
the productivity and quality of ""automated machining processes,"" thereby preventing the growth of smart and 
combined manufacturing enterprises (Tran et al. 2022a).  
Several diagnostic and monitoring methods for the cutting operation were designed to address this issue, employing 
""cutting signals"" for chatter recognition (Chen et al. 2019, Kuljanic et al.2008, Ghoneim et al. 2021). Most of these 
methods, however, are offline. Generally, the chatter monitoring procedure requires data collection, signal processing, 
and the use of statistical approaches and machine learning for chatter diagnosis (Liu et al. 2020, Tran et al. 2020). The 
study (Kious et al. 2010) addressed the use of ""cutting force signals"" to improve ""tool condition monitoring"" (TCM) 
in milling operations by designing a tool wear prediction method. The paper (Wang and Cui 2013) presented a ""self-
supervised neural network"" entirely generated from data collected under typical machining conditions, eliminating the 
requirement for tool wear conditions during training. The work (Nouri et al. 2015) developed another approach for 
TCM in ""end milling"" and diagnosed a real-time failure by observing the force model's coefficients. 
The development of an Internet of Things (IoT)-based intelligent online technique for TCM in CNC machine tools is 
now the solution for efficient ""predictive maintenance systems,"" which regularly record and document the condition 
of the machine's tools (Civerchia et al. 2017). Recently, robust fault detection and monitoring methods based on 
""Cyber-Physical Systems"" (CPSs), ""artificial machine learning,"" and IoT have been developed. New IoT 
infrastructures have been constructed for the online monitoring of induction motor failures (Tran et al. 2021), vibration 
conditions (Tran et al. 2022b), and tool wear (Kaid et al. 2023) during the CNC machine center cutting operation. 
As the literature states, companies apply rigorous operational techniques to minimize such failures and prevent 
expensive TW (Rangwala and Dornfeld 1989). However, because of the necessity to replace the tool early, machine

4. Conclusion
Due to the enormous growth of IoT-based ""cyber-physical systems"" in milling machines, in which a specific level of 
adaptability is essential, this study highlights the importance of methods and tools developed to assist automatic failure 
detection and repair. This paper introduces a novel technique based on PNs and the IoT for an online tool condition 
monitoring system. First, the PN model is designed to represent the milling machine and guarantee the model's 
liveness. Then, the developed model is integrated with the IoT model to monitor the tool condition based on the 
obtained data from the sensors. The results highlight that the developed technique is simpler in configuration. In 
addition, the proposed strategy is applicable to various intelligent systems in future studies.

Abstract  
 
The short-term scheduling problem (STSP) of oil refinery operations with unreliable distillation units (CDUs) is a NP-
hard problem, necessitating a high degree of accuracy and efficient techniques. Developing effective scheduling 
optimization techniques for oil refineries is a significant challenge. In order to provide solutions to this difficult 
problem, this study proposes a new hybrid Petri net and tabu search (PNTS) approach with unreliable CDUs to 
effectively solve this problem. To show the efficiency of the developed approach, an industrial case study is used. The 
results demonstrate that the developed method efficiently solves the industrial case study. 
 
Keywords

1. Introduction  
 
Global market competition and the associated environmental challenges need that companies seek strategies to 
increase profit, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and minimize expenses.  It has been established that efficient 
production planning improves both the economy and the environment in high-energy-consuming industries (Al-
Sharrah et al., 2001). Process industries, including steel production and oil refining, consume more energy and have 
a high cost. As a result, it is critical to develop effective strategies for managing a plant's activities efficiently. 
Nowadays, a new factory is handled hierarchically, with three levels:  process control at the bottom, scheduling in 
the middle, and production planning at the top. It is well recognized that essentially most industrial plants have 
optimized their unit performance criteria at the process control level by installing intelligent control methods. 
Moreover, with the introduction of methods based on ""linear programming,"" planning technology has evolved 
significantly, enabling the efficient formulation of an optimal plan (Pelham and Pharris, 1996). However, for 
industrial-scale applications, computationally efficient techniques and related software tools are required at the middle 
level (Wu et al., 2008c, Honkomp et al., 2000). Indeed, a planner prepares the STSP manually through trial and error 
(Wu et al., 2008c). With a gap between the upper and bottom levels, the three levels are unable to be combined, leading 
to an inefficiently run plant (Jaikumar, 1974, Shobrys and White, 2000). Therefore, effective solutions for the STSP 
must be investigated to develop tools. Since a crude oil refinery is a process flow industry, which makes a major 
contribution to the economy, this study investigates in detail its short-term scheduling difficulty. 
For complicated scheduling problems, heuristic methods such as tabu search algorithms, simulated annealing 
algorithms, and genetic algorithms are good solutions (Mattfeld and Bierwirth, 2004, Ponnambalam et al., 1999, 
Sabuncuoglu and Bayiz, 1999, Yang and Wang, 2001). These approaches are only applied to problems with initially 
deterministic scheduled jobs and no consideration for solution feasibility. To develop the STS for the refinery plant, 
the number of activities to be performed should be specified, the specific prosesses for each activity described, the 
time needed for each prosess defined, and the activities sequenced. Moreover, there is no realistic way for determining 
the feasibility of a schedule. Furthermore, these methods are ineffective for scheduling refineries on a short-term basis. 
As a result, a novel approach to overcoming this problem should be presented.

5. Conclusion  
This paper presents the STSP of oil refinery processes with unreliable distillation units. The STSP is a NP-hard 
problem that is difficult to solve. Due to the complexity of the STSP, the scheduling process must continue to be 
conducted manually, and efficient techniques and software tools are required. In order to propose solutions to this 
difficult problem, this paper develops a new hybrid Petri net and tabu search (PNTS) approach under unreliable CDUs 
to effectively solve the problem. The results demonstrate that the developed PNTS efficiently solves the industrial 
case study.

Abstract 
Transportation is a highly affected sector during the COVID-19 pandemic, and trucking comprises most of Indonesia's 
transportation market share. Hence, more research in this transportation sector is critical for enhancing Indonesian 
supply chain performance. This research highlight the comparative analysis across different segment of trucking 
companies on the resilience factors highlighted during the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaires were distributed 
to some Indonesian trucking associations with 33 private fleets, 101 trucking carriers, and 56 third-party logistics and 
courier participants. Partial Least Square Structural Equation modeling was used for the statistical analysis. This 
research reveals that financial resources management significantly enhances company resilience and performance of 
the private fleets, while third-party logistics and couriers mainly rely on business continuity management and finances. 
Truck carrier highlights a broader range of resilience factors involving financial resource management, resilient 
leadership, risk and business continuity management to enhance company resilience, emphasizing innovative 
digitalization technology and finances in correlation to company performance. This study provides managerial insight 
into different trucking segments and opens the possibility of extending the business and diversifying the investment.

1. Introduction
Transportation is a sector highly impacted by COVID-19 (Shen et al. 2020). Therefore, more research on this topic is 
crucial to help trucking companies sustain operations during this COVID-19 pandemic. Trucking companies consist 
of a few different segments. Our research classified these trucking companies into truck carriers, private fleets, third-
party logistics, and couriers.  
Kähkönen et al. (2021) suggest a comparative analysis across different countries and industries. Dohmen et al. (2022) 
also recommend more research comparing the resilience act. In addition, Hosseini et al. (2020) suggest future studies 
connecting resilience and performance. Mitręga and Choi (2021) have researched relationship management in Poland 
transportation companies and recommend future studies related to this topic in other countries. In addition, Mohapatra 
et al. (2021) also recommend upcoming research involving quantitative statistical analysis of factors contributing to 
company performance. Lestari et al. (2022) discussed problems and actions in different industry sectors in Indonesia, 
including logistics and transportation, yet the scope is only on implementing health protocol during the COVID-19 
pandemic.  
Most studies highlight specific sectors, while none of the research discusses various business types or sizes (Rebmann 
et al. 2013). Hence, they observed different sectors in the United States and found out that the pandemic preparedness 
of more prominent firms is better than the small ones. Lookman et al. (2023) discussed Indonesian trucking companies, 
yet their research only focused on competitive advantages and innovative capabilities. Our previous research discussed 
a comparative analysis of different sizes of Indonesian trucking companies (Sugianto et al. 2022a), did a comparative

 Abstract 
Window Manufacturing Company (WMC) in Puerto Rico is a prestigious and visionary brand in the manufacturing industry 
of doors, windows, and architectural solutions, which over 55 years of experience. Glass and aluminum are two of the 
materials used in their production operations to deliver high quality doors and windows. In the critical areas of the glass-
cutting process, there are no existing metrics or standardizations evaluate the state of operations. This research aims to 
improve the glass cut process output from 4,500 to 6,500 square feet daily. To achieve this objective, the entire process 
must be analyzed and observed from beginning to end to identify the root causes of the deficiencies in the maximization of 
capacity and production of glass cutting. Since the glass cutting line is the most demanded and has much variability in 
products, styles, sizes, and measurements, we can cut 6,500 square feet daily with 3.4 hours of overtime, which means an 
annual loss near $60,000. We use different empirical methods to analyze data, such as Lean Six Sigma, DMAIC 
methodology, and production optimization. By implementing several design alternatives, the objectives set for the project 
were reached and exceeded.

1. Introduction
WMC is the leading corporation in designing and manufacturing aluminum and glass goods. They specialize in custom 
doors and windows designing, manufacturing, distributing, and installing them for homes and businesses. This project will 
be based on the specific area of Glass, which has several phases in creating the final product. Glass cutting production is 
currently 4,500 square feet per day over 7.5 hours. This is a problem since the glass cutting line's capacity needs to be 
utilized to its full potential without incurring in overtime. To enhance the production output, management wants to enhance 
capacity by increasing glass cuts to 6,500 square feet in the same period. This project aimed to redesign the glass-cutting 
process to increase production capacity, including more planning and communication in the area, optimizing warehouse 
carts during production hours, equipment downtime, and a gantry layout design that can respond quickly to dynamic 
production requirements.   
1.1 Objectives  
Two objectives were established: increase capacity and production in the glass cut process from 4,500 SQFT to 6,500 SQFT 
daily and optimize the organization of the carts and glass gantry and reduce management downtime by 35%. Achieving 
these objectives will result in 100% reduction of the current overtime costs.   
2. Literature Review
The project was organized following the process improvement DMAIC principles, with phases of historical data analysis,
root cause analysis and implementation of alternatives. Several industrial engineering methods were used to facilitate
evaluating causalities between the response and independent variables, with statistical validation of results provided, like
Perez et al. (2021). Statistical inference tools can facilitate these analyses, with methods like those in Montgomery and
Runger, (2010). The tools for the historical data analysis include a stopwatch time study to determine standard time

For the inventory management system improvements, a Kanban Storage Cart was recommended. The number of 
required Kanban was established using the following equation:

Where the variables are defined as:  
D = demand  
LT = lead time  
S = safety stock  
C = container size  
k = number of Kanban  
  
Assuming the glass cuts area reaches the goal of 6,500 sqft in a 7.5-hour shift, the variables in the formula are shown 
in Table 5. The Kanban analysis suggests that six (6) carts must be available for a continuous flow, resulting in zero 
pauses in production for lack of carts.

5 Conclusions  
The project aimed to redesign the glass-cutting process to increase production capacity. To obtain the improvement, 
the main problem was divided in subproblems that considered task execution, inventory management system and 
layout. Following a root cause analysis, a weighted decision process was performed and three solutions, were 
identified. For the two objectives:  
 
Increase capacity and production in the glass cut process from 4,500 SQFT to 6,500 SQFT daily – with the 
recommendations provided, the production increased to 9000 SQFT daily. Since there are seventy-five periods of 6 
minutes on working days, multiplied by the production that these man-machine diagrams can do in the period of 6

minutes, which is 120 square feet, the total daily production is 9,000 square feet. This means that it has been 
demonstrated that in addition to the expected production capacity, an additional 2,500 square feet per day can be 
produced.  
 
Optimize the organization of the carts and glass gantry and reduce management downtime by 35% - with the 
recommendations, the management downtime is reduced by 79%. This percentage of decrease is proven in the 8-waste 
checklist, where it was cut from 3 months of annual loss to only one month. Transportation was high in waste and was 
reduced to low, motion and extra processing were also from high reduced to medium, overproduction and waiting, 
were type medium reduced to low, resulting in reducing non value added activities.   
  
The project achievements are summarized in table 6. Both objectives were exceeded, allowing the company to 
duplicate its daily output while reducing process downtimes. By achieving both objectives a 100% reduction of 
overtime costs was achieved, since production can be performed during regular work hours.
