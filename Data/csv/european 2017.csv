Abstract 
Hospital-acquired infections are not only a major concern for hospitals, but also global health society. 
Life and cost burden of the hospital-acquired infection is very much noticeable. It is widely stated that 
hospital-acquired infection is not a local issue; it is a challenging global health-related issue. It results a 
noticeable mortality rate. Although many prevention policies and booklets were distributed by different 
hospital managers for staffs, visitors and patients use, the productivity of the hard-copy booklet method 
were not encouraging enough. Hospital-acquired infection is still a serious problem faced by the ministry 
of health and hospital policy makers. The main objective of this study is to provide an applicable proposal 
to encourage mobile application software, active in hospital sites, in order to guide hospital staffs, 
visitors, and patients on Hospital-acquired infections control methods. This study is with the use of 
qualitative approached in research. A literature review with additional site observations has been 
conducted by the researchers to achieve the main objective of this research. As the result of this study, we 
find that mobile health could be an effective method to solve the hospital-acquired infection issue. 
Hospital managers with the support of the ministry of health could provide a free of charge mobile 
application software in the area of related hospital units for the visitors, staffs, and patients. The software 
could be planned to show prevention techniques based on each site unit. The users will easily install the 
application on their smartphone, for free and start reading the prevention methods to enhance their 
knowledge.

Abstract 
This study explores how supply chain strategies should be aligned with demand/product characteristics and 
market requirements. A review of the product-driven supply chain literature suggests that there is a lack of 
analytically proven guidelines to help strategy makers confidently design their supply chains. In this paper, 
we provide a mathematical validation for Fisher’s (1997) framework which is extensively cited in the 
literature and matches supply chain strategies (i.e., efficient or responsive) with product type (i.e., 
functional or innovative). Specifically, we analyze the impact of demand variability, product life-cycle, and 
contribution margin on the supply chain capabilities, i.e., efficiency and responsiveness. Our analysis starts 
with an initial discussion on the two inventory models, newsvendor and continuous review, and then 
develops the continuous review model into a multi-echelon supply chain structure where optimality is 
mathematically explored to demonstrate how it would change when product/demand characteristics change. 
The results confirm that optimal lead-time decreases in demand variability and contribution margin, but 
increases in product lifecycle. Moreover, optimal order size increases in demand variability and 
contribution margin (and so does in average stock-out cost), but decreases in product lifecycle.  
Keywords 
Supply chain strategy; optimal inventory decisions; product characteristics.

Lean Manufacturing has been so successfully implemented that it has become the de facto method of 
manufacturing. However, all such activities are subject to the law of diminishing returns, leaving many 
manufacturers wondering where the next big gains are to come from. For many, Industrie 4.0 would seem 
to offer the solution. However, for an organization balancing competing priorities with limited resources, 
should the focus be on ‘smart manufacturing’- defined as comprising such things as increased production 
output, quality, safety, and yield? Or ‘connected products’, defined as applying to Industrie 4.0 to vehicles 
and industrial machinery in order to facilitate remote diagnostics, remote maintenance, and remote data 
capture, up to and including servitization? Or should their focus be the ‘connected’ value chain, defined as 
applying Industrie 4.0 in order to increase the visibility and coordination of both inbound and outbound 
activity?  This paper explores this very real dilemma for manufacturing organizations and proposes a simple 
audit tool as a starting point that an organization can use to identify how their practice of Lean might be 
extended to leverage the benefits of Industrie 4.0.

1. Introduction
1.1 Origins and drivers for Industrie 4.0 
There is a well-known proverb “a thousand priests makes a thousand religions” and if one works in the field of 
manufacturing you could be forgiven for making a new version “a thousand Industrie 4 experts means a thousand 
version of what Industrie 4 is”!  One widely used definition from the EU Briefing paper ‘Industry 4.0 Digitalization 
for productivity and growth’ (Davies, R, 2015) defines Industrie 4.0 as “a term applied to a group of rapid 
transformations in the design, manufacture, operation and service of manufacturing systems and products” however 
most researchers would probably agree that the term is not particularly well defined and the definitions that do exist 
seem to vary according to the industry perspective of the definer.  Almost all the current definitions point towards the 
idea of 'Smart Factories' with a view to changes/improvement to increased flexibility, enable mass customization, 
increase production speed, product quality and overall productivity, give a wider customer range, increasing 
independence on location and development of new business models – for example the move towards 'servitization' or 
selling services not products (sometimes described as 'selling light not light bulbs'). 
The Industrie 4.0 Working Group (Kagermann, et al, 2013) believes that action is needed in the following eight key 
areas: (i) standardization and reference architecture; (ii) managing complex systems; (iii) a comprehensive broadband",,"Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

5. Concluding Remarks
The benefits of implementing Lean manufacturing methods and techniques are indisputable and can be argued to have 
been the cornerstone of the successful growth of much of the manufacturing industries. Most companies are already 
far along the lean ‘pathway’ and those that are not are probably looking to begin.  Large amounts of valuable 
experience is already available to these companies and lessons learned in implementing lean manufacture could be 
transferrable to those who are looking to implement Industrie 4.0 in their businesses. The main tents of Industrie 4.0 
consist of a variety of areas which will need to be addressed to enable truly ‘smart’ manufacturing and business.  
The current situation with Industrie 4.0 (i.e. no-one is truly sure exactly what to do and how to start) can be seen as 
analogous to the situation with lean manufacture in the early days of its development and implementation. The early 
days of lean implementation proceeded through a series of phases; beginning with no knowledge, discovery, 
enthusiasm, (sometimes over-enthusiasm!), pragmatism, systemizing, optimizing and now finally looking for the next 
thing to achieve the kind of gains found in the first stages of implementation of lean. Industrie 4.0 as an idea can be 
difficult to ‘encapsulate’ and thus explain and enthuse industrialists.  
To successfully begin implementation of lean practices, the usual starting point is some kind of audit or gap analysis 
tool. This tool allows a company to firstly identify areas of strength or weakness and/or problems which need solutions 
and then identify and apply appropriate lean techniques in the places detected. This paper argues that a similar starting 
approach is required with implementing Industrie 4.0 and thus a suitable audit tool is necessary. The paper outlines a 
proposed Industrie 4.0 audit tool, which being based on existing lean audit tools (the style and operation of which will 
be familiar to practitioners of lean) will be easy to use and understand and will help companies ‘plan their Industrie 
4.0 journey’.

Abstract 
Forecasting is an important tool in operations planning. Determining resource requirements and 
scheduling of personnel at a call centre require accurate forecasts. This study includes analysis and 
forecasting of the number of calls of general type of customers at a private bank’s call centre. These 
customers are referred to as mass customers and their calls constitute more than 60% of all calls at the call 
centre. Time series data contain double seasonality with intraday pattern for hourly calls within day and 
interday pattern within week. The data set of hourly calls of ten-week period is separated into a training 
set consisting of the first eight weeks and test set consisting of the last two weeks. The methods 
considered include seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and regression with 
ARIMA errors. Two models out of different candidate models are identified through statistical inferences 
of the model parameters, diagnostic checking and fit indices by using the training set for the original 
series and logged series. Forecasting performances of the models are evaluated with one-step ahead 
forecasts by using the test set and it is concluded that suggested models adequately predict hourly calls of 
the call centre.

1. Introduction
It is very important for banks to provide customer-satisfying services by their call centres while running profitable 
call centre operations. Gans et al. (2003) explain the economic importance and complexity of telephone call centres. 
They state that most call centres capacity costs in general, and human resource costs in particular, account for 60-
70% of operating expenses. The cost of staff members handling phone calls at call centres typically comprises 60-
80% of the overall operating budget (Aksin, et al., 2007). 
Forecasting is an important tool in operations planning. Determining resource requirements and scheduling of 
personnel at a call centre require accurate forecasts. Accurate forecasts of call arrivals are key for the achievement of 
optimal operational efficiency as under-forecasting leads to under-staffing and long customer waits, while over-
forecasting results in money wasted on over-staffing (Ibrahim et al., 2016). Steckley et al. (2009) point out that it is 
worthwhile to investigate techniques for choosing staffing levels while accounting for the trade-off between service 
quality and staffing costs in the context of arrival rate variability as its ignorance can have a significant negative 
impact on system performance. There is an increasing interest in describing the call arrival patterns, modelling and

4. Conclusion
It is vital to forecast arrivals accurately at call centres to be able to manage effectively the operations in terms of 
staffing, scheduling and quality of service. This study includes analysis and forecasting of the number of calls of 
general type of customers at a private bank’s call centre. The forecasting models obtained using seasonal ARIMA 
method and regression with ARIMA errors method adequately predict hourly calls of the call centre. Since the time 
series data of call centres have both a daily cycle and a weekly cycle, the forecasting methods chosen should capture 
these seasonal patterns. As a further study, artificial neural networks can be used with the same data by adding 
trigonometric dummy variables for seasonal cycles and the results can be compared with the results of this study.

ABSTRACT 
The gate assignment problem is an important operational issue (GAP) faced by airlines at airports. 
The assignment schedule has implications for efficiencies in passenger transfer, baggage transfer, 
towing of unassigned aircraft, scheduling of ground logistics such as fueling, aircraft cleaning, and 
other maintenance functions, and overall passenger satisfaction.  This paper presents a model for 
assigning flights to gates at airports that maximizes the total preference value of the flight-gate 
assignments subject to a number of constraints.  The problem is formulated as a zero-one linear 
programming model which has a strong underlying acyclic network structure.  The efficiency of 
the model is demonstrated on data obtained from Air Canada for the Halifax International Airport. 
A problem with 61 flights and 14 gates is solved optimally using CPLEX in 25 seconds of CPU 
time.

Abstract 
This research addresses the multiple level warehouse layout problem, which involves assigning items to 
cells and levels with the objective of minimizing transportation costs. A monthly demand and an inventory 
requirement are associated with every item type along with vertical and horizontal unit transportation costs. 
The warehouse has one port to transport items vertically from ground floor to the other levels, where each 
item must be assigned to exactly one cell on the assigned level.  
Both the items’ demand and their inventory requirements are stochastic, following a uniform distribution. 
This NP-complete problem is solved using an optimization-simulation-optimization approach. In particular, 
Ant Colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is modeled using discrete event simulation to capture the 
randomness of the items’ demand and inventory requirements, then the simulated ACO’s parameters are 
also optimized to guarantee superior solutions. 
This approach’s performance is evaluated by comparing its solutions to the ones obtained using 
deterministic data. The results show that simulation was able to identify better assignments of items to cells 
than the deterministic approach, as the latter did not capture the real randomness of demand and inventory 
requirements.

Abstract 
In today’s digital era, accelerators such as technology and sustainability have necessitated the 
transformation of the manufacturing industry, to become adaptive, connected and cognizant of its own 
functioning. This paper provides a framework for analyzing the system design and organizational 
management considerations that need to be followed in adopting the digital factory idea with a specific 
focus on resource efficiency. One of the priorities of this paper is to develop a model to optimize the 
energy consumption on the production line of a discrete printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing 
company in Canada. Energy efficiency in the manufacturing domain must be seen in a more holistic form, 
where resource optimizations are supported by Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) 
based infrastructure. This provides means to better understand how energy is being utilized in the factory 
floor and what could be done to reduce its usage and cost to the company. Going beyond energy 
consumption optimization this paper draws a parallel between the data obtained from the model and the 
various levels of organizational management, to dynamically adapt the digital factory concept to business 
plans or goals thereby aiding manufacturing companies in thinking strategically and making informed 
decisions.

Abstract 
Evaluation of flatness of machined components has assumed considerable significance because of its role 
in predicting functionality during application. Standard flatness assessment techniques used in industries 
as contact in nature which limits its measuring speed. Though, contact measuring technique is very 
accurate, speed of inspection is not fast enough to be used as an online measurement technique. To 
overcome these drawbacks, many non-contact measurement techniques came into being. Many of these 
techniques are electro optical in nature. These techniques are reasonably fast however; the method can be 
used only in laboratory environments. The proposed method uses a machine vision system for flatness 
measurements uses a relatively low-cost vision system and can be used in industrial environment. In this 
context, the proposed methods assume special significance. Both the accuracy of measurement and speed 
are not available in online measurement of flatness. Hence, the proposed method use as a vision system 
for flatness measurement the method is non-contacting in nature and hence higher inspection speed are 
possible and finds application in online assessment of flatness.

1. Introduction
In this paper, Inspection of Flatness of specimen surface using vision system is presented with two methods. These 
techniques are developed with focus on industrial application that can use not only in lab environment but also in 
industrial environment. The method is unique by its concept, experimental arrangements, and algorithms. Method is 
non-contacting in nature and doing 100% inspection of surfaces.  
2. Methodology
2.1 Specimen preparation 
Specimens are prepared by shaping and grinding operations as per table 2.1. Specimens were prepared in square 
shape to have dimensional advantage for calibration. As this is novel measurement technique, to prove that there is 
no significance difference between standard methods and proposed method, specimens are prepared in 25 quantities 
to prove statistically and compare with standard methods.

3. Analysis & Conclusion 
3.1 Side view method 
According to algorithm MATLAB will give three quantities maximum height of peak, minimum height and flatness 
value, here flatness value comes as a result is in pixel unit. Pixel values were calibrated according to distance of the 
camera from the object. As per shown in fig.3.1, pixel values are plotted against flatness value measured by standard 
method. However, method is showing insignificancy with measurement readings of standard method. It is due to the 
setup or camera orientation we may conclude that this method is better for lab environment where discharged light is 
vailable. .

Abstract 
Interpretation of Value in the Saudi Housing Market  
Value as a principle of lean thinking has great potential for an enhanced interpretation 
when perceived from the customer's perspective, particularly in the initiation phase of 
a product design activity and the customization of the product service attributes 
throughout the holistic value chain. The design of enterprise systems, provides various 
abstraction levels of any system understudy in the form of a constructed model, for 
example the construction of a model representing the housing market in Saudi Arabia. 
Whereas, most models are of complex nature and ill-defined problem, ambiguous goals 
and unclear means to arrive the goals requiring more effort in scoping the design 
problem. Particularly that many problems fit the definition of wicked problems, a class 
of social system problems which are ill-formulated, where the information is confusing, 
where there are many clients and decision makers with conflicting values which applies 
to the characteristic of the Saudi housing market when carefully evaluating the gap 
found between the unit price of a housing product and the average purchasing power of 
potential consumers in need for the housing product offered by the developers, this 
inadequate interpretation of value as perceived by the customer in the housing products, 
that are made available by the Saudi housing market developers, has great potential to 
be bridged when scoping the design problem on the consumer purchasing power 
abstraction level for the model representing the system.

Abstract  
In this paper we propose the design of a multi-agent system which has the concept of sociability like the 
main feature in the behavior of artificial agents. We expose the concept of social-inspired computing and 
the design of an artificial agent like a finite-state machine as a way to modeling a set of behaviors and solve

1. Introduction
In this paper we describe the proposal for a multi-agent system which has the sociability like the main feature among 
its components. The need of include the concept of sociability in artificial systems is a consequence in the increase of 
the number of interconnected systems and their ability to communicate and work together as a distributed system. 
This new features make the traditional control schemes not enough robust to work in dynamical environments 
(Gershenson & Fernández, 2012). First we make a description of the main features of an interconnected system and 
mention some of the new challenges that appear when we work with these kind of systems. Second, we explain the 
concept of social-inspired computing as a way to modeling these new challenges and work with systems with a high 
amount of components (Shoham & Tennenholtz, 1995) (Insa-Cabrera, Benacloch-Ayuso, & Hernández-Orallo, 2012). 
Additionally, we expose how it is possible to include the concept of sociability in the logical design of a artificial 
agent. To achieve this, we use the finite-state machine as way to model different kind of behaviors in the system and 
to allow change de decision model of an agent according to the context (Chaczko, Chiu, & Kale, 2010) (Leitão, 
Barbosa, & Trentesaux, 2012). 
As a future work we expose a layer model for a distributed system that has as a base a ad hoc network. In the upper 
layer can find a multi-agent system which the features mentioned above. 
The paper is organized as follows: in section 2 the interconnected networks are described. In section 3 and section 4 
we expose the concept of social-inspired computing and the the logical design of an artificial agent based on sociability. 
Finally, in section 5 and 6 discussion and future work are drawn. 
2. Interconnected networks
The communication networks has had a great development in the last years. Since the first communication systems, 
with the purpose to make phone calls, until nowadays where we have networks with a convergence of services.
The communication systems evolved from serve for phone calls to a data transmission with a great amount of service 
working at the same time. The increase in the amount of devices and the possibility to communicate among them had 
as consequence an exponential increased in the size of communication networks (Nitti, Girau, & Atzori, 2014). 
As result of the growth of fixed systems, the needs of users started to change; the mobility appear as a desirable 
condition of communication systems. Therefore, there was a change in the routing algorithms and in the way the 
systems manages the packets and communications. The possibility to communicate terminals through wireless

7. Conclusions
In the presentation of this document a research proposal is made for the design of a multi-agent system based on the 
concept of sociability. The proposal shows the design of the agents as a finite-state machine as a way to give flexibility 
and adaptive mechanisms to a set of agents. To achieve this the concept of a knowledge base is used. 
However, the interesting thing about this proposal is that in definition of the interactions among agents and the 
exchange of information among knowledge bases works as the base base of sociability. As a proposal, a future work 
section is planned where the implementation of a layer model has the necessary conditions for the construction of the 
multi-agent system. All these concepts working together will be the base of social-inspired computing. 
Additionally it is assumed that the basis of this research are the needs of the interconnected systems. These conditions 
provide the framework for the development of the IoT and in response to solve problems related with these new 
technological approach. It is necessary start to think in new ways if we want to develop these technologies.

Abstract 
This paper presents a simulation and calculation for the hysteretic delta-sigma modulator (HDSM). A 
complete theoretical study of the significant modulator parameters is also given. The HDSM structural 
design has three characteristics appropriate for the high-speed A/D conversion: (1) all signals contained by 
the modulator are positive for a specified enclosed input; (2) no sample-and-hold switch necessary for the 
reason that of using a bi-stable switch with hysteresis; (3) the input signal has almost a linear relationship 
with the time-averaged output.

1. Introduction
At the present time, analog to digital converting technique become an important topic in electronic system. As
known, the Delta-Sigma-Modulator (DSM) is a complicated system, because it engages analog and digital problem 
for its implementation. Most significant fact is the practical part, since of its robustness and the number of significant 
applications used in the design of Analog-to-Digital Converters. The hysteretic delta-sigma modulator (HDSM) is a 
continuous-time delta-sigma modulator CT-DSM with binary (0, 1) output. All signals contained by the modulator 
are positive which composes its optical implementation practical. Structural design of the hysteretic delta sigma 
modulator HDSM and the input/output relation of the inverted bi-stable device are shown in Figure 1. When the 
parameters are chosen properly the ranges of all signals within the modulator have positive values.

Abstract 
In the manufacturing environment, there are many algorithms for assigning jobs to multiple-load 
automated guided vehicles (MAGVs).  In this study, an agent based control system is proposed for the 
control problem of MAGVs. In the literature, task determination, delivery-dispatching, pickup-
dispatching and load selection problems are researched and some dispatching rules are used frequently to 
dispatch MAGVs. This study focus on delivery task problem in which an MAGV should determine which 
delivery point will be visited. For this aim, an Multi-Agent based control system framework combined 
with dispatching rules for MAGVs is developed in this study.

Abstract 
Shade variation occurs when the same textile material is dyed using the same recipe but reflects different 
color. Shade variation is one of the major problems in textile dyeing industry causing delays, reworking, 
or even loss of the customer. Even though shade variation cannot be avoided completely, it should be 
within an acceptable range specified by the customer. In this study, a two-level fractional factorial design 
for six factors is used to perform an experiment for the dyeing process of knitted cotton fabric. The 
difference between the reflectance data of the samples from the experiment and the reflectance data of the 
standard sample is used as the response variable. The statistical analysis of the experimental data is 
carried out to investigate the factors accounted for shade variation. The objective is to determine 
influential factors in order to identify opportunities for quality improvement. It is concluded that 
temperature and liquor ratio are the most influential factors on the shade variation and their two-factor 
interactions with salt type are also significant.

automated, but some employees still hired to do manual job in module assembly process. The labor may 
have high risk of musculoskeletal disorders because of the long work hours and the repetitive activities, 
handling large-size of glass in an unfitted work station. We has used questionnaire, checklist and to evaluate 
the work place design. The result shows that the participants reported high musculoskeletal disorder 
symptoms in shoulder (59.8%), neck (49.5%), wrist (39.5%), and upper back (30.6%). To reduce the 
musculoskeletal disorder risk factors, we have recommended revising the height of the work benches, chairs 
and redesigning the truck to decrease the chance of unsuitable positions and to reduce other ergonomics 
hazards and set a good human machine interface and appropriate job design.

Abstract 
Most airlines companies’ core objective is to provide a smooth air traveling experience to 
their passengers. To increase passenger satisfaction, airlines should be aware of passenger 
seating preferences, including solo women passengers. In the MENA countries, particularly in 
Saudi Arabia, women are considered to be more conservative than in other countries. Due to 
cultural matters, women do not feel comfortable sitting next to a man passenger. At the time of 
boarding, when women find that their seat is assigned next to a man seat, they usually request for 
reseating. Most airline seat reservation systems do not meet solo women’s concerns of sitting 
next to men. The aim of this project is to develop an effective seat reservation system that 
accommodates solo women passengers’ preferences. It will help the airlines to eliminate seat 
rearrangement when board on the aircraft. In order to reach an optimal solution, three 
alternatives were generated and compared using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The 
optimal solution that will be applied in this project is a computerized seat reservation system 
with an optional choice for sitting in a flexible female zone, with different options for seat types 
and locations. A check-in procedure will be established and followed by the check-in counter 
agents, and a boarding strategy will be provided to solve the swapping issues. The expected 
outcome from this project is to have a satisfactory seating arrangement for solo women 
passengers.

Abstract 
Female students in engineering programs are still fewer in number in contrast to male counterparts 
offering same courses after years of professional integration and learning convergence. Currently, in the 
focal group under exploration, only 28% of students at the faculty of engineering are females, which 
indicate a wide gap between male and female students within this faculty. The study focus is on 
identifying challenges which female students experience while studying engineering programs. This is 
imperative because engineering programs are now less gender selective and it is needful to identify the 
challenges female students are griping with in order to proffer solutions that will assist the students go 
through their studies with ease. To identify this problem, a quantitative research approach was taken and 
data was harnessed from registered female students within the faculty using questionnaires. The results of 
the study reveals that lack of funding support, inadequate academic mentorship, and peer pressure 
constitute some of the challenges experienced by female students in engineering faculty. The research 
outcome is useful as it provides data to guide management in taking informed decision that will address 
the low intake and number of female student drop out from the engineering faculty.

1. Introduction
The society today is engineering and technology based and the quality of life of the people is directly or indirectly 
related to the quality and level of technical education in vogue. Engineering and Technology are the terms used 
nowadays in almost all aspects of life from the making of a needle to the manufacture of an space craft. In this 
progressively shifting world, the human need and services revolve around the engineering and technologies. For the 
economic and industrial growth of any developing country one of the very important aspects is the progress in the 
field of engineering and technology. Technical education are playing a major role to the overall education system 
and also playing a vital role in the social and economic development of the counties. Today’s engineering graduates 
will have to resolve tomorrow’s problems in a world that is, as never before, progresses much more rapidly, and

Q6 
Are you on funding? 
There are forty-four (53%) students who indicated that they obtained loan from National Student Financial 
Aid Scheme (NSFAS). The scheme aim at transforming NSFAS into an efficient and effective provider of financial 
aid to students from poor and working class families in a sustainable manner that promotes access to, and success in, 
higher and further education and training, in pursuit of South Africa’s national and human resource development 
goals. Students who study with the loan will have to refund 50% of the loan obtained when they start working after 
graduation. Majority of students in South Africa depend on this loan for their University education. In 2017, many 
students struggled to get the loan but few students are opportune to get the loan. In addition, 4 students’ indicated 
that they got bursary from Gauteng City Region Academy to pay for their academic expenses for the year.  The 
remaining students have their fees paid by their family members. The lack of funding is a big challenge for the 
students and this has resulted in some students withdrawing from school.  
Q7 
Do you have academic mentor? 
Students’ responses to this question indicated that most students don’t have mentors. From the responses, 
66 (80%) of the students have no mentor, 8 (10%) indicated that they have mentors. The remaining students gave no 
response, which can be interpreted that they do not have mentors.  
Q8 
Are you being affected by peer pressure? 
The responses retrieved from the questionnaires show that 62 (75%) students are not affected by peer pressure, 11 
(13%) are influenced by peer pressure while the remaining students gave no response. 
4. Conclusion
This study doesn’t sketch a detailed and polished portrait creates of the female engineering learning experience but 
provides a rough sketch, using a variety of research methods and relying on the female students own words for much 
of the data. Questionnaires related to the challenges faced by female students in engineering education were 
distributed to the batch of 2017 academic year. Evaluation has been done utilizing quantitate method in which 
patterns, themes and categories are examined but focus not on replication. Total of 82 random sampled questions 
were taken. The questions were based on the information about the age, family background, their learning 
experiences in a male dominated department, peer pressure and their financial challenges 
Based on the finidings it is found the maximum numbers of students are between the age group 15-19 only two 
students were above the age 30. Maximum parents have studied till matric and are employed. It is also found that 40 
parents live in rural area and 38 lives in urban area while 5 students gave no answer. Around 53% of the students has 
obtained loan from National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). The remaining students have to pay their fees. 
The lack of funding is a big challenge for the students and this has resulted in some students withdrawing from 
school. Based on the findings, it is also found, that the female students, faced numerous gender-related challenges 
and peer pressure, even of the students have no mentor in academic.  
Although currently Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), has 28% of the female students there is still need for 
much more females in engineering in order to satisfy ever-growing demand for gender-balanced engineering 
workforce. Diversity of the student body at academic institutions has immediate economic benefits. In an age where 
many academic institutions compete for enrolments, in particularly in engineering, not drawing on the pool of 
women, for example, reduces revenue. Equity, however, does not just mean an equal number of women and men; it 
means equal chances of success and career opportunities and development. 
The study, however, attempted to contribute, in its small way, to the knowledge of difficulties of women in 
engineering education. Women are naturally creative and engineering is creative too, Women bring a much desirable 
and exceptional zest to engineering and therefore they should be supported, motivated, protected, respected, 
appreciated, and promoted.

Abstract  
In  today’s  online  shopping  experience,  online  customer  reviews are seen as an essential reference  in 
supporting  online  shoppers  to do  product study  and make a purchasing  decision.  Online reviews  are 
very  influential  as they are  based  on customers’ insights and true  experience of product use. As e-
commerce is becoming more popular, the employment of customer reviews systems grows rapidly as 
well. Hence, the importance of reviews is acknowledged. But what sort of important information do 
online shoppers look for when using online reviews? This paper attempts to empirically investigate the 
engagement between online shoppers and customer reviews to identify what are the key information 
dimensions that they referred to, searched or looked for regarding online customer reviews. The study 
conducted an ethnographically-informed observational consumer study aimed at obtaining the important 
information dimensions of online review contents. The consumer study is based on video recordings of 
real online shopping experience, and follow-up interviews with the online shoppers. The findings were 
thoroughly analysed through data coding and validated through inter-rater reliability tests to form a set of 
key dimensions of important information in online customer reviews. This result shows that the set of key 
dimensions of review support the reason people look into online customer reviews.  
Keywords  
Online customer reviews; e-commerce; information dimension; ethnographically-informed observation.  
1. Introduction
E-commerce is rapidly growing with the increasing number of commercial Web sites and acceptance of 
online shopping trending by consumers. Since E-commerce is becoming more popular, the number of 
customer reviews grows rapidly (Park et al. 2011). Consumers who shop online cannot touch or smell the 
products; therefore they must refer to product information obtainable from the site to make a judgement 
on their purchases. The limitation can be mitigated through online sellers offering consumers the chance 
to share product assessments online (Smith et al. 2005).  Generally, online customer reviews are defined 
as peer-generated product evaluations posted on company or third party websites which contain 
overviews of products from users’ standpoints (Dabholkar 2006).

Based on the results shown in tables above, from both emergent and a priori coding have presented a 
substantial level of agreements between coders. The results interpreted that the codes extracted are 
reliable and the set of key important information dimensions in customer reviews consists of User 
Experience, Value For Money, Product Quality, Customer Service and Recommendation.  All these 
categories or key important dimensions of information are generic yet distinctive which has enabled 
people to differentiate the difference between the categories.  
7. Conclusion
The study has proven that using an Ethnographically-Informed Observational approach is a valuable and 
practical method which is suitable in investigating online shoppers’ information search needs and 
identifying the key important information dimensions in review content. Based on the consumer study, 
the findings formed codes that represent the review dimensions and the codes were assessed through 
emergent and a priori coding processes to establish reliability and validity of the codes developed. Hence 
the result has signified that the codes represent reasons people look into customer reviews based on the 
scores achieved. To sum up, the overall output of this research has discovered that the User Experience, 
Value For Money, Product Quality, Customer Service and Recommendation are the key important 
information dimensions of customer reviews.

Abstract  
Last mile logistics also referred as city logistics or urban logistics, concerns to the optimization of urban 
freight transportation systems. This relatively recent concept responds to the need for feasible and 
sustainable last mile logistics solutions that contribute to reductions on not only costs but on congestion 
and environmental effects, particularly in dense cities.  Decisions on a supply level involve network 
design, which includes urban facilities location. In this context facilities are called urban or city 
distribution centers, micro distribution centers, satellites platforms or just satellites. On other hand, 
vehicle fleet related decisions need to be also customized to this particular urban distribution context, 
specifically dealing with multi-mode selection, fleet size, smaller vehicle capacities (i.e. city-freighters), 
power technology, vehicle autonomy, and inclusive, vehicle design, etc. Literature suggests there is still 
an opportunity in terms of optimization modeling and methodologies to address these issues. This work 
revises the drivers motivating the topic, the last mile distribution network elements, and establishes an 
explicit connection between urban network design and the actual development and use of more 
environmental and suitable vehicles for urban freight.

Abstract 
The Single-Facility Location Problem (SFLP) is one of the most important problems in Logistics and 
Supply Chain Management. Its significance is crucial for transportation routes and capacity planning, 
selection of suppliers, and international expansion of enterprises. Concerns regarding the emission of 
pollutants by transportation vehicles have led to the development of green technologies and sustainable 
practices.  Within this context we present a model to dynamically integrate an emission factor of CO2 
emissions in the SFLP. This model is proposed in order to consider the pollutant risk factor within the 
location decision process. Experiments performed on standard FLP instances present a difference in the 
final location of the facility if the CO2 factor is considered. This is an important insight to estimate the 
generation of CO2 for this kind of decisions and the pollution risks in specific regions.

1. Introduction
Facilities, customers and suppliers are important elements of the Supply Chain. Within the Logistic Network, 
facilities (distribution or manufacturing centers) must be efficiently connected to their customers in order to achieve 
a fast and controlled product flow. The location of these facilities involves finding the best location from a set of 
potential locations to minimize the associated distributing costs (Yang et al., 2007).  
The Single-Facility Location Problem (SFLP), also known as the Weber’s Problem (WP), consists on determining 
the location of a single facility which minimizes the sum of weighted Euclidean distances to n demand points (Chen 
et al. 1992). WP is one of the most important problems of optimal location of interconnected points (i.e., demand or 
service points) (Zabudskii and Veremchuk, 2016).  
In recent years, concerns regarding climate change have led to modelling environmental objectives within the 
formulation of distribution problems (Harris et al., 2009). Thus, it is now strategically important to design efficient 
and environmentally-friendly distribution networks that depend of the locations of the main distribution centers. 
Within this context, Green Logistics has become an important aspect of the Supply Chain as it consists of the 
management practices and strategies developed to reduce the environmental impact of the distribution activities of 
products (e.g., materials and waste management, packaging and transport). It also focuses on the development of 
sustainable production and distribution strategies considering the associated environmental and social factors 
(Guirong et al. 2012; Sbihi and Eglese, 2009). Particularly for the manufacturing and transportation industry, Green 
Logistics has become very important to reduce the emission of pollutants (i.e., CO2 emissions).

In this work we proposed a methodology and metric to integrate pollutant emissions within the SFLP. The metric 
uniformly generates emission values within a confidence interval estimated from DEFRA data. Thus, dynamic 
practical variation of the CO2 emission can be modelled with the proposed metric. Also, the methodology and metric 
proposed to integrate CO2 emissions on the SFLP showed that there is a difference in the facility location when this 
factor is considered.  
Due to these observations, it is important to highlight the pollutant reduction within logistic planning (particularly if 
Green Logistics is expected to be achieved). Hence, the future work is to be focused on: 
-
to extend on the modelling of CO2 emissions for more distance metrics and surface models;
-
to analyze the suitability of the model for other distribution contexts;
-
to implement the CO2 metric on other distribution planning problems (e.g., vehicle routing problems).

Abstract 
This study aims to investigate how the Twittersphere reacted during the recent historical event of robotic 
landing on a comet. The news is about Philae, a robotic lander from the European Space Agency (ESA), 
which successfully made the first-ever rendezvous and touchdown of its kind on a comet nucleus on 
November 12, 2014. In order to understand how Twitter is practically used in spreading messages on 
historical events, we conducted an analysis of one-week of tweet feeds that contain the #CometLanding 
hashtag. We studied the trends of tweets, the diffusion of the information and the characteristics of the 
social network created. The results indicated that the use of Twitter as a platform enables online 
communities to engage and spread the historic event through social media network (e.g. tweets, retweets, 
mentions and replies). In addition, it was found that comprehensible and understandable hashtags could 
influence users to follow the same tweet stream compared to other laborious hashtags that were difficult 
to understand on social media.

Introduction  
Microblogging is a novel form of communication that involves posting updates, ideas, or simply quick 
notifications, thus providing a flexible platform for communication (Ebner, 2009; Zhao and Rosson, 2009) and 
Twitter is one of the most popular microblogging service used for spreading information. Twitter has more than 
approximately 1.3 billion users (as of 2016), of which, 317 million are active users (Twitter Report 2016). The site 
was launched on July 13, 2006 (Jansen et al., 2009) and has since expanded considerably in its use for connecting 
people and spreading information (Golbeck, Grimes and Rogers, 2010; Java et al., 2007). Twitter enables users to 
send and read short messages called ‘tweets’ with 140-characters and focuses more on small events happening in 
users’ daily and work activities (Arakawa et al., 2014). Twitter defined itself as “a real-time information network 
powered by people all around the world that lets you share and discover what’s happening now” (Twitter.com).  
Hashtags, words or phrases prefixed with “#” sign are the primary way in which Twitter users organise the 
information they tweet and make it more searchable (Bruns and Stieglitz, 2013). The trending hashtag will appear on 
the Twitter sidebar when they are currently and massively used in real-time as the trending topic. Hashtag enables 
tweets on specific topic to be found easily by clicking on the hashtag topic or searching for the said hashtag. 
Hashtags make it easier for people to find and follow discussions about brands, events and promotions. In the 
context of events or conferences, hashtags are found to be expedient because conference organizer and participants 
can share information and content about the event using the same hashtag such as #iswc, #kidneywk11 and #TtW12 
(Chang, 2010). According to Onook, Agrawal and Rao, a twitter hashtag archive can be considered as result of a 
collective effort, because the posts can be aggregated into a single stream with a common #hashtag.  They also let 
brands track the performance of promotions across social media, as it allows you to keep track of the brands and 
search for updates. Although several studies have conducted Twitter research on academic conferences (Ebner, 
2009; Letierce, Passant, Breslin, et al., 2010; Ross et al., 2011; Wen, Parra and Trattner, 2014; Reinhardt et al., 
2009), politics and government (Mergel, 2013; Hsu and Park, 2012; Golbeck, Grimes and Rogers, 2010;

edge or link between the nodes shows the connection that occurs, such as through retweets or mentions. For this 
analysis, we examined the network by measuring the number of nodes, the number of edges, reciprocity, the degree, 
and the clustering coefficient of the network. Fig. 5 shows the network visualisation that depicted the flow of 
communication during this one-week event. There were 604 number of nodes with 802 unique edges involved in 
this network. The first observation is the degree of reciprocity in this network where the ratio of the number of 
relations which are reciprocated over the number of total relations in the network is measured. We found low 
reciprocity (0.005) in this network, which was expected as Wen et al. also found in their study that retweeting 
activity contributes to low degree of reciprocity in a network due to lower interactions. Then, the node’s clustering 
coefficient (0.011) was found to be significantly low in this network. The clustering coefficient is the number of 
closed triplets in a neighbourhood or the degree to which nodes in a network tend to cluster together. It indicates that 
the network has minimum clustering and was more likely to perform disjointed cliques. This was supported through 
our last observation on number of in-degree (i.e. incoming connections) and out-degree (i.e. outgoing connections) 
in the network. The average number of in-degree and out-degree connections is similar in this network, which is 
1.328. Below are examples of communications that occurred in the network between the nodes:

Discussion and Conclusion 
In this study, we analysed Twitter feeds for the Rosetta Mission Probe landing. Our analysis revealed that most 
users chose to adopt an uncomplicated and easy official hashtag because it is more understandable and 
comprehensible. We found that the #CometLanding hashtag received the most hits 801,998 compared to other 
additional trending hashtags, such as #67P and #Rosetta. It shows that users compliantly tend to follow the hashtag 
stream and applied the hashtag started by the initiator or domain user. From our observation, user behaviour of 
tagging is mostly about complying with and adopting this simple hashtag: #CometLanding. Essentially, there was 
other an additional hashtag used by some people, which is #67P. Even though #67P -the scientific name of the 
comet- is short and precise compared to other hashtags, but this hashtag did not trend. Based on our insight, this kind 
of hashtag is more likely perceived as a technical tag because first, the public have no idea of what 67P represents 
and only those who are familiar and aware of space terms tended to use this hashtag, since it requires a certain level 
of knowledge and awareness of what it implies. With a simple hashtag, such as #CometLanding, users were quickly 
settled on the hashtag and we can conclude that it directly attracted people to tweet and engage disseminating 
information collectively.  
Secondly, our findings suggest that Twittersphere is a suitable platform for disseminating information for historic 
events based on the amount of the potential reach tweets calculation during this event. This indicates that 
microblogging is an important source of covering real-time news updates for an event like this and has a broader 
network of coverage compared to other social media forms, such as Facebook. Users can easily access the hashtag 
since any trending topic on Twitter will be displayed on the left side of the client page. They can follow the stream 
of news updates and post comments to the hashtag without needing to establish a mutual follower/followee 
relationship with the original posters. This kind of approach spreads the richness of the event and makes the tweets 
visible for other users who are regularly viewing and gaining updates through hashtags. Besides, several 
conversations and interactions between two top influencers’ account (@Philae2014 and @ESA_Rosetta) were found 
appealing to followers, and as a result, attracted many users to retweet and favourited their interactions. It can 
therefore be assumed that this appealing interaction contributed to the high level of engagement identified during the 
event. 
Our analysis also supports suggestions that influencers play an important role as a driving factor to encourage 
followers to engage. Our analysis showed that users like @Philae2014 and @ESA_Rosetta are the top influencers 
and that these users are likely the people who were directly, physically and virtually involved in the event. We also 
found that the frequency of tweets from the influencer (e.g. @Philae2014) was higher when the landing happened 
with around one tweet per minute (within 10 minutes of the landing) compared to other days within the study 
period.

This suggests that influencers used this strategy to keep updating their followers by giving and sharing the latest 
information to maintain engagement, and at the same time ensuring #CometLanding continued trending on the first 
page of Twitter. We can infer that these frequent tweets held people’s attention and encouraged them to follow 
updates of this historic event and this resulted in the propagation of information across other online communities.  
However, there are some limitations on this work. For a start, we conducted our analysis during a one-week time 
frame, but the results might not be generalizable to the period before and after the event since situations may be 
different. For future work, our recommendation is to examine the usage of additional tags related to the domain 
hashtag that may enable the spread of messages outside the initial online community. Further, research is needed to 
future investigate and validate the suitability of Twitter for historic events compared to other social media types.

Abstract 
This study presents an operational interruption analysis in bars and profiles rolling mills, developed 
with the support of a steel company. The study was performed by analyzing the operational 
interruption records related to guidance equipment in order to identify the fundamental causes of the 
interruptions, helping in their subsequent minimization or even elimination. The analysis included 
the equipment assembly and maintenance parameter, physical conditions and performance during 
operation. The equipment assembly and maintenance cell has undergone a layout change aiming higher 
functionality, the equipment was standardized, and the employees were trained by the manufacturers. 
The applied solutions have been proven to be effective with superior results than 35% of reduction and 
tending to stabilize the process.

In addition, a second workbench equipped with all the necessary tools for assembly and maintenance of guides has 
been installed, so that the collaborator responsible for the maintenance can work in parallel with the collaborator 
responsible for the assembly. All cabinets with doors were discarded and replaced by shelves or trolleys, exposing 
the organization of materials. The parts shelves have been identified and a fast location scheme has been developed 
for all parts. 
Furthermore, all of the missing profile IDs were purchased, and they were centralized in a single, properly identified 
panel, as well as some static reservations for the dry guides. The checklists of the cell were restructured in order to 
simplify as much as possible and eliminate all items deemed unnecessary. And finally, the cell was painted and the 
lighting was redone. 
Despite the difficulties and some delays in the action plan, the results obtained were quite satisfactory, proving that 
the project has a solid basis and that the proposed changes came to stabilize the process as indicated by the trend line 
shown in Figure 9. 
Figure 9. Interruption results collected during project development 
Thus, as the work was completed before the end of November, the result described was proportional and shows that 
decrease 1.5% of interruption’s variability in nine months. 
6. Conclusions
During the construction of the work, it was noticed that with the correct application of a good working methodology 
based on lean and six sigma concepts and with detailed planning, discipline and organization, one can achieve the 
desired kaizen improvements, however it is necessary to exercise negotiation, knowing how to listen, understanding 
and often disagree, therefore, the human factor is very strong and is always present in projects of team management 
and process improvement. 
In the system records, difficulties of classification of the stop and inconsistencies were found during the records of 
the events. It is worth noting that the scenario of the analyzed cell presented many opportunities for improvement in 
the 5S question, especially in the sense of order and use. There was also absence of wear control, parts being 
accepted outside the desired specification due to lack of planning of purchases, generating rework, missing parts 
with a frequency above acceptable, lack of control of the rollers to be recovered and, as a result, the lack of them and 
the lack of qualification of the employees responsible for both maintenance and assembly.

The stratifications pointed out that the alignment failures are the ones with the highest incidence, however, when 
analyzing the scenario as a whole, it is noticeable that in a way all problems are interconnected and the root cause is 
in fact lack of capacity and process standardization. 
With all of these observation exercises, aided by the selected Six Sigma tools, a number of considerations were 
arrived at, some of them already explained in the analyzes. The most latent finding is the lack of training of the 
professionals who are part of the operational team. The differences in performance of employees after training were 
noticeable. What most attracted attention was the lack of motivation and the difficulty of some employees to 
visualize the change and to leave the zone of comfort. After the initial resistance, the work was taking shape and as 
the results appeared, the team was increasingly adhering to the proposed changes and even suggesting others. 
From the results obtained, it would be interesting to continue the work of renewing and updating the equipment, in 
addition to continuing to train the team in Lean Six Sigma concepts and tools and standardizing procedures so that 
the knowledge is perpetuated and improved. Although the studied cell presents very adverse conditions such as 
physical space limitation and high production range, with the continuation of the work still can become reference in 
the group. For this to be effective, it is important to maintain follow-up and collection management, constant 
training and compliance checks.

Abstract 
Social media networks such as Facebook and Twitter have become vital and is a-must by businesses 
nowadays. Social media covers a wide spectrum of users and facilitates businesses in their operations by 
providing various services and interact with customers. As a result, a large amount of social media 
content is created and freely available on social media sites. In order to understand customers better, 
companies use this opportunity to monitor and analyse user-generated content related to their interactions, 
performances and at the same time provide comprehensive views on other competitors. In an effort to 
help companies understand how to perform social media analysis and transform the data into meaningful 
knowledge, this paper examines user-generated unstructured content on Twitter and Facebook sites of the 
three leading UK online retailers: Amazon, Asda and Tesco. Our analysis shows how topics, engagement, 
sentiment analysis of these data could be turn into knowledge, source of intelligence and useful for 
companies to improve businesses. We believe that the study of customer behaviours and interactions on 
social media site has its potential to extract valuable knowledge and pattern that can be beneficial to 
develop effective marketing strategies. The results will be discussed and implications will be drawn.

Abstract 
The informal nature of operations can be an issue especially for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). 
Understanding the key problem and gaps will establish suitable framework in effectively integrating 
strategy for operations improvements. This can be done by exploring actions taken by ‘competitive 
SMEs’ to discover decisions, practices and tools which contribute towards improved operations. 
By doing this, there are three contributions that can be made. First, it provides tools and actions required 
to improve operations. Second, it can show when the tools and action should be carried out. Finally, it can 
discover ‘good practice’ which may only obtained by speaking directly to ‘competitive SMEs’ managers 
and owners. 
In general, this paper addresses the need to establish systems that would provide support to organisations 
by not only giving directions on where it should be and how to improve but also providing guidance when 
actions should be initiated. In the end it will benefit a new start-up and also organisations which is still 
unclear about the strategic operations direction that should be pursued.

Abstract 
Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises or commonly known as the SMEs is one of the supporting pillars of 
economic Pharmaceutics among the middle class. SMEs are high productivity levels in the villages which 
have massive labor absorption. Currently, Indonesia has faced the AEC (Asean Economic Community) and 
the effects will be felt at the beginning of the year 2016 (Directorate General of Trade and Industry, Small 
and Medium Industry, Ministry of Industry of Indonesia, Euis Saedah, 2015). Therefore, SMEs as the key 
to the economy of the community should be good developed and structured in order to be ready to face 
global competition. Handkerchief Our team consists of students of Industrial Engineering, Mechanical 
Engineering, and Accounting University of Indonesia interested in conducting research on the use of 
methods of Line Balancing in the production process carried out by SMEs Crafts in the city of Depok. Line 
Balancing methods have been tested and applied in large corporations that system of division of labor is 
balanced so the level of  productivity increased the production. Therefore, we want to implement this 
method Line Balancing-Six Sigma on SMEs usually have the classic problem that is Out of Stock & Order 
every order in large numbers, in other words SMEs we have not been able to meet the global demand that 
the number would not be very much. We chose Crafts for SMEs is one of the largest home-based 
commodity production is quite a lot in the city of Depok, Indonesia. but less well-known, wellstructured 
and not very productive. Depok city itself is a nearby town in which all of our team members live and 
learning in the lecture. Thus the distance to carry out research on SMEs in the city of Depok is not an issue. 
The economic condition of the people in Depok is also not so good because it is a suburb of the capital 
Jakarta city. Therefore, the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Crafts Industry in Depok city should be 
developed in order to improve the economy of their communities well. The solutions we offer are using 
Line Balancing in the production process that previously we would do some research first about the 
application of methods, systems, mechanisms, and management. Expected future, the results of this study 
can be used as a model to be applied to applicable and tested that can be applied to SMEs which are run 
directly by the people in all regions of Indonesia. With the development of SMEs is expected the economy 
of small communities can grow and be strong to face the world economic turmoil.

Fig. 10. Station times of U-shaped assembly line for c=18 
Comparing this solution to serial line balance from Fig. 5 we can notice that the station times are almost 
perfect. In this case transforming serial line into U-shaped line gave a much better result. We obtained less 
1 workstation (instead of 8 workstations we have only 7 now). The quality of balance is much better, too. 
But it is no rule in assembly line balancing problem. We can only be sure that the number of workstation 
can’t exceed the number of workstations of existing serial assembly line balance solution. The quality of 
the final result of u-shaped line can be worse than for serial line. In Fig. 9 we can observe such case. 
Comparing to serial line solution for c=18 we have still 8 workstations but the smoothness index and line 
time are a bit higher than for the same conditions for serial line. 
9. Conclusion
The traditional assembly line is characterized by high efficiency or good value of smoothness 
index but due to its high specification and division of labor it has disadvantages in other areas. The 
assembly line has poor flexibility and can’t adapt easily to either changes in product design or 
product demand changes. Almost any changes in product design by line balancing & Lean Six 
Sigma, affects the entire system, requiring rebalance of the line and reallocation of resources. 
Problem of reducing number of workstations was discussed in this paper. Fluctuation of market 
demand cause changes in production systems. It was presented that even single product can lead 
to rebalance of assembly line in case of new market demands (new cycle time). SME business in 
handicraft Curug Marketing Gentong pretty good run so far, even though Curug Gentong not pay 
much attention these aspects in developing a business. Curug Gentong has focused on production 
activities than pemasaran.Curug Gentong tends to relax in promoting its products because it 
usually does not do the waterfall Gentong significant marketing efforts. For example, in terms of 
advertising, Curug Gentong indeed a lot to advertise its products in various media such as 
newspapers, tabloids, television, and so on, but not the waterfall Gentong who spend on 
advertising, it is precisely those media requesting Curug Gentong to advertise their products on 
their media. In terms of efficiency, Curug Gentong more emphasis on word of mouth marketing 
over other marketing strategies, which costs quite a lot but not too big impact in driving sales

Abstract 
Asean Economic Community 2016 has been creating more challenges in logistics industries in Indonesia. 
The implementation of IoT (Internet of Things) in logistic services is needed for increasing competitiveness 
leading to the establishment of so-called smart logistic transport. We propose the implementation model of 
the Indonesian Smart Logistic Transport, by focusing on cold supply chain system. We have conducted an 
engineering economic analysis of the smart logistics transport, in relation with the mobile network platform 
of 2G, 3G, 4G. Development of the implementation model is completed by conducting in-depth interviews 
with the application customers, technological vendors, regulator and network provider. Based on 
implementation trial in September-October 2015 and engineering economic analysis, we have found that 
Smart Logistic Transport is not feasible only on scenario 3 for CD6 at 4G network. Such condition is caused 
by the expensive price of 4Gs M2M gateway module and MDVR. Therefore, it requires the minimum 
amount of implemented truck to make implementation feasible. Our proposed model has signified 11 
features, i.e. 2 basic feature and 9 advanced features, formulating the Indonesian smart logistics transport 
system. Due to the dynamic business process, customers may need specific advanced features in the future. 
By taking such opportunity, Indonesian local content developer can work to develop any relevant 
application features, which is needed by the logistic companies in the near future.

Abstract 
Steel manufacturing is one of the main sectors of the economy. In South Africa this sector is 
highly fragmented relating to productivity and consists mostly of small and medium-sized 
enterprises (SMEs). The main problem is a low productivity in steel manufacturing SMEs 
impact negatively on competitiveness of the industry. The purpose of this paper is to identify 
bottleneck causing production flow inefficiencies. This includes elimination of waste, non-value 
adding activities, defects and production variation in steel manufacturing industries.  The 
author observed steel material arrival on machine, the processing times, work-in progress 
ranging from sawing, milling to threading that is intended for further production processing 
computer numerical control (CNC) machinery in order to enhance productivity. The system 
dynamic modelling was simulated to verify and validate the reality of manufacturing process 
aimed at identifying manufacturing process bottlenecks. To date, only limited research has 
been conducted into integrating simulation and Lean Six Sigma (LSS) in the South African 
manufacturing sector. The findings suggest that simulation and Define, Measure, Analyse, 
Improve and Control (DMAIC) LSS are viable tool to assist manufacturing managers and 
supervisors in improving productivity process in steel manufacturing SMEs. The study findings 
also reinforced the value of Simulation and LSS in making informed decision relating to 
efficiency and effectiveness in the steel manufacturing SMEs.

Abstract 
Fringe projection entails projecting a fringe pattern or grating on an object and viewing it from a different 
direction. It is a convenient technique for contouring objects that are too coarse to be measured with 
standard interferometry. Fringe projection is related to optical triangulation using a single point of light and 
light sectioning where a single line is projected onto an object and viewed in a different direction to 
determine the surface contour (Case et al. 1987). The fringe patterns are projected on to the object surface 
and the deformed grating image is captured by a CCD camera for subsequent analysis. Phase shifting 
techniques have been employed to determine the phase value. The phase variation is achieved by using a 
linear translation stage incorporated to the grating.  In this paper, the surface profile of objects for 3D 
printers is determined by using fringe pattern.

Abstract 
Engineering education is a very important field of every country because of the day to day engineering 
problems face in real life. Due to this, Project-based learning in engineering education is a very important 
instructional model due to the constructivist approach to learning, which entails the construction of 
knowledge with multiple perspectives, within a social activity, and allows for self-awareness of learning. 
In this paper, we have presentation an experiment of students acquiring knowledge without and with project 
based leaning models which include, videos and practical experiment. The results reveals that using project

Abstract 
This paper describes a framework to integrate and synchronize discrete event simulation (DES) models and system 
dynamics (SD) simulation models. SD is used to model the total manufacturing enterprise system while DES models 
are used to provide detailed simulations of the manufacturing processes in the system. The SD and DES models are 
synchronized to reach a comprehensive simulation that accommodate all management levels in a single structure, 
while recognizing the differences in terms of scope and frequency of decision making, and levels of details suitable 
at each management level. The current approach can maintain the integrity of the two simulation paradigms and can 
use existing/legacy simulation models without requiring learning new simulation skills. We discuss certain technical 
details in synchronizing the two simulation paradigms: the types and format of data exchanged, and the need for 
replications in DES. We propose dividing the DES model run into a number of mini runs (segments), and describe 
the resumption algorithm that is meant to ensure statistical validity of the data obtained from each DES segment.

1. Introduction
Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and System Dynamics (SD) simulation are the two main simulation paradigms in 
use. They are fundamentally different; following two different perspectives in viewing the world. DES models are 
made of sets of processes, resources, and queues where entities flow among them; competing for the resources at the 
processes, to have certain activities done, and cause events. Events are timeless occurrences that highlight the time 
consuming activities. DES has been dominating simulation modeling at the operational levels of management, in 
particular in the manufacturing systems applications where the main concerns are at the level of individual 
resources, resources, units of product, or steps of processing. At the higher management levels; with the global 
views of the system, DES faces difficulties. DES is a stochastic, data-driven approach, in which the state of the 
system is updated at the points in time when events occur. SD, on the other hand is a successful system thinking 
approach targeting top management levels with comprehensive integrative perspectives. With relatively minimal 
data requirements, it has been most effective in addressing decision makers’ needs at the strategic management 
levels for policy analysis and design. Yet, it failed to offer the needed granularity at the operational levels (Rabelo et 
al. 2015; Brito et al. 2011; Helal, 2008; Helal et al. 2007; Goddeing at al. 2003).     
Integrating/synchronizing/coordinating the two paradigms in a hybrid approach has been promoted for long, and 
several frameworks have been proposed (Morgan et al, 2017; Rabelo et al., 2015, Brito et al, 2011; 2008, Helal; 
Helal et al., 2007; Venkateswarana and Son 2005; Rabelo et al. 2005).). Contrasting SD and DES explicitly 
indicates the potential of the two paradigms complementing each other in hybrid simulation approaches to develop 
simulation models of the current complex business systems, where management levels are significantly overlapping. 
Hybrid SD-DES simulations can offer comprehensive simulation models that encompass all management levels and

4.0 Experimental Analysis  
The synchronization approach described above has been implemented for experimentation and a case study 
involving a real manufacturing enterprise has been conducted and results were logical and meaningful. See Rabelo 
et al. (2015) for details on that case application, which involved a single SD model and two DES models of two 
production lines. A Visual Basic (VB) application was developed that communicated with the Arena and Vensim 
software packages. The VB implementation of the SDDES framework used the ActiveX Data Object (ADO) 
technology to connect to the simulation engine in Arena to gain access to and control the simulation models. The 
functions and messaging tools of the Vensim’s Dynamic Link Library (DLL) were utilized to communicate with the 
SD model while establishing a Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) link to have the software acting as a server/client 
application for the data exchange operations. To use it as the centralized data repository, the controller used MS 
Excel object to perform the data preparation operations and appropriately authorize the simulation engines to 
perform data read/write operations. The use of spreadsheets in implementing SDDES provides a cheap approach to 
integrate the discrete and continuous simulations in a scalable comprehensive model, making use of existing 
(legacy) simulations and not requiring learning new simulation skills. 
5.0 Summary and Conclusions 
We have described a framework to synchronize SD and DES models to develop hybrid simulation of the total 
enterprise system. A comprehensive SD model of the total enterprise system is synchronized with a number of DES 
models; built to represent selected sub systems. We have discussed the exchange of data between the SD and DES 
models, and the necessary data preparation and formatting. The SD and DES models run in parallel and their runs 
are managed by the SDDES controller. It is needed that the DES simulation runs be divided into segments, where 
each segment is treated as a typical DES simulation run with replications. We presented the resumption algorithm, 
which monitors the run segments of each DES model and carry data from a segment to the next in order to maintain 
the statistical integrity of the DES run and outputs, such that autonomous SD and DES model can run in parallel and 
share statistically valid DES data.  
Combining SD and DES accommodates the coexistence of the continuous and discrete behaviors and the 
deterministic and stochastic natures in the manufacturing enterprise system. They also accommodate the different 
perspectives in decision making and views of the system being focused on the dynamic complexity of the business 
unit or on the detail complexity in managing it. The comprehensive and scalability dimensions in the simulation 
models of the manufacturing systems were achieved by using a modular structure that regarded autonomous SD and 
DES models as modules contributing to the same simulation. This can simplify the model building process as 
several SD or DES models can be built with well defined, relatively narrow scopes to model the various business 
units and then be interfaced. The addition and deletion of the DES models as the system evolves over time is not 
restricted. Further, we can utilize existing simulation models without the need to learn new simulation skills.  
It is acknowledged that more experimentation is necessary to emphasize the value of the proposed approach. In 
particular more investigations of the resumption algorism are needed to evaluate its effectiveness for more complex 
DES model configurations.

Abstract 
The benefits that the implementation of quality management systems bring to testing and calibration 
laboratories make a compelling case for their deployment in teaching and research laboratories. The Thin 
Section laboratory, based at a South African university is a research and teaching laboratory currently 
facing funding and quality challenges and has to find ways of supplementing the grant it receives from the 
University. One of the ways is providing commercial testing services. Testing and calibration laboratories 
are required to conform to ISO/IEC 17025:2005 which is the general requirements standard for 
competence of calibration and testing laboratories. The Thin Section laboratory compliance to this 
standard can improve the quality of its services to compete with other testing laboratories. 
Using laboratory experiments, surveys and interviews, this study aimed to evaluate the gap between the 
Thin Section laboratory processes and ISO/IEC 17025:2005 requirements, assess the ISO/IEC 17025 
implementation challenges for such laboratories and evaluate the possible benefits of implementing such 
a system. The study found the gap between ISO/IEC 17025:2005 requirements and laboratory procedures 
to be wide but recommended solutions to narrow it. The findings of this study can be utilised by other 
teaching and research laboratories with intentions of implementing ISO/IEC 17025.

which include X-ray diffraction (XRD); and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Preparing good quality thin 
sections is very important for the above-mentioned studies and many other applications. Most of these analyses 
depend on the precision of the size and thickness of the section as minerals’ optical characteristics sometimes 
change with size. 
Housed in an academic institution, the laboratory’s primary objective is producing good quality thin sections for 
academic research and students’ practical work. The price adjustments at the laboratory are always kept minimal to 
enable laboratory users to have as much analytical data available to them as possible and at reasonable costs. An 
upward surge in student numbers and research activity has led to an increase in the number of sample submissions 
and the amount of work that has to be processed through the facility. That coupled with increases in consumables 
prices and funding challenges has placed added pressure on the laboratory’s financial wellbeing. The laboratory

6.2 Management Requirements 
Changes to the laboratory’s organisational structure would have to be made by the department. This may mean 
creating a position for a laboratory/technical manager to oversee the day-to-day operations of the laboratory. The 
manager can concentrate on technical and quality initiatives while the financial aspects are left with the 
departmental executive member. The laboratory manager will also help with writing proposals for new equipment 
funding and laboratory upgrades. Another option would be to train technicians on ISO standards and make them 
responsible for the technical aspects of the laboratory and ISO standards interpretation and implementation. This 
maybe a lengthy process but it has long term benefits for both the technicians and the department. 
From literature and the conducted interviews, it was established that ISO/IEC 17025 implementation is a costly 
exercise. There is no doubt that ISO/IEC 17025 implementation will benefit the laboratory immensely but laboratory 
management will need to conduct a proper cost-estimation and ROI analysis. Abdel-Fatah (2010) states that it is not 
advisable to pursue implementation of ISO/IEC 17025 unless there are significant gains counteracting the cost of 
establishing the system, gaining accreditation and maintaining the standard. 
6.3 Process Improvement 
In an attempt to align its processes with ISO/IEC 17025 requirements, the thin section laboratory will have to 
improve its thin section-making process. The tests conducted in this study showed that there are changes that can be 
made to the preparation procedure to improve the quality of the thin sections. As the laboratory validates its 
methods, more improvement opportunities will be identified. Implementing ISO/IEC 17025 helps identify process 
improvement opportunities with corrective and preventative actions. The move towards implementation will also 
provide such opportunities as the review of the current processes is conducted. The laboratory technicians should 
conduct tests to determine the standard methods and validate them. Senior researchers can also be invited to give 
input on how to streamline the process to make it more efficient.

Abstract 
This paper explores the dynamic process of change and change management. While change is about 
moving to a future state, change management is the process of supporting individual employees impacted 
by the change through their own transitions. The study aimed to investigate the causes of continuous 
resistance to change towards the implementation of a centralized HR Support Services from business 
units of a multinational mining house, Company X with operations in Southern Africa. The study used 
both quantitative and qualitative research methods using survey questionnaires and semi structured 
interviews for data collection to explore different experiences of key employees and management of the 
mining company and industry as a whole. This study found that poor communication, poor leadership, 
and poor change management result in resistance to change. Some key recommendations put forward for 
Company X leadership are to produce a change management framework specific for each business unit 
concerned, including feedback sessions, and the need to have a communication plan about the need for 
change and its benefits to be used to persuade employees to accept the change programme. This research 
contributes significantly to thought leadership on the issues of change and change management in the 
South African mining industry.

1. Background
David (2001:254) stated that resistance to change can be considered the single highest threat to effective and 
successful strategy implementation in an organisation. The business environment especially, is prone to constant 
change due to various external factors that influence the way companies operate in order to remain competitive. The 
management of any change initiative can be sometimes overwhelming for management and employees alike, and 
can result in resistance to the changes. As much as change is necessary and inevitable, it is complex, hence 
managing resistance to change is fundamental for any organisation. CIPD (2015) agrees that change management 
matters because, though change is taking place at an ever-increasing pace, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that 
most change initiatives fail. CIPD’s research found that less than 60% of re-organisations met their identified 
objectives which are generally bottom line improvement; and this has been consistent with other published research 
(CIPD, 2015). 
Mining is a cyclical complex industry, with various chains of operations strongly influenced by external factors, and 
the attraction and retention of skilled workforce. Recruitment in this sector is challenging due to the shortage of 
skills in certain disciplines, and the attraction of skills to undesirable working conditions. A global mining house, 
Company X is faced with similar challenges making HR related recruitment support often inefficient. Company X 
with activities spanning the world has one of its corporate offices located in Johannesburg, South Africa, and is

Figure 4.10 Future with Company X 
As depicted in Figure 4.10 above, an overwhelming 72.73% of the survey respondents stated that they were still at 
Company X as they considered it to be a good company to work for, whilst 22.73% were willing to stay and adapt to 
the changes, whereas only 5.55% were unhappy and on the job market. As much as there was some unhappiness and 
resistance from employees, most of them still found Company X to be a good company to work for. Reasons 
provided were the developmental opportunities and financial well-being of the company despite the current mining 
economic challenges and cyclical nature of the industry. This would suggest the financial and development rewards 
of Company X to be possible employee retention factors despite the continuous resistance shown and experienced.    
5. Conclusion
This research has provided valuable insight on the importance of organisations being ready for change in order to 
implement change successfully. The findings suggest that change planning processes and systems were not 
adequately in place or implemented which led to discontent amongst employees at company X. Popular theory states 
that employees as well as the structure of the organisation must be ready for change. Majority of the respondents felt 
that more rigorous change planning and deeper stakeholder engagement could have prevented some of the 
challenges experienced at Company X. The current socio economic climate is increasingly unstable for company X. 
From reform in the global mining sector to issues of social risk in the South African labour market, the company 
should take this opportunity to learn, reflect and improve ways of working through localised solutions and 
meaningful engagement with staff teams. The conclusions of this research have been summarised around the 
objectives of the study below. 
5.1 The Perception of Management and Employees towards Effective Change Management 
There was a wrong perception and misunderstanding of the change that was identified as being prevalent at both 
BUs. The difference in perception of management and employees towards effective change brought about lack of 
alignment, wrong perception of the change to be implemented, resulting in a low sense of urgency for employees at 
Company X. A disconnect between managers and employees’ perception is present in that management is of the 
view that the change was warranted based on thorough analysis of their BUs in SA. Management stance was that 
blue chip companies had to follow predominant industry practices that have success records once implemented. 
Management is able to see the positive changes that new the HR model brings, such as better policies, cost 
reductions, better control systems; better employee engagement, and cost reductions. Although workers attest to the 
HR model being efficient, they have negative perceptions on its implementation process. 
5.2 Root Causes and Barriers to Change within the BUs 
Parochial self-interest, possibility of jobs becoming obsolete, fear of job losses, and a preference to continue with 
previous ways of working so as not to lose control were identified as some causes and barriers to change within the 
BUs. Lack of effective leadership in change management was instrumental in the resistance to change; there was 
disconnect with the views of top management and those of the employees at the operational level that have to work 
with the new HR model. The lack of efficient change agent was also identified as a possible cause to the continuous 
resistance to change as there was not sufficient interactions and engagement with the affected employees. Critical 
decisions about change were made without much of their input nor consultation. Employees at Company X shared 
the desire to have experienced a more personal and transparent leadership style. Lack of employee involvement in 
the decision making processes can lead to employees not assuming ownership, lack of commitment, manifesting in 
work stoppage, high turnover, or absenteeism. The findings show that a lack of trust amongst employees and 
management and this hampered relationship building during the change implementation process.

Lack of cultural sensitivity was a contribution to the resistance to change and is a factor that needs to be taken into 
consideration.  Culture sensitivity is critical during change implementation as identified at Company X, especially 
for a multinational organisation operating with a diversity of race, religions, cultures, and languages such as that of 
Company X. The global culture of Company X should not have dominated the cultures of the BUs; but the change 
agents should have made it a priority to understand the cultural differences and be more cultural sensitive in 
communicating the change. An approach used in one location may not be ideal in another. For a multi-national 
company, the cultural context of different BUs should be recognized and respected. For example, in South Africa, 
hierarchy is deeply engrained in work culture, hence the resistance shown when ‘cultural protocols’ are ignored. 
5.4 Resistance/Acceptance of Process of Change within Company X 
The use and/or abuse of power was one poignant aspect which may have prevented a successful change management 
initiative at the BUs. Ritualisation of change, due to the continuous change programmes that had been introduced are 
no longer seen as much meaningful by employees; and the ivory tower change pitfalls, which is characterised by 
change driven by senior agents were all present. Lastly, for employees in managerial positions, the loss of control 
and humiliation felt contributed to the resistance. The research findings suggest better leadership, transparency and 
support could have helped ease resistance at Company X.  
5.5 Effectiveness of Communication during the Process of Change 
The lack of transparency and consistency in communication brought about some challenges for Company X during 
the change management process that resulted in resistance. Lack of consistent feedback may have fuelled the 
resistance. Feedback should be provided consistently to improve the quality of information disseminated and the 
manner in which the information is delivered. As described by respondents, a one-way communication is an 
ineffective way to work in an organisation and especially during change.  
5. RECOMMENDATIONS
The current socio economic climate is increasingly unstable for company X. From reform in the global mining
sector to issues of social risk in the South African labour market, the company should take this opportunity to learn
and reflect and improve ways of working through localised solutions and meaningful engagement with staff teams.
Light has been shone on this increasingly relevant topic and will contribute to further research studies on change
management in South Africa and beyond. The recommendations put forward are listed below:
•
Company X needs to produce a change management framework specific for each business unit concerned,
including feedback sessions, and recommendations to management
•
A communication plan about the need for change and its benefits can be used to persuade employees to
accept the change programme.
•
Townhall meetings should be held to increase participation and involvement – improved communication at
all stages, transparency and shared involvement in the implementation of change.
•
Facilitation and support should be provided to employees to reassure those affected by the change.
•
This research report should be circulated within the mining sector to improve the sharing of change
management best practice.
•
Company X should review its change management processes at least yearly so as to capture the effect of
the changes in the organisation and its impact on the diverse workforce

Abstract 
This study sought to investigate how translators are using modern technological tools to enhance their 
business and the impact of E-commerce and M-commerce has on their work. The research method used 
was quantitative using a self-administered questionnaire which was generated online via Survey Monkey. 
The participant sample consisted of SATI members. The major findings of the study were that translators 
are increasingly using E-commerce and M-commerce to enhance their business and have customers both 
locally and overseas. Translators have been using new forms of communication for more than five years: 
most have not personally met their clients, even those based in South Africa, indicative of the prevalence 
of E-commerce and M-commerce. The mobile phone has enhanced the availability of translators: they 
have become mobile professionals, not confined by traditional geographical boundaries: they interact with 
clients at any time and are able to create work spaces anywhere. The study concluded with a set of 
recommendations to SATI and its members on the use of technological tools to enhance their business.  It 
also provided the translation industry with insight into the current status of the industry and the need to 
invest in appropriate tools to keep up with modern translation business trends.

1. Background
With eleven official languages, South Africa has always had a vibrant translation industry. Recently an official 
language policy was developed stating that government documents must be available in all these languages and, if 
not feasible, in at least six of them (Pan South African Language Board, 2011:5).  
With the inclusion of South Africa in BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China), the demand for translation 
will increase (Kelly, DePalma & Hegde, 2012a:29). In another study, Kelly and DePalma (2012b:6) found that in 
2012, the global translation industry was worth USD 33,523 billion and has an annual growth rate of 12.17%. Kelly 
et al. (2012a:1) state that currently Africa accounts for 0.26% of the global market share of language services, with 
the majority owned by South Africa.

The following correlations were found in relation to RQ2: 
•
There is a significant, moderate, positive correlation existing between visibility and the use of M-commerce
tools (0.418, N=88, p<0.0001), thus, the more M-commerce tools such as mobile phones are in use, the
greater the visibility of translators. There is equally a significant, moderate, positive correlation existing
between M-commerce and the use of online tools (0.410, N=88, p<0.0001), showing that the more M-
commerce tools are in use, the more translators will be likely to use online tools.
•
There is a significant, moderate correlation between M-commerce and visibility increasing (r = 0.418, N =
88, p < 0.0001). Visibility relates to the ability to be present and available beyond the normal confines of
time and space, and is a significant aspect of the way that mobile professionals work, not being confined by
traditional time and space boundaries.
•
There is a significant, moderate correlation between online tools being used, and availability increasing (r =
0.532, N = 88, p < 0.0001).
•
There is a significant, moderate, positive correlation existing between visibility and the use of M-commerce
tools (0.418, N=88, p<0.0001), thus, the more M-commerce tools such as mobile phones are in use, the
greater the visibility of translators. M-commerce thus facilitates the visibility of translators to their clients
who are able to interact with them in a dynamic format.
•
There is a significant, moderate, positive correlation existing between M-commerce and the use of online
tools (0.410, N=88, p<0.0001), showing that the more M-commerce tools are in use, the more translators
will be likely to use online tools.
•
There is a significant, strong, positive correlation existing between E-commerce and the use of online tools
(0.776, N=88, p<0.0001), showing that the more translators use online tools, the greater their participation
in E-commerce practices. The two are closely related. Thus it can be concluded that translators are
increasingly submitting their invoices to clients online.
•
There is a significant, moderate to strong, positive correlation between translators marketing themselves
online more than they did five years ago, and owning a website or having several online translator profiles
(r = 0.745, N = 85, p < 0.0001). This means that as translators increasingly market themselves online, they
will start investing in websites or setting up online translator profiles.  There is a significant, moderate
correlation between E-commerce and visibility increasing (r = 0.698, N = 88, p < 0.0001), thus, the more
translators use E-commerce tools, the greater their visibility.
•
There is a significant, moderate correlation between E-commerce and availability increasing (r = 0.505, N
= 88, p < 0.0001).  This is consistent with the literature on the mobile professional, which points to the
establishment of new workspaces and greater use of E-commerce tools in order to operate.
4.4 Conclusion on Research Question 2 
Translators indicated that it is becoming increasingly important to have an online presence and that they are 
marketing themselves online more. The questions sought to find out the impact of online tools, M-commerce and E-
commerce on visibility and availability and it was generally noted that there has been such an impact. Translators 
are having more customers outside of the country, working beyond normal hours to meet deadlines for other time 
zones, and generally doing business without necessarily having face-to-face contacts with their clients. It was found 
that translators are mobile professionals with locational mobility, with the ability to create work spaces anywhere 
and using their mobile phones as an extension of their offices. Thus the impact of using these tools has been an 
increase in visibility and availability. 
5. Conclusion and Recommendations
5.1 Conclusions
The following were the main findings of the research and the linkage with the literature review:
•
Translators in South Africa are accustomed to using technology to enhance their work productivity.  Tools
such as printers and flash disks have already become obsolete in this industry, which relies strongly on
online tools such as email and online portals to deliver jobs to clients.
•
CAT tools are becoming increasingly prevalent in use in South Africa, although crowdsourcing which is
commonly used overseas is not used as much in South Africa.
•
Translators use email as their main form of communication with clients, to the extent that they have not met
personally with their clients.  Translators are already communicating with overseas clients and it can thus
be surmised that they are equally penetrating the overseas market as well as bringing business to South
Africa.

•
Translators are essentially mobile professionals who do not need to be in a specific location in order to do
business. They can create a work space anywhere, consistent with the literature on the mobile professional.
•
There is a gap in translator education, in that translators identified that they did not feel equipped to deal
with technology which has become an essential part of their business.
•
The literature on the translation industry was consistent with the study results. It can be said that translators
are using modern innovative technologies to do their business and are trying to keep up to date with the
latest developments.
The conclusions of the study led to a set of recommendations to be used by both translation professionals and the 
translation industry, as well as service industries which are becoming reliant on technology for their business needs. 
5.2 Recommendations 
The recommendations are thus as follows: 
•
Be equipped with the latest technology: For mobile professionals to be successful, it is necessary to be
equipped with the latest technology and understand the latest trends in the industry.
•
Have a strong online presence: It is important to have a stronger online presence by owning a website or
purchasing membership of portals which provide free website access as well as other features such as the
ability to bid for jobs immediately they are posted instead of having to wait until they can bid for jobs as
non-members, by which time the job might not be available. In order to enhance online visibility and be
more readily available to overseas clients, it is important to be a paying member of online as it helps obtain
more jobs.
•
Take advantage of the expertise available on online portals:   Participate more in online portals which
add to online visibility and help them as mobile professionals stay up-to-date with the latest developments.
A real danger of being a freelancer or mobile professional is that you can become redundant and lose touch
with the latest developments in the industry.  Thus it is greatly important to stay up-to-date with the latest
developments.
•
Obtain free membership of online revenue models to gear yourself for the future: The findings
revealed that most translation agencies operating internationally are using such online revenue models and
have made it a condition of working with them, thus it would be important to obtain membership of such
models such as Skrill and Paypal, which is free.
•
Invest in the latest CAT tools: With the increasing need for greater speed and greater accuracy, the use of
CAT tools has become paramount.
•
Ensure you have fast broadband connectivity: It is of vital importance to be equipped with new
technologies such as faster broadband and smartphones with advanced functionalities.
•
Have a communications strategy: The more forms of communication available, the greater the impact on
the translator’s availability to clients, thus having a communications strategy is important.
•
Equip yourself with the latest smartphones and tablets: Translators must invest in technologies such as
smartphones and tablets which help enhance their mobile presence.
•
Get an understanding of the latest technology:  Perhaps universities could consider this to be a
component of translator training and degrees.  It equally presents a business opportunity for translation
agencies to offer courses on how to use modern technologies.
In conclusion, as the translation industry is constantly growing and developing just as much as new technologies are 
produced, it would be of interest for translators to continue developing their skills, learning about new technologies 
and increasingly interacting with those who are using these tools.

Abstract 
Inventory management in reverse logistics has been receiving increasing attention in recent years. Our 
modelling approach generalizes a whole class of various models that draw attention to different aspects of 
production, inventory, and recovery. A complete solution in the form of a theorem for that general model 
class is provided. Furthermore, the paper illustrates how that theorem can be applied to one of the 
mentioned models from the literature, Jaber and Saadany, 2009. The paper Jaber and Saadany, 2009 
extends along this line of research and assumes that demand for manufactured items is different from that 
for remanufactured (repaired) ones. This assumption results in lost sales situations where there are stock-
out periods for Manufactured and remanufactured items. However, in their paper the authors provide 
solution procedure in the form of algorithm and did not provide the complete explicit solution to this 
complex problem. We provide the solution in this paper.

1. Introduction
In recent years, reverse logistics has received increasing attention from both academia and industry. There is 
increasing recognition that careful management can bring both environmental protection and lower costs: 
environmental and economic considerations have led to manufacturers taking their products back at the end of their 
lifetimes. As a result, the reverse logistics process is now considered as a basis for generating real economic value as 
well as supporting environmental concerns. 
Rogers and Tibben-Lembke, 2009 defined reverse logistics as the process of planning, implementing, and 
controlling the efficient, cost-effective flow of raw materials, in-process inventory, finished goods, and related 
information from the point of consumption to the point of origin for the purpose of recapturing value or proper 
disposal. The integration of forward and reverse supply chains resulted in the origination of the concept of a closed-
loop supply chain. The whole chain can be designed in such a way that it can service both forward and reverse 
processes efficiently. 
A latest actual survey of mathematical inventory models for reverse logistics can be found in Bazan et al., 2016. An 
extensive survey of research related to quantitative modeling for inventory and production planning in a closed-loop 
supply chain was provided by Akc¸alı and C¸etinkaya, 2011. According to Akcaly and Cetinkaya, 2011 inventory 
models are divided into two main categories: deterministic and stochastic, according to the modelling of demand and 
return processes.  
The subject of this paper is deterministic inventory models with constant demand and return. The economic order 
quantity model (EOQ model), which was derived by Ford W. Harris in 1913, became the basis for many reverse 
logistics models because of its simplicity and intelligibility. Shrady, 1967 was the first to apply the EOQ model to 
reverse logistics processes. He introduced an EOQ model with instantaneous production and repair rates. A closed-
form solution was developed. In his work an efficient policy P(m,1) was established, which means that within each 
remanufacturing cycle a number m of remanufacturing batches of equal size are followed by exactly one 
manufacturing batch. This work was extended by Nahmias and Rivera, 1979  and Mabini et al., 1992

4. Conclusion
Faster generation of waste leads to rise of collecting and remanufacturing cores to extend their useable lives and thus 
reduce waste. Economical incentives enticed and later governmental legislations compelled companies to initiate 
product recovery programs. European waste legislation currently gives a global framework for the implementation 
of extended producer responsibility in Europe. Inventory and production planning focuses on the effective 
utilization of existing inventories and production resources, therefore managing inventory in reverse logistics 
represents an important problem. The focus of this paper is on the mathematical modeling of inventory with return 
flows that were developed on the base EOQ. The general objective of the inventory management models is to 
control product orders, inventory levels, and recovery processes to minimize total costs. 
Our modeling approach generalizes a whole class of various models that draw attention to different aspects of 
production, inventory, and recovery. A complete solution in the form of a theorem for that general model class is 
provided. Furthermore, the paper illustrates how that theorem can be applied to one of the mentioned models from 
the literature, Jaber and Saadany, 2009. In their paper the authors provide solution procedure in the form of 
algorithm and did not provide the complete explicit solution to this complex problem. We provide the solution in 
this paper. We found the optimal policy P(m; n) for the problem, it can have a different structure depending on the 
value of the parameters. The impact of the switching cost becomes apparent for sufficiently high values. In this case 
the optimal numbers (m, n) can both be greater than one. This was illustrated by the numerical analysis. 
The consideration of the government regulations related to extend producer responsibility instruments such as 
minimum recovery target and disposal fee is the future direction of this research. A legislative environment will be 
considered, where the government requires the producers to collect and recover at least a certain percentage of their 
sales and imposes a disposal fee on each product not recovered up to this quota

Abstract 
Microorganisms have always been part of the human life both intrinsically and extrinsically. They are 
ubiquitous and have been a tool for genetic engineering, biotechnology and waste management. 
Anaerobic digestion is a process that is made possible by specific group of microorganisms which 
changes substrates into biogas, a renewable energy source. This paper aims to show the microbial 
community responsible for each stage of hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis in 
the anaerobic digestion (AD) process. Understanding the microorganisms involved in AD and how 
process parameters affect them is key in the optimization of the AD process for a high methane yield and 
as a tool for waste management.

Introduction
Over hundreds of years, the process of anaerobic digestion (AD) has been in use. The use of biogas was first 
recorded in Syria during the 10th century b.c.e. Afterwards, 17th-century scientist Jan Baptist van Helmont 
concluded that decaying organic matter could turn into flammable gases. This idea was expanded by Count 
Alessandro Volta and he established a correlation between the amount of matter and the amount of gas produced. 
The first anaerobic digestion plant was built in Bombay (now Mumbai), India in 1859; after which more anaerobic 
digestion plants were built towards the end of the 19th century in England, where the fuel produced was used to light 
street lamps. Ever since then, anaerobic digestion plants have been built all over the world with improvement in its 
technology. (Fogle, R., 2016). Biotechnology of biogas generation is the degradation of different kinds of organic 
wastes, industrial (food) agricultural waste, wastewater, sewage sludge and organic fraction of municipal solid 
wastes (OFMSW) with the aid of microorganism under optimum process conditions. Anaerobic digestion 
culminates into biogas production, which entails conversion of the energy in biomass fuel. It aids in the recycling of 
organic wastes into stable liquid fertilizer and energy which helps to mitigate hazardous outcome of waste in the 
environment (Zieminski, K. and Frąc, M., 2012). The resultant product of AD is biogas (both methane and carbon 
dioxide), and gases such as hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen. It is a process that involves different kinds of 
microorganisms. The intrinsic worth of anaerobic digestion includes low sludge production, increased organic 
loading rates, production of methane and reduced energy consumption. Other benefit of anaerobic digestion is the 
use of the slurry as fertilizer. The anaerobic process does not reduce the nutrient content of the slurry and thus 
making the fertilizer nutrient rich and a suitable replacement for chemical fertilizers. AD is also a waste

methane production rate by 10-28% and specific methane yield by 9-34% in co-digestion of dairy manure and food 
waste. Dewaterability of digester effluent was significantly improved by reducing food waste particle size. 
4. Conclusion
 Understanding the biochemical reactions of the microorganism at each stage of anaerobic digestion is key to the 
optimization of methane yield and gaining the maximum benefit from the AD process as a waste management tool. 
Process parameters like temperature, pH, organic loading rate, inoculum to substrate ratio play a major role in the 
effectiveness of anaerobic digestion as a renewable energy generation source and a waste management tool. Though 
the AD process takes place in an engineering design, understanding the microbial community and how they are 
affected by process parameters are indispensable to a successful high methane yield from anaerobic digestion, a 
waste management tool.

Abstract 
The purpose of the research is to investigate relationship between two major constructs (supply chain 
performance measures and supply chain profitability) as supply chain has a key role to play in the expansion 
and profitability of retailers and it also provides a recognized foundation for retail industry success, the 
most significant challenge that impedes by R-SCM is the development of an efficient and modern retail 
sector is an underdeveloped supply chain, thus this research provides a model using rigorous empirical 
method to validate the instrument scale for measuring the validity and reliability of the identified constructs. 
Additionally the paper further tests the relationship between supply chain performance measures and supply 
chain profitability using structural equation modelling (SEM). 
The data was compiled and collected from 213 Operations and Supply Chain heads from leading retail 
stores in India. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the validity of the proposed 
measurement scale and the relationship is tested using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results 
exhibit that all the SCPM items have significant loadings to their corresponding second-order construct, 
similarly all the SCP items have significant loadings to their corresponding first-order construct. The 
relationship between the second order construct SCPM and SCP was also found to be significant.  
The results of the structural equation model analysis supports the developed hypothesis, which states that, 
higher level of SCM Performance leads to higher level of SC Profitability. It was found that standardized 
coefficient was statistically significant at (p < 0.01). The hypothesis is accepted which states that 
Organizations implementing SCM have obtained improved performance, cost savings, increased revenues, 
and the reduction of defects in products are some of the chief advantages of introducing supply chain 
management. It has been demonstrated that business profitability is closely associated with performance 
measures. Overall, the model has a satisfactory fit with CMIN/DF 2.648, RMR 0.078, RMSEA 0.088, GFI 
0.813, NFI 0.810 and CFI 0.872. 
From the results it can be mentioned that the selected measures provide a good guide to managerial decision 
making processes. Another significant contribution of the research lies in the fact that there are a plethora 
of studies identifying different dimensions of SC performance; however, there is no study identifying 
important dimensions for managers. This study identifies important SC performance measures beneficial 
to managers, which deserve their immediate attention. The research contributes a model to the knowledge 
of theories on supply chain management by suggesting to obsolete old performance measures to eradicated

Abstract 
This research paper focuses on sewing manufacturing co-operatives and the role of supplier development 
funding on their performance. This paper presents a model of supplier development used by a South African 
government department which has contracted over 83 sewing manufacturing co-operatives to provide 
school uniform packs annually for identified schools in a province. The model proves to be valuable to the 
knowledge area on funding of manufacturing enterprises with an aim of developing them into reliable 
suppliers of quality goods. The results of this study show that the model of funding applied in developing 
the sewing co-operatives as suppliers has enabled them to acquire new manufacturing equipment, fund their 
business plans and as a result they regard themselves as successful. The practical implications indicated on 
this paper include improving funding models directed to small business manufacturers to reduce the failure 
rate of small manufacturing businesses.

1. Introduction
Supplier Development is a common buzz word in the field of entrepreneurship and small enterprise development
(Govindan, Khovaredi & Jafarian, 2012). Paying a suppliers’ invoice is not a guarantee that they will deliver timeously
and quality, which makes it necessary for big buyers to provide support and engage in collaboration with smaller and
under-resourced suppliers. It is also a collective responsibility of big business and government to ensure that
employment and business opportunities are sustained through successful small manufacturers (Johnson & Shaw,
2014). Funding of small manufacturing enterprises comes in a form of grants, loans and contract based funding. Some
grants are dedicated supplier development, loans are obtainable from financing institutions or from private investors
(Tian, 2015) and contract based funding, is obtained when a manufacturer has been awarded a big valuable contract
which the manufacturer is unable to deliver to without additional funding and added resources (Rowley & Michie,
2014). In this research we studied a total of 83 contracted and funded sewing co-operatives in the Gauteng Province
of South Africa. These co-operatives are contracted and funded by the buyer which is the Gauteng Department of
Social Development (Ioppolo, Szopik-Depczynsko, Stajnaik & Konecko, 2016). These co-operatives are selected in
terms of the sewing factory’s ability to deliver required quantities and based on their location. This move to source
from co-operatives came as a result of a need to empower impoverished communities and to also live up to the
Sustainable Development Goals Mandate (Fox & Stoett, 2016), which is better attainable through co-operatives
(Abdallah, Bressers & Clancy, 2014). A manufacturing co-operative can be defined as an enterprise executing factory
and process based operations dependent on inputs, a conversion procedure and with an ability to deliver a tangible
output, it is an autonomous association of people, democratically owned and lives up to its set principles (Zhu, Su &

Abstract 
This paper presents the role of a secondary co-operative in the supply of an input key to delivering a product 
by a co-operative movement focused on manufacturing. This study bases its focus on sewing co-operatives 
and uses the supply of fabric as an example that relates to a proposed secondary co-operative that would be 
established within a township community of South Africa to supply fabric to clothing manufacturing co-
operatives. A literature grid specifying references and concepts used to arrive at the suggested model is also 
presented on the paper. Secondary co-operatives in supply chain management are key to inter-cooperation 
of manufacturing co-operatives and to sourcing quality inputs at reasonable rates. In conclusion it is 
specified that empirical studies could be done to improve and develop further the suggested model of supply 
chain management through a secondary co-operative structure. Policy makers in the areas of re-
industrialization through co-operatives especially in emerging countries may consider secondary supply co-
operatives to be drivers of inter co-operative cooperation and as providers of strategic operational support 
to the manufacturing co-operative movement particularly in clothing manufacturing which is a sector 
confronted with cheap clothing imports from low cost producing countries.

1. Introduction
The need for secondary co-operatives rose when individual primary co-operatives in production industries realised 
that the benefits of inter-cooperative cooperation included attracting corporate buyers and newer resources. In South 
Africa many co-operative are still new in the manufacturing arena which is why the need to establish secondary co-
operatives is relevant (Abor & Quartey, 2010). Manufacturing in an environment with resource scarcity also requires 
co-operation with other industry members and other experienced role players in an industry (Chareonwongsak, 2017). 
Co-operatives in manufacturing can benefit from a secondary co-operative in numerous ways, these ways include (1) 
sharing industry knowledge (2) bidding for big contracts as a collective (3) joining marketing and sales operations to 
maximize income generation (4) reducing costs of inputs by sourcing from the primary co-operatives and (5) building 
recognition for the goals and aims of the manufacturing co-operative movement (Lehtonen, 2004). Co-operatives in 
any manufacturing sector are also challenged to compete with private firms which have values such as earning income 
for its shareholders, making profit and efficient value adding (Niewenhuizen, 2014) while on one hand co-operatives 
aim to ensure equal distribution of income among its members, creating value for the society and also ensuring further 
creation of equity as well as improvement of lives (Muthuma, 2012). On this paper we focus on how can

5. Conclusion
This paper reminds the academic community in the fields of engineering of the role that collaboration can play in 
building productive capacity in small and medium manufacturing enterprises. The literature used on this paper is 
recent but also shows that there is a growing interest in supporting social enterprises making products for their 
communities and done by the same community members. Although private sector still creates the most economic 
opportunities and other trade initiatives, it is worth noting that the resilience of co-operatives is rather better than that 
of investor owned firms which commonly resort to retrenchment and restructuring during unfavorable economic times, 
unlike manufacturing co-operatives where worker-members are able to renegotiate their own salaries and share 
schemes to save both the co-operative, employment and retain buyers. The global challenges which humanity faces 
today also requires enterprises which are more humanistic in their approach to wealth creation, consumption of natural 
resources and ensuring equitable participation of most people in the economy, and this can be achieved through co-
operatives. Private companies had been able for centuries to run the clothing manufacturing sector. However, the 
working conditions in the clothing manufacturing factories are devastating especially in Asia. These conditions 
include the payment of low salaries, working long hours, child labour and unsafe working conditions, this kind of a 
problem could be solved if skilled individuals organised themselves into worker co-operatives for production purposes 
but also secondary co-operatives to solicit training, education and also create market access. A secondary co-operative 
role is such that the primary co-operatives and their members will put in resources which can be shared by the members 
of the secondary co-operative to advance their communities and protect their own people from any potential 
exploitation associated with production in the textile sector, also a secondary co-operative can assist its member co-
operatives to handle economic challenges associated with the continental problems indicated on section 4. The key 
recommendations are described on the following section. 
5.1 Key Recommendations 
It is recommended that technical researchers in the field of operations management reserve time to conduct research 
on manufacturing social enterprises as part of their community engagement. Although this might not be seen as a 
profitable exercise, it will benefit ordinary people. It is also recommended for African scholars of engineering to invest 
time in studying supply chains of co-operative enterprises as these are enterprises bringing development to rural 
communities and providing inputs for established private industries. In summary this research recommends the 
following: 
•
Government intervention to co-operative development should not interfere with the independence of
production co-operatives and the co-operative movement at large.
•
Education for co-operative movements should be designed to address the need for cooperation amongst co-
operatives.
•
The governance of secondary co-operatives should embrace transparency and focus on creating market
access, create a resource pool for primary co-operatives which are members and invest in training its members 
on production efficiency, quality and distribution.
The last part of this paper gives an idea and direction which future research should take in the area of advancing the 
co-operative movement through cooperation. 
5.2 Focus of future research 
This study was limited only to focusing on sewing co-operatives and this study was selective of clothing co-operatives 
and literature reviewed. Therefore, an empirical study which would extend, develop further and test the suggested 
model is recommended as well as the testing of the pilot project plan for the development of a secondary co-operative.

Abstract 
The availability and ease of access to substitute quality products and services has created an expectation 
among consumers in different markets to expect as certain standard of quality on any purchase they make. 
This expectation leaves some small manufacturing enterprises out of the market if they are unable to cope 
with the dynamic quality requirements of consumers. This paper uses a case study of a clothing 
manufacturing co-operative which has been operational for 48 years and which with resource constraints 
had managed to satisfy customers beyond expectation based on available customer feedback. This study 
shares a lesson which may be not generalizable in other contexts, which is that small manufacturing co-
operatives should strive to focus their quality control efforts on the key quality control points mentioned on 
this paper. This research paper also suggests that more research be done on small manufacturing enterprises 
regarding Total Quality Management which is a knowledge area largely dominated by research on well-
established enterprises. In principle this paper also calls for an increase in research which can benefit the 
operations management field about the knowledge of small manufacturing social enterprises which are 
common and beneficial for communities in developing countries.

1. Introduction
Quality refers to the ability of a product or service to meet and even exceed the expectations of the customer in terms 
of product or service efficiency, performance, durability, comfort and ease of use. However, quality has to be 
consistent and there needs to be resources to support and implement all activities associated with controlling and 
managing it (Harpa, 2011). In clothing manufacturing a good quality management system would be concerned about 
the inputs used in the making of clothes, the skill of the workers and also having adequate sewing machines which 
sew in quality threads (Mahnaz & Ejaz, 2005). Quality clothing is normally rewarded by consumers and the same is 
for consumers when they receive quality clothes. In early 2000s the South African Department of Trade and Industry 
launched the Proudly South African campaign, which is an initiative and a body responsible for promoting local 
production in food, clothing, steel and other key manufacturing sectors. While this is important for a country such as 
South Africa, quality management is also important. Sewing co-operatives happen to be the local manufacturers of 
clothing, such as traditional wear, school uniforms, and work-wear and special dress codes. There is a preference for 
these local manufacturers, although major retailers are more reliant on Chinese and other clothing imports which is 
thought to be cheap and also of acceptable quality. A challenge for co-operatives in maintaining consistent quality in 
clothing manufacturing is that they lack certain resources which are important to implementing and for

the use of industrial cutters to meet the pattern specifications and the actual quality of the stitch of the industrial sewing 
machines is recognized as essential to the overall quality of a garment (Fang, Ye, Cheng, Zhang, Liu & Xu, 2015). 
The following table is an analysis of Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) associated with 
managing quality in a resource constrained co-operative enterprise. 
Table: 1 SWOT Analysis of Quality Management in a Resources Constrained Co-operative Enterprise 
STRENGTHS 
WEAKNESSES 
•
Understanding of quality focus areas.
•
Clear sewing process with critical quality
control focus points.
•
Zero return on sold garments and positive
feedback from bulk buyers.
•
Internal skill and strong supervision of staff.
•
Limited production space.
•
Inability to produce large quantities given the
constraint of manual quality check.
•
Inability to service large orders from corporate
clients.
OPPORTUNITIES 
THREATS 
•
Expand production capacity through a shift
work system.
•
Adopt automated quality check systems in the
production of bulk orders (Poka-Yoke devices)
•
Upskill 
more 
co-operative 
members 
to
understand quality and its application to their
work or contributions in the sewing process.
•
Promote quality at all levels.
•
The rapid introduction of advanced and
technological quality management techniques
in clothing design and manufacturing can be
costly for small manufacturing enterprises.
•
Mass production of popular brands and
reduction in their prices limits co-operatives
from entering the space of clothing retail.
Small manufacturing co-operative enterprises around the world share some similarities when it comes to their SWOT 
analyses (Russu, 2013). However, there can be no compromise on quality and small enterprises may focus on growing 
from their strengths and utilization of available opportunities to acquire more resources until they are able to put in 
place necessary automated quality control systems. The section which follows is a conclusion of this paper with the 
component of key recommendations and direction for future research. 
5. Conclusion
In conclusion the key quality control points are not the only reasons for the success of a small manufacturing co-
operative such as the one referred to in this study. It should be noted that there are other contributing factors to 
operational excellence and performance in terms of quality in the operations of a small clothing manufacturer focused 
on sewing, these factors include tacit knowledge, flexibility of the sewing process, repeat orders and the small quantity 
of orders processed. 
5.1 Key recommendations 
A recommendation which can be made from this non-generalizable case study is that each under-resourced enterprise 
should study its production processes to improve them either by accumulating new resources or using the limited 
available resources. This paper also recognizes that it may be costly for some subsistence co-operatives to keep up 
with latest quality management trends but it is possible to maintain a skill of quality management which guides the 
system operators about common areas of focus in the process of managing and controlling quality. 
5.2 Focus of future research 
This research paper has a limitation of a single case study and a future study could also focus on evaluation of quality 
practices in sewing co-operatives. A quality practice such as Total Quality Management could be a viable study area 
as most small manufacturers have not kept up with TQM and understanding the underlying reasons and also filling 
the gaps in the knowledge area of quality management in small manufacturing enterprises is relevant in our life-time 
where all opportunities and all size businesses form part of bigger economies.

Abstract 
The Chemical industry are beneficial in improving human wellbeing by providing employment, 
better quality health, productive lifestyle and nutrition opportunities. However, the pollution 
from the industry has been associated with negative impacts on health and safety of humans, 
threatening the sustainability of the environment. Waste from the Chemical industry poses a 
significant threat to humans and environment when management is improper. Chemical waste 
generation and its management have been a serious problem ever since human habitation. 
Minimizing of waste and reuse are main issues relating to the management of chemical waste. 
South Africa backs the hierarchy of waste by encouraging production processes that are cleaner, 
minimizing waste, reusing, recycling and treating waste, making disposal the last option for the 
management of waste. Stringent hazardous or chemical waste control and management are 
required to avoid harm or damage to the environment and humans, while reducing liabilities. 
This paper gives an overview of the waste management of chemical waste in South Africa.

of environmental damage and hence becoming the biggest challenge in South African waste 
management.  
7. Conclusion
The chemical industry is one of the important industry in the South African industrial base, 
continuously being pressured to operate in an environmental friendly manner. The raw materials 
and feedstocks processing of chemicals emits hazardous toxins to the environment and produce 
hazardous waste that can have negatives impact on human beings as well. The chemical waste 
management is an international environmental issue that requires a waste management plan that 
will minimize the generation of waste, recycle and have disposal as the final of option.

Abstract 
Conventional hysteresis current controllers have the disadvantage of a variable switching frequency.  
This paper proposes a fuzzy hysteresis band technique for the current control for shunt active power filter (SAPF).  
An active harmonic filter is used to eliminate current harmonics caused by nonlinear loads. The current control 
strategy utilizes using a selective Filter STF method to improve power quality through compensating harmonics and 
reactive power required by a nonlinear load. The power quality standard IEEE-519 states that the total harmonic 
distortion (THD) caused by electrical equipment gear should be within the agreeable range of 5%. The simulation 
model of the overall system is developed in MATLAB/Simulink environment. This strategy makes algorithm 
independent of load parameters. From analysis, it has been found that fuzzy hysteresis band technique proves to be 
effective in reducing the THD of the source current.

1. Introduction
Electrical power quality has been, in recent years, an important and growing problem because of the proliferation of nonlinear 
loads such as power electronic converters in typical power distribution systems. Particularly, voltage harmonics and power 
distribution equipment problems result from current harmonics produced by proliferation of nonlinear loads. These harmonic 
currents influence the function of other equipment connected on the similar distribution feeder, including the harmonic producing 
loads. Among number of solutions conventionally passive filters offers a low cost solution. They generally offer high series 
impedance or low shunt impedance to block the particular harmonic content. 
However there are certain disadvantages like fixed compensation characteristics and resonances with the source impedance. Thus 
in orders to prevail over the demerits associated with traditional passive filters, Active Power Filters (APF) have been introduced 
in recent years. APF plays a vital role for controlling the amount of harmonic pollution present in a distribution system . Typically 
shunt APF consists of a three phase voltage source inverter with capacitor on dc side. 
      The paper has been organized in the following manner. The SAPF configuration and the load under deliberation are discussed 
in Section II. The control algorithm for APF is based on the use of STFs. The STF is used to extract the fundamental component 
directly from electrical signals (distorted voltage and current) in the α-β reference frame under distorted voltage conditions. A 
Fuzzy hysteresis band technique search has been presented   in Section III. Comparative evaluation using MATLAB/Simulink 
results are discussed in Section IV and finally Section V concludes the paper.

6. Conclusions
The work presented in this paper makes a significant contribution to the identification and control strategies in order to improve 
the SAPF performance. The novel approach which is based on intelligent techniques has been proposed. The performance of the 
proposed fuzzy hysteresis band was verified through simulation studies with Matlab and confronted with classical techniques. 
The complete SAPF structure has been implanted to compensate harmonics caused by nonlinear loads. 
At this level, comparative studies between both  the  fuzzy  hysteresis band and the conventional fixed band current control 
method used to extract the harmonic component of the load current to produce reference currents; (STF theory) have been 
accomplished. 
The  conventional  fixed  hysteresis  band  current control achieves fast response but generates excessive current ripples because  
the modulation  frequency  varies within  one  band. With  the  fuzzy hysteresis current control method,  the band can  be  easily 
implemented  with  fuzzy  logic  to  keep  the modulation  frequency  nearly  constant  and  to  achieve  good  
quality filtering.

1. Introduction
In all types of machinery and equipment, gear transmission is the uppermost driving method, and the operational 
status of gear transmission system directly affects the performance of the mechanical equipment [1]. When the 
internal parts of gear transmission system such as gears, shafts and bearings break down, significant modulation 
phenomenon will produce [2]. JZQ-250 transmission gearbox system is as the study object, its structure parameters, 
operating principle, the layout of measuring point and characteristic frequency are studied. The modulated vibration 
signals are directly demodulated by using cyclostationary demodulation method [3] in normal status, and by fusing 
the local mean decomposition [4-6] with cyclostationary demodulation in tooth wear, and outer ring failure 
condition under the motor speed as 600r/min and the sampling frequency for 4000Hz.  
In the cyclostationary demodulation and LMD, many scholars have done a lot of work. For example, Mr. Du studied 
the second-order cyclic statistical properties, confirmed the second-order cycle statistics for the mechanical fault 
signal demodulation process, more conducive to identification Fault characteristics [7]. Dr. Bi proved that the 
analysis of the gear modulation information can be accurately reflected when the spectral correlation density is used 
on the cyclical demodulation of the vibration signal under the weak gear [8]. Jonathan S. Smith proposed a new 
signal time-frequency processing method (Local Mean Decomposition (LMD)) in 2005. The signal is decomposed 
by LMD, which consists of a complex multi-component FM-AM signal into a series of linear combinations of 
Production Function (PF), where each PF function is multiplied by an envelope signal and a pure FM signal, so that 
the instantaneous amplitude of the original signal can be calculated by the envelope signal, and the instantaneous

4. Conclusion
Based on describing the basic components on JZQ-250 structural parameters, calculating the characteristic 
frequency of gear transmission system, analyzing the measuring points arrangement, setting working state and 
studying data collection methods; analyzing JZQ-250 gear transmission system under normal state, gear fault status 
and bearing fault condition based on the LMD cyclostationarity demodulation method. Aiming at the shortcomings 
of the second-order cyclostationary statistics, it is easy to produce the cross-interference term when it demodulates 
the multi-component modulation signal. LMD decomposition method is used to decompose the signal into a single 
component, smooth demodulation, extraction characteristics. By the use of second order cyclic statistics and spectral 
correlation method can effectively extract the corresponding fault characteristics, and effectively suppress the 
influence of cross-interference terms in actual use, and they have the positive significance to diagnostic result.

Abstract: The design of rotor blades has a great effect on the aerodynamics performances 
of horizontal axis wind turbine and its efficiency. This work present the effects of mesh 
refinement and boundary layer on aerodynamics performances of wind turbine S809 rotor. 
Furthermore, the simulation of fluid flow is taken for S809 airfoil wind turbine blade using 
ANSYS/FLUENT software. The problem is solved by the conservation of mass and 
momentum equations for unsteady and incompressible flow using advanced SST k-ω 
turbulence model, in order to predict the effects of mesh refinement and boundary layer on 
aerodynamics performances. Lift and drag coefficients are the most important parameters 
in studying the wind turbine performance, these coefficients are calculated for four meshes 
refinement and different angles of attacks with Reynolds number is 106. The study is 
applied to a S809 blade airfoil 21% thick, specially designed by NREL for horizontal axis 
wind turbines.

Abstract 
Growing pressures from various players such as governments, non-governmental organizations, and 
customers have impelled business corporations to address the economic, environmental, and social issues 
associated with their supply chain activities. Consequently, the concept of sustainability has become a 
buzzword among scholars and industry practitioners. Although, the concept of sustainability is attaining 
high level of importance in Europe, America, and Asia due to its ability of ensuring environmental 
sustainability, in Africa the integration and application of sustainability’s concept is facing several 
challenges. To this end, this study aims at exploring the barriers hindering the implementation of such 
concept in mining industry of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which its economy 
depends heavily on mining sector. The findings revealed that the major barriers blocking the development 
of Sustainable Supply Chain in mining industry of SADC region include Lack of commitment on 
environmental deterioration, lack of communication and knowledge sharing, Ineffective monitoring and 
control system, lack of effective policy and legislation direction, high cost associated with the 
implementation of SSCM, Poor Supplier Commitment, lack of green practitioners, poor senior 
managements’ commitment, lack of recycling activities. Lack of Political commitment and support, Lack 
of managerial support and practical tools, and inadequate individual capacity.

I. Introduction
Mining operations supply chain activities cause important environmental and social damages, with economic 
implications underlying all these activities [38]; [39]; [41]; and [42]. During the past decade, environmental 
deterioration associated with mining industry’s operations has become a buzzword word among industrial 
practitioners and other stakeholders such as government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and consumers. 
As a result, mining industry practitioners have come under pressure to take full responsibility for environmental 
degradations caused by mining operations. Hence, most of them have been forced to re-view their business processes 
by including sustainability practices into SC’s activities. In light to this, it should be point out that over the past century 
the business goal of mining practitioners was only based generating significant revenues for the company. This 
philosophy backs life cycle logic and evaluation allowing a holistic methodology to lessen environmental damages 
generated from mining operations. Accordingly, Supply Chain (SC) activities symbolize both production and 
materials acquisition and used, the type of the production processes and activities (i.e. exploration, mining, mineral 
processing and extractive metallurgy), and by what means waste produced are employed, if it is a closed-loop, 
industrial ecosystem, or disposal focused.  
It is believed that management of the above-mentioned SC concerns will assist to alleviate environmental 
deteriorations caused by mining operations. For instance, mining operations such as exploration creates the erasure of 
vegetation that in return produces soil destruction and environment damage. Drilling can lead to severe soil and water 
pollution through oil spills. In addition, mining industry’s operations such as digging, loading and 
hauling/transportation, refining, and extraction of metals from ore can lead to change of natural body water ﬂows,

Over the last decades, environmental deterioration has earned so much attention from non-
governmental organizations, government authorities, and consumers as a whole. Previous studies 
point out that environmental deterioration increases risks and decreases opportunities to 
improving mankind well-being, particularly for poorest and vulnerable people. The degradation 
of environment is happening within a progressively more globalized, industrialized and 
interconnected world. Due to the production and consumption system put in place, which do not 
promote sustainability practices. In addition, the deterioration of ecosystem service might impact 
negatively on future generation well-being. In the context of environmental issues such as global 
warming, ozone depletion, solid waste disposal and air pollution on the ascendency, 
manufacturing companies are regarded as the main source from which these environmental 
issues are generated. Though, the aforementioned issues have been extensively studied in the last 
decade. However, many studies focus more on the ‘’what’’ of Sustainable Supply Chain 
Management than on the ‘’how’’. That means, there is still a gap concerning the understanding 
of implementing sustainability practices within the supply chain. Therefore, the main goal of this 
paper is to identify how sustainability practices could be implemented in the supply chain through 
the interaction between the suppliers and customers. The paper uses a systematic literature 
review as the research methodology.

Abstract 
 
Over the current decade, it has been noticed that the number of hungry people across the world has been 
growing at a fast speed. The cause of this food shortage has been mainly attributed to insufficient food 
production as well as an increased demand for food from consumers. In light of this, in Africa, 
particularly the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is dealing with serious food insecurity and this 
is significant issue facing most of people living in the DRC. In this part of the world access to sufficient 
food is not stable, consequently many households are facing recurrent food crisis, which in turn is 
threatening their livelihoods and negatively affecting their welfare.  Therefore, this paper was conducted 
with a goal of analysing and measuring the key factors affecting food security in the DRC.",,,european 2017

Abstract: During the past decade, South Africa as a whole has been experiencing a serious 
electricity supply crisis. Consequently, the electricity utility has been dealing with a rapid 
diminishing reserve margin throughout the load profile. Due to the surplus capacity under which 
the utility operated during the past decades has been mainly exhausted and it is expected that the 
utility’s power system stays restricted whilst new capacity is being built. In addition, the South 
African national power grid is operating under strain. The reason of the current power shortage 
is due to insufficient generation capacity as well as a high increase demand for electricity from 
consumers. In order to mitigate this crisis, the state owned electricity utility Eskom introduced 
Demand Side Management (DSM) measures into the electricity market, which have 
demonstrated theirs worth in being capable of significantly save energy throughout the national 
power grid. Despite this, the total implementation of DSM measures countrywide still a major 
concern especially in rural area. In light of this, the present paper aimed at exploring the 
challenges and benefits regarding the implementation of DSM initiatives. The paper focused more 
on challenges and benefits to energy system, utility, environment, and end-users.

Abstract 
The fundamental responsibilities of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems are to provide urgent medical care, such as 
pre-hospital care, and to transport the patient to the hospital if needed. The agility and efﬁciency of EMS systems are major 
public concerns. Since the EMS process involved is fundamentally a transportation process, the Lean Transportation 
approach is a viable option for improving Emergency Medical Service (EMS) operations performance. The identification of 
waste during the ambulance cycle time is the basis for designing an operations improvement strategy. The scheme utilized 
uses modified versions of the Transportation Value Stream Map (TVSM) and The Operational Vehicle Effectiveness (TOVE) 
Index. Thus, availability, performance and quality wastes are identified to define the improvement strategy.  Results of the 
application for the Monterrey metropolitan operations of the Mexican Red Cross are provided.

Introduction
Over the past decades, a signiﬁcant amount of research studies have been conducted to improve the performance of EMS 
systems. The major focus of these models is to reduce response time (the time between the receipt of a call at the dispatch 
center and the arrival of the ﬁrst emergency response vehicle at the scene) by placing the ambulances in optimal locations. 
The focus has been on response time because EMS systems are designed to rapidly provide advance medical care to critical 
patients such as cardiac arrest or trauma. Therefore, the system has to be extremely agile (Christopher, et al., 2001) to provide 
such a service. In addition to the ambulance response time, other agility performance measures are the ambulance turnaround 
time (time of ambulance arrival to the hospital until it is available to respond to other emergency) and the ambulance cycle 
time (total time from the emergency call until the ambulance is available to service another call) are also relevant to 
determine the level of agility performance of EMS operations.  
On the other hand, the management of these systems must consider their level of efficiency. It is important to determine 
the level of utilization and consumption of the available resources required to attain certain degree of agility. The system 
must be agile, but with an adequate degree of efficiency. One important measure of efficiency considered in the literature is 
the average unit hour utilization (number of services divided by the ambulance hours used). 
This work proposes a scheme based on transportation waste elimination to improve the level of agility and/or efficiency 
of EMS systems. The benefits of such a scheme are illustrated with its application on the Mexican Red Cross operations in 
the Monterrey metropolitan area.  The operations count with ten fixed locations and seven mobile locations from which 
ambulances are sent to service pre-hospital events. The organization has 34 ambulances but the financial resources to operate 
50% of them during any day. The number of services carried out in year 2015 was 35,400. The organization felt that the 
current level of agility of the organization was below international standards and its operating cost presented opportunities for 
reduction.  
This paper consists of five sections. Section one offers an introduction to the problem and context around it.  Section two 
provides a brief review of the literature on lean healthcare and transportation and gives a description of the scheme utilized to 
decrease waste. This section also suggests an adaptation of the lean transport approach to improve EMS operations 
performance. The application of this scheme is undertaken in section three and section four where conclusions and future 
recommendations are presented.

As shown in Table 1, the initial average response time has been reduced 13.5% and the percentage of calls served in with 
a transport time less than ten minutes is 58%, after one month of partial pilot tests. It is expected that after the full 
deployment of the total number of ambulances (given by scenario III) equipped with navigator devices, and the 
implementation of motorcycles and the Interact system, the international average response time benchmark can be achieved.  
4. Conclusions
This work has two main contributions; It proposes a new conceptual approach for improving EMS operations by adapting the 
lean transportation concepts and methodology (Simmons et al., 2004; Villarreal 2012; Sternberg et al., 2013) for this purpose 
and; provides the first application of this approach to improve the level of response time for the Mexican Red Cross 
operations located in the Monterrey metro area. Additional applications of the approach are required to enhance concepts and 
methodology.

Abstract 
Until 2015 Indonesia energy mix is still dominated by petroleum by 47 percent, followed by coal 
and natural gas respectively by 24 percent. Consumption of renewable energy (EBT) has 
accounted for 5 percent of the national energy mix, or 59 million barrels of oil equivalent per 
year, while consumption of petroleum reached 550 million barrels of oil equivalent per year. 
With the growth of energy consumption reached 8 percent per year which is not offset by the 
discovery of new reserves of fossil energy to encourage the emergence of National Energy 
Policy. In order to achieve sustainability and energy independence and to support sustainable 
development, the government aims to use renewable energy in the national energy mix by 17 
percent by 2020 and 23 percent in 2025. One type of renewable energy potential in Indonesia is 
bioenergy. The purpose of this study was to analyze the priority development of the bioenergy 
industry in Indonesia-based palm biomass. The approach used in the study to combine field 
surveys, analysis of stakeholders through the FGD, and a desk study. Field surveys conducted in 
North Sumatra province, while for FGD held in Jakarta. The data were analyzed qualitatively 
and quantitatively using the SWOT method, AHP, and financial feasibility. The results of the 
analysis recommend 2nd generation bioethanol industry (G2) as a flagship bioenergy industry 
based palm biomass. The advantages of bioethanol G2 is supported by the mastery of bioethanol 
from biomass conversion technologies cane and fiber pulping technology. Besides, it is also 
taken into account through the flexibility of product absorption bioethanol compared to other 
bioenergy products. G2 investment bioethanol industry oil from oil palm empty fruit bunches 
(EFB) 5000-5500 capacity KL/year is planned at North Sumatera. To support the sustainable 
supply of raw materials needed EFB at least three palm oil mills capacity of 1000 TBS/day. 
Investment of IDR 622 billion is projected to have payback periods of 4.67 years, PI of 1.99, B/C 
ratio of 1.73 and an IRR of 13.18 percent and still be economically viable.

Abstract 
 
In today turbulent environment controlling the suppliers' risk could have a key role in escalating the firms' 
performance. The present study extends the supply chain literature by introducing supplier dependence as a moderator 
of the relationship between relationship quality and supply risk reduction. Also, the supply risk reduction is also 
introduced as a mediator between the relationship quality and supply chain performance association. Data from a 
survey of 143 Iranian manufacturing firms are used to test the research hypotheses using structural equation modelling. 
As a result, trust and commitment as two dimensions of relationship quality are found to have a significant and positive 
effect on supply risk reduction. Furthermore, supply risk reduction also has a positive impact on supply chain 
performance. Consequently, the results indicate that while supplier dependence positively moderates the contingent 
relationship between trust and supply risk reduction, it has no significant impact on the link between commitment and 
supply risk reduction.

1. Introduction 
Due to the high cost of losing a customer (Athanasopoulou, 2009) and the current competitive environment, firms take 
steps to promote the performance of themselves as well as their supply chain members by establishing a strong 
relationship with their trading partners and reducing uncertainty. A review of the pertinent literature reveals 
relationship quality (RQ) as a key antecedent and driver of firm’s competitive advantages and performance such as 
the organization's flexibility, speed in responding to customer needs and timely delivery (e.g. Han et al., 1993; Fynes 
et al., 2004; Ramaseshan et al. 2006). A good quality of existing relationships among firms and their business partners 
(e.g. supplier) enhances the exchange of relevant information, knowledge, and technology (Roberts et al., 2003) which 
in turn can lead to superior performance in innovation processes, and hence resulting in a better response to the market 
needs and environment changes (Pe´rez-Bustamante, 1999). In fact, an appropriate level of buyer-supplier relationship 
quality can result in a sustainable relationship that assuring the efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity 
improvement for both supplier and buyer firms (Morgan and Hunt, 1994; Liao et al., 2010). While different factors 
(i.e. trust, commitment, satisfaction, communication, and cooperation) are discussed in the literature as the main 
dimensions of the relationship quality, trust (T) and commitment (C) are the most frequently cited factors among them. 
Previous studies highlighted these two dimensions as the key factors in making firms’ activities more efficient 
(Skarmeas et al., 2008) and argued that good levels of trust and commitment enable buyers and suppliers to 
continuously improve their efficiency (Athanasopoulou, 2009). In line with the pertinent literature, the present study 
considers trust and commitment as the factors reflecting the level of relationship quality.  
While the importance of the “relationship quality” was highlighted in the earlier studies in the supply chain area (i.e. 
Fynes et al., 2004), the review of the literature shows that, to date, only one study has empirically investigated the 
potential impact of the relationship quality on firms’ supply chain performance (SCP). Thus, this research aims to 
revisit the association between the supply chain performance and relationship quality in B2B environment by 
considering new perspectives which can shed more light on this research subject. Since the relationship based on trust 
and commitment among supply chain members can mitigate the supply disruption risks (Wuttke et al., 2013) and 
consequently improve the supply chain outcomes (Chen et al., 2013), we argue that the supply risk reduction (SRR) 
mediates the link between relationship quality and supply chain performance. Furthermore, supplier dependence (SD), 
as the amount of alternative resources availability in supplier, is argued to be a key factor in supply risk (Hallikas et",,,european 2017

Abstract 
The paper proposes a new approach to designing of a structured mathematical model for chemical-
technological systems (further - CTS) of refinery in uncertainty. These uncertainties are depending from 
randomness and a fuzziness of the input data for a various types of information. Idea and novelty of the 
proposed method lies in the fact that at first the results of studies of each CTS unit based on the gathered 
information and the adopted criteria for evaluating the model of separate element is constructed. Then to 
simulate the whole process the developed models are combined into a single system. The designed 
method has been successfully implemented during the design of models of units of catalytic reforming at 
Atyrau oil refinery. Analyses and comparison of the known results and simulation results of the proposed 
method, and the experimental data from Atyrau refinery have shown the effectiveness and advantage of 
proposed modeling approach to interrelated technological units complex.

1. Introduction
The vital problems of any production are intensification of production, improving of the quality and efficiency of 
technological and production processes. One of the most promising and effective way to solve these problems is an 
increased production facilities control efficiency through the use of scientific methods of system analysis, 
development and decision-making on the basis of mathematical models constructed with the use of a systematic 
approach [1 - 3]. Currently, there are series of works devoted to the method of mathematical modeling and control of 
refinery technological objects [1, 3, 5]. However there is a class of objects of oil refining, different production 
situations and their control tasks. Their formalization and decision can be not obtained in the traditional ways; it

The originality and novelty of the results of the work lies in the fact that the proposed method of mathematical 
modeling of CTS under condition of uncertainty, make it possible, on the basis of different character information to 
build the adequate models of complicated facilities, consisting of a plurality of interconnected units. For the purpose 
of implementation and practical application of this approach possible models for basic units of PSP at Atyrau 
Refinery are analyzed and evaluated. The mathematical models system of reactors of ISP is developed. 
Thus, systematic approach to the development of a mathematical model set of interconnected technological units 
CTS is justified, which allows to solve basic problems of mathematical models constructing and system simulation 
of work regime of the units processing facility under the fuzzy initial information. The proposed complex model 
development method differs from other approaches by using available information of various kinds, including fuzzy 
information. Different models of the studied objects are built, which are then combined into a single-system models.  
This approach is implemented in the construction of the model system, of the main SPI units at Atyrau refinery. On 
the basis of this study the structure and parameters of mathematical models of thermal reactor F-001 and Claus 
reactor R-001 PSP are identified. To evaluate the quality indicators of sulfur the linguistic models and membership 
functions are built, describing the fuzzy quality indicators. The comparison of the simulation results of the thermal 
reactor work of PSP at Atyrau Refinery with the experimental and industrial plant data is given. The results of the 
simulation with high accuracy coincide with the real (experimental) data and on the base of obtained models can 
determine the quality of products, in fuzzy environment, which is not defined by traditional modeling methods.

Abstract 
Fringe projection entails projecting a fringe pattern or grating on an object and viewing it from a different 
direction. It is a convenient technique for contouring objects that are too coarse to be measured with 
standard interferometry. Fringe projection is related to optical triangulation using a single point of light and 
light sectioning where a single line is projected onto an object and viewed in a different direction to 
determine the surface contour (Case et al. 1987). The fringe patterns are projected on to the object surface 
and the deformed grating image is captured by a CCD camera for subsequent analysis. Phase shifting 
techniques have been employed to determine the phase value. The phase variation is achieved by using a 
linear translation stage incorporated to the grating.  In this paper, the surface profile of objects for 3D 
printers is determined by using fringe pattern.

Abstract 
Queue length optimisation and service efficiency is an integral part for banks. Queuing theory helps in 
understanding the waiting lengths and times to correlate it with performance and customer satisfaction. 
The queuing models are worthwhile in evaluating the service efficiency of a counter. The research 
revolves around understanding the single server model to assess a counter in bank and calculate the 
utilisation parameters to analyse the efficiency of the counter. Queueing model is applied in order to 
check the frequency of the counter being busy and evaluate the service rate. The queuing theory is highly 
advantageous and can help optimise the queue lengths in the bank. The scrutiny of the bank queues 
through the single server models will assist in finding the flaws in the service and devising ways to 
improve the service rates in order to minimise the queues and have an efficient utilisation rate. The 
objective behind the experimentation is to optimise the queue lengths and revamp the working of the 
counter and enhance the service efficiency.

Abstract 
Over the last decade, measuring corporate sustainability has been increasingly important in business 
research and practice. However, most of the studies to date have been conducted in the context of 
developed nations. In addition, the implementation of sustainability performance measurement tools 
has been almost developed in and for large firms while these tools are still missing in small and 
medium enterprise (SMEs). From the literature, this study will produce a protocol; and develop 
sustainability metrics (through the lens of Triple Bottom Line approach) for these SMEs whist taking 
into consideration their specific characteristics in the context of Vietnam. A mixed methods approach 
will be employed starting with a quantitative phase to provide an overview of these SMEs’ 
sustainability performance, followed by a qualitative phase to explain the initial quantitative findings. 
The researcher believes that using an explanatory sequential mixed methods, key enablers and 
inhibitors to effectively measure corporate sustainability performance of SMEs in Vietnam will be 
investigated and addressed, which is the primary purpose of this study. The research results are 
expected to have critical implications for both managers and policy makers aimed at improving 
SMEs’ sustainability performance.

Abstract: During the last decade, South Africa has been dealing with a serious food crisis. The 
reason of this food crisis has been largely attributed to the effect of climate changes, land 
availability and high food prices, which in return have caused an important damage to the lifestyle 
of many households, especially those living in rural area. In response to this backdrop, the South 
African governments decided to develop new strategies in order to create a future environment 
where households are not dealing with issues relating to food insecurity. One of the strategy put 
in place has been on empowering small farmers by giving them the necessary resources. Because, 
they believed that small farmers would contribute in reducing food crisis by increasing food 
throughput, as it this later is viewed as a serious challenge for many countries all over the world. 
However, this approach has not yet meet the expected result due to the fact that the trend of food 
crisis still growing at regional and national level. Therefore, the present research article aims at 
developing a model that can help to enhance food security in South Africa. The model focus on 
four keys such as food availability, poverty per district, intra-household food distribution, Land 
availability. Limpopo province was used as case study. The result show that the mitigation of food 
insecurity can increase employment and empower those who live in townships.

Abstract (12 font) 
A mathematical model was developed to solve a staff-scheduling problem for a maintenance staff in 
production. Currently, monthly schedules are manually constructed. The manual nature of the process and 
the large number of constraints and goals lead to a situation where the used schedules are both inefficient 
and unfair. A linear goal programming model is suggested to find an optimized cyclical schedule. The 
maintenance planner objectives as well as the engineers’ preferences are taken into account. The developed 
model had to produce balanced schedules that provide the required coverage while satisfying fairness 
considerations, in terms of weekends off, working night shifts, working day shifts. A 28-days scheduling 
period plan has been used. All of work patterns have been mathematically formulated as a set of soft 
constraints. The suggested mathematical model has been implemented using Lingo software. The optimal 
cyclical schedule has been found. It significantly increases both efficiency and staff satisfaction. A good 
balance of distribution between day and night shifts has been justified even though of different worker 
absenteeism scenarios. 
Keywords Maintenance staff. Staff scheduling.

Abstract 
Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Limited (TGTDCL) is a public Limited Company 
(government share 75%) responsible for distributing natural gas to customers at the household, 
commercial and industrial level. In order to deliver it services more efficiently, the company needs to 
address a number of customer services issues such as service processes, customer experiences, 
communication processes and gas marketing Rules. Titas Gas personnel use traditional procedure to 
deliver services to their customer. As a consequence, Customer needs to run to get services. TGTDCL 
still may be considered as a low level service provider. The understanding of the innovative service 
process, and its economic implications, these studies do some key questions what needs to be changed? 
Are some processes and models no longer applicable for TGTDCL? Does TGTDCL need to develop new 
explanations and model regarding its services? This paper has reviewed available literature regarding 
current service procedure and compared with traditional model of Titas gas. It outlines strategies for 
improving management procedure. Finally, this paper introduces a case study that shows how customer of 
TGTDCL can get efficient and innovative services and thereby make the customer service of TGTDCL 
more efficient. 
Key Words: Service innovation, Employee Motivation, Strategic Management, Customer service. 
1 Introduction and Theory background 
Traditionally services are described as elements which cannot be touched, intangible and cannot be viewed as 
object. A service is viewed as an activity or process and no transfer of ownership takes place. Besides, the demand 
of service has increased due to globalization, advancement of the IT application, knowledge Production, community 
Building and Networking (As Hanneke. Vos 2010). The important things are Knowledge on people, management 
and strategy, and technological domain need to be combined and integrated to design a proper solution to the 
customer (Candi M 2007). There are at least two complicating factors of services such as multidisciplinary and high 
degree of heterogeneity. Bartos (2002) sets out a definition of innovation appropriate to the public sector: Innovation 
is a change in policy or management practice that would lead to a lasting improvement in level of service or quantity 
or quality of output by an organization. In addition, Innovation processes in the public sector may vary between 
different countries due to institutional variations (Gallouj & Zanfei, 2013). Besides, the results of a recent literature 
review by De Vries et al. (2016) suggest that most existing studies of public sector innovation have   been conducted 
in liberal market economies such as the USA and the UK, implying that more research from other countries is 
needed. Research has not yet been focused much in public service innovation (a few examples include Windrum and 
Koch 2008, Hartley 2005, Soren and Torfing 2009, Gallouj et. Al. 2013, Borins 2001, Fuglsang et. al. 2014).The 
most of service innovation research has used private profitable firms as their empirical setting (A.S. Tor Helge et.al. 
2016). Literature discussing innovation in the public sector is increasing; the amount of research literature 
innovation in the public sector is still limited. Specifically, there is almost not any research literature regarding 
service systems of national Oil & Gas sector of the least developed country like Bangladesh. According to Finland 
research agency, TEKES (Tekes), “Service innovation is a new or significantly improved service concept that is 
taken into practice. It can be for example a new customer interaction channel, a distribution system or a 
technological concept or a combination of them. A service innovation always includes replicable elements that can 
be identified and systematically reproduced in other cases or environments. The replicable element can be the 
service outcome or the service process as such or a part of them”.

study. TGTDCL communicates to Parents Company normally when problem (Material/equipment shortages) arises. 
However, it is not effective. TGTDCL should develop dynamic communication systems with sister concern 
Company like PGCL, BGDCL, KGDCL, JGDCL, SGCL and BAPEX for better customer services.  
6 Conclusions and Further Study 
Smooth cooperation is vital for the revenue, sales and Material Engineering and Control Department for executing 
effective customer services. Third Party/stakeholders relations (enlisted contractor, Local political leaders, City 
Corporations and police administration) and coordination regarding Titas gas services is very poor. Political leader’s 
commitment and police-city corporation smooth communication with TGTDCL, and accountability can play a vital 
role in improving management and customer service procedure of TGTDCL. Change of management and financial 
procedure regarding service systems at TGTDCL needs to emphasize. This study shows that TGTDCL should 
reduce the bureaucratic barrier, delegate financial empowerment and improve professional conduct within the 
departmental jurisdiction. Integrated computer systems of TGTDCL need to enhance to execute efficient customer 
services. This study shows that TGTDCL has lack of motivated people due importance of customer services relevant 
to the staff selection and transfer right places of work force. This paper demonstrates that administrative innovation 
to develop service systems is not given due importance at the TGTDCL. The reasons for not emphasizing service 
innovation with structural and service process need further study.

Abstract 
Growing pressures from various players such as governments, non-governmental organizations, and 
customers have impelled business corporations to address the economic, environmental, and social issues 
associated with their supply chain activities. Consequently, the concept of sustainability has become a 
buzzword among scholars and industry practitioners. Although, the concept of sustainability is attaining 
high level of importance in Europe, America, and Asia due to its ability of ensuring environmental 
sustainability, in Africa the integration and application of sustainability’s concept is facing several 
challenges. To date, several studies were conducted to investigate the barriers affecting sustainability 
practices in mining sector at country’s level. However, an investigative study regarding the barriers of 
sustainability practices in mining sector of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), which 
involve fifteen African countries is missing, this paper aims at filling this gap. The data were collected 
through a quantitative approach. At least 1 423 participants were involved in the survey. The findings 
revealed that the major barriers blocking the development of Sustainable Supply Chain in mining industry 
of SADC region include Lack of commitment on environmental deterioration, lack of communication and 
knowledge sharing, Ineffective monitoring and control system, lack of effective policy and legislation 
direction, high cost associated with the implementation of SSCM, Poor Supplier Commitment, lack of green 
practitioners, poor senior managements’ commitment, lack of recycling activities. Lack of Political 
commitment and support, Lack of managerial support and practical tools, and inadequate individual 
capacity.

I. Introduction
Mining operations supply chain activities cause important environmental and social damages, with economic 
implications underlying all these activities [38]; [39]; [41]; and [42]. During the past decade, environmental 
deterioration associated with mining industry’s operations has become a buzzword word among industrial 
practitioners and other stakeholders such as government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and consumers. 
As a result, mining industry practitioners have come under pressure to take full responsibility for environmental 
degradations caused by mining operations. Hence, most of them have been forced to re-view their business processes 
by including sustainability practices into SC’s activities. In light to this, it should be point out that over the past century 
the business goal of mining practitioners was only based generating significant revenues for the company. This 
philosophy backs life cycle logic and evaluation allowing a holistic methodology to lessen environmental damages 
generated from mining operations. Accordingly, Supply Chain (SC) activities symbolize both production and 
materials acquisition and used, the type of the production processes and activities (i.e. exploration, mining, mineral 
processing and extractive metallurgy), and by what means waste produced are employed, if it is a closed-loop, 
industrial ecosystem, or disposal focused.

The role of participant governed networks in implementing healthcare 
innovations into practice. Evidence from the UK NHS

Abstract 
Due to the increasing level of underfunding and the aging population, the United Kingdom 
National Health Service (NHS) is under pressure to find innovative ways to improving patient 
care and service quality. Different research has emerged that suggest the importance of 
‘evidence into practice’ within healthcare networks, as one of the means of promoting 
efficient and effective healthcare. However, a review of extant literature reveals that limited 
research has examined the value of participant-governed networks on the implementation of 
new evidence into practice within the UK NHS. This study therefore draws on the theories of 
the network and network governance to present an empirical evidence of how participant-
governed networks influence the implementation of new evidence into practice. The study is 
one component of a large-scale, collaborative, longitudinal project examining the value of the 
West of England Academic Health Science Network (WEAHSN). Underpinned by a multiple 
case study methodology, semi-structured interviews and document analysis were used to 
obtain data from five maternity units, the WEAHSN’s team members, industry partners’ and 
general practices across the WEAHSN’s region. While the first case dealt with the use of 
Magnesium Sulphate to decrease the incidence of Cerebral Palsy in preterm labour, the 
second case examined the optimisation of anticoagulation use in the reduction of Atrial 
Fibrillation related stroke. Preliminary results revealed that informal communication, flexible 
implementation strategy and incentives are the key factors that influenced the 
implementation of new evidence into practice in complex healthcare networks such as the 
UK NHS.

Abstract- 
It is primarily understood that clusters are the sources of innovation and therefore, of late, the focus of 
researchers and practitioners has been increasingly to ascertain the factors driving innovation among the 
firms in a cluster, especially in a high-tech cluster. Researchers have identified that the dynamism of a firm 
in terms of degree of interactions of a firm with other firms and related institutions as one of the key drivers 
of innovations in a firm residing in a cluster. However, this has not been empirically validated considering 
the gamut of interactions of a firm with all the stakeholders within and outside a cluster.  It is in the context 
of Bengaluru (erstwhile Bangalore) cluster which houses densely interconnected network of high-tech 
manufacturing firms this paper probes the influence of degree of cluster linkages on the firm-level 
innovation.

1. Introduction
Innovation is considered as one of the key drivers of productivity and firm performance (Schumpeter, 1934; Porter, 
1990). In the context of a developing country, Mytelka (2000) defined innovation as the process by which firms master 
and implement the design and production of goods and services that are new to them regardless of whether they are 
new to their competitors, their customers or the world. Further, from the perspective of a manufacturing firm, the 
focus is laid on technological innovation which provides the firm a competitive edge over others (Becheikh et al., 
2006). However, firms in general, and Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in particular are constrained by internal 
resources that serve as impediments to undertake innovations by them. It is here the notion of industrial cluster which 
comes in handy to eliminate or lower these impediments and thereby propelling innovations in firms (Ketels, 2003).  
Clusters offer various benefits to firms as well as regions housing these clusters (Muskell, 2001, Ketels, 2003; 
Sonderegger, 2010). Notably, they facilitate firms to achieve higher levels of innovation and productivity (Porter, 
1990; Ketels, 2003). However, firms in a cluster can derive economic benefits from positive location specific 
externalities resulted out of network effects only if the firms in a cluster interact adequately. Hence, it is appropriate 
to understand the influence of interactions of firms in terms of cluster linkages on the innovation levels of firms.  
Furthermore, among the clusters of the globe, Bengaluru cluster occupies a unique position as it includes not only IT 
sector but also multitude of high-tech manufacturing industries (e.g. electronics, pharmaceutical, machine tools,

Abstract 
This study investigates the use of TQM as a business improvement strategy in furniture manufacturing 
SMMEs and the impact of supply chain management on product quality of furniture manufacturing SMMEs 
that are situated in Orlando Industrial Park and Freedom Park. It was discovered in this study that supply 
chain starts with the supplier and end with the customer. The study reveals that furniture manufacturing 
SMMEs must make relationships with all the stakeholders involved, including other organization as it helps 
to improve the competitiveness of the enterprise and it further helps with learning from enterprises. A long-
term relationship needs to be made with the suppliers of the enterprise. This study adopted a mixed method 
approach by developing a case study, questionnaires were issued, observations were made and managers 
and owners were interviewed as well. This study adds knowledge on the impact of the supply chain on 
product quality. Further research must be made on the effectiveness of TQM on furniture manufacturing 
SMMEs.

Introduction
SMMEs in South Africa have the bigger pie of the business pie. They make a total of 97.5% from the overall South 
African businesses [15]. However, the number of manufacturing SMMEs in South Africa has been decreased since 
1998. However, the remaining manufacturing SMMEs have been able to improve their sales margins.  In contrary, the 
improved profit margins do not compliment employment by means of increasing employment in the country. These 
Manufacturing SMMEs are however challenged by the increased imports of products (furniture) that they sell in this 
country [3]. In order for SMMEs to make it the business world, they need to make sure that their quality is up to 
standard and they also need to compete on costs. Meaning they must offer good quality products at an affordable price. 
Furthermore, poor quality products and or service damage the good name of the enterprise and its competitiveness. 
When enterprises reduce costs they should not compromise quality because customers are sensitive towards poor 
quality products and or service [16]. 
The end-consumer of the product does not depend on the company alone but is beyond the producer of the product. 
Furthermore, it is stated that environment, products and delivery times are closely linked to customer satisfaction. 
This means that enterprises need to consider those factors (environment, products and delivery time) [1].

b.
Good working relationship with suppliers
Working and having a very good relationship with their suppliers and other organizations that surround their enterprise
will make them learn a lot from their suppliers. However, these relationships can only last and be effective if there is
trust amongst all stakeholders and collaboration amongst all parties that are involved. When the enterprise has a good
relationship with its suppliers, they get the privilege of buying on credit and pay later if the Enterprise is stranded.
Furthermore, they can also get discounts from their suppliers if they have an effective collaboration. Even their
suppliers can also refer them to potential customers. This will make the business to grow faster and make more money.
This is what is needed in enterprises especially in SMMEs.
c.
Using Total Quality Management
The enterprise should consider producing and selling good quality products at all times. This can only be achieved if
the needs and expectations of customers are known and fulfilled. This will make the organization to be competitive
and have increased inflow of cash. In order for furniture manufacturing SMMEs to achieve this, it means that they
need to adopt the TQM which is a business improvement strategy because it focuses on the customer and it involves
all the stakeholders in the enterprise.
V.
Limitations and Future Studies
This research only studied furniture manufacturing SMMEs that are located in Gauteng province, South Africa. 
Generalizing the findings and recommendations to all SMMEs will not be practical because the studied industry has 
its own challenges that it is facing that are not necessarily the same challenges that are faced by SMMEs who trade in 
other industries. Further research must be done on the effectiveness of Total Quality Management on furniture 
manufacturing SMMEs. This will help realize if TQM is an effective business improvement strategy that can be used 
by furniture manufacturing SMMEs. The second future study will look at the relationship between supply chain 
management and product quality. The primary objective of this study will be to test this relationship scientifically. 
This will be the second study because this study did not test the relationship scientifically. The discussions were based 
on questionnaires answers and case study.   
VI.
Conclusion and Implications
This research looked at the role of supply chain management and it was discovered in this research that it is of 
paramount importance in the organization. Total Quality Management in SMMEs was also looked into and findings 
state that it improves performance enterprise. Findings indicate that the furniture manufacturing SMMEs play a pivotal 
role in the economy. Some of these SMMEs even exports their products (furniture) to the SADEC region. However, 
these furniture manufacturing SMMEs do not invest heavily in ensuring quality in their products and services. 
Moreover, furniture manufacturing SMMEs should understand that failing to ensure quality is not only costly but the 
enterprise can lose customers due to them switching suppliers. Should furniture manufacturing SMMEs ensure quality, 
their cash flow will be favorable. They must also work on strengthening their relationships with all of their 
stakeholders as this has a positive impact on the quality of the products and service.

Abstract 
In order to improve efficiencies and minimise costs, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services in 
the aviation sector are increasingly embracing lean philosophy and advances in technology. The central 
tenet of lean philosophy is to eliminate non-value adding activities from value streams. While the take-up 
of lean philosophy is increasing, there are indications that aviation MRO services are facing challenges in 
implementing lean and this inevitably impacts on the effectiveness of such continuous improvement 
programmes. This paper presents findings from a study on aspects of lean philosophy in aviation MRO 
organisations. The focus of the study is on critical success factors that can impact the effectiveness of 
continuous improvement and lean waste reduction programmes in aviation MRO organisations. Findings 
from the study showed that emphasis needs to be placed on technical, non-technical and managerial 
considerations when implementing lean in aviation MRO organisations. In addition, also observed is a 
shift of emphasis in critical success factors when operating cloud-based aviation MRO systems in 
comparison to traditional aviation MRO systems.

1. Introduction
There continues to be a growing interest for lean philosophy in Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) services 
including in the aviation industry (Mathaisel, 2005; Al-kaabi et. al, 2007; Ayeni et. al. 2011; Ayeni et. al. 2015). 
Lean philosophy, whose roots are in manufacturing, has been extended to service industry and found success, for 
example, in aviation services, healthcare, IT operations, and retail management. The central tenet of the lean 
philosophy is to eliminate waste from value streams. Lean waste, conceptualized as anything that does not add value 
to a process, can manifest in a variety of ways, as overstocked and underused inventory, and misallocated labour, 
time, transportation and logistics. From a customer’s perspective, value-added activities are necessary and customers 
are willing to pay for the activities (Bamber, 2000; Glass, 2016). 
Aviation MROs can realize significant performance improvements by implementing lean practices across their 
operations and processes (Bartholomew, 2009; MIT, 2005). MRO could be defined as ‘all actions that have the 
objective of retaining or restoring an item in or to a state in which it can perform its required function’ (Vieira & 
Loures, 2016). Included in the action set are combinations of technical, corresponding non-technical and managerial 
activities.  In aviation, the main objective of MRO organisations is to retain or restore aircraft to a state in which 
they can safely perform its required design functions (Al-kaabi et al., 2007). 
Aviation MRO are known to commit high economic costs including significant work and training hours for service 
personnel in order to keep appropriately maintained aircraft fleets and deliver the safety, comfort, and quality 
services offered by airlines. According the International Air Transport Association (IATA, 2015) the maintenance 
cost for an airline is 17% of the operational cost. During 2014, the global market of MRO’s costs were $62.1 
billion,

(IEOM) Bristol, UK, July 24-25, 2017 
The following is a typical comment: 
‘The airlines and the MRO organisations are not experts in the IT field or maybe are not enough 
sufficiently familiar with the lean philosophy. In any case, the participation of consultants mainly 
during the induction phase, supposes an aid of great value for management and training.’ 
Finally, the focus group reinforced believe that lean is a viable philosophy for aviation MRO organizations but not 
sufficient by itself to achieve all the strategic goals of an aviation organisation. A point noted by other researchers 
(Ayeni et al., 2011). To achieve the desired leverage, the focus group went further by emphasising the need for 
stakeholders to understand the clear shift of emphasis in the critical success factors when implementing lean in a 
cloud-based MRO setting. These findings may be contingent on the characteristics of each aviation company and 
without accounting for the identified factor especially on a case-by-case basis, implementation may face difficulties, 
stressful, and fraught with significant uncertainty making key stakeholders such as suppliers, customers, or investors 
experience negative outcomes. 
5. Conclusions and Future Work
Effective lean waste reduction with the benefits of increased resource utilisation and productivity is achievable in 
aviation MRO services. Technological advances such as cloud-based systems should in principle help leverage the 
gains of lean in MRO services. There is however important critical success factors to be aware of when 
implementing lean in MRO organisations. This paper presented an analysis of the critical factors using results 
obtained from a focus group. Based on the analysis and discussion of the results it is concluded that there are 
differences in the significance of some of the critical success factors for effectiveness of lean implementations in 
traditional aviation MRO organisations compared to a cloud-based aviation MRO organisations. Monitoring and 
evaluation of performance, technical competence, consultant participation, user appreciation, and supplier 
management are emphasised more for lean implementation effectiveness in cloud-based MRO organisations. Project 
management, organisational infrastructure, and education and training are also important critical success factors for 
lean implementation in both traditional and cloud-based aviation MRO organisations. Management, non- 
technological, and technical groups considerations are found to be significant when considering the implementation 
effectives of lean in MRO services. The emphasis placed on how these groupings will affect the effectiveness of  
lean implementation differs in traditional and cloud-based MRO settings. More emphasis is on the technological 
factor grouping for lean implementation in the cloud-based MRO services. Future work could focus on how these 
results can be embedded in the processes for lean implementation processes for MRO services in the aviation sector.

Abstract 
Ti-6Al-4V is a titanium alloy used in aerospace industry because of its high strength, low elastic 
modulus and corrosion resistance property. Its hardness makes it a necessity to use non-
conventional processes for machining. To analyze the effects of peak current, pulse-on time and 
pulse-off time on output parameters we drilled a hole of Ø 6 mm using copper (99%) electrode 
by Electric Discharge Machining (EDM) process. Effect of various input parameters on output 
viz material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness are studied. Response surface 
methodology was used for optimization of the process. Taguchi L9 orthogonal array was used to 
design the experiment. Significance of individual parameter was obtained by ANOVA. The 
result obtained will be compared with that obtained by grey-relational analysis.

Abstract 
One of the critical challenges of business world is to manage change. This rapid rate of change 
has forced many companies to radically improve its business processes or better known as 
business process reengineering (BPR). Financial sector is one of the main drivers in economy in 
any nation and has been experiencing drastic change in its operations. This paper examines the 
effectiveness of business process reengineering (BPR) and the moderation role of information 
technology (IT) capability on the performance of Islamic bank in Malaysia. BPR factors namely 
change management, strategy alignment, management commitment, customer focus, IT 
investment, process redesign, adequate financial resource and less bureaucratic structure are 
investigated to see their effects on the Islamic banks’ performance. The performance of Islamic 
bank is unique because it is based on three main aspects which include (1) educating individual, 
(2) public interest, and (3) establishing justice. The direct relationship and moderation effects 
were analyzed using the Partial Least Square (PLS) structural equation modeling. Collectively, 
the results show the positive effect of BPR on the performance of Islamic banks. The outcome of 
this study provides the important insights to both managers and researchers for further 
understanding of BPR factors particularly on the Islamic bank’s performance.

Abstract 
Sustainable supply chain allows integration of environmentally sound choices into supply chain 
management, shifting focus towards environmental, social and economic impacts across products and 
services lifecycle. Pressures arising from mounting environmental costs, consumer demand for eco-
friendly products and services, and profitability amongst others are driving shift towards a sustainable 
supply chain. Growing evidence suggests that to effectively respond to these pressures, a key requirement 
is visibility i.e. the extent to which actors within a supply chain has access to, or share, information which 
they consider as key or useful to their operations, improves decision making, and is of mutual benefit. 
This paper contains a systematic literature review on visibility-enabled sustainable supply chain 
ecosystems. A total of 44 accepted refereed papers between 2007 and first quarter of 2017 have been 
selected and reviewed. The selected papers are then analyzed based on their content and the appropriate 
developed categories. The results show that visibility impacts significantly on sustainable supply chains 
and salient themes are emerging in the subject area.

1. Introduction
In the last few years, the evolution of the economic, technological, and environmental landscape in the context of the 
global industry has for supply chain process led to many significant changes. Global supply chains are having to 
adapt towards fulfilling a growing role that demands increased interconnectedness amongst participants, including 
suppliers and manufacturers. The increasing interconnectedness with attributable dependencies amongst supply 
chain participants results from advances, for example, in outsourcing, globalization, and innovations. A consequence 
of these relationships is the growing complexity of supply chains(Gunasekaran and Ngai, 2004). Supply chains are 
embracing sustainability with a premise that as the complexity of supply chain networks increases, so is a need for 
supply chains to take full responsibilities of their business operations and clearly demonstrate their environmental 
and ethical behavior(Grzybowska, Golinska and Romano, 2012).   
Whilst the focus in traditional supply chains has been solely on cost considerations (Goetschalcks and Fleischmann, 
2008), sustainable supply chains on the contrary are developing strategies and initiatives that simultaneously

Abstract 
The oil and gas companies and companies which produce sub-products of oil, such as 
petrochemical firms, nationally and internationally have been faced competitive issues that 
harden sales and complicate market structure. There are many analytical researches which have 
been considered various items in market strategy; however, in this paper by idolizing competitive 
atmosphere in basketball game and the concept of mobile leadership, we tries to present new 
model named DO (Dynamic Organization) which help firms to overwhelm the effects of 
tolerances in market and conquer competitors. Based on basketball game model, when a player 
gets the ball all competitor organize quickly than her teammate like as market. In these terms, 
both defensive and offensive strategy with leadership ability is needed. These items are 
transferred by ball to every player. The designed model is utilized for two refining companies 
which have been encountered with sever global price changes of oil and sub- products. The 
results verify the effect of strategy planned by the presented model on better controlling of 
economic and market changes.

Abstract 
This study looked at the occupational health and safety of manufacturing SMMEs that are based in Soweto, 
which is a very big township in Johannesburg, Gauteng Province in South Africa. The aim was to 
investigate if furniture manufacturing SMMEs consider the occupational health and the safety of their 
employees. This study adopted a mixed method where a case study was written, unstructured interviews 
were conducted, and questionnaires were given to the representatives of the enterprise that were studied. 
This research studied 117 furniture manufacturing SMMEs. It was discovered in this study that the 
employees did not seem to care what happens to their employees with regards to their health and safety. 
This adds more knowledge in the sector of furniture manufacturing SMMEs and occupational health and 
safety. Further research will focus on finding the reason why these enterprises ignore the occupational 
health and safety Act 85 of 1993. The next research will further seek to find out if ignoring the occupational 
health and safety is deliberate or they have solid reasons for not considering the Act.

Introduction
The Occupational Health and Safety Act was first introduced in the 17th century by the British Factory. This 
Occupational Health and Safety Act restricted women and children from working in factories. In addition, the factory 
employees liked the act till the late 1960s when they complained that they were no longer safe at the workplace. 
Because their grievances were not heard, it forced employees to strike for their health and forced the government to 
review the Act. By that time, they had a very high number of employees that had been infected with lung cancers, 
silicosis, and other health issues. [16]. Occupational health and safety aim to prevent employees, employers, and 
people who visit from being exposed to hazards and getting illnesses in the workplace [10]. SMMEs are usually 
managed by the owner of the enterprise. These enterprises are usually posed to health risks and many other health 
issues with their physical work that they do daily. However, these SMMEs usually have good relations with their 
employees, customers, and suppliers [4]. More businesses including SMMEs are exposed to the latest and advanced 
technology, but these technological advances pose threats to the safety of employees. The technology that is referred 
to can be the equipment that enterprise employees use to manufacture their products [1].  
Gauteng province has the highest number of manufacturing companies in the country. This industry has not been 
growing, however, it has the largest portion of the total labour force. With regards to contributing to the GDP, this 
sector is the second largest following the financial sector (The South African Economy and its Engine Room, 
Gauteng). However, these SMMEs encounter a number of challenges. South Africa is a member of BRICS (Brazil,

6.1.3. Proper working gear 
It is evident in the case study that the people at these furniture manufacturing SMMEs do not have the proper and safe 
working clothing that they wear to protect themselves from the hazards and getting illnesses from the workplace. In 
addition, some who had the face mask did not wear them on the face to cover the nose and mouth but they were on 
the forehead. There were no fire extinguishers in place, should there be fire, the enterprise will lose everything and 
people will be harmed.  
6.2. Recommendations 
6.2.1. Certificate of competence 
These furniture manufacturing SMMEs must comply with the safety regulations. They must make sure that they have 
fire extinguishers in place should there be fire. They must abide by all the regulation. They must know their duties 
and those of their employees, train them, apply for the certificate of competence then plug it on their walls to show 
that they know and abide by the Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993.  
6.2.2. Proper working gear 
Failing to wear protective gear can result in employees getting illnesses and exposed to hazards. Employees must 
ensure that they buy a full uniform (protective gear) that their employee can use when they are working.  
6.2.3. Staffing 
These SMMEs must ensure that they employ locals and internationals with passports and work permits. This will also 
prevent unnecessary xenophobic attacks. Their stuff needs to be trained about health and safety in the workplace. 
6.2.4. Government intervention 
The government through the department of labour must train these SMMEs about the importance of complying with 
the Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993. They must also visit these SMMEs and check if they are doing 
the right things or not. The visits should be without the knowledge of the enterprise.  
7.
Conclusions
It is clear that the studied furniture manufacturing SMMEs do not comply with the Occupational Health And Safety 
Act 85 of 1993 because in their business there were no certificates of competence as issued by the chief inspector of 
the Occupational Health and Safety under the Department of Labour in South Africa.  Employees are exposed to lots 
and lots of hazards in the workplace but they continue working because they have no any other option because they 
are either illiterate or they are illegal foreigners.  The purpose of the study was to review the OHS Act 85 of 1993 and 
that was done in this study and to investigate if the studied SMMEs comply with this Act. However, it should be noted 
that these SMMEs have limited finance and have other challenges. It is very important to employ local residents with 
skills and are literate so that they can read documents regarding Occupational Health and Safety. They need to employ 
legal foreigners who have proper documentation. Further study will look at why these SMMEs ignore to comply with 
the Occupational Health and Safety Act.

Abstract 
Reducing crowd volumes at Emergency Department (ED) of healthcare delivery system is a major 
concern to healthcare provider.  One of the most promising option for doing so is to offer at-home healthcare 
delivery system, which we referred here as Urgent Care at Home (UCH).  It can reduce the ED visits by 
patients with non-critical condition. In this research, we have considered an integrated lean concept to make 
UCH effective, efficient and reduce operating cost. To achieve this objective, first, we have designed a 
simulation model using ARENA 14.7 for UCH by considering it’s mechanism to assess its current 
performance. To study the feasibility of considering lean concept for UCH, we have incorporated the idea 
of value stream mapping (VSM) using electronic value stream mapping (eVSM). We compared the outcome 
of eVSM with the current system performance obtained from ARENA, and used Lean Six Sigma DMAIC 
to determine opportunities for improvement.

Abstract 
Turnaround time covers activities involving ordering, collection, transportation, preparation, analysis, 
interpretation, and provision of medical test results to clinicians and patients. Considered as the most 
important key performance indicator in the medical laboratory industry, turnaround time is influenced by 
various forms of lean wastes, which are, transportation, inventory, motion, waiting, over production, over 
processing, and defects. Elimination of these wastes will improve the operational efficiency and cost-
effectiveness of the medical laboratory industry. Given the widespread awareness of what lean can do in 
the healthcare industry, it worthwhile investigating the factors behind the adoption of non-adoption of 
lean in the medical laboratory industry. This paper investigates the barriers to and enablers of lean 
adoption and implementation in the context of medical laboratories in Namibia. Findings from this 
research indicate that management support plays an important role in enabling lean adoption. On the other 
hand, lack of support from management is the strongest inhibiting barrier to the successful adoption of 
lean.

1. Introduction
Turnaround time refers to time between ordering a laboratory test and reporting the test results (Alem, 2013; Deyet 
al. 2013; Biswajit et al., 2013). In line with this, Hawkins (2007) explains turnaround time in terms of nine steps, 
namely, ordering, collection, identification, transportation, preparation, analysis, reporting, interpreting, and 
provision of results to clinicians and patients. Fast turnaround time is crucial to medical laboratories (Poksinska,

888","Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management (IEOM) 
Bristol, UK, July 24-25, 2017 
As indicated by the analysis in Table 3, adequate training has the strongest influence on lean adoption in medical 
laboratory, with a mean score (or response) of 4.49. Proper planning and involvement closely follows adequate 
planning, along with top management involvement. The rest of the enablers were customer satisfaction, democratic 
talk about wastes and ability to accept change, as shown in the table. Interestingly, the mean score for all the 
enablers in the top five range were above 4, which indicates that the top five enablers had a strong influence on the 
adoption of lean. Overall, top management involvement is crucial in proper planning and making plans for adequate 
training which play a crucial role in the rest of the enabling factors. These results are supported by past research 
findings (Mallicket al., 2012; Poksinska, 2010; Joosten et al., 2009). 
4.2 Barriers of Lean Principles Application 
This investigation was aimed at identifying factors or challenges that inhibit can hinder or inhibit the adoption of 
lean in the medical laboratory industry. The factors identified were support from the management, financial 
constraints, staff resistant to change, lack of conceptual knowledge on lean principles, and absence of lean culture in 
the laboratory.

Table 4 presents a summary of the results in terms of mean response rate. From this analysis, it can be seen that that 
lack of support from the management has the highest inhibitive influence on the adoption of lean in medical 
laboratories, with a mean score of 4.32. This agrees well with the conclusion obtained above, that top management 
involvement is the most crucial factor in lean implementation. Following the lack of management support, financial 
constraints and staff resistance to change have a significant influence. However, lack of conceptual knowledge and 
absence of lean culture in the laboratory have moderate influence on inhibiting the implementation of lean in the 
medical laboratory industry. These findings are similar to what was observed in past studies by Drotz (2014); 
Mallick et al. (2012). 
4.3 Managerial Implications 
This research provides important managerial implications. Deriving from this study, the following approaches are 
considered to essential for lean transformation and application, particularly from the context of the Namibian 
medical laboratory industry: 
1.
Identify the key performance indicators which are below the target, along with the existing wastes;
2.
Implement improvement initiatives based on the affected indicators and communicated to the relevant
personnel;
3.
All staff involved should be trained adequately;
4.
Identify the most appropiate lean tools and apply them according in order to eliminate wastes;
5.
If little or no improvement, revise and restart the process repeatedly until the wastes are eliminated;
6.
If wastes are eliminated, monitor the process often to ensure that the wastes do not reappear; and,
7.
Sustain the process and strive for perfection by continually removing the wastes as they appear.
The suggested strategies are slightly in agreement with Poksinska (2010) and Venugopal (2013). Poksinska (2010) 
argued that there is no single approach to adoption of lean. However, this study provided an insight into lean 
implementation, through which the medical laboratory industry can strive to improve turnaround by eliminating 
waste or non-value adding steps in their processes. 
5. Conclusions
This study investigated the enablers and barriers of lean in the medical laboratories, with a case study of the 
Namibian medical laboratory industry. Findings from the study indicated that management support plays a crucial 
role in the successful adoption of lean tools. On the other hand, lack of support from management is a cause for 
concern as it poses the strongest inhibition to the successful adoption of lean.

Lean is a useful tool for eliminating wastes or non-value adding steps in the medical laboratory processes. These 
wastes include transportation, defects, over-production, over-processing, inventory, motion and waiting. These can 
be eliminated by applying the rightful lean tools, resulting in improved efficiency, reduced wastes, while improving 
quality of patient care, cost-effectiveness and job satisfaction. In summary, this research recommends the following: 
1.
Medical laboratory personnel should be able to learn and accept culture change. This will enhance the lean
implementation;
2.
Medical laboratory staff should be well trained for best practices;
3.
The medical laboratory industry should communicate lean tools to all the laboratory staff in order to
encourage a lean culture in the industry; and,
4.
Knowledge about how lean implementation should be shared throughout the Namibian medical laboratory
industry to enhance effective application of lean tools for customer satisfaction.
Further research on the impact of lean implementation could be necessary to determine the effectiveness of lean on 
the efficiency and effectiveness of lean tools on the medical laboratory industry.

Abstract 
Lean tools are useful for identifying and eliminating (or reducing) wastes, defined in terms of 
transportation, defect, over-production, over-processing, inventory, motion and waiting. The purpose of 
this research was to investigate and analyze the adoption of or usage of lean tools, as well as their 
perceived importance, in the context of medical laboratory industry, Namibia. A descriptive, cross-
sectional, mixed study approach was used to gather data from seventy-two medical laboratory services in 
Namibia. Analysis of results showed that standard operating procedure as the most adopted tool in the 
medical laboratories, contrary to most extant studies which show that value stream mapping as the most 
frequently used lean tool in healthcare. The results also indicated that lean is commonly implemented for 
quality improvement in the industry, rather than for turnaround time improvement. In summary, the study 
revealed that lean is widely useful for eliminating wastes, in terms of transportation, defect, over-
production, over-processing, inventory, motion and waiting.

1. Introduction
Healthcare organizations are under strong pressure to improve the laboratory turnaround time. the demand for 
laboratory services has continued to rise every year, as countries increasingly require evidence based decision 
making for healthcare interventions. Oftentimes, laboratory services are tasked to address clinical diagnosis and 
interventions. Lean tools have been considered to have a significant influence on the identification and elimination 
of non-value-adding activities or steps, identified as lean wastes (Womack and Jones, 2003). Lean wastes are 
defined in terms of transportation, defect, over-production, over-processing, inventory, motion and waiting (White

commonly implemented for quality improvement in the industry, rather than for turnaround time improvement. 
Overall, lean is a useful tool for identifying and eliminating the wastes, defined in terms of transportation, defect, 
over-production, over-processing, inventory, motion and waiting. Further research may be essential to evaluate why 
lean tools are not fully utilised and incorporated into the laboratory day-to-day activities to influence the success and 
the sustainability of lean principles in the Namibian medical laboratory industry. Studies on the importance of value 
stream mapping is suggested as it the best tool for mapping and identifying loop holes in the process flow by 
identifying value adding and non-value adding activities, and allowing for corrective actions to be taken.

Abstract 
A neglected aspect of the nature of expertise and knowledge is how personnel in public procurement are 
perceived. The purpose of this paper is to examine the characteristics of procurement staff who are 
perceived to be knowledgeable and those who are not. Fifty-eight UK Ministry of Defence procurement 
function staff completed an online survey. The study shows that how procurement personnel are regarded 
by colleagues is inclined towards ascribed attributes and this paper presents a delineation of those 
attributes to allow for greater understanding. An awareness of the perceptions of others has practical 
importance for procurement personnel and managers as it allows for the better understanding of how they 
are perceived and in doing so empowers them to build on strengths and identify areas for improvement. 
The study’s originality lies in the provision of an important insight into how staff within a complex and 
usually difficult to access public sector procurement environment are perceived by their colleagues.

1. Introduction
Those that are perceived to be knowledgeable are often afforded the name ‘expert’. However, Evetts et al., (2006) 
suggest that expert and expertise are relational notions where to be an expert always means to be an expert in 
contrast to non-experts. Although Nichols (2017) dramatically describes a skepticism towards experts as ‘the death 
of expertise’, citing factors such as layperson access to the myriad of knowledge on the internet, he notes that our 
modern society cannot function without reference to and belief in them. People can act on these beliefs, for example, 
in choosing to hire the services of individuals regarded as more expert than others (Yates and Tschirhart, 2006). The 
expectation then is that personnel who are in positions where their judgment is relied upon, are knowledgeable. In 
the normal course of business hiring or promoting an individual who is regarded as knowledgeable but who is later 
found not to be might have financial consequences, but in organisations such as the United Kingdom Ministry of 
Defence (MOD) the consequences for being regarded as being knowledgeable without the reality of having such 
knowledge can be catastrophic. This has been demonstrated by high profile cases such as the loss of Nimrod XV230 
with 14 servicemen over Afghanistan in 2006 (Haddon-Cave, 2009). This then represents a neglected area of 
research, namely the perception of those who are regarded as knowledgeable and those who are not. 
The aim of this study, part of a wider study on the perception of expertise, is therefore to examine the characteristics 
of procurement staff in the MOD who are perceived to be knowledgeable and those who are not.

Abstract 
This research study was designed to evaluate the performance of foundation extended program and 
mainstream students pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering at the Tshwane 
University of Technology, eMalahleni campus, South Africa. The variables under assessment are the 
academic performance (students’ scores) in Electronics 1 for foundation (year course) and mainstream 
(semester course) levels. Data were acquired using 574 students’ scores in Electronics 1 course.  The 
students’ scores for the years 2013 and 2014 were used for the investigation. T-test statistical analysis was 
used to evaluate the results. The findings reveal that students’ performance has no significant difference 
since p>0.05. In addition, the mean score of the students in the year 2013 is better compared to 2014 
academic year. Furthermore, generally comparing the mean scores between the groups under 
investigation, it is evident that the mainstream students outperformed the foundation students. The study 
concludes that base on the findings, the continuous assessment evaluation method is not adequate for 
improving the students’ performance. It provides insight to the process of improving teaching and 
learning pattern for Electronics courses in order to improve students’ pass rate.

1. Introduction
Electronics is one of the compulsory subjects for all students enrolled for electrical engineering (EE) studies. 
Students enrolled in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment at 
the Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), South Africa either get admitted through the mainstream program or 
extended curriculum program with foundation provision (FP). The mainstream program is completed within 3 years 
(6 semesters) while FP minimum duration is three and half years. Thereafter, the students go for experiential 
learning in Electrical or Electronics engineering industries depending on their field of interest (light or heavy 
current). The experiential learning is a year program after which the students will register for BTech program to 
complete the undergraduate degree. The mainstream students normally offer Electronics 1 in semester one, 
Electronics 11 in semester two, Electronics 111 in semester 3 and Electronics 1V at BTech level. For FP students, 
Electronics 1 runs for one year before registering for Electronics 2 in semester one of second year of study, 
Electronics 111 in semester two of the second year and Electronics 1V at BTech level. To qualify for the 
mainstream admission, student must obtain an Admission Points Score (APS) of (at least) 28 in matric result with 
Mathematics, Physical Science and English as compulsory subjects. Applicants with APS between 20 and 27 with 
the compulsory subjects inclusive could be considered for FP admission. The students’ performance in electronics 1 
course has significant influence for future success in light current Engineering.

Table 7 presents hypothesis (v). It compares foundation 2013 (M=51.64, SD=13.32, t(181) = - 0.45, p=0.65>0.05) 
with mainstream 2014 (M=52.42, SD=14.28, t(181)= - 0.45, p=0.65>0.05) scores. The result shows that there is no 
significant difference between the two groups. Variance in performance score at 0.05 level of significance between 
the foundation and the mainstream Electronics 1 students is not statistically significant. Hence the null hypothesis is 
rejected. But from the mean results, it is evident that foundation students have better mean score value compare to 
the mainstream students.

Discussion and Conclusion
The t-test analysis reveals that the performance between the foundation and the mainstream students in Electronics 1 
for the period under investigation has no significant difference. For all the tests conducted, p values are greater than 
0.05 (p>0.05). The result shows that the students’ performance does not represent the connection between the 
program of study and the course content. This could be due to the students’ educational background prior to 
registering for the program or lack of interest as earlier mentioned. It may also imply in the first year of study that 
students are not yet conscious of the fact that workloads in the higher institution are more challenging as compared 
to high school workload and methods of study need to be tactically and properly planned.  
According to (Hari et al., 2016, Simpson and Fernandez, 2014), the lower mean value is better than higher mean 
value. Consequently, comparing the mean scores obtained in hypothesis (i) and (iv), both mainstream and 
foundation students’ performances are better in 2013 compare to 2014. The low performance in 2014 could be 
associated with the increased workload that the students had to undergo. For hypothesis (ii), (iii) and (v), the mean 
scores reveal that the mainstream students performed better than the foundation students. The low performance of 
the foundation students could be associated to the entering admission point scores.  In addition, the students’ 
academic background prior to admission could pay a crucial role in their performances. Furthermore, the results 
show in general that the continuous assessment evaluation method is not adequate for improving the students’ 
performance since the students’ performance did not increase as shown in our findings. Further evaluation work will 
be conducted to establish these findings.

Abstract 
 
It is important to attain an appropriate state of deployment readiness when implementing process 
innovation. That is, ensuring that deployment will run smoothly and relatively problem free. Essentially, 
deployment readiness is a feature of pre-implementation phase and it represents the state of preparedness 
for something about to happen. Of increasing interest in the literature is finding ways of achieving the 
highest degree of process innovation deployment readiness. Whilst methods of assessing deployment 
readiness are emerging, the influence of flexibility on deployment readiness is yet to be ascertained. This 
paper focuses on the influence of flexibility on readiness to deploy process innovation in manufacturing. In 
particular, the emphasis is on how flexibility mediates deployment plans for implementing manufacturing 
process innovation. Deployment plan is conceptualised as the approach, scope, and execution planned for 
the deployment of an innovation initiative.  The interrelationships of flexibility and deployment plans is 
studied using simulation of a job shop with routing flexibility and results show that deployment plan is 
significant to innovation deployment readiness performance and its significance is moderated by flexibility.

1. Introduction 
 
In increasingly competitive global markets, manufacturing companies are looking towards flexibility and innovation 
amongst others to achieve their desired goals. Innovation is now widely accepted as a condition for survival in 
manufacturing (Cefis and Marsili, 2006; Gonçalves Silveira Fiates et al., 2010; Maier et al., 2014; Naji al., 2016). 
Ability to compete over time is now not only determined by efficiency increases but with appropriate capacity to 
simultaneously innovate (Abernathy, 1978; Stalk and Hout, 1990; Park et al., 2014). Continuous innovation alongside 
productivity improvements has therefore come to the fore. There are several definitions of continuous innovation (e.g. 
Teece and Pisano’s, 1994; Teece et al, 1997; Soosay, 2005; Davison & Hyland, 2006); central to the definitions are 
ideas of ‘timely responsiveness, rapid product and process innovation’.   
 
Product innovation, process innovation, and a combination of the two are fundamental dimensions of innovation in 
manufacturing. Product innovation entails creating and introducing goods and services that are either new or offers 
substantial improvement to previous versions. Process innovation is the implementation of a new or significantly 
improved production or delivery method, including significant changes in techniques, machines and/or application 
software. Process innovation has been compared with product innovation and the relations between them well studied. 
As in product innovation, implementation methodology and acceptance is central to successful delivery of innovation 
initiatives.  
 
Continuous innovation and manufacturing flexibility are intrinsically linked.  Innovation offers manufacturing 
companies mechanisms for adapting to demands of dynamic environments (Hurley & Hult, 1998). Manufacturing 
flexibility complements with ability to respond effectively to changing circumstances and to better handle a wider 
range of possibilities under uncertainty (Gerwin, 1987).  Manufacturing flexibility is a capability of manufacturing 
companies to deploy and redeploy its resources effectively in response to changing situations (Gerwin 1993).","Proceedings of the 2017 International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

tardiness is lower under deployment Plan A compared to no deployment for the no flexibility configuration. This 
performance result is reversed with increased flexibility. This indicates that flexibility can mediate the influence of 
deployment plans on implementation performance.  
 
Table 3. Deployment Readiness Values  
 
 
With no flexibility, tardiness is more spread compared with medium and flexibilities under the two deployment plans. 
The spread of tardiness overtime is much reduced for deployment Plan B compared with deployment Plan A.  Which 
also accounts for the deployment readiness values shown in Table 4. Having a less spread out tardiness values is 
ordinarily good particularly of jobs are of relatives equal in value.  
 
 
5. Conclusions and Future Work 
 
Getting prepared for deployment is an important step when implementing manufacturing process innovation. The 
level of preparedness, captured through measures of deployment readiness index, is a useful indicator for managing 
implementation of process innovation. There are several factors than can influence deployment readiness and they 
include the deployment plan and manufacturing flexibility. This paper focused on these two factors and found that 
flexibility can influence deployment readiness. In addition, flexibility is found to mediate the impact of deployment 
plan quality on deployment readiness. These results were obtained based on computer simulation of a job shop and 
for a specific routing rule FCFS. Areas of future work should look more closely at the role of manufacturing flexibility 
more generally such as flexibilities other than routine flexibility, the criticality of machines and jobs, the effect of 
alternative rules of routing jobs to the alternative machine's queue and other range of performance measures beyond 
service level performance. Work is also required in validating and extending the findings to other types and 
manufacturing processes and environments.

Abstract 
Decision makers are often faced with the problem of grouping inventory into categories for cost-effective 
and efficient management and control of inventory. The classical ABC inventory analysis has been 
applied widely in industry. However, the approach is associated with practical limitations: the desired 
service level and budget allocation constraints are not considered simultaneously, there is no guarantee 
for optimal solutions, and qualitative decision criteria are not modelled explicitly. It is desirable to 
develop models that can capture quantitative and qualitative criteria, from a multi-criteria optimization 
view point. In light of these limitations, the purpose of this research is to model the inventory grouping 
problem using grouping genetic algorithms approach. We first assess the grouping structure of the 
inventory classification problem, and then model the grouping problem from the grouping genetic 
algorithm perspective. Further research prospects and applications are evaluated and presented.

1. Introduction
In almost all sectors of the industry, such as manufacturing, automotive, healthcare and retail, sufficient inventory of 
items need to be maintained. Oftentimes, the number of items or stock-keeping units (SKUs) becomes too big to 
manage effectively. In such cases, the most practical approach is to classify, manage and control the items in groups, 
rather than individually (Ernst and Cohen, 1990; Millstein et al., 2014). Ultimately, the process of managing and 
control of groups of inventory will be more cost-effective since this will reduce the overhead of managing individual 
groups. 
A few inventory grouping approaches have been presented in the literature (Erns and Cohen, 1990; Korevaar et al., 
2007; Teunter et al., 2010). One of the most widely applied inventory grouping method is the ABC grouping 
approach (Guvenir and Erel, 1998; Millstein et al., 2014). The approach classifies inventory according to their 
transaction volumes or value, so that the top 20% are classified as A-items, followed by the next 30% of items in the 
B class, and the rest in the C-class (Pareto, 1971; Juran, 1954). Other clustering percentages have also been applied 
in the literature (Juran, 1954). The classical ABC approach, however, does not give a clear guideline on the 
optimization of the service level, and optimal decisions are usually not achievable (Millstein et al., 2014). Ernst and 
Cohen (1990) suggested a two-stage procedure with a blend of optimization and statistical clustering techniques. 
Korevaar et al. (2007) presented a non-linear optimization model for optimizing the inventory budget. Recently,

As with the crossover operator, the group mutation should work with groups, and not individual items (Falkenauer, 
1994; Mutingi and Mbohwa, 2016). There are three possible procedures for executing group mutation: (i) by 
creating new groups, (ii) by eliminating some selected groups, and (iii) by shuffling a few selected items among the 
groups. In practice, computational implementation depends on the problem domain that is to be solved. Domain 
specific constructive heuristics may also be utilized. 
4.4 Inversion 
The purpose of this operator is to facilitate transmission of good schemata from parents to offspring in order to 
ensure increased rate of sampling of better performing schemata (Mutingi and Mbohwa, 2016). The mutation 
operator works by overturning the order of groups between two points in a randomly selected chromosome. To 
illustrate, assume that we are given chromosome [A B C D] and two points are selected as shown below. Then the 
chromosome,  
[A |B C D| ]  
could be inverted to: 
[A D C B], 
Assuming that it is known that it is more desirable to have A and D closer together, then this increases the 
probability of transmitting both groups (genes) A and D together into the next generation when the next crossover is 
performed. 
5. Concluding Remarks and Further Research
The GGA approach has is the only evolutionary algorithm that has been refined to especially model grouping 
problems by taking advantage of the grouping structure of the problems. The algorithm can be adapted to a wide 
range of grouping problems (Mutingi and Mbohwa, 2016). In this paper, it was observed that the ABC inventory 
classification problem is a grouping problem whose grouping structure can be modelled using grouping algorithm 
approaches. As a result, we proposed and presented a GGA methodology for addressing the inventory classification 
problem with a wide range of possible groups, and from a multi-criteria perspective. In summary, the proposed 
approach has the following advantages: 
1.
GGA approach uses an efficient group encoding scheme which avoids time-consuming redundancies in the
chromosomes, which helps to improve the efficiency of the algorithm;
2.
GGA avoids adverse disruption of essential information encoded in the groups of each chromosome,
thereby improving the effectiveness of the algorithm;
3.
GGA can easily model and optimize the number of groups by searching over a wide range of possible
group sizes, which gives the decision maker a wider search than is possible with previous approaches; and,
4.
GGA can model inventory classification problems based on multiple criteria, including, number of groups;
assignment of items, service level for each group; and budget allocation to groups of items.
Further research is envisaged to involve numerical experimentation based on benchmarks as well as case studies to 
be gathered from literature. Comparative analysis will be beneficial in proving the efficiency of the proposed GGA 
approach to inventory classification problem.

Abstract 
Female students in engineering programs are still fewer in number in contrast to male counterparts 
offering same courses after years of professional integration and learning convergence. Currently, in the 
focal group under exploration, only 28% of students at the faculty of engineering are females, which 
indicate a wide gap between male and female students within this faculty. The study focus is on 
identifying challenges which female students experience while studying engineering programs. This is 
imperative because engineering programs are now less gender selective and it is needful to identify the 
challenges female students are griping with in order to proffer solutions that will assist the students go 
through their studies with ease. To identify this problem, a quantitative research approach was taken and 
data was harnessed from registered female students within the faculty using questionnaires. The results of 
the study reveals that lack of funding support, inadequate academic mentorship, and peer pressure 
constitute some of the challenges experienced by female students in engineering faculty. The research 
outcome is useful as it provides data to guide management in taking informed decision that will address 
the low intake and number of female student drop out from the engineering faculty.

1. Introduction
The society today is engineering and technology based and the quality of life of the people is directly or indirectly 
related to the quality and level of technical education in vogue. Engineering and Technology are the terms used 
nowadays in almost all aspects of life from the making of a needle to the manufacture of an space craft. In this 
progressively shifting world, the human need and services revolve around the engineering and technologies. For the 
economic and industrial growth of any developing country one of the very important aspects is the progress in the 
field of engineering and technology. Technical education are playing a major role to the overall education system 
and also playing a vital role in the social and economic development of the counties. Today’s engineering graduates 
will have to resolve tomorrow’s problems in a world that is, as never before, progresses much more rapidly, and 
facing on its way, new, critical challenges (Madara and Cherotich, 2016). To cater the various aspects of engineering 
and technological development, social and economic progress technical education is imparted  from craftsmanship 
level, diploma, degree, post graduate degree to research degree in specialized fields. Several publications have

Q6 
Are you on funding? 
There are forty-four (53%) students who indicated that they obtained loan from National Student Financial 
Aid Scheme (NSFAS). The scheme aim at transforming NSFAS into an efficient and effective provider of financial 
aid to students from poor and working class families in a sustainable manner that promotes access to, and success in, 
higher and further education and training, in pursuit of South Africa’s national and human resource development 
goals. Students who study with the loan will have to refund 50% of the loan obtained when they start working after 
graduation. Majority of students in South Africa depend on this loan for their University education. In 2017, many 
students struggled to get the loan but few students are opportune to get the loan. In addition, 4 students’ indicated 
that they got bursary from Gauteng City Region Academy to pay for their academic expenses for the year.  The 
remaining students have their fees paid by their family members. The lack of funding is a big challenge for the 
students and this has resulted in some students withdrawing from school.  
Q7 
Do you have academic mentor? 
Students’ responses to this question indicated that most students don’t have mentors. From the responses, 
66 (80%) of the students have no mentor, 8 (10%) indicated that they have mentors. The remaining students gave no 
response, which can be interpreted that they do not have mentors.  
Q8 
Are you being affected by peer pressure? 
The responses retrieved from the questionnaires show that 62 (75%) students are not affected by peer pressure, 11 
(13%) are influenced by peer pressure while the remaining students gave no response. 
4.
Conclusion
This study doesn’t sketch a detailed and polished portrait creates of the female engineering learning experience but 
provides a rough sketch, using a variety of research methods and relying on the female students own words for much 
of the data. Questionnaires related to the challenges faced by female students in engineering education were 
distributed to the batch of 2017 academic year. Evaluation has been done utilizing quantitate method in which 
patterns, themes and categories are examined but focus not on replication. Total of 82 random sampled questions 
were taken. The questions were based on the information about the age, family background, their learning 
experiences in a male dominated department, peer pressure and their financial challenges 
Based on the finidings it is found the maximum numbers of students are between the age group 15-19 only two 
students were above the age 30. Maximum parents have studied till matric and are employed. It is also found that 40 
parents live in rural area and 38 lives in urban area while 5 students gave no answer. Around 53% of the students has 
obtained loan from National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). The remaining students have to pay their fees. 
The lack of funding is a big challenge for the students and this has resulted in some students withdrawing from 
school. Based on the findings, it is also found, that the female students, faced numerous gender-related challenges 
and peer pressure, even of the students have no mentor in academic.  
Although currently Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), has 28% of the female students there is still need for 
much more females in engineering in order to satisfy ever-growing demand for gender-balanced engineering 
workforce. Diversity of the student body at academic institutions has immediate economic benefits. In an age where 
many academic institutions compete for enrolments, in particularly in engineering, not drawing on the pool of 
women, for example, reduces revenue. Equity, however, does not just mean an equal number of women and men; it 
means equal chances of success and career opportunities and development. 
The study, however, attempted to contribute, in its small way, to the knowledge of difficulties of women in 
engineering education. Women are naturally creative and engineering is creative too, Women bring a much desirable 
and exceptional zest to engineering and therefore they should be supported, motivated, protected, respected, 
appreciated, and promoted.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the attitudes and perceptions of employees towards Six Sigma 
implementation to improve quality in an electric cable manufacturing company. The study followed 
a qualitative research approach utilising interviews, observations, and document review. The study 
focused on shop floor employees, supervisors and production managers and was constrained to ten 
participants to elicit in-depth information. The findings revealed that the majority of the respondents felt 
that there is lack of support by management for quality within the organisation. Negative attitude towards 
quality cascading from management to shop floor workers, was the second most frequent theme that 
surfaced, followed by lack of communication and feedback. The majority of respondents however, 
showed understanding of quality concepts. Based on the findings, the study concluded that lack of 
management support, norms and values that are not aligned to a quality culture, and leadership that 
does not infuse corporation with employees, were the causes of poor quality at ABC Electric. It was 
recommended that a vigorous training program, management support, a change of attitude, teamwork 
were important antecedents to successful six sigma implementation. A paradigm shift to a quality centred 
culture for the entire organization through leadership commitment is necessary.

•
Quality management is well understood by both employees and managers at ABC.  Both Managers and shop
floor workers are aware of six sigma and ISO 9001 quality management frameworks and the requirements
that ensure production of quality products.
•
Employees at ABC understand that monitoring and control are an essential component for effective operation
of processes and their improvement. This is essential for implementation of a quality improvement
programme such as six sigma.
Research question 2: What gaps exist within ABC’s quality management framework that could be closed 
through adoption of six sigma? 
•
Management does not provide the necessary resources to assist employees solve quality problems. Without
quality tools to collect and analyze data, process performance cannot be improved. Root causes of quality
problems cannot be identified.  The execution of the Six Sigma methodology secures buy-in from top
management in order to succeed.
•
There is no proper documentation in place. Defective products are passed down to subsequent processes
without documentation resulting in high failure and scrap rates.
•
Management is not committed to education and training of its workforce. Training is both selective and
seldom. Six sigma requires that training be provided to all levels of the organization in line with the belt
system. Employees have to cope with challenges of learning e.g. statistics
•
ABC Electric’s organizational structure is bureaucratic. Information does not flow down to employees due
to the many layers of management. Customer satisfaction and feedback information are not communicated
to the employees. Lack of quality meetings and quality meeting area are cardinal to culture that is not quality
focused.
Research question 3: What values and norms contribute to the culture within ABC and how does it impact on 
management of quality? 
•
A quality culture is non-existent at ABC Electric. This is demonstrated by the shift of focus by management
from quality to meeting deadlines when due dates approach. Managers at ABC perpetuate poor quality within
the value chain by allowing defective products to continue to downstream processes. Culture comes out of
shared behaviours and the working relationships of organisation members developed over time.
•
The absence of a quality oriented culture in ABC Electric is clearly demonstrated by lack of support among
fellow employees, employees pass down defective products to fellow workers at next processes.
•
There is also no accountability for quality of work within the organization. Operators feel that quality
management is the responsibility of process technicians, who in turn think that it is the role of the quality
department. This ambiguity of roles and responsibility which causes uncertainty is not in line with a quality
focused culture. In a quality focused organizational culture, quality is everybody’s responsibility, each being
responsible for the quality own work.
•
The leadership style at ABC is transactional oriented. Transactional leadership promotes compliance rather
than corporation among workers. In corporation leaders work with subordinates to identify needed change.
Managers at ABC Electric make changes without informing shop floor workers and this has resulted in
adversarial relationships and resistance to change. In implementation Six Sigma projects top managers have
to be hands-on with pinnacle management, eagerness and involvement in providing required resources.
Based on the findings of this research study, it is recommended that ABC Electric implement Six Sigma to address 
the quality problems and reduce failures. There already exists an understanding and appreciation of quality concepts 
within ABC Electric’s managers and employees which can be leveraged for successful implementation of Six 
Sigma. The understanding most probably stems from the implementation of ISO 9001 which unfortunately has not 
been maintained resulting in the company not realizing its benefits.  
Based on the conclusions to the findings the following were the recommendations: 
•
ABC Electric should embark on a company-wide training programme. The training should cascade from top
management to shop floor workers in line with the Six Sigma belt system. Investing in training will also

enable the organization to implement total productive maintenance. Investment in new technology and 
machines is recommended in the long run. 
•
ABC Electric should flatten its organizational structure through development of a team based organization.
Teamwork fosters accountability, responsibility, and ownership among other benefits. A flattened
organizational structure will remove bureaucracy and result in improved communication.
•
ISO 9001 must be applied vigorously throughout the entire organization so as to assist in managing the
business improvement initiative of six sigma. Compliance to the requirements of ISO 9001 will set the
foundation for the implementation of the six sigma methodology while six sigma will provide the necessary
tools for process control resulting in the effective operation of the ISO 9001 quality management system.
Hence the two will complement each other.

Effective Performance Analysis of Industrial Robotics for 
Automated Manufacturing System 
 
Abstract 
 
This paper is completed on a study for industrial robotics work unit, in which, continue to grow in 
the manufacturing world and across industry. While those are efficiently very useful, industrial 
robots require an initial capital investment, and take training to be able to operate for setting up 
the optimal performance in terms of capacity providing rate of the cycle time. With a controlled 
working environment, industrial robots can repeat tasks time after time providing the effective 
cycle times with an ignorable difference unless the conditions being uncontrollable. In this 
research work, a set of empirical experimentation is done using a 2k full factorial DOE, with 2 
factors affecting 2 responses. The factors are the type and speed of robotic programing termination, 
while the responses are cycle time and consistency as variables for the effective performance. The 
analysis shows that the factor FINE (termination type) at 100% (speed) yielded the best results for 
cycle time and CNT (termination type) at 100% (speed) yielded the best consistency of the robotics 
program.

Observing the consistency interaction plot, Figure 6, a crossing path can be seen when both factors are at 
the upper levels (1). Therefore, a significant effect is played on the consistency with the interaction of Speed 
and Termination Type. The interaction plot for cycle time shows extreme parallelism, meaning that there 
is no interaction and it can be concluded that the interaction of Speed and Termination Type does have a 
significant effect on Cycle time. 
 
The main effects chart shows the difference the factor levels show compared to the mean. The 
dotted line represents the mean of the study. Therefore, with that being said it can be seen in Figure 5, that 
both factor A and B have a step diagonal line, denoting that they have an effect in the outcome of the 
consistency between the factor levels. The 100% Speed shows better consistency deviation measurements 
(lower) than 50% speed. Termination Type CNT0, shows better consistency deviation measurements 
(lower) than FINE termination type. Figure 7, is studying the main effects factor A and B have on cycle 
time. Factor of speed should obviously play a large effect on cycle time and you can see that with the step 
diagonal line for factor A in the Figure 7. Speed of 100% yields a better cycle time than speed at 50%. 
However, there is little to no diagonal line for factor B (termination type) in the Figure 7 concluding that 
termination type does not play a large effect on cycle time outcomes.

Conclusion and Recommendation 
 
Through testing the different parameters offered while programming industrial robots, there can be 
a few conclusions made about the different effects the parameters will have regarding cycle time and 
consistency. If industrial engineers are most worried about cycle time, then they should have the settings 
up at FINE for termination type, and the speed should be set at 100% of maximum speed. While if the 
engineers are most worried about consistency of the path the robot will be following, they should use the 
CNT0 setting for termination type, and the speed should be set at 100% of maximum speed. This was what 
was found to be the best in the experimentation with this particular equipment of; FANUC LR-Mate 200 
iB, industrial robots. However, with different robotic programs it may have different results.  
 
As previously stated, the interaction of termination type and speed had no statistical significance 
when using cycle time as a response, but the interaction did indeed have statistical significance when using 
consistency as a response. Each factor individually did play a statistically significant effect on the results 
for both responses. This is incredibly useful moving forward with other experiments, because now it is clear 
that researchers do not need to worry about how the combination of the factors and how they might interact

with each other when trying to achieve the fastest cycle time possible, instead they need only to worry about 
each factor individually. This simplifies programming immensely, because it takes away one more variable 
from programming the robot. If the engineers are focused on the consistency of the program, then they must 
take into account that there is an interaction happening between speed and termination type. Moving 
forward, it is recommended to test different designs to draw with the robot, with varying amount of points. 
Such as draw an “S” or an “R” sets of leading points because both of these scenarios entail using curvature, 
and the termination type would have a far greater effect on the results gathered. It is also recommended to 
run more iterations of the experiment to gather more data, doing so will lead to more normalized data and 
more confidence in the ability to generalize the conclusions from the experiment in terms of relying on 
empirical optimization.

Abstract 
This work describes the strategy of a Mexican firm to improve its transportation cost of unused truck capacity. This 
is based on the application of a transportation waste elimination scheme for increasing efficiency in its warehousing 
and routing operations on a detailed level. The Operational Equipment Effectiveness index used in TPM is adapted 
to be used as the main performance measure. Availability, performance and quality wastes are identified using 
Value Stream Mapping of the distribution operations. The implementation of the improvement initiatives is still in 
progress but pilot test and projected results are provided. 
Keywords:  
Transportation waste elimination, lean routing, value stream map, transportation efficiency, vehicle routing problem 
1. Introduction
The problem of concern in this paper is the reduction of transportation cost. This problem has been treated exhaustively in the 
academic literature. Two approaches have been used to the goal of reducing transportation cost; the mathematical modelling 
approach and the efficiency improvement approach. Under the first approach several classical problems have been utilized: 
The Vehicle Routing problem, the Transportation problem and others. These models have the objective of minimizing cost, 
time or distance. The efficiency improvement approach is based on the idea of eliminating waste. This work provides a brief 
description of the application of the efficiency improvement approach.
The scheme is applied to the distribution operations of one of the leading steel Mexican conglomerates located in the 
northeastern region of the country. The company is experiencing an important level of transportation cost originated by an 
important level of unused truck capacity (CUTC). Thus, the management of the company developed a strategy for reducing 
this cost concept by identifying and eliminating waste in its logistics operations. In fact, as it will be further discussed, Simmons 
et al., (2004) and Villarreal (2012) point out that unused truck capacity is one of the main wastes that determine the level of 
performance efficiency. 
This report consists of five sections. The next section deals with a brief review of the literature on lean transportation. Then, 
a description of the scheme utilized to decrease waste is described in section 3. The application of this scheme is undertaken in 
section 4, and section 5 presents a summary of conclusions. 
2. Previous research
The improvement of transport operations has been traditionally approached with the use of mathematical modelling, 
operations research, and simulation methods (Sternberg et al., 2013). Under these, several classical transportation problems

The consolidation process starts with the selection of states with a Distribution Center (DC) located in it. Then, all the DC 
orders and those of the customers located in the state that contain steel coils are identified. Next, full truck load shipments are 
formed with the coils and other light material ordered. This process continues considering first DC orders and then customer 
orders until no coils are available. The previous process is repeated, but now the steel coils are substituted by stripes. Finally, 
the process of consolidation is continued with the rest of the available materials not assigned. 
As part of this initiative, several important customers (in terms of their demand volume, order consistency and frequency) 
were identified. Among these are: Invacare Corporation in Reynosa, Whirlpool International in Ramos Arizpe, Controladora 
MABE in Celaya, Controladora MABE in Saltillo, and Formex Automotive Industries in Ramos Arizpe. Daily dedicated 
transportation circuits with consolidated deliveries were designed for them. In some cases, the re-design of platforms or 
containers were required to accommodate more material as shown in Figure 5. All the previous initiatives have been 
implemented in pilot projects with very important results. Therefore, the firm has already determined to continue their full 
implementation throughout the rest of the facilities during year 2016. 
3.4.3 Transportation management system 
Since most of the initiatives are inter-dependent and require centralized customer, transport supplier and facility information. 
The firm decided to undertake a company-wide project for automatizing a centralized delivery planning and control system to 
be designed and implemented in year 2016. 
4. Conclusions and results
This work provides a brief description of the application of the efficiency improvement approach to the distribution operations
of one of the leading steel Mexican conglomerates. The company is experiencing an important level of transportation cost
originated by an important level of unused truck capacity (CUTC). Thus, the management of the company developed a strategy
for reducing this cost concept by identifying and eliminating waste in its logistics operations.
The two most important wastes found correspond to a Fill Loss and waiting for loading and loading time in excess. Fill loss 
has an important impact on CUTC through the quantity or volume component of the concept. The waiting for loading and 
loading time in excess affects CUTC by determining the extra charge of the freight rate for the delivery. The improvement 
strategy developed is still in process. Figure 6 describes the behavior of CUTC before and after implementing the strategy. The 
current level of CUTC is 14 Mexican pesos per ton, 75% lower than the average from Jan – Jun, 2015. It is expected that this 
level will be at 8 Mexican pesos per ton after full implementation of the strategy.

Abstract  
Since the global emergence of low cost carriers (LCC) in airline industry, shift of business is observed. 
LCC are gaining more market share as compared to conventional airlines known as full service carriers 
(FSC). LCC manage to cut costs by cutting extra services and make it possible for passengers to travel on 
much lower cost. Introduction of LCC has brought change in airline industry throughout the world; 
similarly it has emerged in South Korea as well. This paper performs competition analysis on South 
Korean Airlines using Lotka-Volterra (LV) model, examines and discusses the effect of emergence of 
LCC on FSC. LV model is also used for forecast.

1. Introduction
Since the global emergence of low cost carriers (LCC) in airline industry, shift of business is observed. LCC are 
gaining more market share as compared to conventional airlines. Conventional airlines also called Full service 
carriers (FSC) are service focused, on the other hand low cost carriers focus on low cost. LCC manage to cut costs 
by cutting extra services and make it possible for passengers to travel on much lower cost. FSC provide customized 
services like routes, class of cabins, infant services, and airports while LCC has standardized the services like routes, 
cabin class, airports and even aircrafts. Introduction of LCC has brought change in airline industry throughout the 
world; similarly it has emerged in South Korea as well. Previously, South Korean airline industry was ruled by two 
major airlines; however, there operate about eight different airlines now. This paper tries to analyze the competition 
between FSC and LCC of South Korea. South Korean air industry has grown up immensely and there are several 
domestic routes, but this paper intends to consider a competition analysis on just one route between Seoul, the 
capital of South Korea, and Jeju Island. Korean Air (KAL) and Asiana Airlines (AAR) are operating since 1962 and 
1988 respectively and are considered to be the giants of South Korean airline industry. After the emergence of AAR 
in 1988, T’way Airlines was the first airline entered in South Korean airline industry in 2004 with a gap of sixteen 
years. From 2004 to 2016, five more airlines Jin Air (JNA), Jeju Air (JJA), Easter Jet (ESR), Air Seoul (ASV) and 
Air Busan (ABL) have entered the industry, as presented in Table.1. This paper performs competition analysis on

5. Conclusion and Limitation
Applying LV competition model on LCC and FSC of South Korean airline industry reveals interesting competition 
dynamics. Emergence of LCC has intensified the environment of competition. Both the FSC are affected by the 
emergence of LCC. Competition dynamics of FSC with each other as well as with LCC may change with the 
passage of time depends upon action and reaction of airlines. Overall it is observed that customer focused business 
policies lost to cost focused business policies in terms of market shares. Results reveal that there exists a competition 
between LCC and FSC but only up-to a certain level; because LCC has set its own market and low costs have 
encouraged new passengers to travel. Results also show that AAR responded earlier to the emergence of LCC than 
KAL. LV model can be applied to furnish an efficient forecast.
There are a couple of limitations to the study, first the LV analysis is applied for Jeju Island travelers and overall 
trend of South Korean Airline Industry may be different or even different type of relationships may exist on 
different routes. Secondly, there may be several external factors which are not considered in this model. Authors are 
working to overcome the limitations.

Abstract 
In order to analyze the way residential sector energy is consumed putting into consideration certain factors, 
this study predicted the United States residential sector energy consumption from 1984 to 2010. The factors 
having impact on the way energy is consumed were assessed using the connection weight approach while 
the energy is being predicted. Artificial Neural Network was successfully applied in the prediction with a 
correlation coefficient of 0.97903. It was observed that the median household income was the most 
important factor in the consumption of residential sector energy consumption with a percentage of 93% 
followed by household size and cost of residential natural gas with 90% and 56.5% respectively while 
resident population was the least important factor followed by cost of residential heating oil, gross domestic 
product and cost of electricity in percentages of -76%, -51%, -30.5%, and 18% respectively.

1. Introduction
Energy consumed in the residential sector has a very complex as well as inter-related characteristics (Belaid, 2016). 
The residential sector has a large portion of consumed energy globally, and for that, remains a target for consumption 
of energy efforts (Swan and Ugursal, 2009). Everyday activities require accessibility and use of energy serving as pre-
requisite for fundamental needs (Sovacool et al., 2014).The level of energy consumed by a building in any country is 
very specific to the country’s economic and social indicators in the likes of country’s income and the stage of 
urbanization (IEA, 2010). Residential sector records 16 – 50% of total energy consumption in nearly all countries 
(Saidur et al., 2007). This gives rise to increase in emitted GHGs (Ahmed et al., 2015). (Belaid, 2016) identified 
residential building sector as one of the most cost-effective sectors that can greatly cut down the amount of energy 
consumed and also mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in France. This statement however is true across the 
globe. 
The amount of energy consumed domestically depends on country, weather and building type. As much as these 
factors are the same, variation in consumption still occurs by virtue of pattern of occupancy and inhabitant’s lifestyle 
(Ellsworth-Krebs et al., 2015). Determining the inputs of those factors responsible for the residential energy consumed 
can serve as a guide to decisions made by policy makers. Among the countries, the developed tend to consume more 
as compared to developing (IEA, 2010). However, the urban settlements of the developed countries tend to consume 
less energy per capita as compared to their rural counterparts. Reason for this can be attributed to district heating in 
higher-density areas, low transportation-related energy use, among other factors. On the other hand, the reverse is the 
case with developing countries (IEA, 2010).

During simulation, some weights were generated for both the input and output data as explained by equation 1. These 
weights are known as the connection weights generated, as can be seen in their evaluation in Table 2. From Table 2, 
it can be said that median household income input was the most important factor when it comes to residential sector 
energy consumption next to household size input, with very high percentages of 93% and 90% respectively whereas 
resident population input was the least important factor next to cost of residential heating oil input.

4. Conclusion
This study as compared to the study of (Kiralashaki and Reisel, 2013), used all the available inputs to predict accurately 
the amount of residential sector energy consumed in the United States. (Kiralashaki and Reisel, 2013) selected the 
inputs separately for three different ANN models, the first model considered GDP and cost of residential electricity, 
the second model considered GDP, median household income and cost of residential electricity while the third 
considered GDP, median household income, cost of residential electricity and cost of residential heating oil. From this 
present study, it can be said that all factors were able to predict the residential energy consumption successfully, 
however, the most important factors are the median household income followed by the household size, next to the cost 
of residential natural gas. From this present study carried out it can be said that the income received by household says 
a lot in the amount of energy consumed which was recognized in two models of the previous studies, however, 
household size as well as cost of residential natural gas were not selected as inputs in either of the three models. Based 
on the household income, it determines the type of household gadgets the family could afford as well as the energy 
efficient gadgets. The amount of individuals residing in a home based on their behavioral pattern will also affect how 
energy is being consumed, either efficiently or inefficiently. The United States residential sector case study gives a 
clearer view of how these factors do contribute to the energy consumed between 1984 and 2010. It is very important 
that the three key contributing factors identified in this study be attended to in ways that could assist in the conservation 
of energy consumed in the residential sectors.

Abstract 
The objective of this study is in the assessment of residential sectors use of energy through a benchmarking 
methodology taking the years of consumption as the decision unit. It further assesses the effect of each of 
the independent variables responsible for each year’s residential energy consumption known as sensitivity 
analysis. To achieve the following objectives, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was employed. The study 
considered the United States residential sector data from 1984 to 2010, with residential population, gross 
domestic product, household size, median household income, cost of residential electricity, cost of 
residential natural gas and cost of residential heating oil as inputs while the energy consumed was the 
output. The study found out that the year 1996 proved the most efficient while gross domestic product 
proved important in the way energy needs to be consumed efficiently.

1. Introduction
The role of electricity in the lives of members of the modern society is regarded crucial (Liu et al., 2010). As reported 
by (ACEEE, 2014) (American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy) in the publication ‘International Energy 
Efficiency Scorecard’, : ‘countries can preserve their resources, address global warming, stabilize their economies, 
and reduce the costs of their economic outputs by using energy more efficiently – an eminently achievable goal.’ 
Everyday activities require accessibility and use of energy serving as pre-requisite for fundamental needs (Sovacool 
et al., 2014). Human lives tend to improve drastically when energy is there to be consumed especially in various 
homes. The mind is enlightened, as well as activities are improved. Some may say disagree that this increase is to the 
detriments of the society. This is left to be debated on another platform. Increased energy use gives global emission 
rise concerns (Longo et al., 2015). Residential sector has not been an exception to this emission. Developing a 
systematic approach in the assessment of energy management of a building can increase its performance (Yu and 
Chan, 2012) especially in the way energy is consumed and ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Evaluating 
the way energy could be efficiently used in guiding sustainable development has led to various propositions of energy 
demand management techniques for the past decade (Li and Tao, 2017). When it comes to evaluation, benchmarking 
approaches have been ideal.  
Both simulation and data-driven techniques have been proved as benchmarking techniques, however, data-driven has 
the ability to evaluate a huge amount of multiple parameters (Wang et al., 2015). It can be said that among the 
challenges associated with benchmarking is the ability to deal with various parameters attributed to the objective 
performance (Wang et al., 2015). Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has successfully proven to be ideal in such 
circumstances. There are no prior functional assumptions required when DEA is employed as multiple inputs and

4. Conclusion
Benchmarking is very important to see how improvement could be implemented on areas where there is lack of 
attaining the objective set for a particular goal. This study considered data envelopment analysis in the best way to 
benchmark how residential sectors energy could be consumed. The United States data from 1984 to 2010 was used a 
s the case study. Apart from the way energy could be efficiently used, sensitivity analysis was also conducted by 
omitting one of the inputs in separate combinations of the remaining inputs.  
From the result of the operational efficiencies, year 1996 proved very efficient as DMUs 1990, 1991, 1994, 1997 and 
2001 would have being very efficient in the consumption of energy if only the way of operations in 1996 was emulated. 
Policies governing the year 1996 would also be advised to have been practiced in those years especially in the years 
1997 and 2001 after experiencing the way 1996 performed. It has also been realized that the cost of residential 
electricity consumption should not be the focus when the remaining inputs are considered as without the cost of 
electricity, ways to minimize the energy consumed in the residential sector could be achieved. Gross domestic product 
on the other hand has proved to be important factor when considering the way our residential sector energy is 
consumed. It is assumed that the increase in a country’s energy consumption there will be growth in the country’s 
economy in essence the economy would increase. The misconception in this ideology is that if a lot of energy is 
consumed inefficiently it will also have a setback on the growth of the economy. The economy can only gain advantage 
if the way energy consumed is done efficiently.

Abstract 
Energy continues to play a significant role in human lives. Among the indicators that have a major part to 
play in the consumption of energy is intensity factor. Considering the influence of intensity on energy 
consumption; its reduction will go a long way in promoting the sustenance of energy supply both locally 
and internationally. Many activities have been investigated upon that can assist in its reduction. These 
activities include research and development (R&D), introduction of foreign technology and domestic 
technology transfer driven activities.  This study aims to evaluate these activities with the focus on 
minimizing energy consumption. A designed integrated model (artificial neural network and data 
envelopment analysis) that can be used in this regard is established. With South Africa as a case study, the 
model identified much concentration on foreign technology transfer as a means of energy reduction.

1. Introduction
Energy continues to play a significant role in human lives. For this reason, the world is taking the responsibility to map 
out a decisive process on improving infrastructures needed to obtain the required energy for efficient supply and to 
attain the economic output growth. Energy remains significant because of the energy and economic development 
interdependence. The dynamics of energy and economy present unique challenges to the present and future generations. 
Among the indicators that have a major part to play in the consumption of energy is intensity factor. Considering the 
influence of intensity on energy consumption; its reduction will go a long way in promoting the sustenance of energy 
supply both locally and internationally. Technology transfers, both foreign and domestic with Research and 
Development (R&D) are activities that can rise to the world energy challenges in the regard of its reduction. These 
activities (independent activities) will help achieve the phenomenon of intensity reduction. The main goal of 
investments in R&D, innovation, and new technologies is to have an improvement in energy usage and reduction of 
carbon emitted as it maintains or enhances countries and sectors economic performance (Lanzi, 2013).
Technology transfer refers to the management of process used to convey technology from a developer to a user, as 
defined by (Lulu et al., 1996). Some energy technologies that could contribute to achieving a much lower carbon 
intensity of the energy sector are still expensive (Lanzi, 2013) and yet to find their ways to the market. Results would 
be more easily achievable if there are transfers of these technologies. After the first oil shock, emphasis leaned towards 
R&D (Soriano and Mulatero, 2011). R&D activities are the engine of technological development (Garrone and Grilli, 
2010, Olanrewaju and Jimoh, 2014). These activities have in part directed towards developing energy efficient 
technology (Olanrewaju and Jimoh, 2014, Henriksson et al., 2012).

5. Conclusion
This paper introduces technology transfers and R&D activities as factors which are critical in deciding the optimal use 
of energy. These activities are quantified to show their level of importance on energy consumption reduction so that 
their significance can be taken seriously among the energy community. In order to have a clearer picture how these 
activities contribute to energy reduction, a designed model, integrating both artificial neural network and data 
envelopment analysis was established. In this regard, the artificial neural network was used to investigate and establish 
the baseline of the energy consumption based on the impacts of the various activities. Data envelopment analysis 
conducted a sensitivity analysis on the various inputs omitted one after the other. The result of the data envelopment 
analysis was validated with the connection weight approach of the artificial neural network. The South African case 
study gives a wider margin of how these activities contribute to energy reduction. It is very important that the country 
starts to concentrate on indigenous technologies and R&D activities so as to reduce the margin between them and the 
concentration on foreign technology transfer.

Abstract 
The chemical industry is one of the important industries in the South African industrial base, 
continuously being pressured to operate in an environmental friendly manner. Business with a 
good environmental practice in the South African chemical industry has become a key aspect for 
investors, customers and other stakeholders. In response to this challenge, chemical companies 
have implemented Environmental Management Systems into their businesses and getting certified 
to the various international standards. The ISO 14001 has been the leading international standard 
with the key purpose of progressively controlling environmental impacts while ensuring that 
objectives and targets are met. In this paper, the benefits of implementing and integrating ISO 
14001 in the chemical industry are discussed. ISO 14001 gives the competitive advantage in the 
marketplace and the company benefits economically covering the whole organization’s scope that 
including its products, operations, services, facilities, activities and transportation. South African 
companies have implemented the ISO 14001 EMS as a result of their response to the demand from 
customers and market for higher environmental reliability. This paper aims at educating about 
effectiveness of implementing ISO14001 standard in the companies that manufacture chemicals.

7. Conclusion 
 
The chemical industry globally has contributed greatly to current quality of life, for the 
development of the chemical sector while considering the environment as a crucial factor. 
Consideration for environmental issues is important in chemical company’s activities because it 
acts as surety for stakeholders that within and outside the company. The release of produced 
chemicals in the South African chemical industry whether intentionally and unintentionally has 
contributed to environmental pollution and in many cases the impact will be continuously be felt 
for generations. Adoption of the ISO 14001 Environment Management System standard ensures 
effective running of the businesses within the South African chemical industry, since it covers the 
entire scope of the company’s activities.

Abstract 
Cycle time variation is a metric and philosophy for continuous improvement with the aim of driving 
down the deviations in the time it takes to produce successive units on a production line.  It supports 
organizations' application of lean manufacturing or lean production by eliminating wasteful expenditure 
of resources.. Although it is often used as an indicator of lean progress, its use promotes a structured 
approach to reducing disruption that impacts efficiency, quality, and value. ARENA simulation on the 
other hand Arena is a discrete event simulation and automation software that allow user to builds an 
experiment model by placing modules (boxes of different shapes) that represent processes or logic. 
Connector lines are used to join these modules together and to specify the flow of entities. While modules 
have specific actions relative to entities, flow, and timing, the precise representation of each module and 
entity relative to real-life objects is subject to the modeller. This study was conducted in the assembly 
workstation of a headboard, the upper part of every bed with a unique design. This study was done in the 
AX Furniture, Muar, Johor Darul Takzim using interview, observation on the production department and 
ARENA simulation. Observations were made by studying each element of motion film recorded by video 
recorder. The research was done in order to identify the cycle time of the headboard assembly process and 
to increase the efficiency of the cycle time of the headboard assembly itself. Results from this study may 
help to increase the efficiency of the cycle time concept in a furniture industry.

1.0 Introduction 
1.1 
Research Background 
Cycle time is a measure of the time (minutes, hours, and seconds) required for a certain number of steps in a process 
to be completed, from start to finish, as defined by the team. A cycle time analysis is any method that collects and 
analyses time data for a process to improve the total process or system (V. Balasubramanian, 2015). It is an analysis 
of a worker’s performance against time standard. Time studies are normally performed on short repetitive 
production type of tasks. ARENA simulation is a computer integrated software that can be downloaded through 
internet connection that focuses on making a virtual simulation, process, que, idle and calculate a process related 
result. ARENA software brings the power of modelling and simulation to business process improvement. Typically, 
any process that can be described by means of a flow chart can be simulated with ARENA. (Khalid S. Al-Saleh,

Conclusion and Recommendation
5.1 Recommendations 
For the recommendation, the study suggest to add workers on the places where the cycle time of the process is much 
longer than other. Now, some might argue that the addition of the workers may increase the cost of production, but 
in this case the study is to create a much efficient cycle time in order to keep up with the manufacturing demand.

From the result, we can conclude that the highest total average number of waiting time for the production of fifty 
headboard take so many time in process three as it added up to 2 minutes and the shortest waiting time for the 
headboard assembly is on process one at 1 minutes for the production of 50 headboards. The highest numbers of 
waiting time was on the third process which is 9 times and the lowest is on the first process which is 4 times.  
5.2 Conclusion 
As the conclusion this study was a study on the cycle time of an assembly workstation using application of ARENA 
simulation software in a furniture industry. From the study, we can conclude that the Cycle time in manufacturing a 
headboard unit in AX Furniture is 17.81 minutes from starts to finish and the way to increase the time cycle 
efficiency is by altering the production line, in this case by adding workers on the critical long part of the process or 
stations.

Abstract 
In the Nordic area, Finland is one the main emitters of Co2, and energy consumption is relatively high, as 
well. Here, through log-mean divisia index analysis between 2000 - 2009, the main reason behind 
this issue has been analyzed. As a result, electricity and gas supply, coke, refined petroleum and nuclear 
fuel have been the main reason for the energy increase. On the other hand, pulp, paper, printing and 
publishing have significantly decreased. In addition, the energy related emission has been evaluated, and 
electricity, gas and water supply are highlighted as main items.

1. Introduction
Energy project management has been remarked as one the main derivers of sustainable development policy [1]. The 
previous studies have shown that the energy consumption is related to the three main factors: production changes, 
structural changes and efficiency that affect the energy intensity. This research implements indexed decomposition 
analysis (IDA) to evaluate these factors [2]. First, this research analysis the sectorial energy use for the period 
2000-2009. Next, the Co2 energy related emission is evaluated. Finland has made a plan for the reduction of Co2 by 
80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990 levels, and this analysis can help the policy makers to better achieve the goals 
[3]. 
2. Background
Finnish economy is industrialized, and accompanied with the cold clime the Finnish energy consumption is one of 
the highest in the IEA. Final energy consumption per capita, is ranked as second highest among Nordic countries 
and OECD average (after Iceland) [4]. Denmark and Finland are the main emitters of CO2 in the Nordic electricity. 
Furthermore, the eco-efficiency ranking of Finland is not as high as other Scandinavian countries [5], and it is 
mainly because of a lower ratio of GDP and CO2 emission relatively, as presented in the figure 1.  
Finland is dependent on nuclear and coal-fired power plants in electricity generation. Hydro power is also 
considered as the second important item in the electricity generation mix. The electricity price is among the lowest 
in the IEA countries. However, diversity in power generation in high in Finland, and renewable energy plays an 
important role in Finish energy portfolio. Meanwhile, the largest user of bioenergy in Finland is the pulp and paper 
industry [6]. 
Despite the decarburization policies in Finland, coal, oil and natural gas have been important resource for the 
electricity generation. In compliance with European Union climate and energy targets 20.20.20, Finland aims to 
reduce domestic GHG emissions by 80% by 2050 from the 1990 level. This target includes 38% (20%Renewables 
in road transport) renewable energy shares of total energy use [7].

5. Conclusion 
This study evaluates the energy consumption and Co2 emission in Finland from 2000-2009. The purpose of the 
study is to assess the reason for the high energy consumption and Co2 emission, as well. Therefore, IDA (LMDI1) is 
implemented, and energy consumption is divided into three main criteria: changes in the structure of the economy, 
changes in efficiency, and production effect.     
The finding remarks that consumption is mostly affect by production changes and efficiency has a significant 
mitigating effect. From table 1 it can be perceived that the change in the structure of economy of sector has impact 
in reduction of energy consumption.   
Through this analysis the main users and polluter is identified. The top contributors to energy use are electricity 
(92563 TJ) and Coke, Refined Petroleum and Nuclear Fuel (44960 tJ) and in contrary Plup (-74595 TJ). Likewise, 
the decomposition of emissions reveals important elements in energy use trend in Finland. Production effect has 
been the main reason for the Co2 emission. Electricity, Gas and Water Supply with 14488 kT and transports items 
(inland;1520, water;1822, air:2302)  with 5644 kT has been the highest. However, energy intensity plays an 
important role in the reduction of Co2 with 32397 kT.

Abstract 
Today, companies are making efforts on inventory control enhancement in order to deliver 
products and services to their customers rapidly at low cost. There is no doubt that inventory 
control enhances the firms operations. Better inventory control means effective operations of a 
firm resulting in cost reduction and ultimately increasing on profit. The purpose of this paper is 
to showcase the significance of proper inventory control systems application in warehouses. The 
inventory control techniques applicable in the warehouse such as batch quantities, ordering 
methods and inventory classification and as well as the factors contributing to poor inventory 
control were highlighted in this paper.

1. Introduction
Inventories are work-in-progress goods, finished goods, raw materials that an organization aim to sale and gain 
profit [1].  It is the best assets that any company value; if inventory is controlled and monitored in a good way it can 
add value to the organization. The overall profit of an organization is further enhanced by how well and efficiently 
an inventory is controlled [2].  
According to Ogbo et al. [3], Inventory control is defined as the supply of goods and services to a place with the 
correct quantity and quality. It is the process of moving goods from one place to the other in a safer way. Inventory 
control is the management based activities focusing on determining requirements, forecasting, setting goals and 
giving orders and necessary instructions [4]. 
Inventory control is a consistent means of running the organization operations smoothly while ensuring that 
customers are satisfied, goods are delivered on-time and loss of goods are minimized [3].  
Proper inventory control system in any organization in a country such as South Africa is of vital necessity since it 
helps improve various areas within the management effectively [3], [5]. However, Godana and Ngugi [2] argue that 
there exists a challenge to locate the best inventory level that works effectively with the production system in place 
in the organization. This phenomenon, contributes to majority of companies in developing countries not utilizing 
inventory control techniques [6].

8. Conclusion 
 
The paper reveals that employing inventory control comes with a big price. There are many problems that an 
organization needs to attend to. It is evident that ineffective inventory control is the main problem. Furthermore, 
companies in developing countries do not use the basic inventory control techniques. In many cases the ROP is 
always related to the extent of working capital available. That means companies in developing countries tend to 
order a massive quantity of stock subject to the amount of working capital available.

Abstract  
The automotive industry represents one of the most important industries for the economic growth 
of Mexico. In the last seven years, Mexico has reached the tenth place among the worldwide 
producers of light automobiles and became an important automotive part supplier. It contributes 
with 3.5% of the world production. Nuevo Leon takes part of the cluster of automotive parts 
suppliers with the higher importance for the country. By using a systematic literature review, 
obtained from data bases of two universities, University of Monterrey (UDEM) and Autonomous 
University of Nuevo Leon (UANL), the present research finds six factors with high impact to the 
manufacturing competitiveness of the automotive parts suppliers, in the automotive industry. 
These are: quality, product innovation, process technology, qualified capital human, support of 
the automotive cluster, and information technology. In scientific research a relevant issue is 
measurement. Factors that form part of the measurement process are discussed. This study 
presents an analysis of each one of these factors, and how they have an impact to the 
manufacturing competitiveness of the automotive industry.

Abstract 
The Theory of Constraints has become one of the greatest solutions in industries of developed countries. 
This multifaceted strategy has become the answer to many organizations that were on a free fall. Developing 
countries are yet to embrace to grasp the fullness of this great concept and maximize it to transform their 
economies for the best. Although South Africa being one of the most developed African countries has 
shown to be a step ahead of the countries in Africa by investing resources in the Theory of Constraints and 
the academic work therein, there is still a wide gap that needs to be filled in order to maximize the benefits 
of this theory. Lonmin mine is used as a case study as it has invested a lot of resources in the implementation 
of the Theory of Constraints.

1. Introduction
Theory of Constraints (TOC) is a management philosophy that creates a systematic way of improving organizations 
efficiency.   It is a continuous improvement method that aims to resolve the issues that stand at the bottleneck of the 
organization as they arise, to ensure the organization functions at its most optimum capacity given its available 
resources. According to Şimşit et al [1], TOC focuses on the weakest ring(s) in the chain to improve the performance 
of systems.  TOC is a multi-faceted systems methodology that has been developed to assist people and organisations 
to think about their problems, develop breakthrough solutions and implement those solutions successfully [2]. 
The thinking process (TP) is a TOC tool used as a problem solving mechanism which also encourages people to apply 
their minds and take responsibility of their work environment. This tool entails the use of structures that provoke 
critical thinking at every level and area of employment. These structures range from the evaporation cloud, the current 
reality tree, transition tree, prerequisite tree, future tree and negative branches [3]. TP also has a concept of the strategy 
and tactics tree, which can be used independently however, still fall under the category of the TP. With a good TP 
system in place, the process becomes easier to navigate and identify bottlenecks, thus making faster to implement 
buffers where relevant. 
The drum buffer rope (DBR) is a system that is used to provide a buffer at the point of constraint in the process. This 
is done to ensure that there is always maximum flow at the point of constraint because it is believed that a process can 
only be as strong as its weakest link, in other words a process at its best  performance can only flow as best as the

6.2 The production down time 
In a shaft, just as in any production plant, time is among the most valuable “inventory” that needs to be strategically 
used in order to maximize its outcome. It becomes very crucial to know where to draw a line in order to be able 
integrate the operations management tools. Lean is a good tool in operations management however if not used wisely 
can become a hazard to the profitability of the organization. Having observed the system over a short period of time 
minor issues which appear to be masked as “reducing waste” have occurred which wallow away production time. One 
striking example was the repair and replacement of winches in the shaft: the winches have to be removed and take all 
the way out of the shaft to the engineering department for the engineers to assess whether to replace or repair the 
winch. Then the winch will be transported back to the shaft and put back in place for operation. This is a very time 
consuming process which in turn costs the company lots of money, all because the company aims to “reduce waste”. 
The other of such examples is the ordering of materials required for blasting, this is yet another time consuming 
process which has also lead to the people being openly dishonest in a very obvious way just because the system 
requirements are not considerate of the type of working environment. 
6.3 The degree to which the people are empowered to make decisions and take decisive actions 
independently 
One of the key elements which are working against the logical progress of the shaft is the way the system has been 
programmed. The people at the lower levels have the greatest insight of what is happening in the shaft, especially as 
far as their area of operation is concerned. Many of them have over time acquired the expertise of knowing how to 
detect certain faults and address the basics in their designated fields because of their experience gained. However the 
current method of operation does not allow the people at this level to take decisive actions or empower them to do so 
at all, rather it makes them so dependant that it paralyzes their ability to apply their minds. As a result of this, the 
people at this level begin to feel redundant and lose the zeal to work. The people then shift the blame to cover up for 
their lack of commitment. They cannot be held accountable for anything if they are not entrusted with anything. At 
this rate the only thing that drives them for progress is a bonus at the end of the month. 
7. Future trends of TOC
A comprehensive review of academic literature on the TOC, including papers published in referred and non-referred 
journals and books enables us to classify them on the basis of the TOC philosophy and its application in business 
disciplines. The review shows that the vast majority of the papers have concentrated on the concept and philosophy 
enhancement of TOC. Several articles have been published in the production sector also. But very little work has been 
done on service sector. In the application category a number of articles report the application of TOC concepts in the 
area of production and management accounting. Few papers have been published on the comparison of TOC with 
various existing theories such as TQM, JIT etc. Much work remains to be done in terms of developing measures of 
the three dimensions of the throughput orientation construct and empirically testing the hypothesis .Future research 
could be directed towards the simulation of the case studies of organizations by identifying the bottleneck stations and 
developing a detail schedule for it with the application of finite scheduling method [16]. 
8. Conclusion
There is a wide gap in TOC documented research based on developing countries, this could be mean the introduction 
of TOC in these countries is slow, or the academic side of TOC in these countries needs to be encouraged. South 
Africa has shown great potential where TOC application is concerned as it has highly developing industries and an 
extremely competitive market.

Abstract 
The paper scope was to design an automated carrot peeling machine for use in Zimbabwe. Of particular 
target being local farmers and supermarket retailers who process carrots. In light of this, the project has the 
intention of availing design solutions of a machine that peels carrots for packaging purposes. Furthermore, 
with automation being a major facet of technological advancements, the study looked to automate the 
machine for ease of use and relatively less human interference as well as increasing accuracy of the 
processed product. Local farmers can fetch better on the market by value adding their carrots before selling 
them peeled. In conducting the study, objectives were formulated to solve the problem at hand and 
throughout the research these objectives were continuously addressed. In the design methodology, the 
peeling mechanism that machine will use was looked into. A further research was made on how to convey 
the carrots through the peeler as well as the powering mechanisms of different components that make up 
the machine. Study was also carried out on how to automate the machine through the use of latest flexible 
technology.

3.4. Quality Function Deployment (QFD) 
An analysis for cost and functionality of the carrot peeling machine will be done using the Boothroyd method to come 
up with the payback period. The Quality Deployment Function will be employed to analyze the importance of each 
part of the machine in comparison with consumer needs. The above methods gives the consumer knowledge of how 
much time they will take to fall back on the money invested into buying the machine as well as informing them on the 
suitability of the machine in performing its function in relation to its cost. The Boothroyd price, which is the time 
taken to assemble or manufacture, is translated into monetary terms preventing the manufacturer from understating or 
overstating the manufacturing price of the machine. Quality Function Deployment is a systematic approach to design 
based on close awareness of customer desires, coupled with the integration of corporate functional groups. It consists 
of translating customer desires (for example, the ease of writing of a pen) into design characteristics (pen ink viscosity, 
pressure on ball-point) for each stage of the product development (Rosenthal, 1992). The objective of QFD is to turn 
subjective quality criteria into objective ones that can be measured and quantified and can be used for design and 
manufacture of a product. In a nutshell, this method determines how and where priorities are to be assigned in product 
development.  
4. Recommendations and Conclusion
Recommendations will be made on how to realize the best out of the machine. Specifications will be outlined on 
maintenance procedures of machine parts, quality assurance and control on the peeled products as well 
recommendations on user safety when operating the machine.  
4.1 Quality Control  
For quality control, the following quality checks may be conducted: 
•
Size
•
Color
•
Appearance
Size: The carrot should weigh at most 12% less than its initial mass. The high peeling accuracy is achieved by the use 
of the variable frequency drive (VFD) motor controlled peeling blades. The user can conduct the size test by weighing 
the initial mass of a carrot before peeling and the mass after peeling. The peeling loss can then be calculated as  
𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚
 × 100%. 
Color: Color of the peeled product is also another important quality control tool. The initial color of the carrot should 
not be distorted. 
Appearance: The outer surface appearance of a peeled carrot gives an indication of the peeled carrot quality. The 
carrot should not be bruised after the peeling process and the peeled surface should be uniform.   
Safety: The machine operator should be kept safe from any form of danger that may harm or injure them by following 
the instructions on operation of the machinery. Rotating and moving parts have been housed and guarded as expected 
from modern day design to prevent contact with the user during operation. The machine has been designed to start the 
conveyor belt once a carrot has been placed on it through the use of a proximity sensor that communicates with the 
conveyor belt electric motor through the Mitsubishi GX Developer PLC. Once no carrot is being sensed to be on the 
conveyor, the belt electric motor automatically shuts down. In this regard the operator should not place their hands on 
the belt as this will start the belt and might lead to finger or hand injuries. Special attention should also be taken on 
good hygienic practices since the product being processed is consumed by human beings. The receiving buckets should 
always be kept clean all the time and should be washed by a disinfectant on a daily basis to ensure high standards of 
hygiene. The machine parts that the carrots get into contact with should also be regularly cleaned to avoid 
contamination. These parts include the conveyor belt, transport rollers and peeling blades. A provision is there to 
allow easy access of these parts when the need for cleaning arises. 
Maintenance: To fall back on the money invested in buying the machine and to get the most out of the peeling action 
there is need for maintenance and servicing regularly. Preventive maintenance should be done on electric motor

bearings by lubrication of the bearing jackets after a certain time interval. The lubrication oil of the conveyor belt and 
belt drive electric motors should be checked after every two weeks of continuous operation. 
Machine evaluation: The project can be further developed to cater for other processes involved in carrot processing. 
These are washing, cutting and packaging. If the peeling part of the machine is integrated with these other processes, 
the carrot processing becomes more complete and further reduces the human labor involved and also increasing the 
value of the carrot.

Abstract 
This paper aims to analyse the behaviour of a selected aluminium CubeSat frame subjected under static and 
vibrational loads using finite element analysis. Failures of CubeSats due to instability caused by vibration 
during launch can result in damage of the CubeSats and Launch Vehicle. Hence there is the need to analyse 
the maximum von-mises stress and strain of the CubeSat before production and launch to avoid these 
failures and losses. The CubeSat is modelled and analysed using Solidworks 2014. Finally, the results 
obtained are an indication of whether or not the frame structure is able to safely withstand the worst-case 
scenario static loading and imposed failure modes. 
Keywords: static load, vibrational load, and finite element analysis. 
1. Introduction
The CubeSat concept has been developed at Space Systems Development Laboratory (SSDL), Stanford University by 
Prof. Bob Twiggs and his colleagues and students in conjunction with California Polytechnic State University (Cal-
Poly) (Hansen, 2001). The purpose of the paper is to provide a standard for the design of picosatellites to reduce cost 
and development time, increase accessibility to space, and sustain frequent launches. CubeSats are minuscule satellites 
designed for low earth orbit (LEO) with a purpose to use universities worldwide for space research and exploration 
(Israr, 2014). Presently, the CubeSat Project is an international collaboration of over 100 universities, high schools, 
and private firms developing picosatellites containing scientific, private, and government payloads. The size and cost 
of spacecraft vary depending on the application; some you can hold in your hand while others like Hubble are as big 
as a school bus.  Small spacecraft (SmallSats) focus on spacecraft with a mass less than 180 kilograms and about the 
size of a large kitchen fridge.  Even with small spacecraft, there is a large variety of size and mass that can be 
differentiated as Minisatellite, 100-180 kilograms; Microsatellite, 10-100 kilograms; Nanosatellite, 1-10 kilograms; 
Picosatellite, 0.01-1 kilograms and Femtosatellite, 0.001-0.01 kilograms (NASA, 2015). CubeSats are a class of 
nanosatellites that use a standard size and form factor.  The standard CubeSat size uses a ""one unit"" or ""1U"" measuring 
10x10x10 cms and is extendable to larger sizes; 1.5, 2, 3, 6, and even 12U (NASA, 2015). Figure 1 shows the 
cubesat.

6. Conclusion
In a nutshell, the CubeSat Frame structure is able to withstand the launch static and dynamic vibrations without failing. 
This preliminary finite element analysis has revealed a significant margin of safety and adequate survivability in terms 
of worst-case static loading and imposed failure modes. 
7. Recommendation
The acoustic vibrations appear to induce the most critical dynamic response. In this case, the maximum deflections at 
the center of the plate were observed to occur at the entities fundamental frequency. It is recommended that 
components mounted at the center of these plates be appropriately bonded and inspected after environmental testing.

Abstract 
One of the most important yet ancient technique in the tobacco industry, is the grading of flue-cured 
tobacco. Factors to be considered include overall color, blemish, damage, texture, leaf length and ripeness. 
It is therefore imperative that leaves from different plant positions (different groups) i.e. primings, lugs, 
cutters, leaf, and tips must be kept separate because they have important different chemical characteristics.  
The efforts of this research project are directed towards restoring the objectivity in the grading of flue-cured 
tobacco in Zimbabwe, by means of using Machine Vision and Artificial Intelligence during the grading 
process. MATLAB software was used to implement elements of AI specifically, Computer Vision System 
and Machine Learning. An artificial grading expert system was designed by means of supervised machine 
learning particularly Support Vector Machines. This was achieved by training a data sample of flue-cured 
tobacco according to human expert knowledge of tobacco grading. A test subject is then tried and the system 
is evaluated and it was found that the system is 93.1% efficient which showed that automating the grading 
system in Zimbabwe is not only feasible but it is also more economic.

3 Tuning an SVM Classifier 
Try tuning parameters of your classifier according to this scheme: 
•
Pass the data to fitcsvm, and set the name-value pair arguments 'KernelScale','auto'. Suppose that the trained
SVM model is called SVMModel. The software uses a heuristic procedure to select the kernel scale. The
heuristic procedure uses subsampling. Therefore, to reproduce results, set a random number seed using rng
before training the classifier.
•
Cross validate the classifier by passing it to crossval. By default, the software conducts 10-fold cross
validation.
•
Pass the cross-validated SVM model to kFoldLoss to estimate and retain the classification error.
•
Retrain the SVM classifier, but adjust the 'KernelScale' and 'BoxConstraint' name-value pair arguments.
3.4 Real interface  
An interface was designed simplify the visualization to a laymen and figure 5 below shows the user interface of the 
expert system with all the algorithms running in background. 
Figure 5. System user interface (UI) 
The model was designed to determine its classification accuracy using 500 iteration. This is a fair number of iteration 
considering the size of the model database. Using this, 93% of accuracy was achieved from untrained images captured 
in sunlight illumination and about 90% accuracy of captured in an artificial illumination. The database used was 
relatively small which means a bigger database will the accuracy shots up as training data base gets bigger. 
4. Recommendations and conclusion
Apart from the fact that much of the raw data used in the research was at farm level, pleasing results were obtained. 
All objectives were achieved and exceeded performance expectations. We therefore conclude that automating flue 
cure grading of tobacco is very feasible and if funded will impact our tobacco industry in a positive way.

Abstract 
There are a lot of different tools and methods available to optimise shop floor processes. These methods 
include for example Poka Yoke, 5S, Lean Management, Kanban and Total Quality Management. It is a 
challenge for many companies to transfer these methods efficiently to their production. Besides the 
difficulty of choosing the right method, the estimation of the effectiveness of these methods remains 
uncertain. 
Currently most employees are not acquainted with the methods mentioned above. What is more, they cannot 
assess the process efficiency regarding the implementation of these methods. Even experts of optimisation 
methods are only able to assess the efficiency according to experience. To date, a scientific analysis of a 
shop floor in series production via a business simulation and the selected optimisation methods does not 
exist. The following hypothesis is given:  
“The effectiveness of selected process optimisation methods can be demonstrated via a developed model in 
form of a business simulation in a model factory” 
To confirm the hypothesis, a model with a business simulation that helps to assess the usage of the 
optimisation methods on the shop floor was developed. Although this method is scientifically recognised, 
experiments like this have not yet been undertaken for production processes. Therefore, the purpose of this 
scientific study is to close the research gap with a systematic analysis of series production with a simulation 
and the generated data using design of experiments (DoE). To achieve this, the deployment of the 
optimisation tools on the shop floor is measured and evaluated. As KPIs, lead times of the individual 
workstations, total lead time, reworking, and inventory costs are measured. The selection of the methods 
used in this game is based on the prevalence in literature, group discussions and a quantitative survey. 
Methods used are Kanban, Standard Worksheet, 5S and Poka Yoke.

Abstract  
The Intensive Care Unit (ICU) service is a specific internment ward dealing with critically ill inpatients, 
i.e. those ones who need for advanced, close and constant life support for 24 h a day due to their life-
threatening illnesses/injuries. Efficiency evaluation is to be needed due to this critical status of ICUs. In 
this study, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been carried out for efficiency evaluation of third level 
intensive care units which are in two university hospitals and one state hospital in Adana which is one of 
the most crowded cities in Turkey. DEA which is an increasingly popular management tool relies on 
linear programming to determine the relative efficiency of organizational units. In this case, efficiency 
evaluation is performed the outputs of patients whose treatments result in success or not in ICUs. The 
DEA produces two results which are efficient hospitals in terms of ICU with score 1 and inefficient 
hospitals with scores less than 1. According to DEA results of the study, one of the university hospital 
and the state hospital’s ICU are efficient with score 1 and the other university hospital’s ICU is inefficient 
with score less than 1.

Abstract 
 
The manufacturing industry successfully used the simulation modeling and digital 
engineering toolbox to improve the production efficiency. In this paper, development of automotive 
body shop layout design and the assembly processes is presented for a typical Body-in-White (BIW) 
vehicle.  The overall BIW assembly consists of four BIW major assembly lines. They are Underbody line, 
Body side Aperture lines left and right, Framing line and the Panel line.  A simulation model is developed 
depicting the body shop plant layout and processes to analyse the production output. This paper makes an 
earnest attempt to model the complete body shop processes using simulation software. The stations 
uptime and down time, conveyor speed and the path, process stations, process cycle times were used per 
the processes layout to predict the output.  The simulation model prediction results were compared with 
the typical production output from the plant.

Introduction
The automobile manufacturing plant is very sophisticated, and complex in nature with highly automated 
equipment and robots.   The body is spot welded by robots to form a “Unibody” chassis assembly or a “Body on 
frame” vehicle. Assembly of the vehicle takes place along a highly efficient assembly line. The robot and the 
manual labourers' work side by side to maximize the productivity. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) drive 
assembly line equipment. The automotive assembly plant typically produce about 60 vehicles per hour. Annually, 
150,000 to 250,000 units are produced by a single-line plant depending on the shifts and the number of workdays 
per week. Annual production rates are usually based on 250 workdays per year. The automotive assembly plant 
really consists of three side-by-side plants, Body shop, Paint shop and the Trim, Chassis and Final (TCF) assembly 
shop. Some facilities may have a stamping operation or powertrain assembly on site. However, almost all the TCF 
sub assembled parts are ""Received- in- assembly"" (RIA) at the plant. A new body shop production-line needs to be 
set up for almost every new vehicle (car, truck, minivan or SUV) model. Due to the relatively short product life 
cycles, the planning process of body shops can almost be regarded as continuous. Often, the optimization of a new 
body shop is carried out manually, supported by a simulation model to analyse the impact of different cycle times 
and buffer sizes.  
  
After the vehicle S0, S1 and S2 pilot build processes are finalized; advanced manufacturing engineering (AME) 
department develops the production processes.  The AME have dedicated group of engineers and managers to 
deliver the equipment and processes for each plant shop: BIW, Paint and TCF.   The assembly plant personnel are 
tasked with meeting the daily production meeting the quality requirements.  Plant personnel are busy dealing with 
the day-to-day production tasks.  The automotive assembly line process stations are highly automated with robots

This paper has demonstrated how to develop a simulation model using Arena simulation software with proper 
input parameters. Based on the modeling results, it is proved that the whole-body shop assembly processes can be 
modeled to analysis the plant throughput. This simulation study accurately predicted the throughput based on the 
system uptime and downtime data. Further investigation is needed to understand the effects of the other variables 
such as buffers and line balancing of the upstream and downstream processes.

Abstract 
Most stakeholders involved in the construction industry, particularly from developing countries have 
less emphasis on environmental care primarily involves the reuse and recycle of building materials in 
their construction projects. Previous studies prove environmental aspects have been neglected by the 
major stakeholders of the construction industry compared with issues related to cost and time. This 
study focuses on identifying the current adoption level of reuse and recycle practice among Malaysian 
contractors, the factors that are required for the successful implementation of systematic reuse and 
recycle and to identify the relationship between the selected factors and systematic implementation of 
reuse and recycle.  The questionnaires were distributed to grade A contractors that registered with the 
Contractor Service Centre. Currently, most of the contractors are concerned about waste management 
of the construction materials.

1. Introduction
Infrastructures development and construction industry are usually cannot be separated and they are both actually 
linked together. Currently, the construction industry faces increasingly restrictive environmental conservation 
and protection laws and regulations in order to improve the image of this industry. Due to this reason, the 
emergence of international standards to address environmental quality and performance such as ISO 14,000 and 
substantial pressures from civic and private environmental groups seems to be crucial in order to improve the 
current practices. One of the matter concern in the construction industry are involves the issues of waste which 
resulted from the activities of the construction work. Tam and Tam (2008), mentioned that Construction and 
Demolition (C&D) waste is often seen as the major contributor to the solid waste stream that is going to landfill, 
hence, making it the area of focus for improvement . According to Construction Industry Research and 
Information Association (CIRIA) (2001), construction industry still lags behind in performing the key area of 
sustainability theme especially on the environmental theme. The implications of these issues heightened the 
pressure to consider greener practices as part of the culture in the construction projects (Kibert, 2008).

7. Suggestions and Improvements
Based on the research findings, among the suggestions and views obtained are including unskilled workers and 
professional in the construction projects should have knowledge and skills to handle construction materials and 
must practice waste management especially when they are at the construction site. The respondents also 
suggested that the waste management approach of construction materials are included in the contractual 
obligations towards more efficient waste management. At the same time, the local authorities are encourage to 
increase the numbers of Recycling Site specifically on construction waste materials. Other suggestions towards 
improving the waste management approaches are include : 
i.
Makes reuse and recycling more simple and easy to practice.
ii.
Provide appropriate disclosure to the parties involved on reuse and recycle.
iii.
Providing guidelines, criteria, methods of work, checklists, and related training.
iv.
Increase agency/organization to monitor the reuse and recycle management at the construction
sites.
Based on respondents' views, they are concerned of the basic knowledge related to the implementation of the 
reuse and recycle approaches at the construction sites.

Abstract 
Disposal of municipal waste, a by-product from the sewage treatment process, is resulting in landfilling problems 
hence need for sustainable methods in managing this municipal waste such as biogas generation via bio catalytic 
routes. This study focused on anaerobic treatment of municipal waste, co-harnessing biogas as a value added 
products utilizing Hycura, an engineered enzyme bio-catalyst. Anaerobic digestion of municipal waste was 
investigated for potential biogas generation at mesophilic temperature of 35 °C and thermophilic temperature of 55 
°C. An engineered bio catalyst, Hycura was loaded at 0.5g/L. The biogas quantity produced was measured using the 
water displacement method. Samples of the biogas were analyzed for bio-methane, carbon dioxide and traces gases 
composition using a gas analyzer. Optimum biogas production was obtained under mesophilic conditions and 
Hycura loading of 0.50 g/L with a 78% bio-methane composition. Biogas production from municipal waste does not 
only provide a waste management initiative but also a renewable energy source. 
Keywords: Anaerobic digestion, biogas, bio augmentation, Hycura, municipal waste 
1. Introduction
 
The conversion of bio waste to biogas is increasingly becoming popular as a waste management initiative to 
generate a source of energy that is renewable and ecofriendly (Savari et al., 2016). Biogas is mainly composed of 
methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and other trace gases including hydrogen sulphide (H2S). Biogas production 
can be fully described by 4 stages which are hydrolysis, fermentation, anaerobic digestion and methanogenesis. The 
biogas production stages are given in Figure 1.

 4. Conclusion
Bio augmentation of municipal waste to enhance biogas production is critical for improving the quality of the biogas 
produced especially increasing the methane content. Contaminants like hydrogen sulphide are removed and the bio 
methane quality enriched. Mesophilic conditions are ideal for bio augmentation with Hycura.

Abstract 
The potential to economically run a biogas plant for the generation of fuel for use by the local buses was 
investigated. Various organic waste with varying total solids (TS) and organic loading were investigated 
for bio methane generated under mesophilic conditions. The first plant had a capacity of 10 tons per day 
and TS loading of 11% and 15%. Assuming 20 years of operation, after investing R 10 848 338, a 
breakeven point of 9.9 years with an internal rate of return of 8.3% was achieved for TS loading of 15% 
with 85% base. Whereas, when a 50 tons per day plant was investigated for a TS loading of 11% and 
15%, a breakeven point of 6.4 years was achieved with an internal rate of return of 14.3% at an organic 
base of 85%. From the assessment, it is economical to set up a 50 tons per day plant and the biogas 
produced has potential to power more than 10 local buses. This can be further increased if the organic 
loading in the bio digester is increased to 25% TS content.

1. Introduction
Biogas is increasingly becoming a source of renewable energy in developing countries. Biogas which is mainly 
composed of methane (CH4) is made from organic waste through anaerobic digestion (Gebrezgabher, 2009). 
Although the production of biogas from organic municipal waste is topical, the economic assessment of adopting the 
technology still needs to be done especially when applying in a local context. The purpose of an economic 
assessment is to study the various possible economically viable routes involved in the production of the biogas 
(Murphy et al., 2003; Chacon, 2004; Khan et al., 2014). This study therefore focused on the potential to 
economically generate biogas that can be used in the local buses as a source of fuel among other uses as shown in

4. Social Impact Assessment
Several benefits are obtained from the usage of biogas as a source of energy. These include the fact that the biogas 
is a renewable source of energy since waste is generated on a daily basis. Furthermore, the amount of greenhouse 
gases emitted to the environment is reduced due to the reduced amount of carbon dioxide s and methane emitted to 
the environment from the rotting of the carbon dioxide. Digestion of waste to biogas also reduces the amount of 
waste that ends up at landfills, increasing the lifespan of the landfills. The living conditions of people are also 
improved by having a clean and sanitary environment. 
5. Conclusion
The waste quantification conducted indicated that all organic wastes discharged at a local landfill are available for 
energy recovery as they are presently being covered with top soil to degenerate. If all organic wastes are converted 
into bio methane, about 100 Metro buses can be fuelled. The 20% is a conservative estimate of the theoretically 
calculated 157, representing 29%, metro buses that can be fuelled. There is a low likelihood for return on 
investment for a 10 ton/day plant and high potential for return on investment for a 50 ton/day plant especially 
when co-digested with grass residues. A 50 ton/day which holds higher return on investment with a shorter 
payback period is highly recommended for investment.

Abstract 
Landfills are increasingly becoming an attractive source for gas generation, a renewable source of 
energy that can be used for heating and cooking purposes at both household and industrial level. In this 
study, a variety of landfill waste with a capacity to generate biogas with 60% bio methane composition 
was studied for potential bio methane (CH4) enrichment. Physical and chemical absorption, membrane 
separation and cryogenic separation were studied as the bio methane enrichment methane. The methods 
were ranked in terms of product purity, ease of use and adaptability and the adsorption and membrane 
separation methods were superior. However, chemical absorbed was then chosen as the bio methane 
enrichment method due to its low energy requirements of 0.6-1.9 CH4 percentage of total amount of 
CH4 required for heating.  
Keywords: Biogas, bio methane enrichment, municipal waste, upgrading methods 
1. Introduction
Landfills are a good source of biogas. The biogas produced from landfills is rich in biomethane (CH4) typically
ranging between 35 and 75% vol and have higher heating value of 15-30 MJ/Nm3 (Abatzoglou and  Boivin, 2009).
However, this biogas must be further upgraded to achive a higher bio methane content.The bio methane (CH4)
enrichment process is mainly to separate the non-combustible carbon dioxide (CO2) in the biogas after other trace
impurities have been removed to produce bio methane of high quality >95% CH4 . The bio methane can be used
for various uses such a fuel, cooking and heating purposes. There are numerous methods that can be used to
upgrade biogas to bio methane and these include absorption, adsorption, membrane and cryogenic techniques
(Ramarajand Dussadee, 2009). The choice of the chosen technique largely depends on some important factors
such as biogas composition, available resources such as water, electricity and space, the target purity of CH4 as
well as the volume of biogas to be upgraded.

desorption process requires an increased temperature hence a heating and cooling system is required. Cryogenic 
requires the highest demand on electricity which ranges between 1.9-6.5% of CH4 heating value for the upgrading 
process. The energy requirement of a cryogenic plant is reported to be about 580.9 kJ/m3 of bio methane with a 
heat pump cycle operating between -100 °C to 40 °C. Adsorption technique was also high because of the 
compression energy required but membrane technique was about the average of all the processes. The energy 
demand ranges between 1.9-3.1% of CH4 heating value. From comparisons of both the easy of technology and 
the energy demand, chemical absorption was then chosen as the bio methane upgrading technique. 
3.4 Proposed bio methane enrichment process 
The biogas from the municipal waste is first desulphurized to remove hydrogen sulphide (H2S). After that the 
desulphurized biogas is compressed to 12 bars and then cooled and filtered to remove contaminants. Adsorption 
is then carried out for the removal of water, remaining H2S and other impurities in the biogas. The biogas is then 
sent for bio methane enrichment applying either absorption or membrane separation. The enriched bio methane 
at this stage can be sent for combined heat and power (CHP) uses. The other bio methane can be further 
compressed to 220 bars and distributed as a source of vehicle fuel. The detailed process flow diagram is shown in 
Figure 2. 
Figure 2. Biogas purification process 
4. Conclusion
Potential exist for the conversion of landfill waste to biogas which can be upgraded to bio methane. Biogas 
upgrading is critical for obtaining high purity bio methane with minimal pollutants. Absorption and membrane 
separation of the bio methane from the biogas are ideal separation methods in terms of easy of technology and 
energy usage.

Abstract 
The work measurement standard of a given work is determined from the standard operating procedure of 
the work at hand, as well as from a work study program that captures the time taken to carry out all 
related activities. The activities must be both ‘capture-able’ and ‘analyzable’ in order to set the standard 
time, where specific values are assigned to defined time elements. Conventional assembly production 
works are routine, repeatable, have discrete cycle times, and have predictable patterns of execution as per 
the operating specifications. For this type of work, time studies (also known as ‘pre-determined time 
methods’) are able to capture and analyze time elements efficiently. However, factory works have become 
increasingly sophisticated and non-conventional. Many portions of the work now possess opposite 
characteristics of the aforementioned, to the extent that conventional work measurement techniques are no 
longer efficient in the development of the appropriate work measurement standards. In this paper, case 
studies are used to describe six characteristic attributes of time elements and the pertinent mapping of 
work measurement techniques in a ‘data capture-able versus data analyzable’ quadrant, which can be used 
in the development of work measurement standards of non-conventional factory works. The purpose of 
the paper is to provide an insight of the capture-ability and analyzability of work data. This may prove 
useful in future workforce models, which are becoming more integrated in terms of ‘digital and human’ 
patterns rather than the routine human-only operations.

be similar to the conventional PDL tasks, but they can be overcome with scientific and systematic approaches instead 
of best estimates, gut feel, past experiences, and PDL: NPDL ratios of the past. 
The future workforce model which shifts towards an integrated ‘digital and human’ patterns or mixture of ‘robots and 
humans’ working side by side shall need more flexible methods.  This matches with the approach in this research 
model, which is the ‘Data Capture-able versus Data Analyzable’ quadrant approach. The quadrants focus not on the 
type of job alone, but also the scalability of the capture-ability and analyzability data.

Abstract 
Biomass represents approximately 10% of the energy sources in the world. The most common use of 
biomass for energy is direct combustion, gasification, carbonization and pyrolysis. In this perspective, 
torrefaction emerges as a thermal biomass pre-treatment method that has an ability to reduce the major 
limitations of biomass, such as heterogeneity and lower energy density. However, one of the outputs from 
the torrefaction process is a pyrolysis condensate (tar). Tar is brown or black liquid composed of 
hydrocarbons which can cause clogging and fouling of pipes, heat exchangers or particulate filters. This 
paper provides a study performed in a biomass power generation company that was producing an excess of 
tar. In order to provide a solution to the excess tar generated, a framework to implement sustainability 
business processes using the Business Process Management (BPM) approach was used. The study found 
two solutions for the issue (short- term and long-term scenarios) using tools to improve the process 
management by focusing on sustainability.

Abstract 
Pre-positioning emergency inventory in selected facilities is commonly adopted to prepare for potential 
disaster threat. In this paper, we simultaneously optimize the decisions of facility location, emergency 
inventory pre-positioning, and relief delivery operations within a single-commodity disaster relief 
network. A min-max robust model is proposed to capture the uncertainties in both the left- and right-
hand-side parameters in the constraints. The former corresponds to the proportions of the pre-positioned 
inventories usable after a disaster attack, while the latter represents the demands of the inventories and the 
road capacities in the disaster-affected areas. We study how to solve the robust model efficiently and 
analyze a special case that minimizes the humanitarian cost. The application of the model is illustrated by 
a case study of the 2010 earthquake attack at Yushu County in Qinghai Province of PR China. The 
advantage of the min-max robust model is demonstrated through comparison with the deterministic model 
and the two-stage stochastic model for the same problem. Experiment variants also show that the robust 
model outperforms the other two approaches for instances with significantly larger scales.

Abstract 
The purpose of the paper is to examine the significance of incorporating lean production (LEAN) in the 
Malaysian manufacturing industry. Lean production investigated in this paper consists of eight practices 
namely supplier focus, employee focus, continual improvement, customer focus, quality at source, just-in 
time, flow system and technology & innovation. This study utilizes two hundred and five manufacturing 
companies, selected randomly from the Federation of Malaysian Manufacturers Directory. The study 
measures senior production or lean managers’ perception of the lean production practices and the level of 
quality performances in their companies. Grounded by the Program Theory, this paper specifically 
investigates whether the implementation of lean production practices will affect the quality performance 
in the organization. Pearson’s correlations exhibit significant correlations between the eight lean practices 
and quality performance measures (measured by product conformance, product performance and product 
reliability). The findings of the study provide a striking demonstration of the importance of lean practices 
in enhancing the quality performances of the Malaysian manufacturing companies. The result indicates 
that manufacturing companies will enjoy the benefit of improving quality performance from the 
utilization of lean practices.

Abstract 
When Markowitz proclaimed in his research paper, there were many crises in economic system. The 
majority of economist and quant had suggested their own model of portfolio and theories. Our research 
suggested a new portfolio which is named ‘T&M’ using elastic asset allocation, diversified investment, and 
real momentum. Using Kelly Criterion, T&M portfolio’s efficiency and stability were verified. Market 
indexes used in T&M portfolio are US 10 Year T-Note Futures, US 30 Year T-Bond Futures, S&P 500, 
Canadian S&P 500,S&P/TSX Composite, DAX, Hang Seng, KOSPI, USD/KRW(Forex), and Gold Future. 
The data was used from Jan 1st, 1988 to Sep 1st, 2016. The period verified was computed from 1989, 
monthly. Microsoft Excel 2013’s inner Function was used as a main analysis program. Finally, T&M 
Portfolio increased by about 15.503%(CAGR), and MDD decreased by about 6.3%. With this, this study 
verified he high stability and efficiency of elastic asset allocation. 
Both of two students got the data for completion of study. Taewan Kim had conducted for comparing, 
sorting data, Back-Test, writing about elastic asset allocation and Kelly Criterion, and Mihyeop Lee had 
conducted for writing the stock market, momentum, standard deviation, theory of portfolio, introduction 
and conclusion.

1. Introduction
Since Makowitz(1952) presented the theory of portfolio and diversified investment, many researches have been 
studied. In the financial market, the value of theory of portfolio and diversified investment takes up a large proportion. 
In this paper, two researchers designed T&M portfolio that applied strategy of Elastic Asset Allocation and 
momentum. Moreover, Kelly Criterion Ratio of T&M portfolio was calculated because the value should be verified. 
The T&M portfolio uses the low correlation coefficient, monthly rebalancing, and momentum. The data includes the

that focuses on profitability while minimizing the proportion of cash. The core of the T&M portfolio proposed in this 
study rebalances at the beginning of each month. Rebalancing is to balance the portion of highly valued assets with 
those of undervalued assets and takes into account the profits and losses of the group of assets that generated the losses. 
The rebalancing has been incorporated into the T&M portfolio.  
The T&M portfolio uses the low correlation coefficient, monthly rebalancing, and momentum. The data includes the 
Hang Seng(HSI), Nifty 50(NSEI), DAX(GDAXI), S&P500(SPX), S&P/TSX Composite (GSPTSE), US 10 Year T-
Note Futures, US 30 Year T-Bond Futures, and KOPSI(KS11). Market indexes used in T&M portfolio are US 10 
Year T-Note Futures, US 30 Year T-Bond Futures, S&P 500, Canadian S&P 500, S&P/TSX Composite, DAX, Hang 
Seng, KOSPI, USD/KRW(Forex) and Gold Future. The data from Jan 1, 1998 to Sep 1, 2016 was used for the research. 
According to the results, T&M Portfolio rebalances ratio at every single month. Using the momentum score, it was 
calculated through comparison of non-risk cash asset(CAGR 3%) to get a proper ratio, and T&M Portfolio showed 
less loss and stable profit. For example, simple momentum portfolio had got a lot of loss during 2008 financial 
depression, but T&M Portfolio recovered the loss by bond and gold asset. When T&M Portfolio set the ratio of cash 
asset high, both CAGR and MDD got a loss. When another way set the ratio of cash asset low, CAGR and MDD got 
higher. Also, multiplying the leverage can get more profits at a short term, but MDD got higher to increase of volatility. 
The conclusion drawn from this study is the ratio of multiplying leverage and cash asset which must increase at the 
same time. Up to now we have tested the profit depending on ωM, ωC, and ωV. In conclusion: the research framework 
and research methods were as follows: (1) when ωM increases, both CAGR and MDD increase. (2) when ωV 
increases, both CAGR and MDD decrease. (3) It is the worst result that makes ωC increase. The biggest limitation of 
this study is the deduction. Each stock firm in countries shows different deduction.

Introduction 
The speed, service quality and the cost of operations impact the supply chain performance. So the 
improvement of performance is becoming must in those areas for those organizations looking for 
success. One most popular approach for improving quality, lower cost, and responding time 
responses is lean six sigma.  In recent decades, Lean Six Sigma(LSS) has become the most popular 
strategic tool for adopting continuous improvement in service sector and in the public sector 
alike(Albliwi et al., 015). Continuous improvement is the key goal for any profit and non-profit 
organization to assist them to achieve operational excellence and to enhance quality 
performance(Thomas et al., 2009).

Abstract 
Microservice architecture can be futher extended to cover the Internet of Things. Prior to Microservice 
architecture, Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) has been used for designing and orchestrating services 
but with limitation of scaling. Microservice has been reported to be able to scale services better and in order 
to achieve this services must be in form of loosely coupled. Internet of Things must be considered and 
included in designing service system today in order to build seamless service system. However, designing 
and combining Internet of Things with service system is not straight forward as it will introduce complexity 
to the system especially if it is not designed and planned properly. It is also hard to scale a service system 
if it is in form of centralized and tightly coupled manner. Therefore, it is important to understand how this 
problem will effect the service system and find the solution to overcome this problem. Promise theory has 
been looked as a possibility to be adopted in designing a loosely coupled microservice system for Internet 
of Things. This paper is about the preliminary studies and works that have been done in using Promise 
theory to understand and designing loosely coupled microservice architecture for Internet of Things.

Abstract 
This article presents a technique to measure the diversification effect of local search moves in metaheuristic 
algorithms for solving capacitated vehicle routing problems. The diversification values calculated through 
this technique can be used to modify the algorithms, pick the best neighborhoods in each move and improve 
the searching process to find the optimal solution. This technique may be implemented to a wide variety of 
metaheuristics. It is shown that metaheuristic algorithms for vehicle routing problems may be examined 
efficiently and improved with this technique. Moreover, we examine the solutions for different instances 
produced by this technique on simulated annealing algorithm and we interpret the relations between the 
optimal solution and the diversification scores.

1. Introduction
The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization problem, searching to find the optimum routes for 
delivering the products to customers. Capacitated VRP (CVRP) is a type of VRP problem where vehicles are assumed 
to have a limited capacity and properties of vehicles are assumed to be the same. There exists a central and single 
depot, the deliveries and demands may not be split, deterministic and known in advance. As the properties of the 
problem change, problem type of VRP may change accordingly.  
The VRP problem is an important combinatorial optimization problem due to the fact that there are many real life 
applications. It has been studied via many methods and many attempts have been made to obtain optimal or convergent 
solutions. Even though many solution methods have been developed for these problems, most of them is observed to 
require a long time to provide a good solution. However, in real life, managers generally require a good solution in a 
very short time, thus it becomes important to develop models that provide convergent solutions in a short time period. 
Metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed in literature that may achieve good results in large quantities in a short 
time due to these needs. 
In recent years many new metaheuristic algorithms are developed. Some of them are single solution based algorithms 
which are searching form the reference of one single solution. Single solution based algorithms are easy to implement 
and they are efficient algorithms requiring less memory. Simulated annealing, tabu search, variable neighborhood 
search methods are the examples of these algorithms.  Also, there is population based algorithms which make multiple 
point searches within a single iteration. Genetic algorithms, partical swarm optimization, ant colony algorithms are 
some of these algorithms. The hybrid of those algorithms are also generated according to needs as well. 
Some metaheuristics are using neighborhood search algorithms as hybridized and the challenges in this type of studies 
are to stuck in a local minimum or not having a good result in a reasonable amount of computation time. Selection of 
the neighborhood search algorithm for a metaheuristic has great importance in this area. Especially in the existence

Figure 4. Diversification scores for NS methods 
6. Conclusion
We have presented a new technique that measures diversification effect of metaheuristic algorithms for capacitated 
vehicle routing problems. The problem is solved using simulated annealing algorithm with different NS moves. It is 
obtained that diversification measure is an important factor for the success of metaheuristic algorithms and NS 
methods. In addition, this technique may help to make decisions for NS selection or to evaluate metaheuristic 
algorithms.  
We propose a new technique that is able to calculate diversification scores and analyze metaheuristic algorithms with 
hybrid mechanisms according to these results. These scores show us how diversified the algorithm is. This ability of 
the algorithm can be used as a criteria to decide whether the diversification in the algorithm is appropriate or not, and 
whether the algorithm needs to be improved. Our technique may be useful in measuring the diversification in the 
algorithms and can be a very important indicator for metaheuristics. It can be used to improve the success of the 
metaheuristics by helping to choose the best neighborhood structure in the next moves. It can also help in decision 
making about the combination of two or more neighborhood structures to be used as hybrid approaches. 
The relationship between the diversity score and the objective function value is tested for different NSs. The objective 
function in different problems with different algorithms has been observed from the experiments and the value of the 
objective function is seen to improve as the diversity score increases. The algorithms with high diversification scores 
are observed to be more successful and achieve better results. 
It is also as seen from the results that using two different NS methods in order to increase the diversification effect, 
may not always increase the diversification effect more than using a single NS method. For this reason, diversification 
scores need to be measured for decision making about which NS mechanisms to use. We finally state that the 
measurement of diversification scores in algorithms can provide very useful results in improving the algorithms and 
we will focus on the usage of this technique for different combinatorial problems in the future.

Abstract 
The impact of fast moving items, modeled by auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) type processes, 
on the bullwhip effect is well known. However, slow moving items that can be modeled using integer 
ARMA processes have received little attention. Herein, we measure the impact of bullwhip effect under a 
first order integer auto-regressive, INAR(1), demand process. We consider a simple two-stage supply 
chain consisting of a retailer and a manufacturer. We assume that the retailer employs a base stock 
inventory policy when the demand is forecasted using a minimum mean squared error method. We 
investigate the impact of the INAR(1) demand process parameter, α , and the replenishment lead time, L, 
on the bullwhip effect generated by the order-up-to replenishment policy. We show that the bullwhip 
effect is increasing with the lead-time L.

1. Introduction
The bullwhip effect refers to the tendency for supply chain replenishment decisions to amplify the variability of the 
demand when ordering products from production systems or suppliers (Lee, et al., 2000). Many of the existing 
studies on the bullwhip effect (Chen et al., 2000a and Dejonckheere et al., 2003) have assumed that real demand 
exists. That is to say, demand can take on any number, even fractional values.  For some products sold by volume or 
weight (powders, granules or liquids etc.) this may be appropriate. However, for other products, only integer (or 
batched) demand makes sense. For example, you can’t buy half a car or half a loaf of bread; demand and 
replenishment orders must be integers. For some situations, with high volume demand, replenishment calculations 
can ignore integer effects as any rounding that occurs is negligible in the grand scheme of things. However, some 
low volume demand settings may be more susceptible to integer effects.   
Consider, for example, the daily demand for a single product in a single grocery store in Figure 1. This product has 
low volume, integer, and occasionally zero demand. Continuous-valued series can be modeled using auto-regressive 
integrated moving average (ARIMA) type processes (Box and Jenkins, 1970). However, standard ARIMA modeling 
techniques are not suitable for modelling non-negative integer-valued series (Silva and Oliveira, 2004). Therefore, 
another type of process has been proposed for a stationary sequence of integer-valued time series.  In the literature, 
this family of models is referred to as integer auto-regressive moving average processes, INARMA, Al-Osh and 
Alzaid (1988). 
The bullwhip effect can be measured in different ways, however it is often convenient to quantify it via the ratio of 
the variance of orders to the variance of demand. Auto-regressive demand of the first order, AR(1), auto-regressive 
integrated moving average, ARMA(1,1) and integrated moving average (IMA) processes, are among the most 
frequently used demand processes that are forecasted with minimum mean squared error (MMSE) forecasting 
methods (Graves, 1999; Chen et al., 2000a; Chen et al. 2000b; Hosoda and Disney 2006; Chen and Disney, 2007; 
Duc et al., 2008). Wang and Disney (2016) provide a recent comprehensive review of the research conducted on 
bullwhip effect categorized into empirical, experimental, and analytical approaches.

Abstract 
This paper presents a case study on the use robotic polishing used to polish co-extrusion dies using 
an active force control sensor. A system to test samples was setup using an ABB IRB 140 robot 
and an active force torque controller. A series of test samples was tested by the system using 
different force loads of 30N, 40N and 50N to determine the optimal force load required for the 
polishing process. Once the optimal force level and tool parameters were determined the polishing 
was carried out on the co-extrusion die. The results of the experimentation process are presented.

1. Introduction
Polishing is a material removal process normally carried out as the last step in the manufacturing process 
of a component. The process requires the use of an abrasive material which is rubbed against the surface to 
remove material and produce the required surface finish. Different size abrasive materials are used, 
normally starting with coarser material and finishing off with less coarse abrasive material. Assessing the 
quality of the finished surface can be accomplished using a surface analyzer. Traditional the polishing 
process is carried out by experienced operators relying on their experience. Obtaining the required surface 
finish is achieved by varying the amount of physical force applied during the process, using different tools 
and abrasive materials. The process is not only time consuming but physically demanding. This project was 
carried out as a feasibility study on behalf of Brampton Engineering, Ontario, Canada, to study the 
possibility of automating the polishing process of the extrusion die molds. The existing manual polishing 
process typically takes around 12 to 24 hours depending on the extrusion die mold complexity. To automate 
the polishing process using a robotic manipulator, will require controlling the contact force, the feed rate, 
the speed, programming the polishing tool path, and the polishing wheel speed. The paper presents the 
requirements for the robot hardware, robotic path planning techniques, the experimentation process and the 
results obtained for optimal extrusion die mold polishing.

4. Conclusion
The use of industrial robots in the automated polishing process has been limited mainly due to the requirements of the 
surface finish and also the complexity of the surface being polished. With advances in force torque sensor technology 
and also programming techniques it is now possible to achieve improved performance results for the polishing process 
at the same time reducing the lead times. In this paper a six axis robotic system with a force torque sensor for high 
precision extrusion die molds has been shown to producing results better than the bench mark requirements as well as 
reducing the lead time considerably. However the research has shown that the polishing process of the co extrusion 
die could not be polished a 100%. Final finishing will still need to be completed by manual process.

Abstract 
Especially smaller and medium size manufacturing companies in high wage countries struggle to be 
competitive at international markets. Therefore, the need to differentiate due to unique selling propositions 
implying maximized process quality and minimized costs is essential to business continuity.  
Within this paper, potentials of modern quality management by using Industry 4.0 technologies and 
approaches are assessed and prerequisites are evaluated. The classic target conflict: ‘time – quality – costs’ 
is addressed by a cloud-based web platform offering a broad diversity of real-time data consolidation, data 
analytics and process optimization-tools resulting in a digital production system. The subsequently called 
smart service platform (SSP) is accessible for third parties offering their cyber physical tools. The SSP 
ought to display the consolidated digital mapping of production sites to the human controller and therefore 
constitutes a solid basis for decision-making.  
Expert interviews were executed to identify the status-quo in digitalization and thus deviate potentials. 
Moreover, a definition of sector specific constraints in relation to operative needs and technical 
requirements of the SSP is established. Based on resulting key-findings an empirical study was conducted 
prioritizing industry objectives, requirements and expectation of such technologies. This paper closes with 
an outlook to a future scenario analysis.

Extended Abstract 
Over the past 30 years, cell production or cellular manufacturing has become an integral part of lean 
manufacturing systems, many organizations have applied cell production concepts in manufacturing and 
service processes. In a cell production system, factory floor labor is arranged into semi-autonomous and 
multi-skilled teams, or work cells, who manufacture complete products or complex components. Properly 
trained and implemented cells are more flexible and responsive than traditional mass-production lines. 
Successful implementation of cell production can achieve significant improvements in product quality, 
scheduling, space utilization, control of operations and employee morale.  
Academics and practitioners have paid a lot of attention to cell production system design problems, such as 
the best groupings for products, parts, or machine clusters. Some efforts have also been made toward 
selecting tools, jigs, and fixtures, determining process flow, determining cell capacity and selection of 
equipment. However, it has been reported that most of the problems faced by companies implementing cell 
production system were related to people, not technical issues. As surveyed by several researchers, 
implementation of cell production is not simply a rearrangement of the factory layout; it is a complex 
reorganization that involves organizational and human aspects. 
As major studies have put their emphasis on technical factors of cell production systems, there is a singular 
absence of articles investigating the impact of human factors on production cells. This is because human 
related issues are typically difficult to quantify. Although there are some literatures identifying and dealing 
with how human factors affect production cells, almost all of them were conducted based on questionnaires 
analysis or case studies. There are few researches that examine quantitatively human factors’ impact in cell 
production systems.  
We have made a series of experimental studies to investigate the impact of human factors. One of our 
previous studies has shown that both workers and their experience (learning effect) have significant impacts 
on the productivity of production cells, the impact of these two factors accounts for 67.01% and 19.63% 
respectively. As two-thirds of variance of the productivity were decided by workers, it is very important to 
measure workers’ aptitude and assign the right workers in the right place in order to implement cell 
production systems successfully.  
In this paper, we put our emphasis on measuring the workers’ aptitudes that significantly affect performance 
of production cells, and make several new contributions about the cell production research through the 
following examinations: 
(1) Different from most of previous researches that applied questionnaire survey or case study methods,
this paper applied the experimental study method. We designed and conducted a cell production
experiment, and used the assembly time to measure quantitatively productivity of production cells.
(2) In order to measure the workers’ personality, we applied a short form of Five Factor Personality
Questionnaire (FFPQ-50). FFPQ-50 is a 50-item questionnaire that measures the workers’ five super
traits: extraversion, attachment, controlling, emotionality, and playfulness. A principal component

Abstract  
Industry 4.0 is the new paradigm of the fourth industrial revolution; it embodies a smart industry by 
applying advanced information and communication systems, and high technology. These advancements 
evolved and assisted the supply chain to become a more adaptive network creating new opportunities for 
supply chain competitiveness. Management paradigms as lean and green can develop improvements in 
the supply chain. The integrative lean and green approach eliminates non-value added activities and at the 
same time reduces environment impacts and risks throughout the supply chain operations. This study is 
motivated by the lack of evidence how the lean and green supply chain should evolve to work efficiently 
in Industry 4.0 environment. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether Industry 4.0 can support 
the implementation of the lean and green supply chain. Based on literature review, a conceptualization of 
the relations between Industry 4.0, supply chain management and lean and green paradigms is presented. 
This paper provides an understanding of how this new industrial revolution incorporated lean and green 
supply chain paradigms.

and materials flow speed. How the communication between entities of the supply chain is made, is crucial for the 
supply chain competitiveness. All these innovations are possible due the structure of the high-technology application. 
One of the conclusions of this study is in line with GTAI (2014) “in Industry 4.0 supply chains will evolve into 
highly adaptive network”. Supply chains will be more flexible and with more visibility.  
With the application of the requirements of the Industry 4.0 in the different industry sectors, future research is 
required. For example, understand which lean and green supply chain characteristics are more important on the 
Industry 4.0 concepts implementation (in different sectors of industry); or the priorities of lean and green 
characteristics implementation in the Industry 4.0. In this new era of industrialization, it is expected that lean and 
green supply chain management will have better opportunities to be performed.

Abstract 
Complex, high-level customization products are usually produced in an environment known as Project 
Manufacturing, where each product is executed through a specific project that must meet defined goals of 
scope, cost, time and quality, which is known as ""iron triangle"". The performance of these projects can be 
influenced by elements known as Critical Success Factors (CSFs) that are widely discussed in the scientific 
literature without, however, having a consensus on their influence on the cited environment. Thus, this 
study aims to analyze the influence of CSFs on the chance of reaching the goals established for the projects 
in the ""iron triangle"". Despite the high number of CSF cited in literature, just a few are statistically 
significant to explain this phenomenon. They are: team integration, clear objectives, record lessons learned, 
use previous technologies, insert time and money reserves, and project risks identification. 
Keywords: Critical Success Factors, Project Manufacturing, Iron Triangle 
1. Introduction
Most of the world's product manufacturing is carried out by systems based on mass production where 
production lines or manufacturing cells generate a massive amount of a specific type of product. However, complex, 
high-level customization products cannot be produced in this way, they require a different approach known as Project 
Manufacturing. 
According to Yang (2013), Project Manufacturing, also known as Engineering-to-Order (ETO), is associated 
with chaotic production in situations of high complexity and uncertainty where each product is the final result of a 
project. In general, it involves the production of fully customized items, usually in a few or only one unit, with the 
product design being exclusively developed from the customer specifications. To Carvalho et al. (2015) Project 
Manufacturing is becoming increasingly important among production systems, particularly for the delivery of 
customized products. However, according to Gosling & Naim (2009), this type of environment has received less 
attention from researchers than high-volume production of standardized products like the Make-to-Stock (MTS). 
Project Manufacturing often involves the execution of multiple projects at the same time, with each one at a 
different stage and dividing resources into interactions that involves multiple parallel and sequential activities in an

Although the number of CSFs cited in the scientific literature is large, few presented statistical significance 
(be it 1%, 5% or 10%) to explain each of the success dimensions analyzed in this study. The model used showed good 
adjustment indicating that the use of the logistic regression technique is adequate to study the phenomenon being able 
to explain 51.2% of the data variance. In addition, it was possible to verify that among these elements there is a great 
variation between the level of influence exerted by each one (with Odds Ratio ranging from 1.840 to 6.905). 
It’s important to highlight that most of the CSFs that are statistically significant to explain this phenomenon 
are related to project management practices, indicating that in order to succeed in achieving iron triangle goals, 
managers should emphasize these elements. However, the greatest influence on the chances of reaching the goals in 
the iron triangle is in the use of previous technologies (CSF related to technical aspects), that is, to take advantage of 
the applied knowledge already developed by the organization executing the project. 
It is important to empathize that these results have also practical implications. Project managers can use them 
to support decisions and foment the presence of the CSFs to maximize the chances of project success. 
The main limitation of this study is the process of sampling, which is non-probabilistic and does not allow 
statistical inference (this process was chosen because it was necessary to evaluate the companies that would participate 
in the research regarding adherence to the topic and the capacity to respond). 
These results have also practical implications. Project managers can use them to support decisions and also 
foment the presence of the CSFs in order to maximize the chances of project success. 
For future works it is suggested to expand the analysis to other dimensions of project success, such as 
organizational learning or customer impact. It is hoped that this work can help advance the project management area, 
be it in terms of scientific knowledge for the academy or in subsidizing the decisions organizations that have this type 
of environment.

Abstract 
This paper considers the problem of managing inventory and routing problems in a two-stage 
supply chain system under a Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) policy. VMI is an inventory 
management policy in which the supplier assumes the responsibility of maintaining the inventory 
at the customers while ensuring that they will not run out of stock. The delivery times to the 
customers are no longer agreed in response to customers' orders; instead the supplier indicates 
when each delivery takes place. Under the VMI policy, the planning is proactive as it is based on 
the available information rather than reactive to retailers' orders. Thus, in this research, we assumed 
that the demand at each customer is stationary and the warehouse is implementing a VMI. The 
objective of this research is to minimize the inventory and the transportation costs of the customers 
for a two-stage supply chain system. The problem is to identify the delivery quantities, delivery 
times and routes to the customers for the single-period deterministic inventory routing problem 
(SP-DIRP) system. As a result, a linear mixed-integer program is established for the solutions of 
the SP-DIRP problem. Some sample tests have indicated that the integrated approach for the SP-
DIRP problem provides good result.

Abstract 
Remanufacturing has been identified as the most viable economically and environmentally product 
end-of-life (EOL) management strategy. However, about 80% of manufactured products currently 
end up as wastes. Meanwhile, some of the bottlenecks in product remanufacturing could be 
remedied by Product Service System (PSS). Therefore, the integration of remanufacturing and PSS 
as an improved product offering has been increasingly recommended. However, the analytical 
research on remanufacturing-PSS synergy is sparse, and the benefits of this integration at the early 
phase of product development has not been fully addressed. This paper identifies two important 
factors that are critical for the success of remanufacturing and PSS: core cleaning and product 
serviceability. In order to determine the eligible modules that are clustered into the product, 
modules are assessed in pairs, and the modular pair compatibility indices are obtained through 
fuzzy inference system. The critical factors are optimized and integrated at the modular product 
development phase in order to make improved product configuration decisions that will enhance 
remanufacturing and PSS.

Abstract 
Foundry industry technologies have evolved over the years largely due to rapid changes in technology 
resulting in complexities that require careful planning and organization. Materials in the foundry industry 
pass through various stages and a number of factors, ranging from preparation of charges, materials 
handling and routing, furnace and production scheduling influence the process flows through these 
interconnected stages. Such a complex network of activities pose some challenges to companies that 
traditionally employ manual means of production planning. Research was carried out at one of Zimbabwe’s 
largest foundry companies, prompted by the company’s failure to produce affordable grinding media on 
time and in turn forcing their main customers to prefer cheaper imports. The work study revealed that the 
company’s key challenges were in materials handling and transportation distances through the various 
workstations. This research focused on modelling the process flows using simulation with the aim of 
optimizing and reorganizing the foundry layout to reduce production costs, improve productivity and 
enhance efficiency. The resulting model of the optimal layout and process flows has been adopted and the 
company is gradually regaining its competitiveness and market share.

1. Introduction
A multitude of factors influence the process flows of materials in a foundry, ranging from the raw materials storage 
area where the charges are prepared through the weighbridge, back and forth laboratory analysis for materials quality 
and content, materials handling and transportation to the various furnaces, smelting, casting, fettling and finally sales 
and dispatch to customers. Owing to the interconnectedness and multiplicity of factors through these various stages, 
systems of this nature increasingly become complex posing some challenges in the analysis of these dynamic factors. 
In such a scenario, advanced techniques such as modelling and simulation, genetic algorithms, neural networks or 
fuzzy logic are required to assist in analyzing or predicting the performance of the system (Negahban & Smith, 2014). 
Each of the techniques has its own advantages and disadvantages in much the same way as each will be more suitable 
for certain scenarios and environments than others. In this research and case study, modelling and simulation were

busy workstations such as baling and fettling assisted in reducing idle and waiting times. The manufacturing 
throughput time per batch was computed from the summation of all the variable times for processing, waiting and 
transportation at each workstation. The throughput time for the original arrangement was compared with the times for 
the proposed and reorganized foundry layout obtained from the simulation runs and the setup that gave the highest 
reduction of 58% was chosen as the optimal layout. This reduction corresponded with the reduction in transportation 
distances from 467.7m to 198.3m as a result of the proposed direct process paths between interacting workstations as 
well as the proposed relocation of the weighbridge to an area adjacent to and between the scrap yard (baling) and the 
furnaces (smelting).  
With the anticipated savings from the reorganization of the foundry layout, the company is expected to gradually 
lower the production costs of grinding media, thereby remaining competitive. The savings can also be used to invest 
in other forms of high technology tools such as the Andon Light System for detecting manufacturing systems 
abnormalities and resolving them through viewing real time processes and tracing production events. Effective 
workstation management can be achieved through different alerting options such as emails, audio announcements and 
visual displays. Even though fuzzy logic was not employed in this research, it is recommended for condition 
monitoring and control of the various machine tools at the workstations. Further investments were recommended for 
automation, especially in view of the recent instalment of the CCM as well as the use of a commercial version of the 
Arena simulation software. In line with automation and the challenges observed in materials handling, Automated 
Guided vehicles (AGVs) will also be of great value to the company especially in the jobbing section for quick loading 
and unloading of parts or materials through the foundry and its auxiliary sections.  
6. Conclusions
Appropriate layout of machine tools in any manufacturing environment is critical, more so for a foundry where each 
workstation in the system is dependent on the others. The flow of materials through the system and the processing 
thereof, increasingly become complex in a setup where there are several units interconnected. The case study company 
has several such units that are interconnected in the processing and production of grinding media for the mining 
industry in Zimbabwe. Their traditional customers were preferring cheaper imports which were readily availed when 
needed but this company was failing to meet these needs coupled with failure to match prices for the imported products. 
A number of changes were proposed such as the relocation of the weighbridge, more direct process paths and flows 
between interacting workstations as well as adding more machines at workstations that were observed to have 
consistent queues. There were marked decreases in processing, waiting and transportation times within the reorganized 
layout, while the distances of the rerouted process paths decreased from 467.7m to 198.3m, which is expected to 
translate to reductions in product costs and improvements in yield and process efficiency. The manufacturing 
throughput time correspondingly decreased by about 58% compared to the original layout. Bottlenecks observed 
during the work study were identical to those obtained from the simulation runs and experiments, thereby validating 
the models. Although the company has gradually been implementing the proposed changes, there has been some slight 
increase in customers placing orders for grinding balls. This is however expected to improve as all the changes are 
completely implemented, coupled with the functional CCM. While this research contributed to resolving some of the 
challenges faced by the company in developing an optimized foundry layout, the company should consider investing 
in more equipment and technology such as the Andon Light System for detecting manufacturing defects, commercial 
version of the Arena simulation software, AGVs for ease of transportation of materials through the system as well as 
the use of fuzzy logic for monitoring and control of machine tools at workstations.

Abstract 
We study the problem of freight pricing using pricing break points with quantity discounts offered by 
liner shipping services to freight forwarders in maritime transportation. We propose a model that 
maximizes the liner shipping and the forwarders profits. The forwarders book slots on the vessels for 
every trip (usually weekly) in a quantity that is encouraged by a pricing scheme proposed by the liner 
services with a single breakpoint. The booking is done before the forwarders have an accurate idea about 
their transport demands, and therefore they model it using probabilistic representations. Since container 
transportation services cannot be stored and given the stochastic nature of demand, the studied problem 
can be considered as a newsvendor type problem. Moreover, we consider an accurate formulation of the 
cost function of the liner service in which the sailing speed is a decision variable. The model is an 
integrated decentralized two-stage optimization model where the forwarders constitute the first stage and 
the liner company the second, and in which the optimal decisions taken by one stage are taken into 
account in the optimization of the decisions of the other stage. A numerical application is provided to 
show the effectiveness of the model.

1. Introduction
Maritime shipping has been exceedingly booming in the last few decades, due to its cheapness and the fact that 
increasingly numerous companies that are producing in overseas countries due to lower production costs and other 
tariff and tax incentives, in addition to the online shopping companies that are developing vastly especially in China 
(Clemes et al., 2014).  
Liner shipping companies can improve their profits by using pricing techniques so that they may affect the number 
of containers forwarders are willing to ship using their services, especially that the service quality provided by 
different lines is more or less at the same level, which reduces the competition based on quality and makes freight 
rates the leading decision drive.  
The name “forwarders” is given to the linkage party between the liner shipping companies and the real shippers that 
owns basically the goods needed to be shipped overseas. These container forwarders collect the shipments from the 
good owners, like industrial or commercial companies, and ship them through the liner services which are selected 
based on the offered freight rates and the transit times. The forwarders’ profit is then the difference between the 
freight tariffs collected from real shippers (goods owner) and the freight tariffs paid to the liner companies indeed.

For the demand, we used normal probability distributions for every forwarder using a mean and a standard deviation 
inspired from the work of (Yin and Kim, 2012) 
4.2 Optimization Results  
The optimal results obtained from the implementation of the model in Mathematica are as follows: 
-
There is a proportional relationship between the vessel speed (𝑉𝑉) and the total cost (𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇(𝑉𝑉)), thus, there is
an inverse relationship between the vessel speed and total profit of the line (𝛱𝛱𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿). This is pretty expected
and totally clear and logical. However, Table 2 shows the relation by the numbers we’ve got in our model.
-
𝑄𝑄𝑑𝑑1 which satisfies Max. 𝛱𝛱𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 at all different vessel speeds (𝑉𝑉) is equal to 3835.45.
-
The absolute Max. 𝛱𝛱𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 is at 𝑄𝑄𝑑𝑑1 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜=  3835.45 and 𝑉𝑉𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜= 14 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘, which is the lowest speed in
the M list
-
The optimal cycle time S= 36 days
-
However, after 𝑉𝑉𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜, the next speed values at 𝑄𝑄𝑑𝑑1 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 are also leading to a successful QD scheme,
with higher profits.
-
The forwarders’ profits are provided in Table 3. It shows that two forwarders benefit from the scheme;
forwarder 2 and forwarder 5.

5. Conclusions
In conclusion, it was pointed out the importance of optimizing the profits for container transportation services 
provided by the liner shipping companies. The field of maritime shipping generally is not given the concern it 
deserves in the perspective of financial profitability, while many reviewers and researchers considered its 
environmental aspect. On the other hand, some studies considered mathematical optimization models for free 
shipping quantity orders determination for online businesses. However, it should be concerned the importance of 
optimizing the liner shipping services companies profits and costs. Indeed, under the QD scheme, the total optimal 
line profit (𝛱𝛱𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿) increased by 2.6 % which is 310,100 USD. 
For other not non-optimal total line profits (𝛱𝛱𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿), under the QD scheme, when the vessel speeds (𝑉𝑉) increase, the 
liner service achieved profits that reached 2.9%, which is 330,400 USD, this is at maximum vessel speed 𝑉𝑉 = 
28 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑓𝑓𝑘𝑘𝐶𝐶. Forwarders are benefiting from this scheme also, since any forwarder's optimal quantity to be ordered fits 
the condition: 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖 ≥ 𝑄𝑄𝑑𝑑1will get a discount in the freight rate. Moreover, indirect forwarders benefit is when the line 
minimizes its total cost, which may have an effect on the line’s freight rate 𝑊𝑊0. In this study, more attention is paid 
to the decision variables that really affect the whole liner shipping services’ profit, which are the freight rates and 
the sailing speed. It also considered the effect on the maritime supply chain partners, namely the forwarders and 
shippers. In other words, if a liner shipping company guarantees encouraging pricing schemes for its forwarders and 
shippers and suitable sailing speed, then this liner shipping company is winning the bid and getting the customers’ 
loyalty, since that forwarders or shippers are frequent customers with frequent, or at least periodic, demand to ship

goods. This raises the real importance of structuring such mathematical optimization models to contribute to the 
literature and add value to the maritime shipping field and literature. 
Nevertheless, a better addition to our model is to determine the optimal discounted freight rate  (𝑊𝑊𝑑𝑑1) to guarantee 
even more total line profit (𝛱𝛱𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿). Moreover, it would be great to integrate the demand sensitivity to speed, since that 
the vessel speed affects directly the total sailing cycle time S. these two additions are already our concerns in further 
developing this optimization model. A further dimension would add a great value, is considering the 𝐶𝐶𝑆𝑆2 emissions, 
which is a global environmental concern raising these years.

Abstract 
Most mineral processing companies are energy intensive especially if smelting is used in extraction. After 
processing, the energy is correspondingly dissipated as heat and toxic gases, requiring stringent controls 
for sustainability and safety. In recent years, Southern Africa has grappled with power shortages resulting 
in the scaling down of company operations. Increases in manufacturing activities demand for more energy 
but this has evidently outstripped supply due to the depletion of natural resources. Mineral processing 
industries are probably the worst affected due to fluctuations in world metal prices. These challenges require 
sustainable production strategies to remain in business. This research was carried out at a platinum 
processing company in Zimbabwe which uses smelting in extractive metallurgy, consuming millions of 
dollars in energy but also dissipating this as heat and furnace exhaust gases. The focus of the research was 
on finding ways to turn these challenges into opportunities by recovering the heat and using it for other 
purposes. A waste heat and energy recovery system was designed to work in conjunction with the smelters 
and electrostatic precipitator. The proposed system is expected to increase furnace efficiency by 8.5% with 
an anticipated output of 1.033 MW and an overall plant efficiency of 22.7%.

1. Introduction
Mineral processing plants that utilize smelting in their extractive metallurgy consume a lot of energy and equally 
energy in the form of heat and smelter off-gases are emitted as waste in the process. Some of the furnace exhaust gases 
are toxic and harmful to the environment and operators within these plants. Proper handling and control of the smelter 
off-gases is critical to ensure that the extraction and disposal conforms to environmental policies governing the 
communities where the operations are domiciled (Shang & Scott, 2011). The research was carried out at a mineral 
processing company specializing in the mining and processing of platinum group metals and observations made during 
the work study revealed that the smelters emit off-gas at temperatures ranging from 350oC – 400oC and in the process 
a lot of heat energy is lost. In such operations, management and control of the off-gas should be in such a way that 
any leakages are prevented and that the furnace exhaust gases, mostly the toxic Sulphur Dioxide, SO2 are properly

6. Conclusions
Mineral processing companies that utilize smelters in their extractive processes not only consume a lot of energy but 
also dissipate proportionate and corresponding amounts in smelter off-gas and heat. Efforts have been made by many 
researchers to capture the toxic gases, mainly SO2 while some researched on how to recover and reuse the heat 
generated and dissipated by the smelters. Due to the dangers involved and the anticipated costs for the former, focus 
has been more on the latter. In this research, a waste heat and energy recovery system that consists of thermodynamic 
equipment such as heat exchangers, economizer, regenerator, evaporator and radial turbine was proposed and designed 
for use in conjunction with the Hatch-Elkem 13.5 MVA furnace and Pierce-Smith converters at the case study PGM 
processing company in Zimbabwe. Based on the design and calculations carried out, the anticipated heat energy 
recovery output was 1.033 MW with an overall plant efficiency of 22.7%, estimated equipment cost of $ 430,190 and 
a return on investment of 0.438 years, based on the annual energy savings from the recovery. The system is also 
anticipated to be sustainable and environmentally friendly as there will be no emissions to the atmosphere from the 
closed loop system. However, further work is required to incorporate control systems to monitor inlet and outlet 
temperatures, pressure, flow rates and for detecting leakages and clogging.

The term industry 4.0 comprises a wide array of technological solutions from fields such as communication 
technologies, robotics, virtualization and data analysis. Although the use of automation and information 
technology in manufacturing is not a new phenomenon and has been propagated since the 1970ies, recent 
studies emphasize that companies do not know how to approach this new wave of digitization. A wide 
range of consulting whitepapers has emerged proposing to give guidance.  
Against this background we synthesize both academic and applied literature to build a framework on 
research streams connected to industry 4.0. By focusing on advanced manufacturing technology literature 
(AMT) in particular, we give a structured overview on technological and organizational capabilities past 
research showed to enable successful AMT implementation and which are equally important addressing 
today’s technological changes. Further, we highlight questions arising from industry 4.0 the past research 
in AMT missed to address.  
We aim to contribute to the emerging topic of industry 4.0 in three ways: Firstly, consolidating the breadth 
of definitions and situating industry 4.0 within academic literature. Secondly, closing the gap between 
practitioner’s advice and academically sound research and lastly, highlighting research gaps and drawing 
connections to other literature streams beyond operations management.

Abstract 
One of the most critical requirements for safety in vehicles is the availability of reliable braking systems. 
Most heavy vehicles in Zimbabwe employ the conventional hydraulic braking system. However changes 
and improvements in technology have seen the introduction of retarders that make use of magnets and eddy 
currents. The new technology is friction free but still deemed expensive and thus not yet readily acceptable 
to vehicle manufacturers for fears of reliability and cost. Hydraulic brakes are equally expensive in the long 
run owing to maintenance and frequent replacement of brake pads and rotors, particularly in Zimbabwe 
where the road infrastructure has deteriorated significantly over the years. A case study was carried out at 
a Zimbabwean company which specializes in the sales, service and backup of Scania heavy vehicles, with 
a special focus on the braking systems. The aim of the research was to conceptualize and compare various 
options and concepts of the eddy current retarders. Analysis for the chosen option were made for reliability 
and efficiency using an industrial engineering approach, with the objective of supplementing hydraulic 
brakes and recommending the sustainable use of such technology to the company and thereby dispelling 
any fears of reliability and cost.

1. Introduction
Zimbabwe’s road infrastructure network has been deteriorating over the years owing to a number of reasons such as 
economic, political or natural disasters, to the extent of serious disrepair. This has been exacerbated by the incessant 
rains caused by Cyclone Dineo, towards the end of 2016 and most of the early part of 2017 resulting in floods and 
extensive damage to the road network. The rundown of the road network has become extremely dangerous to road 
users (Tshuma, 2016). The excessive damage, as shown in the collage on Figure 1, pushed the government to declare 
the capital, Harare’s roads a state of national disaster in terms of the Civil Protection Act (Ruwende, 2017). The 
damage to the roads has been a combination of all 3 factors; economic, political and natural disasters and thus cannot

after which the electronic interfacing system should reactivate the retarder progressively for proper braking. 
Connection designs are also recommended as effective controls especially mountainous terrain where the retarder 
activation is on long gradients, an independent brake pedal control is required. This can be built either in the dashboard 
or mounting to the steering column to enable the activation of the retarder in the different positions. An accurate 
thermal model is also required for modelling the conductive, convective, and radiant heat transfer in the brake. The 
modelling of the gradients inside the brake may also be necessary for accurate performance prediction, especially in 
heavy duty applications where the brake heats up significantly and fast response is required. The results can be used 
to determine the importance of these gradients and uneven and damaged roads. The retarder should also be preserved 
from the metal debris since this will be attracted by the magnets and may result in malfunctioning. Further research, 
fabrication and experimentation with the prototype of this conceptual model may be useful to determine practical 
performance against the proposed model. Regular maintenance and checking as well as pressure washing periodically 
will ensure that the retarder is free of debris and hence longer life spans, the exact periods of which vary depending 
on the usage of the vehicles. Further analysis of the application of the integrated brake in heavy vehicles can be 
pursued by using complete dynamic models of the vehicles and actual driving situations to give precise understanding 
of the dynamic operation of the integrated brake in anti-lock, traction, dynamic stability control applications and allow 
for a complete design of the integrated brake controller. 
6. Conclusions
This research was motivated by observations made at a company that specializes in the service and backup support 
for heavy vehicles. The frequent servicing and replacement of hydraulic friction brakes purportedly owing to the 
damaged road infrastructure in Zimbabwe required innovative solutions to cut down on the costs for maintenance. 
Based on the developed concept for electromagnetic brakes, 3 concepts were analyzed and the chosen option was 
developed further to incorporate positive attributes of the other concepts coupled with improvements leading to the 
proposed frictionless electromagnetic retarder that employs permanent magnets mounted on the transmission shaft of 
the vehicle to supplement the hydraulic friction brakes as well as reduce the amount of wear on the brake pads and 
their frequent replacement. Analysis of the proposed design showed that it would be able to provide sufficient braking 
torque to control a heavy vehicle such as a bus or truck. The estimated cost of the proposed retarder was $1,995.00, a 
reasonable amount that can adequately be covered by the savings on maintenance costs. However, further work will 
be required to develop the proposed design into a prototype that can be experimented on to determine practical 
performance on different terrains and road conditions.

Abstract 
This paper considers a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) problem where a set of alternatives are to 
be evaluated or ranked. However, unlike in a traditional MCDM approach, each alternative is evaluated by 
a distinct group of decision makers who are different from those evaluating the other competing 
alternatives. In addition, the decision makers for each alternative are large (in hundreds and above). We 
propose a sampling based modeling technique to transform this special type of MCDM problem into a 
traditional MCDM format. Following this, the sampling distributions of the ranks of the alternatives are 
displayed with Boxplot to aid decision making. A numerical example showing the effectiveness of the 
proposed approach is presented.

1. Introduction
Many important decisions in life are made through selecting from, or ranking a group of competing alternatives based 
on multiple and often, conflicting criteria. Problems of such nature have been studied and solved with Multi-Criteria 
Decision Making (MCDM) methods due to their ability to consider both qualitative and quantitative data, as well as 
the ability to combine multiple and often conflicting criteria. Many evaluation methods exists in the MCDM literature, 
including Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) (Saaty, 2008), Technique For Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal 
Solution (TOPSIS) (Hwang and Yoon, 2012; Behzadian et al, 2012), ELECTRE (Velasquez, and Hester, 2013), 
DEMATEL (Shieh, Wu, and Huang, 2010), and VIKOR (Opricovic and Tzeng, 2004 ). Several techniques have also 
been developed in the literature to handle different types of information or data including crisp, fuzzy, interval, 
intuitionistic fuzzy, and hesitant fuzzy (Aruldoss, Lakshmi, and Venkatesan, 2013; Zavadskas, Turskis, and Kildienė, 
2014). This paper builds upon the growing MCDM literature, and considers a type of MCDM problem where the 
decision makers evaluating competing alternatives are (1) very large in number compared to those in typical MCDM 
applications, (2) the large decision makers are themselves a representative of an even larger body of decision makers, 
and (3) the decision makers differ for every alternative.  
In standard MCDM approaches, a group of alternatives are each evaluated by the same group of decision makers 
(usually few in number) over some selected criteria (Hwang and Yoon, 2012). For example, a company might convene 
a number of industry experts to evaluate and select the best supplier for a particular product (see for example in Ho, 
Xu, and Dey, 2010; Boran, Genç, Kurt, and Akay, 2009). In this case, every supplier (i.e. alternative) would be 
evaluated by each of the experts. However, there exist a form of decision problems that exhibits MCDM properties 
but where the group of decision makers evaluating say, alternative A might be entirely different from those 
evaluating

5. Conclusion
In this paper, a new technique that extends the traditional MCDM approach to decision making was developed to 
handle ranking and selection decision making problems with large and distinct decision makers. The approach 
provides a new way of analyzing ranking and selection problems where opinions are elicited from a large populace 
such as customer service evaluation of competing companies, and product selection based on online customer reviews. 
A characteristic of such problems is that, often surveyed respondents have an experience with only one alternative 
making them unable to comment on other alternatives. This character of distinctness of the decision makers render 
the traditional MCDM ranking/selection techniques not useful since general MCDM approaches require that each 
decision maker evaluate every alternative. The proposed approach transforms this unique problem onto the traditional 
MCDM format for easier analysis and interpretation by imagining the ranking performed by a randomly chosen 
decision maker. This approach therefore makes it possible to apply MCDM methods to problems where competing 
alternatives are evaluated by the larger public, such as in market surveys and product reviews by customers. To most 
organizations and industries, the proposed technique offers a convenient tool to analyze surveys on customer 
satisfaction and product performance in relation to their competitors. More so, the bootstrap sampling method 
underpinning the proposed technique helps ensure the final result is a true reflection of the larger customer population. 
The applicability of the proposed technique was demonstrated using a real-world data on service performance of 
mobile network providers in Ghana from the perspective of customers. The example demonstrate the capability of the 
proposed technique to generate ordinal ranking for the alternatives, as well as put into perspective the real gap in 
performance between competing alternatives.  
On the overall service performance of mobile network providers in Ghana from the perspective of customers, it is 
seen that VODAFONE ranks number 1, followed by TIGO, which is closely followed by AIRTEL. MTN and GLO 
come number 4 and 5 respectively. Given the competitive and fast changing nature of the industry in terms of market 
share, the result therefore is an indication that MTN and GLO need to improve upon their service performances.

Abstract 
The Zimbabwean manufacturing and service industries are struggling to survive in the current country’s 
economic state. Industrial Engineering (IE) is a branch of Engineering that pursues organisational efficiency 
through methods improvement and resource-saving. The world as a whole is now anxious about the 
environment, this suggests that the next evolution of Industrial Engineering will include subjects on greener 
manufacturing. The paper examines how Industrial Engineering (IE) and Environmental Sustenance ideas 
may be applied to the Zimbabwean industry and the benefits that can be drawn from this application in order 
to improve the operations in Zimbabwean Industries.

1. Introduction
Even though developing countries in the Sub-Saharian Africa have a higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) than the 
rest of the word, Africa remains the poorest continent in the world. Its per capita GDP declined from 18% of the world 
average in 1960 to 11% of the world average in 2011. (Yifu Lin, 2012) Africa is the only region in the world whose 
development status has been a crucial topic in the summits of G8 since 2000. Access to modern energy and technology 
and its proper management is the one solution to lead to sustainable development faced in this continent (Angeliki N. et 
al, 2016). Despite the factors that lower commodity prices and a less-supportive global environment the economic 
activity in sub-Saharan Africa has slowed severely. The region’s output is only expected to expand by 1.4 percent in 
2016, the worst growth performance in more than 20 years, and the loss in momentum over the last two years has been 
on par with the deep slowdowns of previous decades. In figure 1 the GDP growth rates are averaged across corresponding 
years of the previous episodes of rapid slowdown centered around 1977, 1983, 1992, and 2009. The current slowdown 
is centered on 2016. (IMF, 2016).

7.7 Motion economy 
1. Industrial engineering studies how workers perform their jobs, such as how workers or operators pick up
electronic components to be placed in a circuit board or in which order the components are placed on the board.
The goal is to reduce the time it takes to perform a certain job and redistribute work so as to require fewer workers
for a given task.
2. Industrial engineering frequently conducts time studies or work sampling to understand the typical role of a
worker. Systems such as MOST have also been developed to understand the work content of a job.

personnel and to arrive at sound policy
vii.
Materials handling analysis: to scientifically analyse the movement of materials through various departments
to eliminate unnecessary movement and to enhance the efficiency of material handling
viii.
Ergonomics (human engineering): it is concerned with the study of relationship between man and his working
conditions to minimize mental and physical stress. It is concerned with man-machine system
ix.
System analysis:  the study of various sub-systems and elements that make a system, their interdependencies
(connections) in order to design, modify and improve them to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness

as a must to companies in Zimbabwe. The industrial engineering personnel can act as catalysts in this endeavor. But the 
guiding spirit should come from top management. Training in Industrial Engineering and Environmental Sustenance 
techniques should be the motivator for all manufacturing and service companies in order to improve on their 
performance. Training should also be instituted with the same passion given to making of profits.

Abstract 
The objectives of the circular economy require manufacturers not only to shift from linear supply chain 
approaches towards inter-company production networks, but also to trace all flows of material and energy 
within the network as well as at its boundaries with the natural environment. Research on production 
networks has been limited in that studies focus on a single or a small set of production phases or 
production methods or that only linear cause-effect-relationship are being studied. Consequently, 
feedback and feedforward loops are insufficiently captured in these partial studies. This paper closes the 
gap by conceptualizing production networks that include the entire product lifecycle including the 
resulting complex structures and interdependencies. The paper introduces a framework with standardized 
modules (modelled as input-output systems) that can be combined into alternative product-independent 
production networks. Depending on the requirements modules of different granularity are presented. The 
paper then applies the framework to the case of car manufacturing and recycling. The merits of this 
innovative research are twofold. Such a material and energy flow framework was previously not 
available, thus the research promises original results. Furthermore, the results can serve as excellent input 
for companies in their planning and assessment of environmentally oriented production networks.

Abstract  
Waste is a serious challenge that impacts the economy of any nation and its environment. In Africa where 
the even increasing population has consequently increased the production rate with a human response to 
generate more waste, there has not been adequate approach to reduce and manage waste properly in the 
continent. With this ever increasing growth comes the need to provide food and social amenities needed 
to sustain the growing population. However, associated with the increase in the amount of waste 
generated is the continual loss of capital and a social and environmental cost to the populace.  In this 
paper, we provide an overview of the nature of waste in the South Africa, the application and utilization 
of waste in the South Africa context and we also look at the cost of waste generated in the society in 
relation to the economy, society and the environment.

1. Introduction
As far back as 2012, South Africa generated as a high as 9 million tons of food waste in a year (Mckenzie, M, 2012).  
Data obtained by (Savides, 2016) shows that South Africa now generates a total of 108 million tons of waste with 
only less than 10 percent of the waste recycled. Waste in South Africa is classified as general waste and hazardous 
waste. Domestic, building and demolition, business and inert wastes constitute the general waste categories. 
Hazardous waste are known for its that detrimental effect on the populace. The amount of hazardous waste does 
matter as its inherent chemical and toxicological characteristics have lasting effect on the populace (Nkosi et al, 
2013).  Waste varies from agricultural waste, industrial waste and food waste. A high portion of waste generated in 
the society are from fruits, processed foods and food waste from households Some part of the food available are

technology, these wastes can be converted to Biogas , a renewable energy  whose cost of production is cheaper 
compared to  energy production from fossil fuels. Disposal of food waste to landfill comes at cost based on the 
financial and external costs associated with the landfill itself. In South Africa, household food waste costs R21.7 
billion per year which is equivalent to 0.82% of South Africa’s annual GDP. This cost is significant in that 
household food waste accounts for less than 4% of total food losses across the food supply chain (Nahman A. et. al., 
2012). 
 
4.2 Social Cost of Waste 
 
As waste increases in the community, the availability of land required for other sustainable project are reduced. 
Even more significant is the fact that more tax payer money will be utilized in the disposal of the waste. Therefore, 
more education and insight must be applied by the industry in designing product which yield less waste for the 
community. Also, water used for irrigation is wasted with every tonne of food waste. South African agriculture is 
majorly dependent on irrigation. Thus food waste comes at a cost in terms of water loss to the nation and this is 
more costly now that the nation experienced drought in the last few years. 
 
4.3 Environmental cost of waste 
 
In a typical dumpsite, the accumulation of waste in such location without the thought of further processing gives rise 
to the release of methane into the atmosphere. The emission of greenhouse gas (GHG) results in the depletion of the 
ozone layer (Global warning). This is one of the 4 other gases released into the atmosphere. Methane as a GHG is at 
least 20 times more potent than Carbon dioxide despite staying for a shorter time in the atmosphere. It is directly 
responsible for at least 25 percent of the global warming issues.  Another environmental cost is the air pollution. 
This is an ever prevalent issue as different emission leads to infection of humans and sicknesses such as asthma.  
Leachates form dump site flow into the water body, sometimes leading to the destruction of aquatic life and loss of 
biodiversity process (UNEP, 2009; Buzby, J.C. and Hyman, J, 2012).  
 
Conclusion 
 
In this paper, the waste type typical to South Africa has been highlighted.  It is very clear the need to find other 
means of utilizing about 90 percent of the waste disposed via landfills in South Africa.  Different approach has been 
suggested to handle this problem. In fact, waste and its maintenance are costlier than what is assumed at face value. 
A detailed analysis of the cost of waste makes any nation have a rethink on the generation of waste. Therefore, it is 
imperative that wastes need to be managed properly. If this is not done, waste that are not  eliminated, reduced or 
recycled will continually have a  negative impact on the economy and the social aspect of any nation and at large, 
the environment where we all live in.

Abstract 
Robotics has been applied to assist autistic people with different approaches and therapy goals. In this 
paper, we describe the results of an exploratory analysis of research approaches, methods and paradigms 
that frequently are used and reported. Our critical perspective seeks links to the social responsibility in 
terms of inclusive employability and equity. We have found that research is geared towards robotic 
assistance to therapists typically to improve relationship skills. The use of robots, moreover, implies that 
specialists are not necessarily present all the time so it is essential that autistic people accept the robot as a 
supporting technology. We conclude that is common to find research that focus on experimental design 
with a robot action in scheduled moments, physically controlled when people are exposed. In addition, 
experiments with robotics applications in virtual worlds interconnected with “physical world” under a 
cyber-physical concept are not frequently considered. However, evidence of validated progress in clinical 
terms is not conclusive, so this seems to be a real limitation for employability increase of autistic people. 
Also, research with rigorous methods aimed at obtaining robust clinical results is a great opportunity, 
especially if a strong link is made in increasing the employability of autistic people.

quasi-experimental exploratory method commonly used must evolve towards proposals more oriented to the 
evidence based on clinical results with study of causality.  
In addition, most of the proposals focus on a face-to-face work of robots in interaction with autistic persons and the 
applications in virtual worlds interconnected that allow to extend the robotic interactions without presence of the 
therapist are not frequent. 
5. Conclusions and Future Works
According with Diehl J, Schmitt L. M., Villano M, Crowell C.R. (2012), Begum M., Serna R.W., Yanco H.A. 
(2016) and Cho Seong-Jin & Ahn Dong Hyun (2016), we found that the purpose of many of the investigations is 
oriented towards the study of “responses to robots or robot-like characteristics, eliciting behavior, modeling, 
teaching, or practicing skills and providing feedback or encouragement, that is, the use of a robot as purveyor of 
behavioral contingencies or social support during an activity” (Diehl J., 2012). However, in this work we also find a 
fifth teleological category: the purpose of stimulating the human-human relationship with the robot as a linking 
instrument (Costa S. et al, 2015; Costescu C.A., Vanderborght B. & David D.O., 2015; Sang-Seok Yun, JongSuk 
Choi & Sung-Kee Park, 2016). In this fifth teleological category, there is the intensive use of virtualization 
technologies and greater application of machine learning to adapt to a specific ludic objective. 
We also conclude that is common to find research that focus on experimental design with a robot action in scheduled 
moments, physically controlled when people are exposed. However, evidence of validated advances in clinical terms 
is still incipient, so this seems to be a real limitation for employability increase of autistic people. 
In the future, research with rigorous methods aimed at obtaining evidence-based clinical results is a great 
opportunity, especially if a strong link is made in increasing the employability of autistic people. In this sense, the 
quasi-experimental exploratory method commonly used must evolve towards proposals more oriented to the 
evidence based on clinical results with study of causality. 
Another great opportunity for research in the future is the use of virtual reality experience of autistic people in 
combination with an avatar of a physical robot. This is an innovative way to search continuous and real time 
exposure to therapy protocols without therapist physical supervision but virtual, taking into account that experiments 
with robotics applications in virtual worlds interconnected with “physical world” under a cyber-physical concept are 
not frequently considered.

Abstract 
In recent years, material imports in the steel industry has increased for several reasons, therefore efforts 
have focused on optimizing port logistics processes to increase their efficiency. The steel slab is a semi-
finished steel product of rectangular section, obtained by continuous casting processes for its use in 
rolling mills to produce rolled steel rolls. On the other hand, the port of Brownsville represents for the 
company under study the main point for the importation of steel slabs. Due the demand growth of this 
material in the last years and the reduction of space in the closest yards to the unloading zone inside the 
port, the management of the material handling is indispensable. The case study presented on this article 
aims to reduce costs in their logistic processes in the importation of steel slabs starting on the material 
unload of the ship to the load of rail wagons that go to plant. Based on the methodology for the analysis 
of logistics processes a reduction of more than 30% of logistics costs was calculated.

Abstract 
Waste management in health institutions has become important in recent years because of the increase in 
population and industrialization. Waste generated from health institutions has risks for human health and 
the environment. Therefore, this paper presents a reverse logistics optimization for waste collection and 
disposal in Turkish health institutions. A multiperiod, multitype product waste reverse logistics network 
was designed to build an effective collection and disposal system for waste generated from health 
institutions in Turkey. A mixed integer linear programming model was developed to determine the optimal 
number and locations of the facilities for efficient waste management in health care by minimizing the total 
cost. In this context, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the impact of the incremental changes 
of waste amounts on the optimal reverse logistics network. According to increasing waste amounts, the 
numbers of changes in facilities are analyzed and strategies are specified.

1. Introduction
In recent years, waste management in health institutions has gained importance because of the damage of medical 
waste on human health and the environment. Medical waste occurring as a result of increased population and 
industrialization has become an important environmental problem (Bajeva et al., 2000).  In fact, although waste 
generated from health institutions occupies less space in terms of quantity, it has the greatest risk of all waste groups. 
Additionally, disposal processes could be a significant problem in terms of cost management. 
Today, the reverse logistics models for the proper collection and disposal of waste generated from health institutions 
have gained importance in health-care waste management, in order to reduce the hazards of waste and prevent its 
negative effects on the environment. The application of reverse logistics on waste generated from health institutions 
helps to manage and optimize the flow of waste, and to design an effective disposal system. This study investigates 
domestic and medical waste collection and disposal from health institutions in Turkey, considering the reverse 
logistics activities of collection, storage, and transportation of waste, as well as processing waste according to the 
different types, and its final distribution to regular storage areas. Consequently, the design of a cost-effective and 
efficient reverse logistics network system is a very important issue for the disposal of waste generated from health 
institutions.

Figure 8 presents the total costs in the reverse logistics network on the basis of 3 periods and different scenarios. As 
can be seen from the graph, at the end of the time periods the total cost increases, in line with the increasing unit 
processing, transportation, and facility costs. Depending on the scenario, a 10% increase in waste causes significant 
changes in the total cost. According to the multiperiod model, investments that are essential for further periods may 
be carried out with the consideration of the long-term planning results. 
Some of specific results can be proposed from the Turkish aspect. Sterilization centers are expected to be established 
in locations with high population density. It is also observed that sterilization centers are generally opened in the 
central part of the country and sea coast cities. Burying with lime centers are generally established in cities that do not 
have a sterilization center. Opening these facilities in cities with low population density could be encouraged and 
planning could be designed accordingly for the future. 
When analyzing results, it is seen that opening rates of facilities increased, especially after scenario 4. In addition, the 
opening rates of facilities closest to the storage centers were higher. This is important, once again, in terms of 
eliminating transportation cost. When considering cost analysis, it is observed that the operation cost factor has the 
largest value, and the transportation cost factor has the second largest. The total fixed costs of the facilities and 
inventory cost are quite low compared to other cost factors. Some of general discussions can be obtained by using the 
proposed multitype waste, multiperiod, multitype facility reverse logistics model; 
Figure 4.Total cost of reverse logistics network over the planning horizon. 
Despite increasing waste amounts and cost factors according to the inflation rate, the environmental decision support 
system provides a minimized system cost and allocates waste flows to different facilities cost-effectively. The 
proposed model provided important highlights about how a multiperiod reverse logistics network may evolve over 
time. It also obtained some essential insights into the fact that processing centers are located according to potential 
savings in transportation costs between facilities. Moreover, by using the proposed multiperiod, multitype waste 
reverse logistics network, it is able to provide an environmentally friendly decision support for both the current 
situation and long-term planning, which can be concluded by waste disposal planning and inventory control in an 
integrated process. 
The practical approach of the proposed reverse logistics model covers many factors, such as suppliers, waste managers, 
processing centers, distributors, and operational elements, so that a systematic strategic model can be obtained between 
all echelons in a multitype waste, multiperiod reverse logistics network, rather than individual operational and 
inventory planning. Using the proposed reverse logistics network design would lead to optimized productivity with 
effective inventory management within capacity constraints. 
7. Conclusions
Waste management in health institutions has become more important in the contemporary world. The waste arising 
from health institutions generates serious risks due to the increasing number of facilities. Also, in Turkey, the health 
sector has developed in recent years owing to the increase in population and industrialization. Moreover, cost 
optimization has become important for efficient waste management in health institutions.  In this study, a reverse 
logistics optimization was conducted for waste collection and disposal in health institutions in Turkey. Hence, the

reverse logistics system for waste generated from health institutions in Turkey was discussed, and different scenarios 
were simulated for different waste quantities. For the analysis, a 3-year multiperiod was considered and mixed integer 
linear programming model was proposed to determine the required numbers, types, and locations of facilities to 
minimize the The proposed multiperiod model considers several features of practical relevance, namely: a multiperiod 
setting, modular capacities and waste quantities, variable operational costs, finite capacity and inventory levels, and a 
cost-oriented objective function. A possible avenue for future research is to develop a decision support model for the 
waste collection and disposal system of health institutions in Turkey.

Abstract 
An important effort of academic research has been realized to improve ambulance response time (the time between the 
receipt of a call at the dispatch center and the arrival of the ﬁrst emergency response vehicle at the scene). This study 
recommends the application of Lean Transportation concepts to achieve shorter ambulance response times. The approach 
considers the reduction of the time required to travel distance in excess waste by placing ambulances in optimal locations 
through mathematical modeling. In this project this is applied to the Monterrey metropolitan operations of the Mexican Red 
Cross. Results of the application are provided. 
Keywords:

1. Introduction
As described by Glushak et al., (1997), the principal function of Emergency Medical Service (EMS) systems is to provide 
patients with urgently needed emergency medical care and to transport them to an emergency medical facility, if needed. 
Mexican EMS institutions started emerged formally at the beginning of the last century. According to Fraga-Sastrias et al., 
(2010) about a third of the institutions are non-governmental organizations financed through donations. One of the main 
private institutions that provide emergency medical services is the Mexican Red Cross which was founded in 1910. Also, as 
stated in Pinet-Peralta (2005), these institutions are not strictly supervised in terms of coordination, regulation and 
performance evaluation.  
The efﬁciency of EMS systems is a major public concern worldwide. Its performance is highly related to health issues of 
life or death, in particular, with patients with strokes, severe trauma and cardiac arrest cases.  This study recommends the 
application of the Lean Transportation approach (Villarreal 2012; Simmons et al., 2004; Sternberg et al., 2013) to achieve 
shorter ambulance response times. In this project this is applied for the improvement of ambulance response time for the 
Monterrey metropolitan operations of the Mexican Red Cross. The scheme suggested by Lankenau et al., (2016) to eliminate 
wastes related mainly to the ambulance performance efficiency is used to improve response time by placing ambulances in 
optimal locations through mathematical modeling. The organization´s operations in the Monterrey metropolitan area felt that 
the current average response time estimated in 19.9 minutes needed to be reduced significantly to satisfy international 
standards.  
This paper consists of five sections. Sections one gives a brief review of the literature on lean healthcare and 
transportation, and a description of the scheme utilized to decrease waste. The application of this scheme is undertaken in 
section 3 and section 4 presents conclusions and recommendations. 
2. Review of Lean Transportation and Healthcare Literature
Lean thinking has proven to be an effective way of improving healthcare organizations. The increasing number of 
implementations reported in the literature supports this view. An initial consideration about the use of lean concepts is offered 
by Heinbuch (1995), in the particular case of just-in-time. Some later publications that describe further applications are 
(Chalice 2007; Zidel 2006; Brandao 2009). Similarly to the case for the manufacturing and administrative processes, it is 
necessary to define the concept of waste or value for healthcare organizations. Two waste frameworks are provided by 
Bentley et al., (2008) and Graban (2016). The first suggest a framework of three types of waste; administrative; operational; 
and clinical. The second framework proposes an extension of the seven Toyota manufacturing wastes to the healthcare area. 
Both waste classifications are more suitable for process improvement inside the health institution.

4. Conclusions and recommendations
As previously mentioned, an important issue in current EMS operations concerns the improvement of ambulance response 
time. This study recommends the application of Lean Transportation concepts to achieve better ambulance response times. 
The approach considers the reduction of the time required to travel distance in excess waste by placing ambulances in optimal 
locations through mathematical modeling. In particular, the DSM model is applied to the Monterrey metropolitan operations 
of the Mexican Red Cross. The results of the model imply an increase in the number of required ambulances. In addition, it 
also suggests new locations for them.  
After reviewing the recommendations, the management of the institution decided to implement a pilot program 
considering the limited resources available at the end of year 2016. The idea behind this move was to have further results to 
justify an increase in the operations budget for improving response time during year 2017. Further work related to this study 
includes the determination of the number and location of ambulances during holidays and summer. The same scheme is also 
considered to be used as an aid for strategic medium range planning.

Abstract 
 
Systems thinking is a conceptual language that encourages professionals into using ""feedback 
loop"" thinking rather than mere linear thinking. In order to analyze a problem, a process of 
building a model of the interrelationship between the various variables of the system took place 
in an Israeli factory, in a country of mixture cultures and social backgrounds. The process of 
building a model involved many participants of different positions in the factory, composing a 
diverse group with varied inputs.  Since the participants in the model building process were 
chosen from various levels within the company, they were also from diverse backgrounds in 
terms of their cultural background, socio-economic status and their work position. These 
impact their way of thinking and their opinions on the problem. It is therefore vital for research 
management teams to acknowledge these differences between group members in order to 
understand the contradictory information that may come up from different parts of the group. 
This variety in problem conceptualization may also arise in knowledge elicitation by using 
both the group model building process and personal conversations. Revealing this kind of 
cultural mixture allows a continuous improvement process of knowledge elicitation through 
this model building process.

Abstract:  This work is focused on the strategies used to incorporate PBL in chemical thermodynamics 
course taught at the chemical engineering department at the Yanbu Industrial College, Saudi Arabia. 
The course was redesigned to map course learning outcomes with the learning objectives. From a 
dominant traditional teacher-centered course, a framework was developed to introduce student-
centered learning.  
In the student-centred learning section, PBL was incorporated in the 10th week of the course where 
intention was to cover most course learning outcomes. As a starter, the PBL formed only 13% of the 
total teaching and learning hours for the course. The multiple-solution problem encompassed the use of 
energy transformation to economically and efficiently transport natural gas from far areas to populated 
cities.  It was found that PBL could be used as an effective education strategy for a typical chemical 
engineering course albeit teacher-centred approach could not be eliminated completely.

1 Introduction 
Yanbu Industrial College (YIC) was established in 1989 to meet the growing demand of technical hands 
for chemical and allied industries. Since then the revolutionary changes in engineering and technology 
have forced industries to seek engineers and technicians that are critical thinkers, problem solvers and 
highly motivated self-directed learners. Naturally, YIC is striving hard to produce quality graduates that 
could satisfy its stake holders. The ongoing effort, apart from hiring highly qualified faculty and 
renovating its infrastructure, is to update its curricula and to incorporate advanced teaching 
methodologies.  A recent step in this direction is the implementation of Problem-Based Learning or PBL 
due to its increasing popularity in academia worldwide.  
Research in education indicates that by having students learn through the experience of solving 
problems they can learn both content and thinking strategies [1]. PBL is a student-centered instructional 
strategy in which students learn through facilitated problem solving. In PBL, student learning centers on 
a complex real world problem that does not have a single correct answer. Students work in small to 
medium groups to pinpoint what they need to learn in order to solve a problem. They engage in self-
directed learning and then apply their new knowledge to the problem and reflect on what they learned 
and the effectiveness of the strategies employed. In other words, PBL gives four dimensions to the 
process of learning such as constructive, self-directed, collaborative and contextual. The teacher acts 
to facilitate the learning process rather than to simply provide knowledge.  Thus the role of teacher is to 
help learner to develop metacognitive skills associated with problem solving process encouraging them 
to think both critically and creatively.  
PBL has been shown by many researchers as a very effective tool in enhancing student learning [2-4]. 
The results of a number of empirical studies on PBL in post secondary education by Dochy et al [5] 
indicate that students taught under PBL environment are shown to possess greater positive skills 
compared to traditional teacher-centered education. Because it promotes deep learning and problem 
solving skills, PBL has been highly recommended in engineering disciplines as well [6-7]. However, PBL 
is not free from criticism [5,8]. The disadvantages cited are: i) students cognitive knowledge may have 
gaps and they may not develop expert reasoning patterns ii) costly and iii) negative effect on knowledge. 
The institutes have therefore cautiously adopted this learning strategy. Usually a blended approach that 
is combining PBL with traditional lectures is recommended. More details about PBL can be found 
elsewhere [9-12].

431","methodology the majority agreed that it promoted better understanding of the problem, improved 
communication skills during discussions with team members and the facilitator and exposed new ideas 
in a short time period.  During class presentations following strengths and weaknesses of students were 
revealed: 
1.
All groups reached the conclusion that transporting gas by using large size compressor was the
preferred option over distributing gas in cylinders. They justified their choice owing to large
populations in both cities would incur huge costs for latter choice.
2.
Only one group performed the sizing calculations accurately by taking non-ideal gas behaviour
into account at high pressures. Some groups also made mistakes in unit conversions. The
groups differed in choosing the type of compressor.  Two groups suggested reciprocating
compressor while the rest came up with the idea of using centrifugal compressor. However they
did not justify their selection.
3.
Regarding safety and environmental issues most of the groups touched these topics generally
with no reference to the main problem. It was not unexpected though because their non
familiarity with these subjects. These topics were added to instil in students to discover new
engineering horizons at their own.
Based on the written report, presentation and in-class group discussions the teacher’s assessment of 
how successful the PBL activity was in achieving the CLOs is shown in Figure 2. Most of the group 
performed satisfactorily except Group-4 and Group-3.  One possibility for these groups performing low 
might be random selection of students.

good and ‘5’ as excellent. As it can be seen the ratings in case of critical thinking and self directed 
learning were mostly found poor. The apparent inability of students in these skills clearly stresses to call 
for PBL implementation into the curriculum.  
3 Conclusions and recommendations 
Several conclusions were drawn from this study as follows: 
•
Traditional teacher-centred methodology cannot be completely eliminated at the associate-level
degrees unless students are taught PBL at secondary schools or have sufficient experience of PBL
in pre-requisite courses.
•
Problem crafting should be done carefully. In this activity the teacher should also consult his
colleagues and review his problem with them. In fact a committee should be formed to analyze and
approve problems before those are presented to students.
•
Formation of groups to promote collaborative learning should be done at the start of the course and
before the implementation of PBL. This would help resolve issues among group members and
improve their understanding towards each other before they embark upon PBL. This would ensure
productive learning where each member of the group would be involved.
•
The teacher’s attitude to conduct PBL is very important to keep students motivated and focused on
their problem. Teachers should be trained to play the role of an effective facilitator.
•
While the problem is crafted based on CLOs the assessment should also be done to see whether
those outcomes are achieved or not.
To summarize, a carefully crafted problem facilitated by a trained teacher in an effective PBL 
environment can invigorate important skills among students to meet industrial requirement.

Due to several medical accidents breaking out, patient safety is getting more emphasis. People have raised 
attention to human factors (ergonomics) approach to improve patient safety. The purpose of this study is to 
evaluate the situation of human factors intervening medication for patient safety improvement cases and 
provide the advanced human factors knowledge to medication in hospitals and to reduce the risk of human 
error in hospitals. The cases are from Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation (TJCHA) 
collected from hospitals. The cases have been reorganized by the domains view of ergonomics; graded by 
the level how they approach of ergonomics and quantified to do statistical analysis. The results shows that 
percentage distribution of ergonomics knowledge using for medication safety promotional are physical 
ergonomics (5.41%), cognitive ergonomics (21.62%) and organizational Ergonomics (72.97%). Some 
recommendation for increasing medication safety have been presented to all levels of medical institutions 
for reference study.

Abstract  
The paper explores and reviews the concept of Circular Economy (CE) by conducting a systematic literature 
review (SLR) to develop an in-depth understanding of the growing trends of CE, its framework, 
implementation, and barriers. The overview of published literature is pigeon-holed under 10 dimensions. 
Furthermore, the paper explores the attention given to the Logistics sector from the perspective of Circular 
Economy and highlights the need for in-depth research to develop new frameworks/models for CE’s 
implementation in the Logistics sector to establish Circular Logistics as an outcome.

1. Introduction
Rapid growth in technological advancement, automation, and development of cross border trade has and is changing 
the rules of the game for businesses. This development has raised the standards of production and living, and made 
life easier for consumers, but at the same time it has also raised serious concerns due to excessive resources depletion 
and that the current economic system is developed with no concern for the environment and clue for recycling (Su et 
al., 2013). Jowit (2008) clearly marks it as an ‘ecological credit crunch’ that the world is heading to, with 
approximately resource usage ratio being 30% higher than the earth can replenish each year. 
Such concerns have not just surfaced recently but have gained the attention of scholars since the last 5 decades, in 
particular, when Boulding (1966) pointed out the damages caused to the environment and resource depletion. Over 
the last two decades, the concept of sustainability has gained momentum and as a result a newer concept, i.e. Circular 
Economy, has emerged. CE is believed to have its origin in Ecological and Environmental Economics (Ghisellini et 
al., 2016) and Eco-Industrial Development (EID), which suggest that both a healthy economy and a healthy 
environment can coexist (Geng & Doberstein, 2010). 
In realisation of the fact that the current production and consumption pattern are not long lasting (Jowit, 2008), 
businesses have been forced to rethink their strategy to minimise their negative impact to the environment (Lai et al., 
2013). In particular, increased awareness and knowledge about the facts due to efficient information sharing, has 
increased this push and businesses have to rethink at least for the sake of their market share (Yuan et al., 2006). 
This paper is of an exploratory nature and by no means it intends to neglect the importance of technology and its 
development, rather the paper focuses on the attitude towards the environment, sustainability, and future generations; 
under the current economic system and its implications to the field of Logistics. The emergence of this concept is 
indeed timely and in realisation of its necessity, therefore the contemporary nature of this paper is highly concurrent.

Abstract 
Technology advancements during recent years have created new opportunities for offering new banking 
services which might have great impacts on decreasing banks’ costs and increasing their non-interest 
income earned from the fees of banking services. But, banks have always been wondering if these new 
services would be adopted or accepted by the customers? Public adoption of a new technology often takes 
years and depends on its success in the development and continuous use by people. This research intends 
to employ a system approach to analyzing the dynamics of developing new banking services focusing 
specifically on mobile banking. Here, a dynamic model is developed and simulated by System Dynamics 
(SD) approach considering related theories extracted from the literature, identified factors, and influencing 
feedback for better understanding the existent mechanisms. The simulation results of four scenarios are 
presented. Results showed that increasing advertisement and R&D budget would not be useful enough for 
the sustainable growth of mobile banking transactions and their revenue in long term. In fact, improving 
the set of factors influencing the customers’ intention of using the technology can most likely make people 
accept the technology and increase its use and the revenue earned from banking fees and other charges.

much interest for the new services. For this problem, the fourth scenario would most probably make better 
improvements, as in this scenario, the set of factors influencing the people’s intention of using the technology were 
improved; e.g. improved ease of use, higher system quality, fewer system errors, and less perceived risk of use. This 
policy would result in higher satisfaction level, less unsuccessful transactions, and fewer lost customers. Hence, the 
number of customers or service adopters would increase, and accordingly more transaction fees would lead to a higher 
profit level. 
The suggested dynamic model presented here is capable of demonstrating the dynamic behavior of the real system in 
developing new banking services. Additionally, the most important feedback loops of its structure were identified; 
e.g. the loop of adoption caused by interacting with active adopters of the technology and their word of mouth, 
advertisement and marketing effects loop, loop related to the influence of backlog of problems, and discarding the 
technology by customers. Also, variables of use intention, advertisement, the backlog of problems, and system quality 
were recognized as model’s leverage points.
This model facilitates the policy making process for banks managers. The key result of this investigation was showing 
how the set of factors influencing the intention of use are the most important issue that managers need to consider 
before presenting a new mobile banking technology to the market.
This research was however restricted in some aspects. Above all, the lack of precise and comprehensive information 
about the existent parameters of the model, made the author define some of the relations in the model based on initial 
estimations. Regarding the significant role of costs in banking profit and their complex system, it is recommended for 
the future studies to do a much detailed analysis on costs and their effects on the system. Plus, the relation of banking 
interest income and the dynamics of developing a new banking service can be investigated much deeply.
