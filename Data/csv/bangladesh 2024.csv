Abstract 
Utilizing 3D bioprinting technology, we have developed, analyzed, and assessed PVA/Gelatin scaffolds for their 
potential applications in tissue engineering. This paper details the creation of a specialized 3D bioprinter and its 
implementation in fabricating porous scaffolds composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and gelatin. Our comprehensive 
study investigates how varying gelatin concentrations affect the physicochemical and mechanical properties of these 
composite scaffolds. The 3D bioprinter, modified from a commercial device, employs an extrusion-based technique 
to precisely place biomaterials using PVA/gelatin bio-inks. FTIR spectroscopy confirmed the formation of 
intermolecular hydrogen bonds between PVA and gelatin within the composites, highlighting significant chemical 
interactions. Notably, increasing the gelatin content markedly altered both the microstructure and mechanical 
attributes of the scaffolds. The elastic modulus consistently increased with higher gelatin concentrations, reaching a 
peak at 12% gelatin (PVA-12G). Conversely, the elongation at break exhibited an inverse relationship with gelatin 
content. These findings suggest that PVA-12G possesses favorable characteristics for potential application in tissue 
engineering. This study illustrates the successful fabrication of PVA/gelatin scaffolds using a custom-designed 3D 
bioprinter. The thorough evaluation of these scaffolds, encompassing FTIR analysis and mechanical testing, provides 
crucial insights into the interaction between PVA and gelatin and its influence on scaffold properties. Future research 
will further explore the potential of these composite biomaterials in various tissue engineering applications.

1. Introduction
The advancement of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine has prompted the investigation of biocompatible 
materials that can facilitate cell proliferation and tissue development. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and gelatin-based 
composites have emerged as viable options owing to their superior biocompatibility, biodegradability, and mechanical 
qualities. Gelatin, a natural polymer sourced from collagen, facilitates cell adhesion and proliferation, whereas PVA, 
a synthetic polymer, improves scaffolds' mechanical strength and structural integrity. The amalgamation of these two 
polymers provides a distinctive equilibrium of biological functioning and mechanical integrity, rendering them 
optimal for scaffold production. 
The combination of gelatin and PVA creates a composite material that utilizes the biological benefits of gelatin and 
the mechanical robustness of PVA, rendering it exceptionally appropriate for scaffold production in tissue engineering. 
These composite materials can offer an extracellular matrix-like environment facilitating cell proliferation while 
preserving the scaffold's form and integrity under physiological settings. The application of these materials shows 
significant potential in wound healing, cartilage regeneration, and bone tissue engineering. In recent years, 3D 
bioprinting has transformed scaffold fabrication, ensuring precision in forming complex structures that emulate the

6. Conclusion 
This study successfully navigates the intersection of material science, engineering, and biology by employing 3D 
bioprinting to fabricate porous PVA/gelatin scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. We systematically 
investigated the impact of gelatin content on these composite scaffolds, revealing the intricate interplay between their 
chemical and mechanical properties. FTIR analysis confirmed the formation of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds 
between PVA and gelatin, indicating a synergistic interaction within the scaffold structure. As gelatin content 
increased, the refractive index decreased, suggesting enhanced chemical integration, particularly with hydroxyl 
groups. This molecular-level interaction significantly influenced the scaffold’s microstructure and mechanical 
performance. The addition of gelatin initially boosted the PVA scaffold’s elasticity modulus, highlighting its potential 
for providing structural support. However, exceeding 12% gelatin content led to a decline in physicochemical 
performance. Our findings pinpoint PVA-12G as a promising candidate for tissue engineering due to its optimal 
balance of elasticity and elongation. 
 
Further refining this understanding and exploring the potential of these composite biomaterials lie at the forefront of 
our ongoing research. This study contributes valuable insights into composite scaffold mechanics and pioneers the 
development of advanced 3D bioprinting technologies. This paves the way for personalized and complex tissue 
engineering applications, opening doors to exciting possibilities in regenerative medicine.

1. Introduction
In an era where sustainability has become a critical focal point for industries worldwide, the Fast-Moving Consumer 
Goods (FMCG) sector stands at the forefront of this transformation. In the contemporary global economy, the FMCG 
(Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) sector occupies a pivotal role, balancing the imperatives of economic growth with 
the pressing need for environmental stewardship. It is safe to say that probably FMCG industries are the best example 
to illuminate the situation of “Low margin-high profit” (Singh  2016). As consumers increasingly prioritize sustainable 
practices in their purchasing decisions, FMCG companies face mounting pressure to adopt strategies that not only 
optimize operational efficiencies but also minimize environmental impact throughout their value chains. At the heart 
of this challenge lies the imperative to enhance energy efficiency and integrate green systems across manufacturing, 
distribution, and packaging processes. Effective management of energy resources not only reduces operational costs 
but also plays a crucial role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing overall sustainability credentials. 
In parallel, the adoption of green systems—from renewable energy installations to eco-friendly packaging 
innovations—positions companies favorably in meeting regulatory requirements and consumer expectations for 
sustainable products. The sustainability imperative for society is all too clear, and for major companies this presents

Abstract 
Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is a globally recognized methodology for process optimization and waste reduction, driving 
operational excellence in developed economies. However, its adoption in developing countries like Bangladesh faces 
significant barriers, including resource constraints, cultural challenges, and limited awareness of process improvement 
techniques. This study examines the current state of LSS implementation in Bangladesh, identifies key challenges 
specific to resource-limited environments, and proposes a customized LSS framework tailored to the industrial context 
of Bangladesh. The research highlights several critical obstacles hindering successful LSS adoption, including a lack 
of leadership commitment, insufficient training, and resistance to cultural change. Furthermore, the study reveals that 
the low level of understanding and the absence of a systematic approach to process improvement contribute to the 
slow uptake of LSS practices. To address these issues, the study proposes a comprehensive, context-sensitive LSS 
framework that includes strategies for leadership engagement, capacity building, and fostering a culture of continuous 
improvement. The proposed framework emphasizes practical, cost-effective tools and techniques that can be 
implemented with limited resources, while also considering the cultural nuances that impact organizational change. 
By aligning LSS principles with the specific needs and constraints of the Bangladesh’s industrial environment, the 
framework offers a viable path for industries to enhance operational performance, reduce waste, and achieve 
sustainable growth. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, business leaders, and practitioners 
aiming to promote LSS in developing countries.

1. Introduction
Lean Six Sigma (LSS) is now a pillar of the hybrid approach used in the quest for business excellence in many different 
sectors. Organizations have greatly improved operational efficiency, product quality, and customer happiness by 
combining Lean's waste-reducing strategies with Six Sigma's data-driven approach to lower variance. Companies 
trying to maximize processes, cut waste, and improve decision-making using data analytics find strategic answers in 
the approach. Traditionally renowned for its emphasis on removing non-value-added operations, Lean Manufacturing 
and Six Sigma—which are aimed at lowering process variability—are no longer seen as separate approaches. Indeed, 
their combination under the LSS umbrella has become quite effective strategy for companies trying to remain 
competitive in a fast-changing worldwide market. This article explores Lean Six Sigma's methodical application, with 
special focus on its strategic fit with corporate goals, leadership dedication and staff involvement. Applications of 
LSS have shown great promise in many different fields, including food processing, manufacturing, and service 
businesses.

Operational Savings: Significant cost savings and process improvements were noted, with reduced product overfill 
and increased production efficiency. 
Quality Improvements: Enhanced product quality was achieved by reducing defects and improving consistency. 
Employee Involvement: Active employee participation in Lean Six Sigma initiatives contributed to the success of 
the projects. 
Sustainability: The adoption of control mechanisms such as SPC helped ensure the longevity of improvements. 
 
5. Conclusion 
To ensure efficient, effective, and consistent operations companies need to continuously invest in process 
improvement.(Lameijer et al. 2021). This study highlights the significant role of Lean Six Sigma (LSS) as a strategic 
framework for achieving business excellence across diverse industries. LSS is still an important context of strategic 
direction toward business excellence in various types of industries, this is what this study reflects. It allows 
organizations to combine millions of waste elimination and process variability reduction through Lean manufacturing 
and Six Sigma methodologies. What emerges from many case studies is that LSS is more than tools, and much about 
understanding processes and culture change. It all starts with aligning LSS initiatives with strategic business goals to 
make sure every project is in the main stream of the organization. This alignment creates a sense of purpose and 
guidance, allowing teams to direct their attention toward the areas that matter most.  
 
The paper proves the Lean Six Sigma as a holistic strategic solution of achieving business excellence through diverse 
industries. Lean Six Sigma blends the waste reduction of Lean with the data-driven quality management from Six 
Sigma to enable organizations to optimize processes and drive continuous improvement. Organizational framework 
linked to organizational goals, top management commitment, and in-depth training on combining the two, is the 
essence of successful implementation. Nevertheless, here, the challenges like availability of resources and reluctance 
to change must be taken into account. Organizations can only gain the full benefits of Lean Six Sigma when there is 
strategic alignment and cultural readiness to accept Lean Six Sigma. The findings provide useful insights for 
practitioners and leaders in the industry who wish to exploit Lean Six Sigma for long-term performance that is 
competitive and operational.

Abstract 
Over the past decade, integrating Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) into healthcare has become crucial for 
improving the interactions between healthcare workers and their environments. The main goal is to enhance safety, 
efficiency, and overall well-being. While completely eliminating human factors in healthcare is challenging due to the 
complexity of tasks, their negative impact can be reduced through effective risk management and task optimization. 
This paper examines key HFE strategies, emphasizing the development of solutions to mitigate risk factors and 
implement comprehensive healthcare management systems. A major focus of these strategies is identifying high-risk 
jobs in healthcare that contribute to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among workers. By prioritizing these roles and 
applying ergonomic improvements, the risk of MSDs can be significantly reduced, improving worker safety and job 
satisfaction. Additionally, these strategies aim to prevent the future development of MSDs by embedding ergonomic 
principles into job design from the outset. Implementing HFE strategies benefits both healthcare workers and patients. 
By fostering long-term partnerships, healthcare institutions can create an environment where safety is prioritized, 
worker well-being is enhanced, and cost-effectiveness is achieved. This holistic approach not only improves the 
quality of care but also strengthens the sustainability and resilience of the healthcare system. The paper advocates for 
a comprehensive approach to HFE, which addresses both immediate risks and long-term benefits, ensuring that 
healthcare environments are optimized for both workers’ health and patient safety.

1. Introduction
Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) is an interdisciplinary field that combines knowledge from psychology, 
engineering, design, and physiology to optimize human well-being and system performance. In healthcare, this 
integration is essential due to the complexity of the work environment, which includes high cognitive demands, 
physical tasks, and multiple interacting systems. Additionally, cognitive load is exacerbated by time pressures, multi-
tasking, and decision-making under stress, further highlighting the need for systematic HFE interventions. The chance 
and consequence of a hazard occurring is the risk within a system. These two words provide a vocabulary to develop 
a shared understanding at any level of a healthcare organization. They can assist in communicating, prioritizing and 
managing the risks presented within a particular healthcare environment, process or context (Sujan et al. 2021). 
Integrating HFE strategies into healthcare systems can enhance patient safety, improve caregiver well-being, and 
optimize operational performance, leading to a more resilient and sustainable healthcare environment. Healthcare 
professionals often face significant physical and mental challenges, such as lifting and transferring patients, dealing 
with time pressures, multi-tasking, and decision-making under stress. These factors contribute to a higher risk of 
musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), which are a major occupational hazard in healthcare settings. Musculoskeletal

Desk Work:  
Improving workstation ergonomics—such as adjustable desks and monitors positioned at appropriate heights—could 
reduce the risk of wrist pain associated with prolonged desk work. By introducing these changes, we expect the REBA 
score to decrease from 5-6 to 3-4, significantly reducing the risk of repetitive strain injuries. 
Equipment Operation and Medication Preparation:  
Ergonomic adjustments in equipment design, such as ergonomic handles and improved user interfaces, as well as 
better workstation layouts for medication preparation, could help reduce shoulder and wrist discomfort. These 
interventions are expected to bring the REBA scores from 6 to 4-5, thus lowering the overall ergonomic risk. 
 
4.3 Impact of Interventions 
It is estimated that the degrees of risk related to these ergonomic improvements will be reduced by 40-50%. Decreasing 
these eliminations is important, as it lowers the risk of musculoskeletal disorders, and increases productivity and safety 
of the healthcare environment. Patient lifts as well as ergonomic tools with surgical procedures as well as desk jobs 
can result in much fewer overwork injuries, lesser absence, and a pleased laborer. This ultimately will create a safer 
workforce, which we can assume leads to better patient care since healthcare workers will be able to provide better 
physician care without pain and discomfort. Instead, our work offers tangible numbers about the risk of performing 
this type of activities and provides a severity classification of the chemical or ergonomic risks through the REBA tool. 
In addition, we reiterate the need for the incorporation of human factors and ergonomics (HFE) principles in healthcare 
design. Although there have been some advancements in healthcare safety, there is a dearth of widespread use of 
ergonomic principles that may be a barrier to achieving healthcare safety. A more systematic method, such as the 
DMAIC framework, provides a better approach to identifying and resolving ergonomic risks in healthcare systems, 
resulting in sustainable worker health and patient safety improvements. 
 
4.4 Limitations and Future Directions 
This study has several limitations that need to be addressed in future research. First, while the DMAIC framework 
provided a structured approach, its application in the context of healthcare ergonomics may have limitations. 
Alternative frameworks, such as PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) or Lean Ergonomics, might offer more direct alignment 
with ergonomic interventions. Additionally, the REBA tool, while widely used, has certain limitations in assessing all 
aspects of ergonomic risk, particularly for tasks involving fine motor skills or cognitive load. Further studies may 
explore the use of complementary tools, such as RULA or OWAS, to provide a more comprehensive ergonomic 
assessment. Another area for improvement is the lack of baseline data or a control group in this study. Future research 
could benefit from comparing the effectiveness of interventions against a baseline group to better assess the real-world 
impact of ergonomic changes. 
 
5. Conclusion  
The following study underscores the importance of applying human factors and ergonomics principles to reduce 
musculoskeletal risks in healthcare settings. By addressing the high-risk tasks identified through the REBA tool and 
implementing targeted ergonomic interventions, healthcare organizations can significantly improve worker safety, 
reduce the prevalence of MSDs, and ultimately enhance the quality of patient care. Ongoing training and awareness 
programs will be essential to sustain these improvements and foster a culture of safety within healthcare environments. 
Improving efficiencies and patient safety in healthcare can be achieved by modeling how healthcare systems work 
while considering human factors and ergonomics. By predicting how individuals and the overall system will perform, 
we can enhance safety and satisfaction for everyone involved—clinicians, patients, pharmacists, and healthcare 
organizations. Human factors and ergonomics (HF/E) is concerned with the design of work and work systems. There 
is an increasing appreciation of the value that HF/E can bring to enhancing the quality and safety of care, but the 
professionalization of HF/E in healthcare is still in its infancy (Sujan et al. 2021). 
 
This study underscores the critical need to integrate Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE) principles into healthcare 
systems to enhance both worker safety and patient care. By applying the DMAIC framework, we identified key 
ergonomic risks in healthcare tasks, providing a systematic approach to implement effective ergonomic improvements. 
The use of the REBA tool highlighted high-risk tasks, particularly patient handling and surgery postures, that 
contribute to musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) among healthcare workers. In adoption of a comprehensive, 
systematic approach to ergonomics in healthcare settings is essential for reducing MSDs and promoting a safer, more 
efficient work environment. The study demonstrates that addressing both the physical and cognitive aspects of 
ergonomics can lead to improved worker comfort, reduced turnover, and enhanced patient care quality. Healthcare

organizations can optimize workflows and improve safety by modeling healthcare systems with human factors and 
ergonomics at the forefront, ultimately benefiting clinicians, patients, and the overall healthcare system. Human 
factors and ergonomics (HF/E) play an increasingly important role in the quality and safety of healthcare, yet their 
professionalization in this field remains in its early stages. As healthcare systems continue to prioritize safety and 
efficiency, integrating HFE principles through structured frameworks like DMAIC offers a pathway to continuous 
improvement. By addressing ergonomic risks, healthcare organizations can foster a culture of safety, well-being, and 
excellence in patient care, leading to long-term benefits for both healthcare workers and patients alike.

Abstract 
The textile sector, particularly within small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Latin America, plays a vital role 
in regional economic development. However, these enterprises face significant challenges, including inefficiencies in 
production processes and high reprocessing rates that threaten their competitiveness. This research aimed to address 
these challenges by proposing a Lean-TPM production model specifically designed to optimize knitting and dyeing 
processes in textile SMEs. The model integrated Lean Manufacturing principles with Total Productive Maintenance 
(TPM) strategies, focusing on improving operational efficiency, reducing waste, and enhancing equipment reliability. 
The implementation of the model yielded notable improvements. On-Time Delivery (OTD) rates increased by 102%, 
reprocessing rates in the dyeing process were reduced by 44%, and audit compliance with the 5S methodology reached 
88.10%. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in addressing the critical issues faced by textile SMEs. 
The research contributes significantly to the academic discourse on process optimization in manufacturing and offers 
practical solutions with socio-economic benefits, including increased productivity and reduced operational costs. 
Future research should explore the model's adaptability to other manufacturing sectors, encouraging continued 
innovation in process optimization.

1. Introduction
The small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) textile industry, especially in the manufacture of textiles, plays a crucial 
role in the global economy. This sector not only contributes significantly to employment but is also fundamental for 
economic and social development in various regions of the world, including Latin America and Peru. In the global 
context, textile SMEs account for a considerable share of production and trade, being responsible for a large proportion 
of the supply of textile products on the international market (Stoll & Ha-Brookshire 2011). In Latin America, this 
sector has shown remarkable growth, driven by the demand for sustainable and quality products, which has led many 
SMEs to adopt more innovative and efficient practices (Scafuto et al. 2021). In Peru, textile SMEs are vital to the local 
economy, generating employment and encouraging skills development in the workforce (Guerra & Camargo 2023). 
However, despite their importance, these companies face significant challenges that limit their ability to compete in 
an increasingly demanding global market.

1. Introduction
The importance of the small and medium-sized construction industry (SMEs) is undeniable at a global level, especially 
in Latin America and Peru. These enterprises not only represent a significant part of the business fabric but are also 
fundamental to the economic and social development of their respective regions. In Latin America, SMEs account for 
approximately 90% of the productive units, generating about 60% of employment and contributing to more than 50% 
of total production (Lingán et al. 2022). In Peru, this sector is crucial, as the construction SMEs are responsible for a 
considerable part of the country’s infrastructure, which in turn impacts on the quality of life of the population (Vera 
2023). In addition, it has been shown that sustainability and innovation in these companies are essential to improve 
their competitiveness and adaptability in a changing economic environment (Briñez & Penagos 2021). The ability of 
SMEs to generate employment and promote local development makes them a pillar of economic growth, which 
highlights the need to strengthen their management and operations (García  2014).

The importance of this research lies in its ability to address critical inefficiencies in warehouse management within 
the construction SME sector. By applying a structured approach based on Lean principles, the study not only improved 
operational efficiency but also provided a framework that other SMEs can adopt to enhance their warehouse 
management practices. The research highlights the potential for Lean Warehousing to drive significant improvements 
in key performance indicators, which is crucial for the competitiveness of SMEs in the construction industry. This 
study also contributes to the growing body of literature on Lean Warehousing, particularly in the context of 
construction SMEs, where such research is currently limited. 
 
The contributions of this study extend beyond the immediate context of warehouse management in construction SMEs. 
The integration of Lean Warehousing with modern technologies like WMS provides a scalable model that can be 
adapted to various industries facing similar challenges. The study offers practical insights into how SMEs can leverage 
Lean principles to optimize their operations, reduce waste, and improve overall efficiency. By providing a detailed 
account of the implementation process and the resulting improvements, this research serves as a valuable reference 
for academics and practitioners alike, contributing to the ongoing discourse on operational efficiency and Lean 
management in SMEs. 
 
In conclusion, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining Lean Warehousing principles with technology 
to achieve significant improvements in warehouse management. The findings suggest that SMEs in the construction 
industry, and potentially other sectors, can greatly benefit from adopting similar approaches. However, further 
research is necessary to explore the scalability of this model across different industries and regions. Future studies 
should also consider the long-term sustainability of the improvements achieved through Lean Warehousing and WMS 
integration, as well as the potential for continuous improvement in warehouse management practices. This research 
provides a solid foundation for future investigations and encourages a broader application of Lean principles in various 
operational contexts.

management systems (WMS). The sustainability plan was designed to maintain the gains made during the 
implementation phase and to ensure that the warehouse operations continued to improve over time. The plan also 
included provisions for continuous monitoring and feedback, allowing the company to make necessary adjustments 
and to stay ahead of potential challenges. The integration of WMS was particularly important for automating routine 
tasks and reducing the reliance on manual processes, thereby further enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of 
warehouse operations. 
 
5. Results 
In Table 1, the key results of validating the Lean Warehousing-based storage management model for footwear trading 
SMEs are presented, aimed at addressing the identified research problem. The model successfully reduced the distance 
traveled during picking by 45%, decreased the cycle time by 26.47%, and improved office efficiency by 4.17%. These 
outcomes highlight the effectiveness of the proposed model in optimizing warehouse operations, leading to more 
streamlined processes and enhanced overall efficiency. The reduction in cycle time and picking distance also suggests 
a significant improvement in the productivity of the warehouse staff, while the increase in office efficiency reflects 
better management practices and process control.

6. Conclusions. 
The study revealed significant improvements in the operational efficiency of a footwear trading SME through the 
implementation of a Lean Warehousing model. Key findings include a substantial reduction in the distance traveled 
during picking operations, which decreased by 45%, alongside a notable reduction in cycle times by 26.47%. These 
improvements were complemented by a 4.17% increase in office efficiency. The integration of systematic layout 
planning and standardized work processes played a crucial role in achieving these results, highlighting the 
effectiveness of Lean Warehousing tools in addressing the inefficiencies identified during the initial diagnostic phase. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its application of Lean principles to the warehousing processes of SMEs within 
the footwear industry, a sector that is vital to the economy but often plagued by inefficiencies due to resource 
constraints. The study’s findings underscore the critical role that process optimization plays in enhancing the 
competitive edge of SMEs, particularly in a globalized market where agility and efficiency are paramount. By 
systematically addressing the root causes of inefficiencies, the research provides a robust framework for improving 
operational performance in similar contexts. 
 
This research contributes to the broader field of industrial engineering by offering a practical application of Lean 
Warehousing principles in a real-world setting. The study extends existing literature by demonstrating the scalability 
of Lean tools in small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in industries with high variability and operational 
complexity. The successful application of these tools in the case study provides empirical evidence that Lean 
methodologies can be adapted to suit the specific needs of SMEs, thereby contributing to the ongoing discourse on 
the adaptability of Lean practices in diverse industrial contexts. 
 
Final observations suggest that while the Lean Warehousing model proved effective in this case, further research is 
needed to explore its long-term sustainability and impact on overall business performance. Future studies should 
consider the integration of advanced technologies, such as warehouse management systems and automation, to further 
enhance the efficiency gains achieved. Additionally, expanding the scope of research to include other sectors and 
regions would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model’s applicability and potential benefits.

Abstract 
The last-mile logistics sector in Peru faces challenges such as late deliveries, incomplete orders, and damaged 
products, largely due to inefficiencies in cross-docking and route planning. Previous research has primarily focused 
on large-scale operations, leaving SMEs underserved. This study addressed these gaps by integrating Lean Service 
tools—5S, Business Process Management (BPM), and Systematic Layout Planning (SLP)—to enhance operational 
efficiency in SMEs. The investigation revealed that lack of standardization and poor layout management contributed 
to service inefficiencies. The research aimed to increase service levels by addressing these operational shortcomings. 
Results showed a 35.8% increase in productivity, a reduction in material handling effort from 100,621.6 kg.m to 
74,081.0 kg.m, and a 21.1% decrease in process cycle times. Additionally, the perfect order rate improved by 74.3%. 
This study offers significant academic and socio-economic contributions by providing scalable solutions for SMEs, 
and improving logistics performance. Further research should explore advanced technologies to enhance operational 
efficiency in last-mile logistics.

1. Introduction
The small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the bakery sector play a critical role in the global economy, 
particularly in Latin America and Peru. This sector not only significantly contributes to employment and income for 
many families but also is essential for food security and cultural diversity through the production of a wide range of 
baked goods. In Latin America, SMEs account for approximately 99% of all businesses, and in Peru, this percentage 
is even higher, having a notable impact on local economic development Baregheh et al. (2012). The bakery industry, 
in particular, has demonstrated consistent growth, driven by the demand for fresh and quality products (Le et al. 2023). 
However, despite its importance, SMEs in the bakery sector face significant challenges that limit their ability to operate 
efficiently and competitively in an increasingly demanding market. 
Production problems within SMEs in the bakery sector are varied and complex, primarily related to the failure to meet 
product delivery timelines, which adversely affects customer satisfaction and the company's reputation. Additionally, 
excessive unproductive time has become a central concern, as many companies have not implemented adequate

6. Conclusions. 
The main findings of this study indicate significant improvements in operational efficiency, product quality, and 
equipment reliability within the bakery SME sector through the application of Lean Manufacturing and Total 
Productive Maintenance (TPM) tools. The 5S methodology improved workplace organization by 70%, reducing 
clutter and unnecessary search times, while the implementation of work standardization lowered defective products 
by 60%. Autonomous maintenance, which empowered workers to perform routine machine care, led to a 35% 
reduction in mean time to repair (MTTR) and a 150% increase in mean time between failures (MTBF). These results 
validate the efficacy of Lean and TPM methodologies in optimizing bakery operations and minimizing inefficiencies. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its ability to address critical issues in the bakery SME sector, particularly in 
Peru, where operational inefficiencies hinder growth and competitiveness. By improving production processes, this 
study not only enhances product quality and customer satisfaction but also ensures sustainable business practices. The 
adoption of Lean and TPM tools is critical for these enterprises to maintain competitiveness in an increasingly 
demanding market, making this research essential for broader application within the sector. 
 
In terms of contributions to the field, this research provides empirical evidence on the successful implementation of 
Lean and TPM in small-scale food production environments, an area that has been underexplored in the literature. The 
study contributes to the body of knowledge by offering a replicable model for improving operational efficiency in 
bakery SMEs, which can be adapted to other sectors within food production. This model bridges the gap between 
theoretical frameworks and practical applications of Lean Manufacturing and TPM in real-world SME settings, 
making it a valuable resource for both scholars and practitioners in industrial engineering. 
 
Final observations suggest that while the implementation of Lean and TPM has yielded positive outcomes, continuous 
improvement is crucial for sustaining these gains. Employee engagement and regular audits should be maintained to 
ensure the long-term success of these methodologies. Additionally, future studies could explore the integration of 
advanced technologies, such as automation and real-time data analytics, to further enhance productivity and reduce 
human error in bakery operations. This research highlights the need for ongoing development and innovation in 
process optimization strategies for SMEs. 
 
In conclusion, this study offers a solid foundation for future research on the application of Lean and TPM tools in 
SMEs, particularly in the food production industry. It calls for more in-depth studies on the integration of new 
technologies and methodologies to build upon the progress achieved in this research. This investigation serves as a 
call to action for industry professionals and scholars to explore new approaches that could further improve operational 
efficiency, product quality, and overall competitiveness in the SME sector..

Abstract 
The Peruvian construction sector, especially its SMEs, faces critical inefficiencies in supply chain management, 
particularly in procurement processes. Past research has shown that these inefficiencies lead to significant cost 
overruns and delays. This study addressed these challenges by implementing a procurement model integrating Lean 
Construction, Kaizen, and Just-In-Time (JIT). The main challenges identified were excess material purchases (20.12% 
of cost overruns) and late deliveries (25.84% of operations). The model reduced late deliveries from 25.84% to 8.95% 
and purchasing errors from 8.49% to 3.33%, confirming its effectiveness. The research has substantial academic and 
socio-economic implications for Peruvian SMEs, providing a solution that enhances efficiency and reduces 
operational costs. Further research should explore broader applications of this model and strategies to promote 
sustainable procurement practices, encouraging professionals to develop innovative solutions in supply chain 
management.

1. Introduction
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction sector are paramount globally, particularly in Latin 
America and Peru. This sector not only represents a significant proportion of employment but also serves as a vital 
engine for economic and social development. Globally SMEs in construction contribute approximately 80% of 
employment in the construction industry, underscoring their relevance in creating job opportunities and generating 
income (International Labour Organization  2017). In Latin America, this sector faces unique challenges, including 
informality and limited access to financing, which restrict its growth and sustainability (World Bank 2019). In Peru, 
SMEs in construction are responsible for a substantial portion of housing development, highlighting their critical role 
in improving infrastructure and meeting the housing needs of the population (Ministerio de Vivienda, Construcción y 
Saneamiento  2020). However, despite their importance, these companies often operate under adverse conditions, 
emphasizing the necessity to strengthen their operational and managerial capabilities. 
The supply chain issues faced by SMEs in construction are multifaceted and complex. Inefficient procurement 
management can lead to the accumulation of excess materials, which not only increases costs but can also result in

performance. The implementation of a procurement model integrating Lean Construction, Kaizen, and Just-In-Time 
(JIT) methodologies led to substantial improvements. Key findings include a reduction in late deliveries from 25.84% 
to 8.95%, a 60.78% decrease in misplaced orders, and an 88.89% reduction in orders received with problems. These 
results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model in addressing the primary challenges in the supply chain. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its direct application to construction SMEs, a sector often overlooked in 
academic literature. By optimizing supply chain management, the study contributes to enhancing operational 
efficiency and reducing costs in a field crucial to economic development. The model's success in reducing delays and 
improving supplier relationships highlights its practical significance for SMEs aiming to enhance their 
competitiveness in the market. 
 
This research makes several contributions to the field of industrial engineering, particularly in supply chain 
optimization for SMEs in the construction industry. The integration of Lean Construction and Kaizen methodologies 
into the procurement process represents a novel approach to tackling inefficiencies in supply chains. Additionally, the 
use of JIT principles ensures that materials are delivered as needed, minimizing waste and storage costs. These 
contributions offer valuable insights for further research and practical applications in similar industries. 
 
Final observations suggest that while the model significantly improved procurement efficiency, further studies could 
explore its scalability and adaptability to other sectors. It would also be beneficial to investigate the long-term 
sustainability of the implemented changes and their impact on the overall performance of construction SMEs. Future 
research could focus on integrating advanced technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence to enhance 
supply chain management further. This study provides a solid foundation for future explorations into optimizing 
procurement processes in construction and beyond.

Abstract 
The Lean and SLP-based operations model addressed inefficiencies in packaging and order preparation for chemical 
trading SMEs. Previous research showed that Lean Manufacturing and Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) improve 
operational efficiency, though their use in chemical trading SMEs had been limited. The main challenges were delays 
and defects that affected customer satisfaction. This study applied Lean tools, including SLP and 5S, along with 
standardized work processes to optimize layout, reduce delays, and eliminate defects. These actions improved 
workflow, consistency, and operational performance. Key results included a 32.09% increase in the On-Time In-Full 
(OTIF) rate, an 82.35% reduction in packaging defects, and a 73.33% decrease in cylinder location delays, 
demonstrating the model’s effectiveness.The research made significant contributions by enhancing operational 
performance and reducing costs, leading to increased customer satisfaction and long-term competitiveness. 
Further research should explore the model's adaptability in other industries, promoting continuous improvement and 
broader applications of Lean principles.

1. Introduction
The significance of the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that commercialize chezcal products in Latin 
America, and specifically in Peru, cannot be overstated. This sector not only plays a vital role in the economic 
development of the region but also is crucial for job creation and poverty alleviation. According to a study, SMEs 
account for approximately 90% of the businesses in Latin America, employing around 50% of the workforce and 
generating a substantial portion of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In the Peruvian context, SMEs are fundamental 
to the economy, as their flexibility and adaptability allow them to respond more swiftly to market demands compared 
to larger corporations. However, despite their importance, these enterprises face significant challenges, particularly in 
adopting information and communication technologies (ICT), which can create a competitive gap compared to larger 
firms. The urgent need to modernize their processes and enhance operational efficiency is evident, as quality and 
competitiveness are critical factors for their survival and growth in an increasingly demanding market.

6. Conclusions. 
The main findings of this study indicate a significant improvement in operational efficiency and quality control in the 
packaging and order preparation processes of chemical trading SMEs. The implementation of a Lean and SLP-based 
operations model resulted in a 32.09% increase in the On-Time In-Full (OTIF) rate, while packaging defects were 
reduced by 82.35% and delays in cylinder location decreased by 73.33%. Additionally, delays in locating finished 
products were reduced by 66.67%, contributing to a more streamlined workflow and improved customer satisfaction. 
These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of applying Lean principles and Systematic Layout Planning to address 
operational inefficiencies, reduce delays, and improve overall productivity. 
 
The importance of this research lies in its application to an underexplored sector—chemical trading SMEs. While 
Lean Manufacturing has been widely studied and applied in various industries, its integration with Systematic Layout 
Planning (SLP) in chemical trading companies has not been extensively researched. The results of this study show 
that Lean tools, when properly applied, can lead to substantial improvements in operational efficiency, safety, and 
quality control. The findings highlight the need for SMEs in the chemical industry to adopt Lean and SLP 
methodologies to remain competitive and ensure continuous improvement in their operations. 
 
This research contributes to the field of industrial engineering by demonstrating the effectiveness of combining Lean 
Manufacturing, SLP, and work standardization to enhance operational performance in SMEs. The study offers a 
comprehensive approach to addressing inefficiencies in packaging and order preparation processes, which are critical 
components of supply chain management in the chemical sector. By optimizing layout, improving workplace 
organization, and standardizing work procedures, the model provides a framework for SMEs to improve their 
operations and reduce waste. Additionally, the research fills a gap in the literature by providing empirical evidence of 
the positive impact of Lean and SLP integration in chemical trading SMEs. 
 
Final observations suggest that while the model has proven effective in this case study, further research is necessary 
to explore its applicability in other sectors and contexts. Future studies could investigate the long-term sustainability 
of the improvements achieved and examine the model's adaptability to other industries with similar operational 
challenges. Furthermore, the integration of advanced technologies, such as automation and data analytics, could 
enhance the model's effectiveness and provide additional opportunities for continuous improvement. In conclusion, 
this research provides a solid foundation for future studies aimed at optimizing operational efficiency in SMEs, with 
the potential to expand the model's application to a broader range of industries.

Abstract 
The industries serve as the fundamental basis of the economy. Conversely, at times it incurs significant losses due to 
insufficient utilization of technology. Continuous manufacturing is facilitated by the use of coolers and boilers. Merely 
setting the temperature accurately does not prevent the possibility of overheating and consequent harm to the product. 
The continuation of this will ultimately result in a significant reduction in industrial output. An effective solution to 
address this problem is the use of a big data approach and processing, together with automation, machine learning, 
artificial intelligence, and networking, often known as IoT (Internet of Things). The objective of this project was to 
develop a real-time data dashboard for the purpose of gathering and displaying the outcomes of big data automation. 
Advancements in programming and machine learning enabled the creation of a switchboard that utilized AI (Artificial 
Intelligence) to monitor the state of the machine. An artificial intelligence system was created to notify the responsible 
party automatically of any possible harm. In order to prevent unintended harm, the system provides the user with the 
capability to power down the equipment manually.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the manufacturing industry has seen a substantial digital revolution, principally propelled by the 
incorporation of sophisticated digital technologies designed to improve corporate management and process efficiency. 
The modernization of manufacturing includes a wide range of technical breakthroughs, such as automation, the 
establishment of digital factories, and cutting-edge manufacturing technology. Although the specific procedures across 
many sectors may change, the fundamental concepts of modernization are consistent—aiming to optimize processes, 
minimize expenses, and improve both production and efficiency. The necessity for modernization is especially urgent 
in industries dependent on specialized equipment, such as boilers and coolers, which are crucial to several industrial 
processes (Golwalkar & Kumar 2022). Boilers are crucial for regulating temperatures in liquid systems, facilitating 
the material transformation of items via heating, cutting, drying, and curing operations. They furthermore function as 
a source of industrial power generation. Conversely, coolers are essential for managing excess heat, which, if 
uncontrolled, can impair machinery, harm the environment, and disrupt industrial operations. Efficient cooling systems 
also regulate humidity levels, especially in commercial warehouses, therefore enhancing product integrity and 
operating efficiency (Rabbi, Chen, & Sethuvenkatraman, 2019; Seifhashemi, Capra, Milller, & Bell, 2018). Both 
boilers and coolers are susceptible to operational failures due to a mix of human mistakes and mechanical 
malfunctions. These problems not only incur expensive repairs but also cause prolonged downtime, thereby impacting

go over the purpose of the Python application, which is to link up with the Azure IoT hub, which acts as a bidirectional 
connector for IoT devices. The IoT hub will then perceive the incoming data and send it to Azure Stream analytics, 
which in this case will be in the form of a serialized JSON string. Azure Stream Analytics is a complex event-
processing engine and real-time analytics tool designed to analyze and manage massive amounts of rapidly flowing 
data from numerous sources simultaneously. Azure stream analytics will then divide the data, sending one portion to 
the Azure Machine learning workspace, which will use the heating, drying, and cutting system information to predict 
the coming temperature, perhaps resulting in boiler damage. To predict the next temperature, we will make use of the 
current deep learning model from the Azure machine learning studio. The stream analytics job will use this data to 
store in Azure SQL DB after this prediction is finished, and the data will then be displayed via the Power BI dashboard 
after Azure ML transmits the data back into stream analytics.  
A general understanding of the Azure stream analytics task is required before proceeding with this scenario. Input, 
query, and output are the three components that make up an Azure Stream Analytics task. Stream Analytics receives 
data from Azure Blob Storage, Azure Event Hubs, or Azure IoT Hubs. Streaming data can be effectively filtered, 
sorted, aggregated, and combined over time using the SQL query language-based query. The user has influence over 
what happens in reaction to the reviewed data, and each task contains one or more outputs for the altered data. Data 
can be sent to services like Azure Functions, for instance. Sending data to a Power BI dashboard will allow for real-
time dashboarding. 
 
5. Recommendation and Future Works 
Although the setup already provides real-time data in the dashboard, it would be ideal if it was possible to the 
anticipated outcome. It is possible to configure the dashboard to employ an OTP-based login method to secure the 
authentication procedure. VPN can be used to secure the website (a virtual private network). Last but not least, because 
Azure supports straightforward mobility and a standard platform, the complete implementation may be carried out 
utilizing the cloud framework (Researched Base Cloud System Architecture). In addition, Microsoft's pay-as-you-go 
model enables to only pay for the resources we use to build or enhance our applications using Azure services. The 
Azure Active Directory service's secure IAM (Identity and Access Management) capabilities, which let the right 
individuals access the right data, are what matter most. Also available on a single platform are all of the Azure cloud 
services, including Azure IoT, Power BI, Azure SQL DB, Azure stream analytics, and others. The aforementioned 
endeavor may have been much better if there had been more time. The prospectus's capacity to forecast the temperature 
and deliver notifications was one of its key features. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The aforementioned explanation shows that both conventional and modern architecture are able to address the 
aforementioned difficulty through speculative and practical solutions. The replacement of equipment is frequently a 
part of traditional production line maintenance operations in manufacturing, either after a failure or at predetermined 
intervals. Because of the equipment's frequent premature replacement, these maintenance programs frequently incur 
additional costs. These have a detrimental effect on the economy. Numerous studies are being conducted on it. None 
of them, though, are lasting. While mine is a long-term fix. Because of merging machine learning and data processing 
approaches. To evaluate and test the system's effectiveness and propensity for prediction, algorithms are used. They 
gather data in real time and deliver results. Additionally, there will be notifications and an automatic reset of the device. 
Therefore, it won't need to be watched over constantly, every day of the week. 
 
Additionally, it saves time and is effective rather than being expensive. For the management and automation of 
industrial activities, the Internet of Things (IoT) is essential. Companies are starting to rely more on technology than 
on manual labor as time goes on. It operates instantly. IoT has improved quality and boosted control over industrial 
activities. The manufacturing cycle can be carried out more quickly and economically by using different protocols. 
Therefore, we can categorically declare that an IoT-based dashboard is a must. As modernization's present and future, 
the Internet of Things (IoT).

Abstract 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a widely used material in container manufacturing, particularly in bottle 
production. It is characterized by its low cost and widespread availability. However, its improper disposal has 
significantly exacerbated global plastic pollution. For instance, less than 50% of plastic bottles are recycled. Moreover, 
studies indicate that this issue has led to a significant accumulation of plastic waste in the oceans, which continues to 
grow annually and could be considered floating islands of debris. This study proposes replacing PET with polylactic 
acid (PLA), a biodegradable and biocompatible polymer with suitable properties for bottle production. PLA also has 
a shorter decomposition time compared to PET, contributing to the reduction of carbon footprint and greenhouse gas 
emissions. The research methodology included a diagnostic phase to define objectives, identify constraints, and 
determine variables based on an extensive literature review. The design phase focused on modeling a PLA-based 
bottle with detailed specifications and innovative structural features. Additionally, experimental evaluations of 
biodegradability, compressive strength, and tensile strength were conducted to compare PET and PLA. The study 
incorporated technical standards and engineering protocols to evaluate critical properties such as material permeability 
and stress behavior. As a result, it was confirmed that PLA exhibits properties that make it a competitive material 
compared to PET. In conclusion, this research presents a technically viable alternative to PET bottles through the use 
of PLA, with the potential to significantly mitigate environmental impacts while maintaining the functional 
requirements of packaging.

1. Introduction
The issue arising from global plastic production is its inadequate management. As evidence of this, only 20% of 
produced plastic bottles are recycled (Georgiou et al. 2022). Additionally, approximately 2.40 million tons of plastic 
waste are dumped into the ocean worldwide. According to Alhazmi, Almansour, and Aldhafeeri, this accumulation of 
2.40 million tons of waste in the ocean has led to the creation of “The Great Pacific Garbage Patch” (as cited in Ajaj 
et al. 2022, p. 5). Furthermore, due to the inadequate disposal of PET bottles and their long-term persistence, CO2 
emissions are generated, leading to respiratory problems and an increase in global warming. Additionally, ecosystems 
are deteriorating, aquatic and terrestrial organisms are impacted, mosquito reproduction is encouraged, and various 
diseases affecting public health are proliferating (Ajaj et al. 2022). To mitigate these environmental impacts, solutions 
such as “Smart Use of Materials” (Suarez et al. 2022) and “material efficiency” (Pomponi et al. 2022) have been 
proposed, focusing on the intelligent use of materials and improved packaging design. For this reason, it is proposed 
to replace PET with a biodegradable material suitable for beverage packaging, such as PLA.

Abstract 
A new service robot is designed in this work for floor dust cleaning in home environments. System has three 
subsystems: electrical, software and mechanical of which microcontroller, sensors and motor are the electrical and 
mechanical subsystems respectively and the software subsystem is the brain of the robot. The cleaning robot uses a 
microcontroller to detect obstacles and manipulates its direction as per the inputs. It is programmed to accept inputs 
to sense obstacles around it and control the robot to avoid any collisions. In case of an obstacle, or a potential collision, 
the microcontroller controls the wheels of the robot by a motor driver to avoid collision. The Floor cleaner at the 
bottom of the robot performs the cleaning process.

Abstract 
The objective of this paper is to explore the timing and methods by which organizations adopt blockchain technology 
(BT) to enhance both supply chain integration (SCI) and overall supply chain performance. The study grounded its 
theoretical framework in the dynamic capabilities perspective. Employing a quantitative methodology, data collection 
involved a structured questionnaire administered to a sample of 160 participants from various manufacturing firms in 
Bangladesh. To evaluate the formulated hypotheses, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis was performed 
using WarpPLS7.0 software. The results suggest a significant and positive effect of BT on both SCI and supply chain 
performance. Furthermore, the findings support the hypothesis that SCF plays a positive and significant moderating 
role in the relationship between BT and both SCI and supply chain performance. This study addresses a recognized 
gap in applying BT to enhance both supply chain integration and performance within a comprehensive context that 
includes the moderating role of supply chain flexibility. By demonstrating the positive effects of BT, organizations 
can better understand how to leverage this technology to improve operational efficiency and competitive advantage.

1. Introduction
Supply chain management (SCM) plays a pivotal role in achieving competitive advantage by enhancing organizational 
productivity and profitability through integration with internal operations, suppliers, and customers. Modern supply 
chains are becoming increasingly competitive due to expanding worldwide business operations, technological 
improvements, changing client needs, and shorter product lifecycles. As a result, market demand has become 
increasingly unpredictable, highlighting the importance of effectively managing uncertainty within the supply chain. 
With the rise of omnichannel retailing and the increasing emphasis on customer-centricity, firms face the challenge 
of meeting diverse customer preferences and delivery expectations. In an era marked by extreme market volatility, the 
significance of supply chain integration (SCI) has been underscored as essential for firms to maintain their 
sustainability (Shi et al. 2023). SCI integrates fundamental practices essential for attaining elevated levels of supply 
chain performance (SCP). SCI can empower organizations to synchronize supply chain activities, merge production 
and resource planning, and engage in collaborative decision-making, thereby improving supply chain efficiency. 
Moreover, SCI facilitates real-time visibility and data-driven insights across the supply chain, enabling quicker

5.2 Proposed Improvements 
Based on the findings of this research, several key improvements can be recommended for organizations:  
Integration of IoT and Blockchain for Demand Forecasting and Inventory Management: The integration of Blockchain 
and the Internet of Things (IoT) provides sophisticated data-driven demand forecasting and real-time inventory 
management functionalities. This integration enables companies to oversee and enhance their inventory levels, 
minimizing stockouts and excess inventory. Adopting this methodology helps optimize just-in-time (JIT) inventory 
strategies and augment inventory turnover rates, resulting in more agile and effective supply chain operations. 
 
Improved Agility through Decentralized Decision-Making: The decentralized characteristics of blockchain facilitate 
swift decision-making in the supply chain. Companies can allocate decision-making power throughout the supply 
chain, enabling immediate modifications based on blockchain-validated information. This decentralization mitigates 
delays resulting from hierarchical bottlenecks, allowing enterprises to respond promptly to market fluctuations and 
disturbances. The capacity to execute data-driven, decentralized choices improves overall supply chain agility, 
enabling enterprises to more effectively match their operations with client requirements. 
 
Sustainability and Regulatory Compliance through Blockchain: Blockchain facilitates sustainability and regulatory 
compliance by providing transparent and verifiable documentation of environmental and ethical adherence, hence 
enhancing corporate social responsibility and sustainable SCM. Companies can utilize blockchain to trace and 
authenticate the sources of raw materials, assess the ecological effects of manufacturing processes, and guarantee 
compliance with sustainability standards. This bolsters brand equity, fosters stakeholder confidence, and guarantees 
adherence to international sustainability benchmarks. Blockchain facilitates transparency and auditability, allowing 
companies to showcase their dedication to ethical sourcing and environmental stewardship. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In summary, the objective of this research was to evaluate the correlation between (BT), (SCI), and (SCP). PLS-SEM 
was used to analyze data collected from a sample of 160 industrial enterprises located in Bangladesh. The Integration 
of BT into SCM has demonstrated significant promise in enhancing both integration and performance. When 
considering SCF, it becomes clear that blockchain’s impact varies and is influenced by how adaptable and responsive 
the SC is. As discussed in this paper, the connection between BT and SCM is complex, with a flexible supply chain 
potentially enhancing the advantages of blockchain integration. By utilizing blockchain’s core features of 
transparency, immutability, and decentralization in conjunction with a flexible supply chain framework, businesses 
can effectively navigate uncertainties, streamline operations, manage risks, and ultimately achieve superior outcomes 
in SCI and performance. 
  
6.1 Limitations and Future Work 
The study acknowledges limitations including BT evolving nature and companies’ limited experience in assessing its 
impact on supply chains. It relies on respondents’ perceptions, suggesting the need for larger samples, wider industry 
inclusion, and interviews for deeper insights. Future research could explore alternative theories and optimal conditions 
for BT integration. The study’s cross-sectional data raises potential for common method bias, recommending 
longitudinal designs for validity. Furthermore, it highlights the need to investigate BT’s integration with other Industry 
4.0 technologies for broader implications

Abstract 
After the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the textile and clothing industry faces new challenges in the links of the textile chain 
due to global uncertainty. Setting the view on Peru, the competitiveness of the sector is threatened by imports, 
which significantly reduce the market share of SMEs. The research aims to optimize the supply chain management 
of a peruvian textile sector SME. It is proposed to implement a management model that integrates Lean Tools and 
Production Planning in the company's supply chain. 5S is applied to the production link within the supply chain, 
as this philosophy focuses on waste reduction within the production process, while, for the rest of the links, VSM 
and Standardized Work are used, in such a way that it is possible to specify a single procedure deliver the necessary 
amount at the right time, eliminating inventory. The model is evaluated through the implementation of a pilot test 
in one of the activities of the process. As a result of the implementation of the proposal considerable improvements 
are obtained in the company that affect the key indicators: increase in the company's competitiveness through 
increased productivity (82.21%), reduction of fabric waste (15.71%) and a reduction in Lead Time (80%), keeping 
pace with market demand.

1. Introduction
After 2 years of economic stagnation due to SARS-CoV-2 the textile industry has suffered severe setbacks, 
impacting the economy of the companies in this sector. At the beginning of 2020, the textile industry faced the

. The increase in costs negatively contributes to the NPV by 41.43%. Finally, the increase in productivity does not 
have a significant positive contribution to the improvement of the NPV; however, it is the only variable among 
the three that the company has direct control over and can work on to improve its performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
As a result of this case study, it can be concluded that the proposed model, focused on the supply chain of a 
Peruvian textile SME and employing Lean Tools (specifically a combination of 5S, Value Stream Mapping, and 
Standardized Work), is suitable, coherent, and adequate to provide a solution to the problem of low 
competitiveness in the industry, optimizing its operations in search of better performance. In addition, it is 
concluded that productivity, Lead Time, percentage of material waste, and the Value Added Ratio are suitable 
indicators for measuring and comparing the company's performance before and after implementing the proposed 
improvements. 
 
The results of the initial evaluation indicated the underutilization of fabric, the presence of elements that hinder 
operations, scarce documentation, among others; concluding that the main problem of the company is the 
excessive amount of material and time waste, and the lack of initiative for its reduction, causing activities to be 
carried out at a much slower pace than required to meet market demand.By applying the proposal to a real system, 
it can be concluded that this method of verification provides much more precise and accurate information 
compared to a simulation with software and using historical data from the company as input. Subsequently, it is 
functionally validated that the application of Lean methods is successful, as evidenced by the optimization of 
performance indicators as well as the financial assessment of the investment.

Abstract 
This study explores the effects of incorporating an additional automated cutting tool into injection molding machines 
to optimize manufacturing processes. A comparative analysis of production data collected over the period of two 
months from July (prior to the modification) and August (post-modification) reveals significant enhancements in 
efficiency and output. Initially, the total production time per frame was 34 seconds, which included 25 seconds for 
molding and 9 seconds for hand cutting. This meant that a maximum of 856 frames (or 13,786 string cords) could be 
produced each day. The manufacturing process integrated a major change with the addition of the automated cutting 
tool. A 36% increase in manufacturing efficiency was achieved with the automated cutting tool, which shortened the 
frame production time to 25 seconds and increased output to 1,153 frames (18,432 string cords). Key findings indicate 
that elimination of manual cutting contributes to greater consistency in product quality and reliability in operational 
performance while also saving time and money on labor. This research underscores the importance of process 
automation in modern manufacturing and the strategic application of additional cutting tools, showcasing the 
advancements not only improve output but also contribute to sustainable manufacturing practices by maximizing 
resource efficiency.

1. Introduction
In the swiftly changing realm of manufacturing, optimizing manufacturing processes is crucial for sustaining 
competitiveness and improving operating efficiency. Injection molding, a prevalent method for manufacturing 
different components, is especially susceptible to process parameters and tooling methods. Manufacturers aiming to 
decrease expenses, enhance product quality, and expedite time-to-market find the strategic use of supplementary 
cutting tools in injection molding machines to be a viable solution (Raju, et al. 2018). This research article examines 
the impact of auxiliary cutting tools on the efficacy of injection molding operations. The conventional injection-
molding configuration predominantly depends on a singular set of tools for the formation and refinement of 
components. The difficulties of contemporary manufacturing requirements such as precise geometries, stringent 
tolerances, and varied material properties - present challenges that traditional tooling may not sufficiently resolve. The 
integration of supplementary cutting tools enhances flexibility in machining operations (Banerjee et al. 2020), 
202","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
© IEOM Society International 
 
4.5 Analysis of the Comparison Data 
Time Efficiency: The removal of the manual cutting process decreased the overall time per frame by 26.5%. Despite 
the molding time being constant at 25 seconds, the elimination of the 9-second cutting step significantly enhanced the 
overall efficiency of the operation. 
 
Production Rate Enhancement: The daily output of frames rose by 36%, from 856 frames to 1,153 frames. This led to 
a comparable rise in the manufacturing of string cords, from 13,786 units daily to 18,432 units daily. The increased 
production rate is directly linked to the optimized process, wherein frames were molded and cut concurrently inside 
the same cycle. 
 
Work and Cost Efficiency: Before the alteration, physical work was necessary for the cutting process. By automating 
this process, the corporation decreased labor expenses and mitigated the risk of human mistake, which had hitherto 
resulted in discrepancies in cutting time. The enhanced uniformity in manufacturing also led to increased productivity 
and less downtime. 
 
The data analysis indicates that incorporating the cutting tool directly into the injection molding process led to 
substantial enhancements in time efficiency and manufacturing output. The removal of the manual cutting procedure 
resulted in a 26.5% reduction in time per frame, which in turn facilitated a 36% enhancement in daily production. The 
daily production of string cords rose from 13,786 to 18,432 
 
5.Results and Discussion 
The inclusion of an automated cutting tool into the injection molding machine has demonstrated a substantial 
enhancement in production efficiency and output, in contrast to the prior system that depended on manual cutting. A 
comprehensive review of the production data gathered over two months, July (before the alteration) and August (after 
the modification), revealed a significant rise in both the daily frame production and the overall string cord output. 
Injection molding took 25 seconds per frame before modification, and hand cutting added 9 seconds. The plant could 
only produce 856 frames per day (13,786 string cords) because to the 34-second frame manufacturing time. Manual 
cutting also reduced production due to operator efficiency. The mold’s cutting tool was incorporated after the 
alteration, eliminating the need for manual cutting. Production time per frame was cut to 25 seconds to match frame 
molding. This simplified procedure raised daily output to 1,153 frames, or 18,432 string cords. This boosts 
manufacturing efficiency by 36%. Key findings include: 
 
Reduction of time: From 34 to 25 seconds every frame. 
Increase of output: String cord manufacturing grew from 13,786 to 18,432 pieces per day, a gain of 4,646 pieces. 
Elimination of manual cutting: Eliminating manual cutting saves time, labor expenses, and manufacturing uniformity. 
The injection molding machine with an integrated cutting tool has increased productivity and efficiency. Removal of 
the time-consuming manual cutting phase optimized the production process, increasing productivity, lowering labor 
costs, and improving operational dependability. The judicious deployment of new production tools boosted 
productivity and showed the importance of process automation in manufacturing. 
 
      6. Conclusion 
The integration of sophisticated cutting tools into the injection molding process signifies a crucial enhancement in 
production efficiency and product quality. This study demonstrates that automating the cutting step markedly 
decreases production time and personnel expenses, while enhancing output and uniformity. Eliminating manual 
involvement enables businesses to optimize operations, reduce human error, and attain greater precision—essential 
elements in the current competitive production environment. 
 
During the two-month trial, the results revealed a significant 26.5% decrease in production time per frame, resulting 
in a 36% enhancement in daily string cord output. This acceleration illustrates the revolutionary capacity of 
automation, particularly in industries requiring complex, high-quality plastic components. By transitioning from 
manual to automated cutting processes, businesses meet the increasing need for expedited production cycles while 
maintaining precision and quality.

Abstract 
The recent enormous expansion of the electronic industry and the extensive use of digital devices in this Industry 4.0 
era have affected e-waste management significantly, particularly for emerging economies. Implementing artificial 
intelligence (AI) based technologies is imperative to modernize conventional e-waste management systems and 
guarantee commercial viability and environmental sustainability. Therefore, this study aims to discover, evaluate, and 
rank the I4.0-based AI-improved for sustainable e-waste management systems. A blended approach consisting of the 
Delphi and Best-Worst Method (BWM) was combined to satisfy the objectives. Based on the experts' suggestions and 
extensive literature review, nine I4.0-based AI imperatives were screened out and prioritized using BWM to evaluate

Abstract 
Social media is instantaneous information exchange whereby news, opinions, and rumors can easily spread and 
immediately affect investor behavior and market patterns. Therefore, research in the impact of social media on the 
stock market volatility, such as those based on Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook, is indeed much needed. This literature 
review presented the in-depth study of social media activity and stock market volatility, emphasizing the role of 
sentiment analysis and predictive modeling in financial markets. This paper intends to complete the crucial research 
lacuna by investigating different social media platforms other than Twitter and Reddit, especially during big global 
events like the COVID-19 pandemic. The methodological approach will be a combination of a systematized literature 
review and selection based on comprehensive keyword searches in Google Scholar, Research Gate, and Web of 
Science. According to the analysis, it would appear that models using Naïve Bayes, XGBoost, and Random Forests, 
combined with sentiment analysis such as VADER and GARCH, can yield rather good predictions concerning short-
term movements in the stock market. However, many of the studies are burdened with a number of limitations, 
including the short period of data collected and their reliance on a single social media platform. By weighing both the 
advantages and disadvantages of social media, we contribute to insights of more accurate predictive models and point 
out further directions of research-most of all regarding refined techniques of sentiment analysis and nonlinear effects 
of social media on the market dynamics. Also, the need for multi-platform and cross-cultural studies should be 
emphasized.

Abstract 
The accurate detection of arc faults is critical for ensuring system safety and reliability, particularly in complex 
electrical networks. In this study, we propose a deep learning model that leverages advanced preprocessing techniques, 
including time-series data transformation into images, to enhance the detection capabilities. By utilizing methods such 
as Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our approach captures 
both temporal and frequency-domain features of voltage signals. We applied this model to real-world voltage data, 
focusing on abnormal event detection such as arc faults. The results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately 
classify normal and abnormal voltage patterns with significant precision, showcasing the potential for enhanced fault 
detection in power systems. Our findings suggest that this method could contribute to improved fault prediction and 
maintenance in various industrial applications.

Abstract 
In order to improve operational efficiency, this study assesses the impact of batch preparation time in the 
manufacturing and distribution of ready-mix concrete (RMC) over several construction sites. By means of Arena 
software, the study intends to find delays, inefficiencies, bottlenecks, and variations in the RMC preparation and 
delivery process by juxtaposing empirical data with simulated results. Based on thorough data collected over a 30-day 
period, simulations indicate an average delivery time of 4.78 hours, while empirical data reveals an average of 8.30 
hours, so producing a 42% discrepancy. This notable difference shows that present site operations are less effective 
than the ideal simulation, hence stressing the need for improvements in particular fields. Using a root cause analysis, 
one has been able to identify elements causing delays, including inefficiencies in batch preparation or delivery 
systems, which influence general performance. Based on the results, the paper presents a framework meant to improve 
the efficiency of concrete delivery systems, reducing delays and optimizing operations. The suggestions seek to 
improve the operational flow of the ready-mix concrete plant, clear obstacles, and offer a more accurate portrayal of 
actual conditions in replicated models. This study is important since it improves RMC delivery methods, increases the 
efficiency of building site management, and builds a scalable framework relevant to many different worldwide sectors.

6. Conclusion  
The aim of this study, to assess and enhance the efficiency of batch preparation and distribution of ready-mix concrete 
(RMC), has been successfully achieved. The study revealed substantial discrepancies between real-world data and 
Arena simulation outcomes, with actual delivery times averaging 8.30 hours, which is 42% longer than the simulated 
4.78 hours. Root cause analysis revealed inefficiencies, including VAT processing delays, internet connectivity 
problems, and logistical challenges.The suggested framework and recommendations, encompassing enhancements to 
VAT administration, labor coordination, and logistics management, provide practical measures to optimize operations 
and minimize delays. These interventions are anticipated to improve plant efficiency, reduce delivery bottlenecks, and 
better synchronize simulation with real-world outcomes.  
 
The research highlights the necessity of incorporating GPS tracking and centralized management systems for real-
time decision-making, markedly decreasing operational inefficiencies and enhancing customer satisfaction. Future 
endeavors may concentrate on the implementation and evaluation of these proposed solutions in real-time operations, 
as well as the exploration of advanced predictive models for enhanced optimization. The research's impact and 
significance reside in its capacity to revolutionize RMC delivery processes, enhancing construction site management 
efficiency, and providing a scalable framework applicable to analogous industries worldwide.

Abstract 
To keep up with the fast-paced era of fashion and trends, the textile and clothing (T&C) sector utilizes diverse methods 
to fulfill the expanding consumer needs. With the exceeding demand for textile goods, the fair share of environmental 
degradation is also rising due to the bulk waste produced by the textile and clothing factories. Bangladesh is analyzed 
in this research as a top textile maker to assess the effects of eco-gamification on buyers' behavior. Research in 
advanced nations shows how views on sustainability differ among different groups and places, and emphasizes the 
importance of specific studies in Bangladesh. We suggest combining gamification methods with a circular economy 
framework to motivate consumer interactions with businesses and consumers. This platform seeks to encourage 
sustainable practices including garment reuse and repair and recycling and offering them for reuse. Utilizing reward 
points for recycling or selling used products will encourage consumers to adopt sustainable habits and deliver real 
perks. The envisioned B2C2C economic framework intends to cut down on waste and lessen the use of resources to 
advance an environmentally friendly textile industry in Bangladesh. The platform rests on a decentralized framework 
to ensure the openness and security of transactions across blockchain technology. This model intends to alter 
purchasing patterns through excitement-generating rewards and build a more sustainable fashion landscape in 
Bangladesh and globally.

1. Introduction:
An urgency exists to promote sustainable social structures according to Geissdoerfer et al. (2017). The global apparel 
market is growing and the textile industry caters to this need. Due to its demanding production process and fast fashion 
movement, the textile and apparel (T&C) sector generates significant waste and pollution. As global resource scarcity 
and climate change increase, the demand for sustainable practices in T&T is even more pressing. The fashion sector 
is trying to tackle environmental damage by adopting Circular Economy (SE) principles to reduce waste and extend 
the life of materials and products. According to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a circular textile system can be 
defined as ""restorative and regenerative by design and providing benefits to business, society and the environment. A

 Table 1. Awareness and Perceptions of Sustainable Fashion and Circular Textiles 
From the data, we can see the immense potential of gamification in influencing consumer behavior. Almost 92% of 
respondents are likely to change their purchasing habits if rewarded for eco-friendly actions, such as resharing, 
recycling, or donating clothes and 85% of respondents are not familiar with any existing platforms that offer rewards 
or incentives specifically for the reusability recycling of textile products. This represents a significant market gap that 
our proposed platform is well-positioned to fill. Our platform can establish itself as a first of its kind in this space for 
the target demographic, which is largely unaware of such initiatives. From the data, it is clear that the strong 
willingness of respondents (90%) to participate in any future platforms offering incentives for sustainable actions 
further highlights the demand for such an initiative. This underscores the crucial role that our proposed gamified 
platform could play in the entire region of sustainable textiles. Given the high likelihood of how people's behavior 
changes, implementing these new strategies could lead to significant shifts in how consumers engage with fashion, 
encouraging more sustainable choices. 
 
The satisfactory level of familiarity with sustainable fashion, mixed with a positive perception of circular textiles, 
suggests that initiatives like gamification will be well-received. Also, the lack of any existing alternatives provides an 
opportunity for the platform to take a leadership role in this space. By focusing on gamified incentives and targeted 
educational content, the platform has the potential to drive significant changes in consumer behavior, promoting 
sustainability and circularity in the fashion industry.

8. Conclusion: 
This study highlights the game-based approach of eco-gamification towards consumer engagement in the sustainable 
fashion and circular textile sector in Bangladesh by encouraging both retailers and consumers to participate in more 
sustainable practices. Given the widespread awareness of sustainable fashion and the overall support for circular textile 
practices, this platform has quite a strong foundation to build upon. The initial idea is to build a unified platform that 
caters to their needs like the reuse, repair, and recycling of garments, while rewarding them for ticking the circular 
economy checkbox. Throughout this platform, both retailers and consumers would be actively involved with 
verification systems in place where transparency and reward-based eco-friendly actions will be promoted. This process

will encourage participants to contribute to the circular economy by either purchasing used items or returning them 
for recycling, thus encouraging an environmentally responsible fashion cycle. 
 
This study has some limitations that warrant further exploration. Firstly, it focuses solely on the perspectives of a 
specific age group of urban Bangladeshi consumers and retailers, excluding a broader demographic. Future studies 
should explore the model of this study in a wider setting in terms of age group. Second, this study surveyed a sample 
of urban Bangladeshi consumers in certain areas. This approach did not encompass the perspectives of consumers in 
Bangladesh who did not live in those areas. Future research should expand to include diverse age groups and compare 
attitudes across urban and rural populations to capture a more comprehensive understanding of sustainable apparel 
consumption in Bangladesh. 
 
In summary, this study shows that ecogamification has the potential to realize a circular textile economy vision, 
providing real incentives for both consumers and retailers. Additionally, the platform could offer a more 
comprehensive solution that not only promotes sustainability through the active lifecycle of fashion but also addresses 
the environmental impact of discarded garments. This would enhance its role as a model for sustainable fashion 
practices in Bangladesh and beyond. By closing the loop between production, consumption, and recycling, the 
platform can contribute to a more sustainable fashion industry in Bangladesh, serving as a model for similar initiatives 
around the world.

Abstract 
The growing development of information technology has enhanced internet access, which has resulted in the growth 
of e-commerce—that is, buying and selling of goods and services on online platforms. Over the past 10 years, e-
commerce has been very popular since it offers consumers the simplicity of buying anyplace worldwide, running 
around-the-clock, and obtaining doorstep delivery. Bangladesh's mobile banking, ticket, ridesharing, online shopping, 
food delivery, etc. trends reflect this pattern. Many beginners, however, join the e-commerce scene without sufficient 
knowledge, which presents difficulties. Startups frequently have growing running expenses; hence competitive pricing 
is more challenging in the early and growing stages and leads to a high failure rate. Beginning with a study of 
Bangladesh's current e-commerce scenario, this research projects its future states using a Markov chain model. This 
also highlights the primary challenges e-commerce business owners must face. Furthermore, recommended 
specifically for Bangladeshi e-commerce companies is a perfect business structure to aid to ease these challenges. 
This structure aimed to lower operational costs in a competitive market therefore enhancing sustainability. This 
approach dramatically reduces startup failure rates and provides the foundation for innovative tech companies, 
therefore increasing Bangladesh's economic development in this technologically evolved era.

1. Introduction
Bangladesh's e-commerce sector has experienced remarkable growth in recent years, emerging as one of the fastest-
growing markets in South Asia. By 2021, the market was valued at around $4 billion and is expected to reach $10 
billion by 2026, with an annual growth rate of 19.1%. (Statista 2021). According to the Bangladesh 
Telecommunication Regulatory, the country's internet adoption, with over 125.46 million users and 66 million active 
social media users, has been a key factor in fueling this growth. (BTRC 2021). As more consumers shift towards 
online shopping, this digital transformation reshapes the retail landscape, presenting opportunities and challenges for 
new eCommerce startups. As the market matures, the rapid growth seen in previous years is projected to slow, giving 
way to market saturation. By 2030, a big portion of the population is expected to have engaged in online shopping, 
leading to slower growth rates and expanded competition. In this changing landscape, startups need to develop long-
term strategies that can sustain growth, even as the market becomes more competitive and less welcoming to new 
players. 
This research employs a Markov Chain model to predict the adoption rates of the Bangladeshi e-commerce market 
from 2023 to 2030. By analyzing the transition probabilities between three key stages—Early Stage, Growth Stage, 
and Saturation Stage—this study provides a comprehensive forecast of the market's evolution over the next decade. 
The findings aim to offer actionable insights for e-commerce startups looking to navigate the increasingly competitive

Abstract 
The objective of this research article is to select the optimal mobile model from the various options available in the 
market. For the purpose of this analysis, 24 different mobile models from various brands were chosen from several 
online shopping platforms, covering a range of specifications and prices from low to medium budget. An online and 
offline survey was conducted with Rajshahi City residents, encompassing students, engineers, salespeople, medical 
professionals, teachers, and other experts. The selection process is done based on 31 important criteria i.e. price, ROM, 
RAM, operating system brand value, camera quality, battery capacity, and so on. AHP was used to check data 
consistency, and SPSS was employed to verify data reliability. This selection process incorporates two MCDM tools: 
Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution 
(TOPSIS). Applying individual COPRAS and TOPSIS methods, the best mobile is selected, with each process 
proposing its preference ranking order of the models. Comparing the proposed ranking orders by both methods shows 
that the outcomes are more or less identical, with minor changes in the middle-order rankings. Both processes give 
model 3 as the best among the 24 alternatives.

6. Conclusion 
In this paper, we explore the complex world of consumer decision-making in the mobile phone industry, emphasizing 
the difficulties brought on by excessive options, technology breakthroughs, and users' differing degrees of technical 
expertise. The study emphasizes the importance of in-depth research to match user preferences with mobile phone 
features and avoid post-purchase discontent. Here We have to identify the best mobile phone selection based on criteria 
on their user performance order and also help the manufactured company brands understand the customer's 
performance order. Here, In the TOPSIS analysis, the Infinix Note 30 Pro (8/256) emerges as the top-performing 
mobile phone model, securing the first position. Similarly, in the COPRAS analysis, the Infinix Note 30 Pro maintains 
its position as the best-performing model, reaffirming its superiority. The rank for the 1st four models is indifferent in 
both the two methods. It means the accuracy of this ranking is strong and highly reliable. These approaches' ongoing 
development and improvement demonstrate their continuing significance in tackling modern decision difficulties in a 
variety of sectors and applications. The paper presents approaches and insights that are important for consumers and 
decision-makers in the ever-evolving environment of consumer preferences and technical breakthroughs, as the mobile 
phone business continues to change.

Abstract 
NACA 4415 is the most common and studied airfoil in aerodynamic studies. Incorporating flaps with NACA 4415 
airfoil is an effective way to improve aerodynamic performance and efficiency. This study presents a comparative 
numerical analysis among a standard model of NACA 4415 airfoil, modified NACA 4415 incorporating gurney flap, 
and NACA 4415 airfoil incorporating bionic flap based on the coefficient of lift and coefficient of drag at various 
angles of attack (AOA) (i.e. -15°, -10°, -5°,0°,5°,10°,15°) and flap height of 2% of the chord length. The airfoil 
performance was evaluated under a constant upstream velocity of 20 m/s using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
simulations. The performance was measured based on lift coefficient over drag coefficient ratio and it is validated 
using velocity and pressure contour over the surface of the airfoil. The highest lift coefficient over drag coefficient 
ratio was found in the NACA 4415 airfoil incorporating a gurney flap, then the standard NACA 4415 airfoil and the 
least value of the ratio comes with the NACA 4415 airfoil incorporating a bionic flap. For instance, the Gurney flap 
made a big difference, boosting the lift-to-drag ratio by 49.9% at 0° AOA compared to the standard airfoil. Conversely, 
the bionic flap reduced this ratio by 19.86%. However, in every case, NACA 4415 airfoil with Gurney flap 
outperforms than other two airfoils in this study. Moreover, the velocity and pressure contour also support the result 
found from lift and drag coefficient.

1. Introduction

6. Conclusion and Future Research 
The realizable 𝑘𝑘−𝜀𝜀 turbulent model was used in this study to analyze the aerodynamic performance of the NACA 4415 
Airfoil and its modifications with Gurney and bionic flaps at various attack angles (-15°, -10°, -5°, 0°, 5°, 10°, and 
15°). To find out how these changes influenced important aerodynamic characteristics such as the lift-to-drag ratio, 
velocity distribution, pressure distribution, and pressure coefficient, Ansys FLUENT was utilized. The NACA4415 
airfoil with the Gurney flap has achieved the highest lift-to-drag ratio, increasing 49.9% above the conventional airfoil 
at 00 AOA. This demonstrates greater aerodynamic efficiency. In contrast, the bionic flap reduced the Cl/Cd ratio by 
19.86% at the same angle of attack, indicating that it is less effective in applications that favor lift. The gurney flap 
exhibited low trailing edge separation, providing improved lift generation across all AOAs. NACA 4415 with a bionic 
flap has the lowest separation. It may be ideal for stability-focused designs, such as airplanes or UAVs, which require 
consistent performance in a variety of flying circumstances. The Gurney flap increased pressure at the trailing edge, 
which facilitated increasing lift by using trailing edges. In contrast, the bionic flap had a more uniform pressure 
distribution at negative AOAs, resulting in less lift. For both the bionic flap and the normal airfoil, lift was primarily 
produced at the leading edge. 
 
The pressure coefficient distribution of the NACA 4415 airfoil and with gurney and bionic flap designs varies 
significantly with angle of attack (AOA). Lower lift at negative AOAs is caused by negative pressure on the lower 
surface and positive pressure on the top surface. The lower surface is under higher pressure when there are positive 
AOAs, so they produce more lift. The pressure differential coefficient was also found to be substantially smaller at 
the trailing edge than it is at the leading edge, despite being substantially larger there.In conclusion, the modified 
NACA4415 airfoil with Gurney flaps exhibits remarkable aerodynamic performance, suggesting it is for application 
295","Proceedings of International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management  
© IEOM Society International 
in high lift applications like wind turbines and unmanned aerial vehicles. The bionic flap efficiently reduces flow 
separation, but it also lowers lift; this suggests that it could be useful in situations where control and stability are more 
crucial than lift efficiency. When the angle of attack (AOA) was more than 100, the lift showed a decreasing trend. 
So, further research can be conducted with higher AOA which leads to determine the flow separation angle. Moreover, 
flap length also has a considerable effect on lift and drag. By varying flap length, optimal design can be obtained in 
the future.

Abstract 
Total Quality Management (TQM) is a quality management tool for improving quality by addressing issues related to 
the entire production process. It involves the process of detecting wastes occurred on a regular basis to improve the 
product quality to increase customer satisfaction. This paper has explored the application of TQM tools to identify 
defects in the sewing line of garment industries and address such issues using Standard Operating Procedures (SOP).

Analysis from the before and after evaluation of implementing SOP  
We can see that the 5S scores for oil spots has improved after SOP implementation in the sewing line of polo t-shirt 
from 4 to 9, showing a visible reduction in occurrence of oil spots now as regular and consistent cleaning routines are 
maintained now.  
 
The 5S score went from 5 to 8 for pleats, showcasing a better fabric handling and machine adjustments to prevent 
unintentional pleats during the production of a polo t-shirt.  
 
The score increased from 5 to 9 for raw edges after the SOP implementation, showing that proper seam allowances 
and overlock machine usage have effectively minimized raw edges.  
 
The score improved from 4 to 9, indicating how consistent needle maintenance and thread tension checks have reduced 
open stitches.

6. Conclusion: 
This study highlights the effectiveness of applying Total Quality Management (TQM) tools, like check sheets, 
histograms, Pareto analysis, and Cause-Effect diagrams chronologically to find the root causes and then taking action 
against them to improve the quality of polo t-shirt production by reducing defects and increasing efficiency through 
the implementation of SOPs. The actions taken against the identified major causes has shown significant improvement 
as the rework and wastes has reduced quite drastically. Besides this SOP application has reduced all non-productive 
activities in the sewing line which can be seen clearly from the before and after 5S score evaluation as the 5S has score 
has went from 102 to 163 after this. Though this research was limited to a single product which is a polo t-shirt and 
its production setting, and focused mainly on the sewing line, future studies could be expanded in to other garment 
types by including multiple production cycles, and integrate digital systems for real-time monitoring. Besides 
exploring the impact of employee training on sustaining quality improvements could also provide valuable insights 
for long term success in garment manufacturing.

Abstract 
The infrastructure development teams often face persistent challenges in effectively integrating project management, 
engineering management, and construction management skills. This often leads to misalignment of goals, 
miscommunication, and a lack of understanding between different teams. This paper explores the potential of 
generative AI (GenAI) to bridge these skill gaps and optimize management processes. By examining the capabilities 
of GenAI and analysing real-world case studies, we demonstrate how this technology can empower professionals to 
seamlessly transition between distinct roles and responsibilities. The findings highlight GenAI's transformative impact 
on enhancing efficiency, collaboration, and decision-making across the project lifecycle. The implications of GenAI 
for organizational reformation is also discussed in this paper with a focus on fostering a culture of innovation and 
sustainability in the infrastructure development.

Introduction 
In the realm of contemporary industrial practices, effective management of complex projects is essential for success. 
Within this context, the combination of project management, engineering management, and construction management 
abilities is paramount. However, effectively combining these skillsets habitually presents challenges, leading to 
misaligned goals, communication breakdowns, and a lack of understanding between different teams. This paper delves 
into the transformative potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to bridge these skill gaps and optimize 
management processes. Genai, an innovative technology, has emerged as a game-changer in various fields, and its 
potential applications in construction management are vast and promising. By analysing the capabilities of GenAI and 
examining real-world case studies, this paper aims to demonstrate how this technology can empower professionals to 
seamlessly transition between different roles and responsibilities. The findings highlight GenAI's profound impact on 
enhancing efficiency, promoting collaboration, and improving decision-making throughout the entire project lifecycle. 
1.1 Background 
In the contemporary landscape of industrial practices, effective project management is essential for achieving success. 
However, the construction industry faces persistent challenges in effectively integrating the distinct disciplines of 
Project Management, Engineering Management, and Construction Management. This misalignment often leads to 
gaps in communication, expertise, and decision-making, hindering project success as described below: 
310","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, 
hardware, and training, can be prohibitive, especially for companies operating in a developing economy like 
Bangladesh. 
Data and Infrastructure Limitations: 
Data Quality and Infrastructure: Successful AI implementation requires high-quality data and reliable infrastructure 
for data collection and processing, which many companies in Bangladesh lack (Ghimire et al., 2023). The availability 
of reliable data and the necessary infrastructure for data management can be a challenge in Bangladesh, limiting the 
effectiveness of GenAI applications. 
Quality and Availability of Data: AI systems necessitate extensive amounts of quality data, which can be difficult to 
obtain in the construction industry due to fragmented and inconsistent data sources (Ghimire et al., 2023). In 
Bangladesh, the deficiency of standardized data collection and management practices can further exacerbate this 
challenge. 
Technological and Skill-Related Barriers: 
Rework and Waste: A massive portion of construction costs goes to rework due to errors and omissions, which AI 
aims to reduce but requires substantial digitization efforts (Ghimire et al., 2023). The digitization of construction 
processes and the adoption of AI technologies can be challenging in Bangladesh, where traditional practices and 
manual processes are still prevalent. 
Slow Adoption: Despite recent advancements, the construction industry has been slow to implement modern 
technologies, including GenAI, due to traditional practices and resistance to change (Ghimire et al., 2023). This 
resistance to change can hinder the adoption of GenAI, even when its potential benefits are evident. 
Incorporation with Existing Systems: Incorporating GenAI with current construction management systems and 
workflows can be complex and costly (Ghimire et al., 2023). The lack of interoperability between different systems 
and the need for customized integration solutions can be a barrier to GenAI adoption in Bangladesh. 
Skill Gap: There is a lack of professionals with the essential expertise to create, install, and maintain AI systems in 
construction. (Ghimire et al., 2023). In Bangladesh, the lack of skilled professionals in AI and related fields can hinder 
the effective adoption and utilization of GenAI technologies. 
Other Challenges: 
Awareness and Understanding: There is limited awareness and understanding of GenAI technologies among 
construction professionals in Bangladesh. This lack of awareness can hinder the adoption of GenAI, even when its 
potential benefits are clear. 
Regulatory and Legal Framework: The absence of a clear regulatory and legal framework for AI in Bangladesh can 
create uncertainty and hinder the adoption of GenAI technologies. 
Addressing these difficulties requires a concerted effort from different stakeholders, including the government, 
industry associations, educational institutions, and construction enterprises. By investing in infrastructure 
development, skill-building initiatives, and awareness campaigns, Bangladesh can create a more conducive 
environment for embracing and utilization of GenAI in the construction sector. 
6.Conclusion
This study has explored the potential of GenAI to address the gaps and optimize management processes. By examining 
the capabilities of GenAI and analyzing real-world case studies and expert opinions, we have demonstrated how this 
technology can empower professionals to seamlessly transition between different roles and responsibilities, enhance 
communication and collaboration, improve decision-making, and promote sustainability. The findings highlight 
GenAI's transformative impact on the modern infrastructures, suggesting a future in which AI-driven solutions are 
essential to effective and sustainable project management. 
The mixed-methods approach used in this study, combining literature review, industry focus group discussions, and 
questionnaires, has offered useful insights into the prospective uses. and challenges of GenAI in construction 
management. The mapping of multiple GenAI model types to diverse building jobs has emphasized the flexibility and 
adaptability of this technology. The positive perception of GenAI's potential among industry professionals underscores 
the growing interest and acceptance of AI-driven solutions in the construction sector. 
319","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,  
However, the study also acknowledges the limitations and challenges of GenAI implementation, including the need 
for domain knowledge, addressing the risk of hallucinations, ensuring accuracy and generalizability, and managing 
ethical and regulatory considerations. Overcoming these challenges will require a collaborative effort from industry 
experts, researchers, and legislators to develop responsible and effective integration strategies. 
In conclusion, GenAI presents a unique opportunity to redefine and optimize management processes in the 
construction industry. By embracing this technology and addressing its challenges, the construction industry can move 
towards a more efficient, sustainable, and innovative future. The insights and recommendations presented in this paper 
serve as a valuable guide for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to navigate the transformative potential of 
GenAI in construction.

Abstract 
In the current unstable global economy, supply chain resilience (SCR) is essential for ensuring business continuation 
during disruptions. This study aims to identify and prioritize barriers to supply chain resilience (SCR) within the 
Bangladeshi food industry, a sector that has traditionally had difficulties due to inadequate resilience frameworks. 
This research utilizes the Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) 
to model the interrelationships among significant barriers, incorporating expert insights to provide a definitive 
hierarchy of barriers. The findings underscore the ""non-availability of a cross-multi-tasking workforce"" as the primary 
barrier, severely impacting the supply chain's flexibility and capacity to respond to disruptions. Furthermore, barriers 
such as ""increased product stock time"" were identified as impactful, but to a lower degree. This study presents a 
strategy framework to tackle these difficulties and delivers practical insights to improve SCR, especially in emerging 
markets such as Bangladesh. These findings are significant for practitioners and policymakers, endorsing proactive 
initiatives to enhance SCR and alleviate future risks.

1. Introduction
The supply chain is a crucial part of every organization in the connected world of today, and supply chain resilience 
(SCR) is essential to maintaining operational continuity in the face of disruptions (Gorane and Kant 2015). The 
COVID-19 pandemic exposed the weaknesses in global supply systems, leading to the closure of numerous smaller 
firms owing to insufficient resilience. Disruptions, including natural disasters, political hazards, and human-induced 
crises, can significantly affect supply chains (Parkhi 2015). SCR is the capacity of a supply chain to foresee, plan for, 
react to, and recuperate from disruptive incidents while sustaining service levels at the preferred standard (Bayraktar 
et al. 2020). This study is significant due to its emphasis on improving SCR, which has been crucial for maintaining 
corporate operations during unexpected disruptions, as starkly demonstrated during the pandemic [30]. A supply chain 
is considered resilient if it can predict and surmount disturbances. Literature identifies several attributes, including 
flexibility, preparedness, a culture of adaptability, collaboration, innovation, and redundancy, that enhance supply 
chains (Parkhi 2015). Despite substantial research in SCR, a deficiency persists in complete models that integrate 
decision-making approaches for an in-depth examination of supply chain barriers, especially within the Bangladeshi 
food sector. This sector has had considerable difficulties because to its inadequate SCR procedures (Mouloudi and 
Samuel 2022). This study aims to elucidate the barriers and offer strategic insights for their resolution.

5.2 Proposed Improvements 
Based on the findings of this research, several key improvements can be recommended for organizations:  
Cross-functional training to improve workers' ability to adapt to diverse supply chain operations and assume 
several responsibilities during disruptions. 
Job rotation programs enhance employee familiarity with various aspects of the supply chain, thereby promoting 
agility in response to unforeseen disruptions. 
Integration of digital systems to enable smooth data interchange and guarantee supply chain visibility between 
manufacturers, distributors, and suppliers. Blockchain and cloud computing technologies can markedly improve 
transparency and traceability. 
Adopt Just-In-Time (JIT) or Just-In-Case (JIC) strategies according to market conditions to facilitate rapid 
adjustments in inventory levels in response to demand variations, while minimizing holding costs. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study aimed to identify and analyze the most significant variables affecting SCR through the application of the 
Fuzzy TOPSIS method. Utilizing the Fuzzy TOPSIS methodology, this study identified and ranked critical barriers 
according to their impact, providing a framework for prioritized action. This research uncovers critical insights into 
the factors influencing SCR and their relative importance. Hence the objective of this study is fulfilled. Although this 
study focuses on the Bangladeshi food industry, the findings have broader implications for supply chain resilience in 
emerging markets and beyond. The barriers identified—such as workforce limitations are not unique to Bangladesh 
but are common challenges faced by industries worldwide, especially in developing economies. The insights from this 
study can be applied to other sectors in Bangladesh, as well as in other emerging markets with similar supply chain 
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the framework developed through this research applies to different industries and 
regions. By addressing workforce flexibility, supply chain collaboration, and logistical efficiency, businesses 
worldwide can enhance their resilience to disruptions, making the study's findings relevant across various contexts, 
including manufacturing, agriculture, and retail sectors globally. 
 
In conclusion, this study not only provides a deeper understanding of the barriers to SCR in the Bangladeshi food 
industry but also offers a foundation for future research that can extend these insights to other regions and industries. 
By taking a proactive approach to overcoming these barriers, organizations can build more resilient supply chains that 
are better equipped to withstand future disruptions. 
  
6.1 Limitations and Future Work 
While this study offers important insights into the barriers to SCR, there are several avenues for future research. 
Advanced modeling techniques, such as Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) or Structural Equation Modeling 
(SEM), could be applied to further explore the complex interrelationships between barriers. These techniques could 
help clarify the causal relationships and cascading effects of various factors within the supply chain. For instance, 
SEM could reveal how specific barriers influence each other over time, helping to develop a dynamic model of SCR 
that accounts for both immediate and long-term disruptions. Moreover, future research could incorporate real-time 
data analytics and machine learning approaches to predict the impact of various disruptions on supply chains. These 
techniques would allow for a more data-driven understanding of how different barriers interact under changing

conditions, providing a proactive tool for SCR enhancement. Additionally, studies could examine how external 
factors, such as changes in government policy or global supply chain trends, influence the relative importance of these 
barriers.

Abstract 
Additive Manufacturing (AM), commonly known as 3D printing, fabricates physical objects by successively adding 
layers of material. This technology is widely utilized for producing both metallic and non-metallic components. In 
particular, 3D printing has simplified the design, modification, and testing of non-metallic materials such as 
hyperelastic, thermoplastic, and rubber-like substances. However, accurate material modeling and validation are 
essential for analyzing these materials effectively. This study investigates the mechanical behavior of 3D-printed 
polylactic acid (PLA) under varying temperatures through numerical validation, complementing experimental 
analysis. Specimens were designed in SolidWorks according to ASTM D638 dimensional standards, with 100% infill 
density and a grid orientation angle of 0 degrees. The infill density and orientation angle significantly influence the 
mechanical properties of the specimens. The study focuses on three temperature conditions (20°C, 30°C, and 40°C) 
using a non-linear hyperelastic model (Neo Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin 2 parameter, and Yeoh 3rd order). Results 
demonstrate that temperature variations impact PLA's mechanical behavior. All these models were identified as 
suitable hyperelastic models for these conditions, with Neo-Hookean offering simplicity due to its single-parameter 
formulation. Additionally, a new equation was developed to estimate the model parameter of Neo Hookean for 
different temperatures.

1. Introduction
Additive Manufacturing (AM), widely known as 3D printing, has transformed the manufacturing industry by 
providing unparalleled design and production flexibility. This level of design freedom is unattainable with traditional 
manufacturing methods (Afshar et al. 2023). Unlike subtractive manufacturing, which shapes products by removing 
material, 3D printing creates objects layer by layer using a variety of materials, including polymers, metals, and 
ceramics. This layer-by-layer process enables the production of complex geometries and highly customized designs, 
making it invaluable across diverse industries such as aerospace, automotive, healthcare, and consumer goods (Gibson 
et al. 2015). 
A variety of materials are available for 3D printing materials, including polycarbonate (PC), acrylonitrile butadiene 
styrene (ABS), PC-ABS blend (Mohamed et al. 2015), polylactic acid (PLA), polystyrene (PS), polyamide (PA),

7. Conclusion 
This study investigates the mechanical behavior of 3D-printed PLA materials under varying thermal conditions 
through finite element analysis and hyperelastic modeling. By incorporating the Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and 
Yeoh models, we validated the strain-energy density of PLA at different temperatures, highlighting each model's 
accuracy and limitations. While the Neo-Hookean model offers simplicity, its single-parameter formulation struggles 
with high-strain nonlinearities. The Mooney-Rivlin model performs better across moderate strains, but the Yeoh model 
consistently provides the closest agreement with experimental data, especially under elevated temperatures. 
 
These findings emphasize the importance of accurate hyperelastic modeling for predicting the performance of PLA 
materials in applications where thermal effects are critical. Furthermore, the study introduces a simplified equation 
for estimating the Neo-Hookean parameter, enabling streamlined analysis for various infill densities. Future research 
could explore additional material blends and multi-parameter models to expand on these findings and enhance the 
applicability of 3D-printed PLA in advanced engineering applications.

Abstract 
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in many fields, leading to speculation about their 
potential role in achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI. Despite their high accuracy in language processing, 
this study argues that certain architectural and training limitations can stop LLMS from reaching AGI. We explore the 
fundamental characteristics of AGI, including consciousness, self-awareness, and continuous learning, and compare 
these with the capabilities of current LLMs. Our analysis indicates that LLMs are deficient in critical capabilities 
required for AGI, including knowledge generalization, novel learning methods, and autonomous reasoning. To rectify 
these deficiencies, we present a novel model that incorporates adaptive learning, sophisticated cognitive frameworks, 
and goal-oriented reasoning. This model advances the effort to transcend the limitations of LLMs and approaches 
AGI. 
Keywords
Large Language Models (LLMs), Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), LLM architecture, Consciousness, Self-
awareness. 
1. Introduction
The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised the crucial question of whether these models 
stand for a practical path toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While they outperform in many tasks like 
summarization, chat, question answering, zero-short and a few short learning, it is essential to critically examine their 
underlying architecture and training methodologies to assess their true potential for achieving AGI. Therefore, this 
paper discusses AGI and its different properties along with LLMs architecture and tries to investigate whether “Is 
current state of art LLMs or the Transformers and GPTs (Vasani et al., 2017) are capable enough to guide us toward 
AGI?”. 
1.1 What are LLMs? 
Large Language Model or LLM is the decoder-only auto-regressive model which takes a sequence of tokens and 
predicts the next token for that sequence. That decoder is based on the Transformer model introduced by Vaswani et 
345","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management, 
© IEOM Society International 
Consciousness: Action to solve a different problem does not necessarily enable consciousness and self-awareness. 
To enable human-level consciousness and self-awareness, the model needed to have first-order, second order, and 
third-order self-understanding and needed to acknowledge its existence. 
 
Facing Survival Issues: To achieve consciousness, any species had to go through natural selection. So, the species 
need to face extreme environments and need to survive those environments by mostly adapting to the environment. 
So, our AGI model also needs to go through survival challenges and learn to survive in those challenges by adapting 
to the current environment to achieve at least anything nearly like phenomenal consciousness. So, the environment 
needed to be tough and competitive.   
 
 6. Advantage of Our Proposal Over LLMs 
The proposed model can overcome the major drawbacks of LLMs, advancing progress in AGI research. Here are the 
Key advantages of this model include: 
 
Enable Self-Learning: The model incorporates an open exploration mechanism, eliminating the need for constant 
manual training to update its knowledge as needed in LLMs. It autonomously explores its environment, continuously 
learning from the actions of other entities and its own mistakes, without human-controlled intervention.  
 
Continuous adaptability: The proposed model is learning and understanding its environment and acknowledging its 
action-taking decision-making mistakes, it can refactor its decision-making strategy and perfectly fit with its 
surrounding environment.   
 
No need for well-structured high-quality data: Gathering, cleaning, and making well-structured high-quality data 
for LLMs is troublesome and costly work and often requires a lot of human resources. But this is continuous open 
exploration-based learners, it can learn and gain knowledge continuously by exploring the environment as much as 
humans do.    
 
Enables social learning: Our model learns by interacting with other entities and in this way, it also learns social 
relationships and thus improves its understanding of society. If the environment is a real world, it may also learn about 
human society and develop an understanding of human society's relationships. But LLM, which is a sequence-to-
sequence model, does not have the ability to open explore and interaction. So, it is impossible for them to build 
complex social relationships like our model can do.    
 
Survival Challenges for Growth: The proposed model can easily adapt to the environment, so when it faces any 
survival challenges it can refactor itself to adapt to those challenges and grow its various capabilities within the 
environment.  
 
Machine Consciousness: Our model mostly emphasizes enabling machines to be conscious, especially enabling 
phenomenal consciousness in machines. While LLMs do not have consciousness, the model ought to be as conscious 
as possible and the book discusses how the model approximates the major concepts of human cognition such as 
learning, interaction, relational spatiality, and awareness.  
 
Internal Evaluation and Predictive Thinking: The ability to internally evaluate actions before executing them gives 
our AGI model a level of foresight like human predictive thinking. It can simulate possible outcomes of actions and 
choose the best approach, which is a key aspect of intelligent decision-making. 
 
7. Conclusion  
Large Language Models have significantly advanced AI research, demonstrating remarkable proficiency in NLP tasks. 
However, as researchers of genuine Artificial General Intelligence, we argue that these factors alone are insufficient: 
without real-world grounding, ongoing learning, and fundamental cognitive capacities, such as self-awareness. These 
LLMs will not be considered as genuine Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). While they are beneficial for specific 
significant applications, their statistical characteristics, rather than genuine understanding, render them insufficient for 
universal intelligence. The key aspect is that contemporary LLMs are completely data-driven language models. Future 
study on AGI will benefit from exploring other methodologies for its development. Including embodied AI, neuro-
symbolic methodologies, and developmental learning frameworks. We assert that by implementing this methodology

and including the essential components of the AGI model we have suggested, we can achieve substantial progress 
towards the realization of genuine AGI.

Abstract 
This study investigates and optimizes the machining parameters of the CNC end milling process applied to mild steel 
workpieces, with a focus on surface roughness measurements. Traditional approaches typically assess surface 
roughness post-machining, but this research employs Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to analyze the impact of 
critical milling parameters—spindle speed (N), depth of cut (d), and feed rate (f)—on surface finish. The experimental 
work was conducted using Minitab 18 software, and response optimization techniques were utilized through 
Regression Analysis (RA) to determine the optimal process parameters. The optimized parameters identified include 
a spindle speed of 2000 m/min, a feed rate of 700 mm/pass, and a depth of cut of 0.1 mm, which achieved a minimum 
surface roughness of 1.64256 μm. The proposed model demonstrated an accuracy of over 80% in fitting the 
investigated values, indicating its effectiveness in identifying optimal conditions and enhancing milling process 
efficiency.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing technology as a discipline resides in a constantly evolving and highly competitive environment; the 
twin pressures of achieving greater, more precise production and finding new ways to meet demand are more acute 
than ever. (George & George 2024) Over the years, there has been increasing concern with the machining processes 
used in modern industries as industries change and become more selective with their requirements for high-quality 
production(Liu et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2021; Machado et al. 2024). Of all these processes, Computer Numerical Control 
Milling, or simply CNC milling, has become a core procedure that is an essential element of new-generation 
manufacturing. (He et al. 2024) For the detailed shapes and varied complex structural designs and patterns with great 
precision, CNC milling is considered a vital tool for the aerospace, automotive, medical device, and even business 
industries throughout heavy machinery products(Soori et al. 2024). Some of the critical CNC milling operations are 
part of the end milling process, and they assume a central role in creating parts with considerable precision and refined 
surfaces. CNC milling is versatile and can work on various materials; hence, it is commonly used in manufacturing 
parts expected to meet the highest quality standards(Nasution et al. 2024). Nevertheless, depending on the selected

6. Conclusion 
In the manufacturing industry, traditional machining procedures frequently result in challenges such as imprecise 
tolerances, poor surface polish, and high rejection rates. To overcome these issues, the study focused on optimizing the 
CNC milling machine's cutting settings to reduce surface roughness and improve product quality. Our investigation 
comprised setting and adjusting parameters such as spindle speed, feed rate, and depth of cut to observe how they 
affected surface roughness (Ra). We discovered that surface roughness rises with increasing feed rates and depth of 
cut, whereas decreases with higher spindle speeds. Optimized cutting settings were a spindle speed of 2000 m/min, a 
feed rate of 700 mm/pass, and a depth of cut of 0.1 mm, resulting in a minimum surface roughness of 1.64256 μm. 
The key contributions of this research include optimizing CNC milling parameters using Response Surface 
Methodology (RSM) and regression analysis to achieve improved surface roughness on mild steel. The study offers 
an accurate predictive model for surface roughness, with an 80% accuracy in fitting investigated values, enhancing 
practical machining efficiency. For future research, the study can explore more complex materials or alloy 
combinations under varied CNC milling conditions. Furthermore, integrating modern optimization methods, such as 
machine learning algorithms, could improve the prediction accuracy of surface finishes, potentially broadening the 
model's application to other machining processes.

Abstract 
The government of Bangladesh is unable to provide adequate support for grid extension and the supply of 
electricity to remote or rural areas as a result of the high investment and maintenance costs. The lack of power 
causes a crisis in fundamental human living values; education. Here three cases have been analyzed involving a 
rural location, Chandpur. This research compares a diesel-only system, a hybrid PV/Diesel/Battery system, and a 
hybrid without battery storage using HOMER Pro software. Technical aspects including Global Horizontal 
Irradiation and load demand were examined. According to these datasets, the model's peak demand was 405.71kW, 
which was utilized to create an off-grid model and optimize it using Homer Pro. The established system is capable 
of producing 885.654 MWh of energy annually. The principal analytical elements encompass the cost of electricity 
(COE), net present cost (NPC), renewable energy proportion, and carbon emissions. The results underscore the 
fact that hybrid systems, particularly those with battery storage, provide significant benefits in terms of reducing 
fuel consumption, lowering costs, and mitigating environmental impact. Therefore, they are the most viable option 
for future off-grid energy solutions.

1. Introduction
The growing global population is driving up the need for energy daily. There are over 1.2 billion individuals, or 
approximately 25% of the global population, who lack access to reliable electricity. This includes over 50 million 
individuals in Africa and 300 million individuals in India (Garg  2012). A major obstacle to global growth is the 
fact that most rural communities, especially those remote from mainland urban areas, do not have access to modern 
amenities and energy services. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which were unveiled by the United 
Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in January 2016, are largely dependent on cheap and clean energy, 
which is outlined in Goal 7. The major objective is to provide dependable, sustainable, and efficient power to 
everybody (Leal Filho et al. 2019). The vast majority of nations are currently trying to reach this objective. 
Nowadays most of the energy we use today comes from fossil fuels, which release greenhouse gases (GHGs) that

how important it is for current energy systems to use renewable energy. Not only does this method help the 
economy, it also makes a big difference in lowering emissions, which makes it a forward-thinking answer for 
meeting global climate goals. 
 
7. Conclusion: 
The advantages of integrating renewable energy sources and storage solutions into energy systems are evident in 
the analysis of a variety of microgrid configurations. Hybrid systems are clearly a better option than standard 
diesel-based models as the need for energy rises and environmentally friendly options become more important. 
Several important results of this study highlight the financial and environmental advantage of hybrid energy 
systems. Here are some of the most important insights: 
• Renewable energy sources that are part of hybrid microgrid systems are very good for the economy and the 
environment. 
• Diesel-only systems produce a lot more carbon dioxide and cost a lot more to run than systems that use solar 
PV and batteries for storage. 
• The efficacy and reliability of energy are enhanced by battery storage, which more effectively manages energy 
production and demand. 
• Sustainable and cost-effective hybrid systems support worldwide efforts to minimize fossil fuel consumption 
and greenhouse gas emissions. 
• The following results encourage the use of hybrid energy options in future energy systems to improve 
environmental sustainability and economic viability.

Abstract 
Styrofoam, or expanded polystyrene foam (EPS), is commonly used for packaging fragile items, insulation in 
construction, disposable food containers, crafting, and art projects. Its lightweight and insulating properties make 
it versatile. Additionally, it is used in floatation devices, horticulture, and construction formwork. Manual 
styrofoam cutting presents several challenges, including inaccurate cuts, rough surfaces, difficulty achieving 
consistency and precision, time-consuming processes, increased material wastage, and safety concerns. 
Automation through CNC machines, like the CNC Styrofoam Cutter, addresses these issues by providing 
precision, consistency, and efficiency in handling complex designs, offering a controlled and reliable solution for 
cutting styrofoam. Hotwire mechanism is used in this CNC machine to cut the Styrofoam. This paper analyses the 
relation between the supply current on the wire, kerf width of the cut, cutting time, and temperature variations 
during cutting to get the optimum cutting parameters.

1. Introduction
The industry is continuously developing. For example, Styrofoam decorations can be used in various things, such 
as placards, artwork, safety goods on shipping, etc. Using CNC Wire Cutter to make decorations will shorten the 
time needed (Sulkowski et al. 2009). In order to forecast and compute the surface roughness (Ra) and kerf width

Furthermore, when the cutting length grows, the temperature of the wire varies constantly. Figure 14 illustrates 
how the wire temperature fluctuates proportionately to the wire's supply current. With a 0.53mA current flow, the 
figure indicates the least amount of fluctuation in temperature with respect to the kerf width and the surface 
smoothness. This suggests the optimal range's precision as well. Here, Figures 14depict the temperatures of the 
cutting wire during the cutting process. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper proposes parameters for cutting the Styrofoam with nichrome hot wire CNC Styrofoam Cutter. When 
the current flow through the nichrome wire increases, the temperature increases and expands. Thus, the foam 
vapors fast, and the design of the foam gets distorted. On the other hand, when the current supply is low, the wire 
needs more mechanical force to cut, increasing the friction and providing rough surface. Also, any assumed current 
supply cannot get the minimum temperature fluctuations of the wire. That is why optimized cutting parameters 
are needed for accurate and smooth cutting, which is 0.53 mA in this case. Operating the CNC machine in this 
parameter provides optimum kerf width, cutting time and minimum temperature fluctuations. The optimized 
parameters on other types of foams can be analyzed in the future. Also, instead of using nichrome wires, the 
cutting parameters of other wires and their effect on surface roughness can be optimized.

Abstract 
Nowadays, the management of foundry machinery is expensive and complicated, not only because of the energy 
used, but also because of the polluting, lengthy and dangerous process. This perspective is relevant given that, in 
many metallurgical micro-enterprises, and even educational center laboratories, waste is generated that is sold at 
a very low price and a product made from virgin material is purchased, increasing the expense, time and natural 
consumption in the foundry process. The following innovation work develops a prototype proposal for a foundry 
process that provides optimization for the metallurgical industry on a smaller scale. The approach includes placing 
the material (waste) in a heating system that works through a conduction transfer, which is theoretically supported 
due to the short-circuit process complemented by Joule's Law, which is the conversion of electrical energy into 
heat until obtaining the molten material. Finally, an analysis of the results is carried out that demonstrate the 
effective mechanism after the use of a low melting point material as an example (Metal of Wood) after melting at 
a certain time (30 seconds) and temperature (88.3 ° C) with the efficient use of the converted amperage (192 A) 
and voltage (1.517 V) and the only resource of a conventional plug at 220V and 10A. In this sense, a low cost of 
obtaining is generated after decreasing the voltage and increasing the current, obtaining a reduction in the use of 
energy of -41.75% compared to other foundry process such as induction.

1. Introduction
In the production of aluminum, its operation requires the use of a lot of energy for its manufacture (Haraldsson, 
et al. 2021). However, by using waste, only 5% of energy would be needed to obtain the material as opposed to 
its production from the virgin element (Raabe, et al. 2022). Therefore, it is stated that a relatively high energy 
consumption is observed in the foundry industry (Leoni, et al. 2021). On the other hand, by using recycled 
material, 35% of energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be reduced (Raabe, et al. 2022), 
thus demonstrating that with this alternative, energy use and pollution to the environment can be considerably 
reduced. Companies are investing heavily in increasing energy efficiency and reducing consumption in systems 
such as machinery motors and compressors (Leoni  et al. 2021). Since a normal casting system can consume up 
to 45 kWh/kg (Raabe, et al. 2022), practical analysis seeks to improve the efficiency of energy use by the foundry 
industry (Leoni, et al. 2021) and thus achieve process optimization. There are studies on this topic that include an 
improvement in the use of waste heat in foundry process that can be reused to convert it into electrical energy 
(Chen, et al. 2021). 
Production efficiency does not always go hand in hand with energy efficiency (Górska & Daroń  2021), so the 
goal is to develop a smaller-scale casting mechanism that efficiently uses electrical energy and can be used to

Abstract 
The combination of Six Sigma with Total Quality Management (TQM) has emerged as an effective technique for 
increasing operational efficiency and reducing faults, particularly in the beverage industry. This study looks at how 
Six Sigma methodologies, specifically DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control), Cause and Effect (CE) 
analysis, the 5W2H framework, the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, Act) cycle, and Control Charts, can be used within the 
TQM framework to reduce defects significantly. The study examines production data both before and after these 
approaches are put into practice using a quantitative approach. The results show a significant decrease in defects, 
proving that Six Sigma tools combined with TQM techniques efficiently optimize workflows and enhance product 
quality. Production processes were significantly improved by the application of PDCA and DMAIC cycles, and CE 
analysis and 5W2H highlighted important areas for development. Throughout the deployment, control charts played 
a crucial role in monitoring and preserving process stability. Despite those positive findings, the study recognizes 
many shortcomings such as the difficulties in incorporating Six Sigma into current organizational designs and the 
substantial resources needed for effective execution. The outcomes highlight how crucial an effective support system 
and the commitment of senior management are to attaining long-term gains. Future studies should examine how 
sustainable the defect reduction made possible by this integrated approach is over the long run and whether it can be 
applied to other areas of the food and beverage industry. Further research is necessary to fully understand the

There is a noticeable improvement, showing that the values have changed significantly. Each section's top displays

5 Conclusions 
The broad theme of this paper is the quality issue that is being attempted to be resolved with various tools. The purpose 
of the study was achieved through a collaborative effort of TQM and Six Sigma. The advanced tool needs to be utilized 
at the highest level for improved quality and fewer errors. Multivariate techniques and quality control tools will be 
employed to get around complexity when it appears. The fishbone diagram identifies waste issues in the beverage 
sector due to disorganized production processes. The 5W2H tools address six sectors, requiring departmental 
implementation to reduce waste and achieve objectives. The improvement part aims to reduce waste by setting goals, 
creating control charts, and displaying quality changes at DPMO and Sigma levels. Further development is possible 
in various areas. 
 
5.1 Future recommendations: 
The beverage industry can enhance waste reduction by implementing lean manufacturing, employee training, and data 
analytics, thereby reducing material losses and equipment failures. In the beverage business, the Analytic Hierarchy 
Process (AHP) can be useful in reducing waste, particularly in decision-making procedures where several factors must 
be taken into account. AHP is an organized approach to decision-making that helps in the categorization of options by 
methodically evaluating and contrasting factors according to their relative significance (Hassan, 2013). Kaizen, a 
Japanese philosophy promoting continuous improvement, can significantly aid the beverage industry in waste 
reduction by utilizing machine learning algorithms for process optimization and improved yield. 
However, Integrating Six Sigma and TQM into the beverage sector can lead to high-quality products and a waste-free 
environment, ensuring profitability and increased consumer satisfaction.

Abstract 
The management of type 2 diabetes in rural Bangladesh is an alarming public health concern, compounded by 
restricted access to healthcare and inadequate health literacy. The purpose of the study is to assess the influence of 
mobile healthcare education platforms on increasing self-management behaviors among people in rural locations. An 
observational intervention study design was utilized, recruiting 100 people diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes from rural 
health clinics. Participants were sorted into two groups and examined with some questionnaires, and data was gathered 
this way. Baseline data on clinical indicators (HbA1c, fasting blood glucose), self-management behaviors (medication 
adherence, diet, and physical activity), and diabetes awareness were acquired. After a month of intervention, follow-
up assessments were made to analyze changes within and between groups. A statistical analysis was done based on 
the collected data to see the fluctuations in the scenario. The early data show that the intervention group had much 
better self-management behaviors, diabetes awareness, and lower HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels than the 
control group. Users of the mobile app reported increased medication adherence, dietary modifications, and physical 
activity levels, indicating better self-care practices. Qualitative evaluations also revealed high user satisfaction and 
perceived advantages of the app in normal illness management. The study demonstrates that mobile health education 
platforms may effectively boost self-management diabetes among rural people, thus lowering disease complications 
and hospital demands. This concept suggests a scalable approach to chronic disease treatment in resource-limited 
settings, boosting healthcare resilience using digital health interventions.

Abstract 
The research in circumvention focused on systematic problems largely prevalent among small and medium sized 
metalworking enterprises (SMEs) in Peru which is an important area in terms of both employment growth and 
competitiveness. The existing literature pointed out to a number of structural variability as well as lack of sufficient 
quality inspections to have negative productivity effects. In this study, the aim was enhancement of Overall Equipment 
Effectiveness (OEE) using integrated production comprising Lean Manufacturing and Total Productive Maintenance 
(TPM). Among the fundamentals of the work were standardization of work, autonomous and preventive maintenance 
of equipment. Results showed OEE when measured on the first production model increased from 64.93% to 81.15% 
and for the second model it increased while cycle time decreased from 50.69 to 43.87 hours implying an improvement 
of 13.46 percent. This study is relevant to the field of operational management as it provides a functional model that 
improves the reliability of outputs and the efficiency of inputs. The results point to the need of sustaining improvement 
and involving employees. Future research should seek to assess the relevance of this model in other areas and include 
digital components to enhance predictive maintenance.

1. Introduction
The role played by the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the metal-manufacturing sector globally, in 
Latin America and in Peru is very important. This sector constitutes a substantial portion of the worldwide economy 
as well as development and employment creation. As reported by the International Labor Organization (ILO), the 
share of jobs created by SMEs is about 70% across the world and even more significant in developing countries where 
it could go up to 90% of total registered businesses (Guo 2023). In Latin America, small and medium-sized metal 
engineering firms are important for industrialization and economic development because they produce and service 
many industries including the construction and automobile stylers (Marti et al. 2013). In Peru, not only does the small 
and medium metalworking industry enhance the creation of jobs but also provides the means for innovative 
competitiveness both in the national and international markets (Lazim & Ramayah 2010). With that being said, this 
sector encounters a number of challenges that need to be addressed as they hinder its growth and sustainability 
potential.

This research has effects that are long-term in nature since it helps develop a framework for SMEs to gain a competitive 
edge within their market segments. Integrating both TPM and Lean Manufacturing tools, a holistic approach to 
production processes optimisation is presented which can find use in various industries. The study revealed the fact 
that when operators participate in maintenance and standardization activities transformation of their mindset into 
practicing ownership and continuous improvement occurs. Such transformation of the corporate culture is critical to 
the persistence of the improvements and the organization's ability to compete in the marketplace. Furthermore, the 
results indicate that SMEs with scarce resources are able to benefit quite remarkably from the intensive training and 
application of these practices on a gradual basis. 
 
Last remarks suggest that there is need for developing additional case studies to analyze whether this model could be 
replicated in other industries and in more resource constrained scenarios. Although this case study demonstrated 
exhaustively the potential synergies of Lean and TPM integration in the area of metalworking, a wider scope would 
seek to confirm the applicability of this integration across all manufacturing sectors. That being said, more efforts are 
also necessary to explore the consequences of these practices on the employees’ level of commitment to their job and 
overall job satisfaction in the longer term, as these may impact on the enhanced sustainability of CI initiatives. The 
study of the digitalization of maintenance and standardization processes to predict failure and eliminate downtimes 
could also be worthwhile areas of study. 
 
Ultimately, the results of this study add to the literature the importance of implementing both Lean Manufacturing and 
TPM as systems for integration in the case of the SMEs dealing in metal segment. The study succeeded in improving 
some metrics of OEE, cycle time and cost minimization in the production process in relationships that included 
variability in structure, inspection supervision and equipment idle time. At first glance, such results seem to offer a 
favorable opportunity for SMEs to focus on increasing their production processes efﬁciency without requiring too 
much investment, on the condition, however, that the firm encourages its staff by providing adequate training. The 
model proposed expands the body of knowledge by showing an easy to implement and easy to scale model geared 
towards achieving operational excellence of the firm. These studies might leverage on the aforementioned studies and 
expand their scope to include assistive tech solutions integrated into the model as well as test this model in different 
manufacturing settings.

Abstract 
The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had wide-ranging industry-level impacts. As COVID-19 creates further 
economic uncertainty and loss, maximizing returns, and managing risk. The study starts by looking at underlying 
factors that lead to supply chain interruptions from COVID-19 to unforeseen uncertainty. The study also highlights 
the significance of continuous improvement and adaptation. In essence, the COVID-19 pandemic-related supply chain 
disruptions are being addressed by the global steel and rolling industries. We learn from this research which strategies 
essential for sustainability have the greatest positive effects. Aside from the strategies, the various impacts will be 
quantified. For studying the impacts based on various strategies and criteria, analytical Fuzzy TOPSIS and Best Worst 
Method (BWM) systems are utilized. Implementing a continuous learning culture and conducting post-disruption 
analysis facilitates the identification of lessons learned and the implementation of preventive measures. Agile and 
adaptable supply chain structures enable organizations to quickly respond to unforeseen disruptions and adjust their 
operations accordingly. Bangladeshi steel & rolling industries may successfully handle disruptions, improve supply 
chain resilience, and guarantee ongoing company operations in an increasingly unstable global environment by 
implementing these techniques and forming solid relationships.

. 5.3 Proposed Improvements  
The study aims to enhance the abstract by focusing on key findings and implications, highlighting the originality of 
the research. The introduction should clarify the problem and importance of supply chain disruptions in a broader 
context, highlighting the research questions or hypotheses. We should expand the methodology section to elucidate 
the MCDM approaches (fuzzy TOPSIS and BWM) and their efficacy within this context. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The proposed strategy and study results can aid decision-makers in formulating tactical choices that will increase 
sustainability in SCs in the face of the pandemic. After systematic literature review and analysis many previous models 
are analyzed in the methodology section and finally using fuzzy topsis and BWM. The study will be based on 
questionnaire approach, so all the questionnaire are attached in the appendix section. From the responses of supply 
chain experts, I have found the best and worst criteria by applying the BWM method. Besides, the criteria weight was 
used to find the strategies ranking by the fuzzy topsis method. This study looked at adaptable SC techniques to lessen 
the effects of COVID-19 and modeled how these strategies relate to one another based on the opinions of experts. 
However, by utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM) and multiple regression based on more quantitative data, a 
more thorough association model can be created and validated in the future. Future comparisons between the ranking 
of flexible SCs tactics and other quantitative approaches are possible. Once more, the current research has investigated 
the adaptable strategies and combined them to recommend a single framework to enhance sustainability in the context 
of COVID-19.  
 
Additionally, it has several limitations. Although the data in this case was gathered from a few well-known 
Bangladeshi steel industries, the results might not accurately represent the entire situation. The proposed approach's 
conclusions are mostly concentrated on Bangladesh's steel sector, while they are intended to be relevant to other 
industries as well. Future research can assess the effects of employing these tactics in emerging economies' businesses. 
Additionally, the proposed model was created using the Bangladeshi steel industry as an emerging economy, Future 
research can be done on additional industries from both emerging and mature economies to generalize the results.

Abstract 
Inventory control problems often arise in different types of businesses. This article presents a case study of a company 
dedicated to selling, installing and servicing industrial, commercial and residential air conditioning and heating. The 
company does not have internal control of its inventories in its product warehouses. In 2022-2023, 3,042 problems 
related to warehouse management were recorded, with an average of 84.49 problems/month. This caused economic 
problems, project delays, inadequate delivery times, and the inability to guarantee their quality certification goals in 
the short term. Therefore, the objective of this study is to reduce these problems significantly. For this purpose, lean 
manufacturing tools such as 5S, Kaizen, and Kanban are implemented. After implementing the improvement, the 
company had formats for ordering and returning materials to the warehouses and a database for recording materials. 
In addition, warehouse problems were reduced to 79, with an average of 26.3 problems/month. This concludes that 
the application of lean manufacturing tools can have a significant impact on warehouse management.

1. Introduction
All manufacturing-oriented companies face the problem of managing different items daily, so the success of each 
business depends on the continuous flow of parts in the supply chain (Vukićević et al. 2021). However, the operation 
of warehouses becomes more complicated due to the increasing abundance of goods, so the usual warehouse 
management strategies are no longer adequate (Jarašūnienė et al. 2023). An effective materials management system 
is critical to the success of a company's projects. However, companies suffer from materials management problems 
that lead to inefficiency (Kar and Jha 2020). Several studies have evidence of the various problems arising from poor 
warehouse materials management. For example, a study in the Indian construction industry identified 33 materials 
management problems and six factors with significant influence in disrupting project schedules and costs. Another 
study mentions that other companies with high material flow are printing companies whose management could be 
significantly improved (Vukićević et al. 2021).  
This article presents a case study of a company dedicated to selling, installing and servicing industrial, commercial 
and residential air conditioning and heating. The company is located in the city of Tijuana, Mexico. It operates with 
32 employees who are responsible for providing their knowledge and skills to transform commercial, cultural, 
educational, health, government, and industrial projects. The company has three warehouses, A, B, and C, where it 
stores its goods. However, it does not have internal control of its product inventories. Figure 1 shows evidence of the

Procedure for dispatching materials in the warehouses: 
1) Receipt of the material order request: The warehouse assistant receives the order form from the operator, 
which must contain the list of materials required.  
2) Format verification: The warehouse assistant verifies that the order form has the signature of the 
requesting manager.  
3) Entering information into the system: The warehouse assistant enters the codes of the requested materials 
specified in the form and performs the search in the AROS system to control materials. 
4) Stock results: The warehouse assistant knows the information of the material requested in the order form 
through the AROS system. If the information on the stock of materials is up to date, the warehouse 
assistant proceeds to print the accepted order form. 
5) Notification to the requesting user of the confirmation: If the requested material stock is available, the 
warehouse assistant confirms to the operator that the requested material will be delivered. 
6) Delivery of material to the requesting user: The receiver must sign the material dispatch form and verify 
that the quantities and conditions of the material are correct. 
7) End: The process is finished, and the information is saved in the corresponding files and records. 
 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
Both the general objective and the specific objectives were met. Problems affecting the control and management of 
the company's warehouses were reduced by implementing lean manufacturing tools, such as the 5S. The specific 
objectives were met by reducing the problems affecting warehouse control, validating the physical stock of raw 
materials in the warehouses, storing the information in a new database, and establishing the use of Kaizen event 
formats for the company's continuous improvement. 
 
In addition, it is concluded that Kaizen, 5S and Kanban tools complement each other. To start with the Kaizen 
methodology, one must first have a 5S base. Based on the application sequence of the tools, raw materials and inputs 
can be easily located, allowing for quick and efficient inventory management. Kanban systems facilitate inventories 
and knowledge of raw materials and inputs moving within the company, with which products are codified, and all 
processes and activities are standardized. Once completed, Kaizen is applied, which allows for analyzing the 
problems detected in the process and their root causes. Finally, a strategy is applied to obtain the benefits of 
continuous improvement. This is obtained by estimating the training results with the personnel using the warehouses, 
allowing them to improve or find solutions before they are requested. 
 
On the other hand, it is recommended to maintain the current practices of the tools implemented, projecting them to 
other areas to improve the supply system. Staff should continue to receive training in new techniques and tools. It is 
recommended that the constant monitoring and evaluation of the improvement activities implemented continue, and 
the diagrams should be updated according to the changes in the procedure. In addition, it is recommended that the 
proposed management tools Kaizen, 5S, and Kanban be applied, as well as a checklist questionnaire every month 
immediately after completing the 5S process to improve the new processes within the warehouse area.

Abstract 
Effective solid waste management is essential for addressing environmental challenges and harnessing energy 
recovery opportunities, especially in developing countries like Bangladesh. This study examines the waste 
management system of Rajshahi City Corporation (RCC) to explore its energy recovery potential and environmental 
benefits. The methodology involves a systematic segmentation of RCC's waste management system, including waste 
collection, transportation, and final disposal. A detailed survey was conducted across households in RCC to determine 
waste generation rates and composition, revealing that 90% of the waste is organic, while 10% is recyclable. Proximate 
analysis was employed to measure moisture, volatile matter, ash, and fixed carbon content of food waste, while 
ultimate analysis identified its elemental composition, including carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. 
Calorific values of different waste components were determined using a bomb calorimeter, establishing food waste as 
a significant energy source with 31.416 MJ/kg. The study estimates that RCC generates approximately 270 tons of 
food waste daily, with a potential energy output of 7.01 MW considering conversion efficiencies. Recycling practices 
in RCC were also analyzed, focusing on the roles of informal collectors and small recycling factories in processing 
480","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

The study identifies critical gaps in RCC’s recycling practices. While the city generates approximately 32.4 tons of 
recyclable waste per day, only 8.53% (2.76 tons/day) is recycled, with the remaining 91.47% (29.64 tons/day) directed 
to landfills. This reflects inefficiencies in source sorting and collection systems. Five small recycling factories in the 
BSCIC area of Sapura process 75–800 tons of waste daily, primarily focusing on plastics. These factories employ 
processes such as sorting, cutting, washing, drying, and packing plastic waste, which is then transported to Dhaka for 
further manufacturing. However, the limited capacity of these factories necessitates greater investment in local 
recycling infrastructure. 
 
The results reveal significant opportunities and challenges. While the calorific value and composition of waste 
highlight potential energy recovery and recycling avenues, the low recycling rates and reliance on informal processes 
pose challenges. Enhancing source segregation, improving recycling facilities, and investing in waste-to-energy 
technologies can significantly improve waste management outcomes. Furthermore, public participation in source 
sorting and robust policy frameworks are essential for achieving sustainable waste management in RCC. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This study comprehensively examined the waste management system of RCC, focusing on its potential for energy 
recovery and recycling, while identifying challenges and strategies for sustainable waste management. The findings 
align closely with the research objectives. First, the analysis of waste generation, composition, and elemental 
characteristics revealed that 90% of RCC's solid waste is organic, with a high calorific value of 31.416 MJ/kg for food 
waste, supporting its energy recovery potential. This aligns with the objective of evaluating energy recovery 
opportunities within RCC's waste management system. Furthermore, the study identified the inefficiencies in 
recycling practices, as only 8.53% of recyclable waste is processed, emphasizing the need for enhanced source 
segregation and infrastructure. This addresses the objective of identifying challenges and proposing strategies for 
improved sustainability in RCC's waste management practices. 
 
The results further highlighted that integrating waste-to-energy technologies could generate approximately 7.01 MW 
of energy daily from organic waste. These findings underscore the feasibility of converting waste into valuable energy 
resources while reducing environmental impacts, fulfilling the objective of proposing actionable strategies. Despite 
its contributions, the study has some limitations. The analysis relied on data from a single urban center, which may 
not fully represent the diverse waste management challenges and opportunities across Bangladesh. Additionally, the 
study primarily focused on food and plastic waste, leaving other waste categories less explored. Projections for energy 
recovery and recycling potential were based on theoretical calculations and laboratory-scale experiments, which might 
differ from real-world outcomes due to technical, financial, and policy constraints. 
 
Future research could expand on these findings by exploring waste management practices across multiple cities to 
develop a more generalized framework for Bangladesh. Advanced waste characterization studies could also be 
conducted to include other waste types, such as hazardous or e-waste, to ensure comprehensive sustainability 
strategies. Moreover, pilot projects for waste-to-energy technologies in RCC could validate the energy recovery 
estimates and provide practical insights into implementation challenges and cost-benefit analyses. Lastly, examining

Abstract 
The textile and apparel industry of Bangladesh is the backbone of its economy, although this industry faces challenges 
in optimizing productivity and resource utilization due to inefficient workflows and bottlenecks. This study evaluates 
and compares three assembly line balancing methods, the Largest Candidate Rule (LCR), Rank Positional Weighted 
(RPW) Method, and Moodie Young Method with the Existing Method in a sewing line in an apparel industry. The 
analysis focuses on key performance metrics, including balance accuracy, resource utilization, bottleneck reduction, 
and material flow index (MFI). Results indicate that the Moodie Young Method demonstrates the highest resource 
efficiency, requiring only 39 machines and minimizing double machine workstations while achieving a moderate 
balance accuracy of 83%. In comparison, LCR and RPW achieve the highest balance accuracy of 90% but each 
requires a high number of 52 machines. The Existing Method exhibits significant inefficiencies, with the lowest 
balance accuracy (78%) and the highest number of bottlenecks (9). This nobility of the research is that it introduces 
MFI as a critical metric to evaluate material flow efficiency to ensure workflow continuity. Additionally, this approach 
highlights the effectiveness of heuristic techniques in balancing operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The 
study’s outcomes provide a comparative analysis of 3 assembly line balancing methods in apparel industries, with 
potential applications in other manufacturing sectors. Future research could incorporate external variables and real-
time data for further optimization.

1. Introduction
The demand for optimized workflows and minimized production delays has become essential for apparel and garment 
manufacturing industries that are facing competitiveness and resource constraints. The garment industry in Bangladesh 
is the biggest contributor to the national economy, contributing over 80% of the country’s export revenue and 
employing a large number of workers, primarily women (Chowdhury et al. 2014). However, this sector faces 
significant productivity challenges due to inefficiencies and bottlenecks in production lines. Previous studies 
highlighted that these issues cause avoidable inefficiencies in the production line, which collectively lead to reduced 
lead times and production costs (Tareque et al. 2020). Furthermore, occupational health and safety concerns, 
particularly following the Rana Plaza tragedy (Bossavie et al. 2023), have further worsened the productivity situations

Abstract 
In recent times, breast cancer has become one of the major health concerns for women which can have a severe impact 
on the overall well-being of the affected and may even result in death. Women, being an essential part of today’s 
world, require a top-notch healthcare system that can ensure their overall well-being and address even sensitive issues 
like breast cancer. So, it is essential to develop a breast cancer detection system that can detect breast cancer effectively 
and discriminate between dangerous malignant and benign tumors incorporating advanced machine learning 
techniques. Notably, promising results have been shown by algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and 
Naïve Bayes. Nevertheless, previous studies have only examined the model’s overall performance. The models 
contain no information regarding the multiclass performances of the evaluation matrices. To address these gaps, this 
study aims to identify the most efficient algorithm for classifying and predicting breast cancer. The analysis comprises 
a dataset that encompasses two distinct kinds of breast tumors: Malignant and Benign. This study evaluates the 
performance of the three mentioned methods by conducting thorough experiments employing k-fold cross-validation. 
Furthermore, the multiclass classification of various tumors showed superior performance compared to the K-Nearest 
Neighbors technique and other algorithms. This approach for evaluating the performance of several categories would 
provide important findings and an in-depth understanding of the overall model's performance which can be useful for 
future research. 
Keywords 
Breast cancer, Classification, Decision tree, Naïve Bayes, K-nearest neighbor. 
1. Introduction
Breast cancer is the primary cause of death among women. Predicting breast cancer from medical data analysis is a 
challenging task, and pathologists and doctors need automated approaches to assist them in differentiating between 
malignant and benign tumors. Worldwide, breast cancer is the most widespread form of cancer among women. The 
development of breast cancer is a result of abnormal growth in some cells of the breast. Various techniques have been 
devised to accurately detect and diagnose breast cancer. The GLOBOCAN 2020 report emphasized the concerning 
consequences of cancer, documenting a total of 19.3 million instances and 10 million fatalities in the year 2020 (Sung 
et al. 2021). Out of these instances, the occurrence of female breast cancer resulted in 2.3 million additional diagnoses, 
along with a challenging increase in mortality rates. Breast cancer has a severe impact on women's lives, although 
mortality can be reduced by increasing awareness and facilitating diagnosis and early detection (Patil et al. 2020). The 
medical field produces vast quantities of data on diverse disorders, which can be employed for analysis and 
prognostications. The adoption of technology has greatly facilitated doctors and pathologists in accurately predicting 
medical outcomes, hence decreasing the requirement for unnecessary medical expenses and guaranteeing that patients 
receive appropriate care. Timely identification can potentially prevent fatalities in some situations (Chaturvedi et al. 
2021). Mammography, also referred to as breast screening, is a diagnostic method used to detect breast cancer.

Figure 10.  Before and after 10k-fold cross-validation accuracy score for NB 
 
From Table 1, we can see that the accuracy rate was increasing for KNN and Naïve Bayes. But it was decreasing for 
Decision Tree. KNN outperformed Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes in all metrics, making it the most suitable model 
for breast cancer classification in this scenario. While Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes also performed reasonably well, 
their performance fell slightly behind that of KNN. Further fine-tuning or ensemble techniques could potentially 
improve the performance of all models. After completing the comparison between these three machine learning 
algorithms, this study proposes the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm for breast cancer classification and 
prediction.  
 
6. Conclusion 
Technological advances have had a substantial impact on reducing mortality rates in the vital field of breast cancer 
research. A wide range of machine learning approaches has been developed to efficiently evaluate sophisticated 
medical datasets. Precise medical diagnosis relies heavily on the accurate and efficient categorization of breast cancer 
data. There are still obstacles in raising the accuracy levels of breast cancer data identification, despite the development 
of multiple methods. This study examines in detail various machine learning techniques that are utilized to predict the 
possibility of breast cancer. The main goal of this research is to determine the algorithm that demonstrates the most 
effectiveness in properly forecasting breast cancer. The study aims to gather and integrate previous research on 
machine learning algorithms used in predicting breast cancer, providing significant insights for individuals new to 
these algorithms. To achieve this, the researchers carried out a systematic literature review. The accuracy of Machine 
Learning algorithms used for breast cancer prediction, classification, and diagnosis has been determined to vary 
depending on the dataset, indicating an important research need. The study's authors have developed a decision-
making approach to find a flexible Machine Learning algorithm that consistently achieves high accuracy when used 
to predict and classify breast cancer across various datasets. In conclusion, the analysis finds the K-Nearest Neighbor 
(KNN) algorithm with 10k-fold cross-validation as the top performer, with an astounding accuracy rate of 97%. There 
are many more machine learning algorithms in this era. In the future, we will try to compare this K-Nearest Neighbor 
(KNN) with other machine learning-based algorithms.

Abstract 
The Government of Bangladesh launched Doel Laptop project in 2011 with the aim of reducing the digital divide and 
promoting technology literacy among its citizens. As the first locally assembled laptop in the country, the Doel laptop 
was expected to be an affordable solution for students and the public. However, the project faced numerous challenges 
and ultimately failed to meet its objectives. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the reasons behind the failure 
of Doel Laptop project and extract some lessons that can be learned to ensure better success rate for any technology 
initiative undertaken by Bangladesh. Through qualitative research, this study reviews existing literature, news articles, 
case studies and official reports from Telephone Shilpa Sangstha (TSS) regarding the Doel Laptop project. Additional 
calculations have been made to get financial losses and investigate the reasons for the project’s failure. The Doel 
Laptop project started well with demand for the Primary 2102 model, which costs Tk 10,000. This lowest priced model 
only saw sales of 98 units over a two-year period despite a price reduction to Tk 5,000 leading to high demand. By 
2013, there were a total of 26,622 laptop PCs sold, two-thirds of which were purchased by the Ministry of Education. 
The project faced major difficulties due to issues with partners 2M Corp and TFT, who held a 75% stake in the venture. 
Inside a year, both partners stepped back, while TFT asked for expensive kit in return. In 2013, however, only 28000 
out of 37 059 assembled laptops were sold. The Doel Laptop project can be treated as a case study for future tech 
initiatives in Bangladesh. This failure shows why good planning is needed with quality and public-private 
collaborations. Later projects should focus on product testing, consumer response potential and sustainability of 
funding.

Abstract 
Project selection is a critical component of strategic management and organizational development, as it directly 
impacts resource allocation, risk management, and overall project success. This paper provides a comprehensive 
review of the literature on project selection criteria over the last two decades, spanning industries such as construction, 
healthcare, information technology, education, and manufacturing. This study identifies key factors influencing 
project selection, including financial metrics, resource optimization, risk management, and alignment with 
organizational strategy. Specifically, in the context of the corporate environment, such generic values as success 
measurement by financial indicators are still dominant, as opposed to such values as sustainability and corporate 
responsibility which have emerged as critical in the twenty-first century. Nevertheless, the public sector tends to 
consider social objectives and legal requirements, which may apply multiple divisional goals. Lastly, the review 
provides some implications for the study on project selection and concludes that both the quantitative and qualitative 
methods should be adopted. This study provides valuable insights for practitioners and researchers by consolidating 
past approaches and identifying future trends. This study also suggests a more holistic approach to project selection, 
incorporating both traditional metrics and emerging priorities.

1. Introduction
Choosing right projects is core competency of project management since it defines organizational strategic objectives 
and impacts success rate. Project evaluation refers to the act of assessing a number of projects to possibly fund or 
undertake when comparing with other projects against criteria in order to make the best decision for overall project 
selection. It is the objective of this literature review to consolidate these studies effectively define criteria-based 
methodologies and tools used with respect to project selection in various fields including healthcare sector, 
construction sector, information & technology sector, education sector and manufacturing & operations sector. Thus, 
it is crucial to grasp the role and significance of choosing projects in today’s commercial contexts as pivotal for an 
organization’s performance and longevity. An effective project selection process helps an organization to harness 
talent and funds for the right projects, ensure that efforts are focused towards achieving organizational objectives, and 
to avoid bad debts, thus improving on the performance of the organization. In today’s world of complex and 
competitive markets, it cannot be enough just to apply simple tests for evaluating projects and choosing the right ones. 
Many works in the past focused on the variety of methods and criteria applied to assess projects for inclusion in the 
portfolio in various sectors and settings. For instance, Shenhar et al. (2001), argued that the principle of improving 
performance and competitiveness can be achieved by integrating projects with the organizations strategic business 
goals. Martinsuo and Lehtonen (2007) pointed out the same idea emphasizing the strategic use of portfolio 
management for selection of projects, and stressed that the cause of managing is to provide a systematic and rational

Abstract 
Technologies are transforming supply chain management (SCM) in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. However, there 
are several obstacles in Bangladesh's way of achieving digital SCM, including those related to technology, skills, and 
the economy. The goal of this study is to prioritize these technologies by creating an integrated multi-criteria decision-
making (MCDM) framework, also to identify the technologies and implementation factors for digitalizing the supply 
chain in Bangladesh under the Industry 4.0 environment. By using DEMATEL (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation 
Laboratory) and COBRA (Comprehensive Distance Based Ranking) techniques, the study was able to evaluate and 
rank the technologies that are necessary to achieve SCM 4.0. Five industry experts specifically rated and ranked 
technologies considering the following factors: Economic Feasibility, Technological Compatibility, Skill and Human 
Resource Requirements, Impact on Supply Chain Efficiency, Risk and Security Challenges, and a few others. 
According to DEMATEL analysis, ""Impact on Supply Chain Efficiency"" came in first place, highlighting the 
significance of improvements in SCM performance brought about by Internet of things (IoT), Artificial intelligence 
(AI), and cloud computing. The main focus of these factors, according to the COBRA ranking order, is on cloud 
computing and big data analytics since they are more cost-effective and provide higher returns on investment. 
This study highlights the necessity of deploying technologies to facilitate a strategic SCM 4.0 with numerous 
components and suggests investigating hybrid models to advance technology adoption frameworks. This framework 
aims to support industry actors and policymakers in identifying challenges to overcome and maximizing the 
advantages of SCM 4.0.

1. Introduction
The pace at which technological growth is taking place has provided room for growth and improvement of industries, 
societies, and companies for that matter. There have been advancements in the technical aspect of the supply chain 
management systems. The contemporary customers are highly web-connected, informed and better empowered as 
they have a variety of choices. They want variety of products and/or services, they want delivery options, and they 
want it faster today than yesterday. For instance, while complaints about a week wait for products were common in 
the past, such time, the current consumers are likely to make their purchase decision based on how fast the product is 
delivered (PwC 2016). In terms of the industries as well as society, digitalization is taking a rather interesting trend 
whereby this leaves businesses with no other option but to digitize core aspects of the organization. This form of 
adoption is in order to improve interaction with customers, boost the development and selling of products, encourage

1. Introduction
The scheduling of projects within available resources is a key component of project management practice, particularly 
in areas where resources are limited and there is a need to manage several projects at once (Sánchez et al. 2022).   They 
define the resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problem (RCMPSP) as that entails the process of allocating 
start times to the tasks associated with two or more projects that have to be carried out concurrently while ensuring all 
internal task relationships are satisfied and resources are constraints. The allocation of resources, the arrangement of 
activities, and the achievement of project completion on time are critical for the success of the project and efficient 
management of resources. The resources used in projects can be categorized as renewable, non-renewable, or partially 
renewable (Sánchez et al. 2022). Renewable resources are consistently restored at the beginning of each period, 
allowing for repeated usage within the project, such as labor hours, machineries, equipment (Asadujjaman et al. 2021a; 
Asadujjaman et al. 2022). Non-renewable resources, on the other hand, are finite within the entire project timeframe; 
once allocated, they cannot be replenished, making careful allocation essential (Asadujjaman et al. 2021b). An 
example is a fixed budget allocated for the project’s duration, which, once used, cannot be restored. This type often 
requires consideration of multiple execution modes, as varying tasks may use resources at different rates. Lastly, 
partially renewable resources are replenished periodically within the project duration.  The management of resource 
allocation over several projects at the same time presents a huge challenge due to their complexities (Cristóbal et al. 
2018; Zarpov 2024). In the last couple of decades, both researchers and practitioners trying to look for better and new

Abstract 
This paper explores the predictive power of data mining for ice cream sales, emphasizing the critical role that 
temperature plays in determining market patterns. The study investigates the intricate relationship between 
weather and consumer behavior, which is essential for adjusting to temperature variations brought on by climate 
change, using linear regression and XGBoost algorithms. Although the XGBoost model shows slightly better 
performance in specific metrics, the Linear model exhibits greater stability under extreme conditions. The 
temperature-sales relationship is frequently ignored by traditional forecasting techniques, which results in 
inefficient supply chains. This research offers a trustworthy predictive model to improve decision-making across 
sectors by utilizing data mining. Driven by the potential for data mining to optimize company processes, the study 
emphasizes advantages such as enhanced production scheduling and focused marketing approaches. The complete 
insights provided by the empirical results from both mod els help stakeholders make informed decisions on the 
influence of temperature on sales. Although the study acknowledges its limits in terms of breadth and data 
availability, it also proposes future research directions that could involve more variables and sophisticated 
approaches. Finally, by elucidating the complex relationship between ice cream sales and the weather, this thesis 
enhances predictive analytics and provides useful insights for companies operating in data-driven contexts.

Abstract 
This study looks into the weaknesses in Bangladesh's ready-made garment (RMG) supply chain, which was made 
public during the most recent political unrest. Its goal is to pinpoint important elements that are essential to the chain's 
long-term viability. Political unrest has had a major impact on the RMG industry, which is a major engine of 
Bangladesh's economy, impairing operations and supply chain effectiveness. This report classifies and ranks the 
primary elements that caused the disruption based on data gathered from industry stakeholders. It also emphasizes the 
crucial components needed to create an RMG supply chain that is strong enough to weather possible political 
upheavals in the future. The paper offers a strategic framework for policymakers and business leaders to reduce risks 
and shield the sector from additional change by methodically identifying these elements. The results provide a road 
map for improving resilience, stability, and sustainable growth in one of Bangladesh’s most vital industries.

Introduction: 
 With millions of jobs and a substantial GDP contribution, Bangladesh's ready-made garment (RMG) sector is a vital 
component of the country's economy. The stability of the industry is, nevertheless, extremely vulnerable to both 
internal and external disturbances, especially political upheaval. According to Kamal and Kaiser (2015), recent 
political upheavals in Bangladesh have revealed serious weaknesses in the RMG supply chain, resulting in labor 
disputes, operational delays, and communication and logistics breakdowns. Political unrest worsens supply chain 
problems by affecting international commitments and production schedules. Research has demonstrated that labor 
unrest, which frequently results from unfulfilled worker expectations and subpar working conditions, is a recurring 
problem in Bangladesh's apparel industry, making sustainable supply chain management more difficult (Ashraf et al. 
2015).

This section according to Table: 3 and Fig : 4 identifies several crucial sustainability tactics to guarantee resilience 
in the face of future catastrophes. For example, ""Maintaining Buyer Confidence Through Transparency and 
Communication"" had the highest RII (0.706), indicating that maintaining buyer relationships even in times of crisis 
requires transparent communication. With a RII of 0.684, government policies and institutional assistance are 
particularly crucial since they can strengthen supply chain resilience and enable required adjustments (Bala et al., 
2020). Together, these results imply that, in the face of present and upcoming political obstacles, a sustainable RMG 
supply chain depends on enhancing logistical assistance, building government engagement, and fortifying 
communication networks.

Conclusion: 
The study identifies possibilities for resilience and improvement by highlighting the serious weaknesses in 
Bangladesh's RMG supply chain that were made public during the most recent political unrest. Important disruptive 
elements including supplier delays, labor strikes, and transportation disruptions highlight the necessity of an organized 
approach to industry risk management and crisis preparedness. These factors are efficiently prioritized using the 
Relative Importance Index (RII), which offers a clear framework for tackling the most significant issues. Setting 
sustainable practices as a top priority is essential to bolstering the RMG industry against upcoming political upheavals. 
Building resilience and preserving global competitiveness require recommendations like improving infrastructure, 
fostering labor relations, and encouraging a variety of supply sources. Additionally, government policies and 
institutional support for stability and crisis management will be crucial in protecting the sector. The findings serve as 
a roadmap for stakeholders, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures to ensure the sustainability and 
robustness of Bangladesh’s RMG industry in the face of ongoing socio-political challenges.

Abstract 
Efficient resource utilization and waste reduction are vital for enhancing manufacturing profitability. This study 
examines production processes within the pipe manufacturing sector, focusing on identifying and reducing non-value-
added activities, commonly called ""waste,"" which contribute to elevated operational costs. Waste manifests in visible 
forms, such as idle time and excess material usage, and hidden forms, like redundant movements and inefficient setups. 
By applying lean methodologies Value Stream Mapping (VSM), 5S, Single-Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED), and 
Kaizen this study aims to address these inefficiencies, thereby improving productivity and cost-effectiveness. The 
results indicate significant reductions in Production Lead Time (PLT) from 30 to 10 days and Processing Time (PT) 
from 145 to 123 minutes. Lean tools, previously used minimally, were expanded to include 5S, SMED, Stage 
Inspection (SI), and Just-In-Time (JIT), leading to improved efficiency in uncoiling, forming, and inspection stages. 
Additionally, the reorganization of workflows through 5S reduced unnecessary motion and delays. This study 
demonstrates the impact of lean tools in minimizing waste and provides a framework for pipe manufacturers seeking 
to optimize processes, control costs, and strengthen their competitive positioning.

Abstract 
Urban areas face significant parking challenges that contribute to traffic congestion and waste time for drivers. As 
urban areas transform into smart cities, the implementation of an effective smart parking system is essential. This 
research proposes an innovative parking solution designed to enhance the user-friendliness of the parking experience. 
It enhances the process, promotes user interactions, saves time, and significantly reduces traffic congestion. The 
system enables users to locate parking facilities easily and provides real-time information on free spots. The proposed 
system integrates modern technologies, including LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and magnetic sensors (MS), 
to detect available parking spaces through 5G connectivity. Augmented reality (AR) navigation facilitates dynamic 
space allocation according to vehicle types, guiding users easily to their designated spots. The system combines 
automated license plate recognition (ALPR) for faster entry and exit, along with blockchain technology for secure 
payment processing. Users receive real-time parking updates and charging station statuses, and predictive maintenance 
keeps everything running efficiently. The integration of these aspects helps transform urban mobility and increase the 
development of smart cities.

to frustration among drivers who spend excessive time searching for parking spots (Ahmed et al. 2020). This situation 
contributes to increased traffic congestion and air pollution, creating an urgent need for innovative solutions in urban 
environments. The concept of smart cities has emerged as a response to these challenges, integrating technology to 
improve urban living and enhance infrastructure (Ali et al. 2018). 
In a smart city framework, technology plays a crucial role in addressing the problems associated with urbanization. 
Smart parking systems are a vital component of this transformation, aiming to provide efficient parking solutions that 
save time, reduce congestion, and improve the overall driving experience (Alrasheed et al. 2021). These systems utilize 
advanced technologies to streamline the parking process, allowing drivers to locate available spots and optimize their 
travel routes quickly. As cities strive to become smarter and more sustainable, implementing intelligent parking 
solutions becomes increasingly important (Alshahrani et al. 2022). These systems foster environmental sustainability 
by minimizing emissions and promoting the use of electric vehicles through integrated charging solutions (Amato et al. 
2020). Ultimately, they contribute to a more organized urban environment, enhancing the quality of life for residents 
and visitors alike.

The Smart Parking System for CITY 4.0 addresses significant urban parking challenges by integrating advanced 
technology such as vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, augmented reality navigation, and blockchain for secure 
transactions. The proposed system provides real-time information on parking availability and uses magnetic sensors 
and LiDAR for precise monitoring of parking spaces. This precise monitoring helps reduce congestion and improve 
overall operational efficiency. The system enhances sustainability by facilitating electric vehicle (EV) charging and 
monitoring the environmental impact. The dynamic space allocation optimizes parking for different vehicle types, 
improving user convenience. As cities grow, this flexible and scalable system can establish a benchmark for future 
parking solutions. It enhances mobility and reduces environmental impacts. Continuous innovation will allow the 
system to adjust to changes in urban development, providing permanent benefits for both city planners and residents.

Abstract 
This paper proposes a U-Net model leveraging a pre-trained VGG-16 encoder to achieve precise land cover 
segmentation, a critical task for environmental monitoring and urban planning. The model incorporates semantic 
segmentation techniques, a class-weighted cross-entropy loss function, and the Adam optimizer to address class 
imbalance. Pre-processing and data augmentation strategies are employed to enhance the model's adaptability to 
varying environmental conditions. The model was evaluated across six land cover classes urban, agricultural, forest, 
water, rangeland, and barren achieving an overall Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 69.27% and a mean IoU of 
59.23%. Performance metrics further demonstrated high precision (83.14%), recall (74.88%), F1-score (76.78%), and 
accuracy (74.88%), underscoring its effectiveness. While the model successfully mitigates class imbalance, it remains 
computationally intensive and reliant on high-quality data. Despite these challenges, the proposed approach shows 
significant promise for applications in environmental research and sustainable resource management.

1. Introduction
Machine learning is a formidable force in data processing, equipping us with indispensable tools for navigating 
complex information (Naqa et al. 2015). Using machine learning and remote sensing together, like in the Copernicus 
Earth Monitoring Project's Sentinel 2 project, is a big step forward in gathering data from around the world. It gives 
us more accurate information about space and time than ever before. Advancements in image processing, fueled by 
the convergence of big data technologies and machine learning algorithms, underscore the pivotal role of Artificial 
Neural Networks (ANNs) like MLP, CNN, and RNN (Liang et al. 2015). With its ability to introduce intricate model 
structures and adapt to changing data, deep learning enables ordered data representation across multiple generalization 
levels (Schmidhuber et al. 2015) This paper used the VGG-16 model, devised by Simonyan and Zisserman in 2014, 
which stands out with its thirteen convolutional layers, two fully connected layers, and a SoftMax classifier. The 
design incorporates layered convolutional layers with various filter sizes, culminating in a 1000-unit SoftMax output 
layer (Tammina et al. 2019).

VGG16 achieves the maximum performance, with an IoU score of 69.27. This shows that customized techniques 
perform better than conventional models, most likely due to task-specific improvements.

test. DeepLab has the lowest score (0.433), followed by FCN-32s (0.4588) and DeepLabv3, which improves somewhat 
to 0.4679. RestNet-101 does better, with a score of 0.4885. The modified U-Net model based on VGG16 has the 
greatest mIoU score (0.5923) (Li et al. 2019). This proves the usefulness of customized U-Net architecture, which is 
clearly superior to other models. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The paperwork effectively illustrates the performance of a U-Net model with a VGG-16 encoder in land cover 
classification, with an overall IoU score of 69.27% and a mean IoU of 59.23% across six separate land cover classes. 
The model excels at distinguishing urban and agricultural zones, with urban land receiving the highest IoU score of 
69.25% and farmland following closely at 68.85%. Furthermore, water obtained an IoU of 68.77%, demonstrating the 
model's ability to recognize aquatic locations. Barren land achieved a modest IoU of 47.83%, indicating that the model 
can discriminate it but may need more data or modifications to improve accuracy. Precision has a score of 83.14%, 
which indicates how effectively the model predicts positive circumstances while reducing false positives, 
demonstrating that important land types are reliably recognized. Although there is a need for improvement in 
underrepresented classifications such as rangeland, these findings demonstrate the model's resilience and usefulness 
to land cover categorization tasks. This model serves as a solid platform for future environmental monitoring and land 
management applications.

Abstract 
Rapid urbanization and the increasing demand for sustainable food production have created significant challenges for 
Bangladesh, necessitating innovative farming solutions. Vertical farming (VF) offers an environmentally friendly 
alternative, enabling crop production in vertically stacked layers, often indoors and near urban centers, thereby 
reducing transportation costs and resource inputs. However, VF heavily relies on artificial lighting, resulting in high 
energy consumption. Integrating renewable energy sources, such as solar PV and wind power, can significantly 
enhance the energy efficiency of VF, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and lowering energy demands. This paper 
reviews energy-efficient strategies for VF, with a focus on their potential benefits for Bangladeshi farmers. Drawing 
on international best practices, it proposes a framework that includes solar PV, wind power, optimized lighting 
technologies, and resource recycling to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate environmental degradation, 
paving the way for sustainable urban farming in Bangladesh.

1. Introduction
The rapid increase of the urban population in Bangladesh underscored the necessity for sustainable and efficient food 
production systems. Conventional agriculture faces challenges in fulfilling these demands without increasing 
environmental deterioration, such as deforestation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, his context, 
urban farming, especially vertical farming (VF), arises as a viable strategy for food production near urban customers, 
thus diminishing environmental impact. Vertical farming entails the cultivation of crops in vertically arranged layers 
within regulated indoor settings, facilitating year-round production while maximizing resource efficiency. Figure 1 
shows some steps of Vertical Farming processes. Figure 1 shows various steps of vertical farming in a multi-
dimensional way, helping to bring about the best practices in farming. First, it focuses on proximity with local 
consumers. It aims to bring fresh produce to the urban heartlands. Second, creating a local network for agricultural 
knowledge through training and R&D ensures that community involvement and skill-building remain intact. High-
tech indoor vertical farming includes artificial lighting, automation, and robotics in its design for maximizing space 
use efficiency and yield. Other improvements include solar-powered rooftop gardens with integrated rainwater 
catchment systems, further enhancing their sustainability by using renewable energy and conserving water. Mobile

Vertical farming uses automated systems to save labor and time towards completing the farm activities. The use of 
such smart farming technologies, like fuzzy logic controllers, has been employed in maintaining efficient activities or 
processes in LED lighting and irrigation regarding value addition for crops. This will help farmers to expand their 
business (Bernardo et al. 2023). 
 
8.7 Reutilization of Wasted Spaces 
 More or unutilized urban spaces, such as rooftops or abandoned buildings, can be used for food production. The 
creative use of such space also goes toward beautification of the urban landscape with greenery. Productive vertical 
farms may be created on unused urban areas like rooftops, basements, or abandoned lots. Such a practice would lead 
not only to greening up the metropolitan territories but also to Urbans cape embellishment (Bao et al. 2024), (Güney 
2024). 
 
8.8 Job Creation  
Vertical farming creates diverse job opportunities, ranging from farming roles to positions in technology development, 
maintenance, and operations. It fosters entrepreneurship in urban agriculture, empowering jobless individuals and 
upskilling workers in renewable energy systems, automation, and precision farming techniques (Neo et al. 2022), 
(Güney 2024). This project serves as an opportunity for employment, especially for the unemployed, for local 
economic development. Moreover, it offers specialized skill development in the fields of hydroponics and renewable 
energy management. 
 
9. Conclusion  
The integration of VF with renewable energy thus provides a promising route for sustainable food production in the 
urban context of Bangladesh. Solar PV and wind energy can be potential alternatives to grid electricity to support the 
energy-intensive VF systems while reducing carbon emissions. There is ample sunlight, and rooftop farming in urban 
areas is possible; hence, VF is one feasible solution to the growing demand for food from cities, besides land being in 
short supply. VF for Bangladeshi farmers now represents another way of achieving high yields with very limited urban 
space-a fresh produce solution without requiring large areas of land. Policies that support the adoption of renewable 
energy and VF in urban areas are a critical factor in this transition. Various international experiences from which 
Bangladesh can learn how to replicate systems efficient in both energy consumption and environmental viability will 
help achieve a resilient, self-sufficient urban food supply chain.

Abstract 
The aim of this study is to calculate the energy efficiency of an electro-hydraulic power steering system (EHPS), as 
electric power steering (EPS) system also can be an energy savings solution instead of traditional hydraulic power 
steering (HPS) system. EHPS consist of electrical, mechanical steering system and hydraulic system. It is an approach 
to minimize the energy consumption and improve the steering feel of the power steering system of a vehicle. We have 
developed an electro-hydraulic power steering system and designed a fuzzy-pid controller that can follow the 
command motor speed. We have calculated, the available motor shaft power to hydraulic efficiency is 53.03%. The 
mechanical loss includes hydraulics and, rack and pinion loss. This study also focuses on comparison of electro-
hydraulic (EHPS), hydraulic power steering (HPS) and electric power steering (EPS) system.

1. Introduction
In electro-hydraulic power steering (EHPS) systems, the primary energy source is the vehicle's battery, which supplies 
electrical power that is subsequently converted into hydraulic power. Therefore, an analysis of electric power 
consumption and conversion efficiency is essential for designing an energy-efficient power steering system. Electric 
power consumption varies depending on the vehicle's weight. For heavier vehicles, the front axle load is greater than 
that of medium-weight vehicles, resulting in higher electric power consumption. As power consumption increases, the

approximately 53%. The overall electric-to-hydraulic efficiency is 19.72%. A heating issue is observed in the motor 
due to the use of an older hydraulic pump motor set. Replacing it with a new DC motor pump would likely increase 
the conversion efficiency. 
 
5.2 Comparison of HPS, EHPS and EPS 
The same motor can be utilized for the EPS system. In the case of EPS, since there is no hydraulic power, the motor 
shaft power at 45 rpm with 5.23 Nm of torque is 48.06 W, which can be directly used to drive the steering gear. In the 
EHPS system, when torque is applied, the rotary valve opens, and the fluid is divided into two paths. The fluid directed 
to the piston generates the primary hydraulic power required for vehicle steering, while the fluid returned to the 
reservoir causes a circulation loss. In EPS, this circulation power loss is eliminated, as there are no hydraulic 
components involved. The hydraulic circuit in both HPS and EHPS is identical, with the HPS system employing a 
vane pump.

Table 7 presents a comparison of different systems based on several key parameters. The EPS system is particularly 
suitable for electric vehicles, as they are powered by batteries. Vehicles with combustion engines require additional 
batteries to operate the HPS, EHPS, and EPS systems. Currently, the EPS system is used in autonomous vehicles. 
Features such as Honda Sensing, Lane Keeping Assist, Lane Tracing Assist, AcuraWatch, and Comma AI can be 
integrated into vehicles equipped with an EPS system (supported cars). The EHPS system is not suitable for this 
application, as it depends on a mechanical steering torque mechanism with a torsion bar, which only allows fluid flow 
when the driver applies force to the steering wheel. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The fuzzy-PID controller can effectively track the required motor speed, providing the driver with a good steering feel 
while saving energy at high vehicle speeds. However, achieving smooth control of the motor speed further enhances 
the steering feel. Reducing fluctuations in motor speed control can significantly improve steering response. 
Additionally, the use of a high-efficiency motor and pump will increase overall system efficiency. There is a 
circulating flow loss in the system, which can be minimized by stopping the motor when it is not needed. To 
accomplish this, a torque or angle sensor, along with a brushless motor, needs to be integrated. Brushless motors offer 
faster response times, higher efficiency, and lower heat generation compared to brush motors. On the other hand, the 
EPS system is particularly well-suited for electric and autonomous vehicles, as well as for lane-keeping assistance. 
For heavy vehicles, the EHPS system is preferable, as hydraulics provide high power density.

Abstract 
Hemoglobinopathies are a group of inherited blood disorders that create a huge public health burden in 
Bangladesh, affecting populations with differing prevalence rates. This study accordingly utilizes data from the 
National Thalassemia Survey 2024 performed by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics to investigate the prevalence 
of hemoglobinopathies among major divisions, taking a more comprehensive look at urban-rural areas and 
comparing genders.We compare trends across urban and rural areas, as well as between males and females, to 
estimate prevalence using cross-sectional survey data from the regions of Barishal, Chattogram, Dhaka, Khulna, 
Mymensingh, Rajshahi, Rangpur and Sylhet.The findings indicate that the prevalence rates across divisions are 
not constant, and some rural areas exhibit high prevalence rates, thus implying poor access to health care. Such 
differences can only be justified by the presence of socioeconomic factors, which seem to have overburdened 
some rural communities. There were also minor, consistent gender-based differences with clear variations in 
prevalence rates between males and females across divisions.These findings indicate the need for region-specific 
health care interventions with demographic sensitivity. High rural prevalence shows the requirement for the 
improvement of health infrastructure and creation of awareness among people in remote areas, while observed 
gender-based disparities raise the importance of gender-sensitive approaches in managing hemoglobinopathies. It 
therefore extends the current knowledge on the geographical distribution of hemoglobinopathies in Bangladesh 
and directly supports public health programs toward improved diagnostics, optimized resource allocation, and 
increased treatment availability to improve outcomes among the affected populations.

Abstract 
This study focuses on optimizing inbound logistics in the automobile industry by exploring how Flex Sim software 
can enhance productivity in car coating and assembly processes. By evaluating both separate and integrated 
production setups, the study demonstrates significant gains in operational efficiency and productivity. In a setup 
with separate plants, producing 500 automobiles requires 73.38 hours, with an average machine efficiency of 
73.24% and a yield ratio of 98.62%. Conversely, integrating coating and assembly processes in a combined plant 
reduces production time to 35 hours and raises machine efficiency to 85.26%, with a slight reduction in the yield 
ratio to 93.96%. These results suggest that while there is a minor trade-off in yield, integrating processes leads to 
major improvements in time and efficiency.

1. Introduction
Over the past few years, researchers and industry experts worldwide have acknowledged the value of enhancing 
production lines through various simulation software. Among them, FlexSim is a powerful simulation tool. Using 
FlexSim, complex problems of transportation and production lines can be simulated without any difficulty. Velyka 
et al. (2023) analyzed the impact of varying input parameters on the output and the system behavior and found a 
relationship between objects in a two-stage transportation problem that accentuates that input data has a 
considerable influence on both the system and its output. Krynke (2021) proposes a cost-effective strategy for 
early-stage production planning using FlexSim simulations. By focusing on resource allocation and process 
selection, FlexSim allows for more informed decisions before production starts, ultimately reducing total 
production costs. Unlike traditional tools like Excel or MATLAB, FlexSim offers 3D visualization, providing a 
comprehensive view of process flows and identifying inefficiencies. The study shows that preproduction 
simulations help reduce the risk of equipment underutilization and enable cost-saving adjustments. The approach

The data indicates that iteration 29 achieves the highest yield ratio, making it the optimal parameter combination 
based on yield percentage. Additionally, iteration 29 requires only 34.751 hours to produce 500 automobiles, the 
shortest production time observed, establishing it as the most time-efficient configuration. Furthermore, with an 
overall efficiency of 85.26%, iteration 29 also represents the highest operational efficiency. Thus, the parameter 
combination from iteration 29 is identified as the optimized set based on yield ratio, production time, and 
efficiency. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This study shows significant improvements in organizing inbound logistics for the automobile industry. FlexSim 
software helped to make car coating and assembly more efficient. When coating and assembly are done in separate 
plants, producing 500 cars takes 73.38 hours. In a combined plant, this time drops to 35 hours, saving 38.38 hours. 
This substantial time saving shows how combining processes can make work faster. Machine efficiency also 
improves from 73.24% in separate plants to 85.26% in the combined plant. While the quality rate (or yield ratio) 
is a bit lower in the combined setup, going from 98.62% to 93.96%, the trade-off is worth it because of the major 
gains in time and efficiency. These changes make production faster, more competitive, and more cost-effective. 
Also, according to iteration 29, it takes 35 hours to produce 500 automobiles. Thus, the production rate becomes 
500/35= 14.28 ≈ 14 automobiles per hour. On 1 July 2018, Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla company had made 7000 
cars in 7 days. According to it, the production rate was 7000/ (7*24) = 41.67 ≈ 41 automobiles per hour. From this 
data, it can be realized that our optimized production rate is realistic. In future, there is a huge scope to introduce

Abstract 
The need for smart, multipurpose household gadgets is constantly increasing, driven by consumer expectations for 
improved convenience and security. This study introduces Lampon Pro, a revolutionary smart lighting system that 
addresses the limits of traditional bulbs by including a variety of sophisticated capabilities. Lampon Pro combines 
flexible lighting control, remote operation, and an integrated fire alarm system, making it appropriate for a wide range 
of locations, including homes, educational institutions, and industrial sectors. The development process began with a 
detailed market research and assessment of customer demands using the Kano model, which identified important 
desirable features such as flexibility, sustainability, and safety. These insights were subsequently transformed into 
technical specifications using Quality Function Deployment (QFD), ensuring that they met user expectations. The 
system's basic functionality is powered by an Arduino-based control unit, which allows for real-time lighting 
adjustment and fire detection using heat sensors. Stress research and simulations proved the design's structural 
integrity and reliability. A cost analysis, including a Bill of Materials (BOM) and break-even analysis, shows that 
Lampon Pro can offer competitive price while providing more functionality than existing market alternatives. This 
study demonstrates Lampon Pro's potential to reinvent smart lighting solutions by offering varied, energy-efficient, 
and safe lighting options to modern consumers.

Abstract 
This study focuses on optimizing input process parameters for the extrusion of alloyed steel (20MnCr5) using finite 
element simulation via DEFORM-3D software and the Taguchi method. The selection of appropriate process 
parameters is critical to minimize extrusion force, particularly when different material sets are involved. The research 
examines key parameters such as billet material properties, workpiece geometry, die angle, coefficient of friction, 
logarithmic strain, ram speed, and die length. Through DEFORM 3D simulation, the minimum extrusion force is 
predicted, and optimal process parameters are identified using Taguchi analysis. The regression analysis identified 
optimal conditions with a coefficient of friction at 0.08, die angle at 20°, and ram velocity at 1.5 mm/s, resulting in an 
extrusion force of 556291KN. ANOVA results indicate that die angle is the most influential factor, contributing 
43.45% to the variation in extrusion force. Using an L27 (3^3) orthogonal array, the experiments were analyzed via 
MINITAB software. The analysis of extrusion speed's effect on temperature revealed a maximum die temperature of 
600°C and billet temperature of 1030°C at ram speeds between 1-2 mm/s. Additionally, the temperature-stress 
relationship indicated the highest stress value of 1000 MPa at 20°C with 0.7% strain, while the lowest stress of 90 
MPa occurred at 1050°C with 0% strain. The findings demonstrate the significant impact of optimized parameters on 
reducing extrusion force, enhancing process efficiency.

1. Introduction
The extrusion process is one of the industry's most crucial metal-forming process and performs complex assembly 
operations by forcing the product through a die. Alloy steels such as 20MnCr5 are widely used in the automotive and 
heavy machinery sectors and encounter significant problems during extrusion due to their high strength and hardness. 
20MnCr5 is a low alloy hardened steel material with excellent wear resistance and toughness, but this material 
provides higher extrusion strength by preventing deformation during extrusion. Finite Element Analysis (FEA), 
primarily through DEFORM 3D software, provides a powerful platform for simulating complex extrusion processes. 
This method allows for a detailed investigation of flow properties, stress distribution, and strain during solid materials 
such as 20MnCr5 extrusion. Important extrusion parameters affecting strength include dead angle, friction coefficient, 
logarithmic strain, and perforation speed (Valberg, 2010). To improve this disadvantage, the Taguchi method, a 
valuable tool for experimental design, was used. The Taguchi method helps to determine the best parameters that 
minimize the extrusion force using a small number of tests. DEFORM 3D's FEA, combined with post-processing

5. Conclusion  
This study effectively utilized finite element analysis (FEA) via DEFORM 3D software, combined with statistical 
tools like Taguchi and ANOVA from MINITAB, to optimize the extrusion process parameters for 20MnCr5 alloy 
steel. The simulations offered valuable insights into material flow, stress distribution, and thermal behavior during 
extrusion, revealing how parameters such as die geometry, ram speed, and friction coefficient impact extrusion 
performance. Optimal conditions were identified, including a friction coefficient of 0.08, a die angle of 20°, and a ram 
speed of 1.5 mm/s, resulting in a minimized extrusion force of 556,291 KN. Analysis of the extrusion speed effect 
highlighted maximum temperatures of 600°C for the die and 1030°C for the billet at ram speeds of 1-2 mm/s. The 
temperature-stress relationship analysis indicated peak stress at 1000 MPa at 20°C and minimal stress at 90 MPa at 
1050°C. The integration of DEFORM 3D with MINITAB proved to be an efficient approach for optimizing process 
parameters, enhancing the quality and efficiency of extruded products. Future research could explore varying die 
geometries and temperature settings to further reduce extrusion forces. To further enhance the extrusion process, 
future research should explore varying die geometries, advanced cooling strategies, and the effects of different material 
compositions. Incorporating real-time temperature and stress monitoring in experiments could also help in refining 
simulation models and improving predictive accuracy.

Abstract 
In today's dynamic industrial landscape, the demand for efficient, flexible, and safe material handling solutions is 
paramount. Traditional conveyor systems, while effective, often face limitations in adaptability and cleanliness, 
particularly in environments requiring strict hygiene standards or the handling of delicate goods. This study introduces 
a novel contactless conveyor system that uses a special aerodynamic traction mechanism to move flat materials—such 
as boxes, papers, and food items—without coming into interaction with one another. To facilitate fluid and contact-
free posture, the technology makes use of a pneumatic cushion and regulated aeration. To guarantee correct 
representation, a thorough model of the system is created and parameters are identified. This research lays the 
groundwork for future exploration, positioning the contactless air conveyor as a transformative solution in modern 
material transport, with a rise time of 1.91 seconds for lighter objects and 3.46 seconds for heavier objects.

1. Introduction
The non-contact air conveyor uses the force of regulated air flow to move materials and products in a gentle and 
effective manner. This technology reduces friction and permits contactless object transfer by suspending loads on an 
air cushion. Comparing this novel technology to conventional belt-driven conveyors, the former offers improved 
safety, adaptability, and energy economy. In contrast to conventional conveyors that depend on mechanical touch, the 
NCACS levitates flat planar objects along the intended path by means of a network of finely regulated air streams. 
Reduced maintenance expenses and an extended operating lifespan result from this frictionless transport mechanism's 
reduction of wear and tear on the conveyor system and the transported goods. The NCACS is distinguished by its 
capacity to move cargo at fast speeds without sacrificing security. The system may achieve quick acceleration and 
deceleration by utilizing pneumatic technology, which allows for quick throughput and reduces bottlenecks in 
production or distribution processes. A cleaner and more hygienic working environment is promoted by the NCACS's 
non-contact nature, which reduces the buildup of dust, dirt, and other impurities on the conveyor surface. This 
capability is especially helpful in sectors like food processing, pharmaceuticals, and electronics manufacturing that 
have strict cleaning regulations.  
Moreover, dry forces are eliminated. As a result, we are able to increase transportation speed without causing any 
harm to the goods. The Non-Contact Air Conveyor System's (NCACS) modular architecture makes it simple to 
integrate into current industrial or logistics infrastructures and enables smooth scalability and customization to satisfy

Future scopes 
For the future of material handling and maintaining items to move from one location to another, the Non-Contact Air 
Conveyor System (NCACS) has a lot of potential. Future advancements in pneumatic engineering and technology 
could increase the NCACS's load capability. The efficient and reliable transportation of bigger and bulkier things may 
be made possible by research efforts aimed at enhancing airflow dynamics, raising air pressure, and optimizing air 
cushion stability. Developments in energy-efficient compressor technology and optimization methods may help the 
NCACS use less energy while still operating at peak efficiency. Sustainability and cost-effectiveness of the system 
could be further improved by adding regenerative braking devices or incorporating renewable energy sources like 
solar or wind power into the air supply infrastructure. Exciting prospects for increasing automation and optimizing 
material handling procedures arise from the NCACS's integration with robotic systems or autonomous guided vehicles 
(AGVs). The NCACS and collaborative robots with sensors and AI algorithms might work together smoothly to load, 
move, and unload cargo on their own, increasing operational flexibility and efficiency.  
 
The NCACS may optimize airflow patterns, anticipate maintenance requirements based on real-time sensor data, and 
dynamically adjust to changing operating circumstances by utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and 
machine learning techniques. Higher levels of efficiency, dependability, and predictive maintenance capabilities might 
be attained by the NCACS through ongoing learning from operational data and performance feedback. This would 
result in less downtime and better system performance overall. Beyond the typical planar movement, future 
generations of the NCACS might investigate the idea of transporting items in other dimensions. The system might 
enable vertical stacking, tilting, or turning of delivered goods by integrating adjustable air jets and advanced control 
algorithms. This would enable more complex material handling jobs and increase the NCACS's versatility in a variety 
of applications. The Contactless Air Conveyor System (NCACS) may find uses outside of its current range as the 
technology develops and becomes more affordable. When transferring sensitive or valuable goods, components, and 
assemblies, industries like healthcare, automotive, aerospace, and e-commerce could profit from the NCACS's 
cleanliness, accuracy, and efficiency. The agriculture industry can also benefit from contactless air conveyors. The 
NCACS can be used for delicate fruit collection and gentle harvesting. 
 
6. Conclusion  
In summary, the Contactless Air Conveyor System (NCACS) offers a revolutionary approach to the transportation of 
items, with numerous benefits that meet the changing demands and difficulties of contemporary material handling 
procedures. The NCACS transforms efficiency, productivity, and safety in a variety of industrial sectors by enabling 
the frictionless, accurate, and hygienic transportation of commodities and planar objects through the creative 
application of pneumatic technology. The non-contact shipping method used by the NCACS reduces wear and tear 
and enhances product quality by removing the possibility of damage to fragile items. When combined with 
sophisticated sensor technology and exact control algorithms, this frictionless operation guarantees precise alignment 
and positioning of transported objects, enabling high-precision movement with little deviation. Additionally, the 
NCACS has major advantages in terms of cleanliness and hygiene since it reduces physical contact with the conveyor 
surface, which lessens the buildup of dust, debris, and pollutants.  
 
This function is especially helpful in sectors like food processing, pharmaceuticals, and electronics production where 
hygienic conditions are crucial and cleanliness standards are very high. Because of its modular design and configurable 
features, the NCACS provides flexibility, adaptability, and scalability in addition to its operating advantages. Because 
of its adaptability to diverse kinds of goods, transportation needs, and operating environments, it can be seamlessly 
integrated into existing infrastructure and used in a variety of industries. The contactless air conveyor system

(NCACS) offers a wide range of uses that can increase productivity, safety, and efficiency, from manufacturing and 
auto assembly lines to food processing plants and storage activities. The NCACS is able to improve product quality, 
reduce downtime, and streamline material handling procedures. The NCACS is well-positioned to play a key role in 
influencing the direction of goods movement, spurring innovation, and providing real advantages to sectors throughout 
the globe as businesses work to streamline their material handling operations and adjust to shifting market needs.

Abstract 
Automated car washing system is one of the most important applications for automobile engineering. Most of the time 
due to lack of time people cannot manage to wash their car properly. More than that chemical washer is also important 
for a car. And for that reason, we have proposed such a system that will automate car washing system with the help 
of IoT. The system will connect with a IoT module by which it will send HTTP request to the server. After that from 
the server it fetches the system variable into an android application. From that application user can control the overall 
car washing system. The main purpose of this system is to reduce human hand usage for car washing system. By this 
system a user can wash multiple cars at a time. So, the main novelty of work of this car washing system is to reduce 
human presence in car washing process. We shall see the output on android application as a data output. It will save 
both money and time.

5.1 Proposed Improvements  
a) 
In future, we can replace the motor input with solar energy that it can be efficient, low-cost operation.  
b) 
AI (Artificial Intelligent) can be used as grinding operation controller. 
c)

6. Conclusion 
To increase the efficiency of conventional car washing systems, this study developed and designed an automatic 
system. It primarily cleans, soaps, and dries the car completely on its own. A password is required to access the system. 
Therefore, it is simple to stop any unwanted misuse. Due to the system's complete automation, no unusual work is 
needed, saving a significant amount of time and money. In order to store vehicle data in its database, this system will 
have a data log. This will make the washing procedure more precise by managing distinct profiles for various 
automobile kinds. Water can be saved by washing cars with a water recycling system. Additional actions can be taken 
to put this system into place.

study and a competition analysis were carried out to further comprehend the industry and its difficulties. Finally, a SWOT 
analysis was performed to determine our plan's strengths and weaknesses. 
1.1 Problem Statement: 
When someone relocates to a new city, their biggest challenge is figuring out how to stay there. The various issues that 
come with living in different cities cause worry that never goes away. primarily low-wage workers and students, who 
cannot find a suitable home or place because of inadequate information. If they discover numerous issues, such as 
unsanitary rooms, high rent, bad service, and poor environmental conditions, it is really concerning. Even after spending 
enough money, individuals frequently have to live distant from their places of employment and in uninhabitable homes 
or messes because they lack the necessary knowledge.(Koca et al. 2021) In many situations, whether stress-related or 
time-related, all the benefits and drawbacks of the mess or house must be accepted later, whether intentionally or 
unknowingly, and the mess or house is only rented because of inadequate information. Every year, a large number of 
deserving students depart from their families to attend various institutions in various places, raising concerns among 
parents about the whereabouts of their children.(Jung et al., 2021)  At the same time, homeowners or mess also deal with

Abstract 
This research explores the impact of ergonomic factors on productivity in the Bangladeshi garment industry, a vital 
sector for the nation's economy, but characterized by challenging working conditions. The study highlights how 
ergonomic practices aimed at improving worker health, comfort, and efficiency can enhance productivity while 
reducing health issues such as musculoskeletal disorders and fatigue. Despite growing awareness of ergonomics in 
developing countries, the application of these principles in the Bangladeshi garment sector remains limited due to 
constraints in cost-effective worker solutions. The study identifies critical ergonomic factors influencing productivity, 
categorizing them into personal variables, workplace environment, and health issues. The fuzzy analytical network 
process (ANP) is employed to prioritize these factors and pinpoint areas requiring urgent intervention, such as poorly 
maintained equipment. The reliability analysis, with a Cronbach's Alpha value of 0.913, confirms the high reliability 
of the findings. Results from the analytical hierarchy process show that the work environment (0.68 weight) has the 
most significant impact on productivity, followed by individual characteristics (0.24 weight) and health-related issues 
(0.08 weight). Sensitivity analysis reveals that the industrial environment (E3) is the most influential factor, with its 
impact increasing as its dimensions are gradually adjusted. The findings emphasize the importance of ergonomic 
improvements to boost productivity and enhance worker well-being, with broader implications for other sectors.

1. Introduction
Bangladesh's garment industry is the backbone of economic growth, providing employment opportunities to millions 
of people and contributing to the country's export earnings (Dickinson et al.2016), (Monira et al., 2020). Despite its 
economic importance, the sector is often criticized for being difficult to work in, which can hinder productivity and 
employee satisfaction (Van Rensburg, Nkomo, & Mkhize 2020). These conditions may include inadequate machinery,

Figure 3. Graph for sensitivity analysis 
 The ranking of main factors is shown in Table 9 above: ""Industrial environment (E3)"" has the highest weight and 
impact is 0.68, followed by ""occupational diseases (E1)"" and ""personal factors (E2)"". The results show that the 
workplace significantly impacts workers' health more than anything else. Poor construction, poorly designed 
machinery, and inefficient fields reduced Production and increased the risk of musculoskeletal diseases (MSDs) among 
workers  (Govindan, Diabat, & Shankar 2015).  
 
BentProp et al. (Di Valentin, Emrich, Werth, & Loos, 2015) have drawn attention to how economic pressure can affect 
workers' health and lead to increased absenteeism. ""Personal factors (E2)"" comes second with 0.24. Studies on call 
centers, such as that of Vulvic et al. (Bontrup et al., 2019), found a positive relationship between the personal health 
of workers and the incidence of back pain. Many studies have investigated the link between prolonged sitting and 
back pain, emphasizing the role of individual characteristics in ergonomic Production. Most ergonomic issues vary 
from workplace to workplace and according to the nature of the job. Workers in physically demanding industries like 
construction, driving, and manual labor are more prone to experience ergonomic issues.  In addition, workers who 
work in front of computers for long periods often experience musculoskeletal disorders and back, wrist, and neck pain. 
These findings support the idea that occupational diseases contribute to many worker-related illnesses. The ranking 
highlights the need to address these ergonomic issues to increase productivity and improve worker quality. 
 
5. Conclusion  
In conclusion, this research highlights the significant role of ergonomic factors in shaping productivity within 
Bangladesh's garment industry, pinpointing key issues impacting worker health and well-being. Ergonomic 
deficiencies, such as outdated machinery, poorly designed workspaces, and health concerns, contribute to reduced 
productivity and increase the risk of musculoskeletal disorders and respiratory issues. Unlike developed nations, where 
ergonomic practices are prioritized, Bangladesh's garment industry has yet to fully address these challenges due to a 
reliance on inexpensive labor and limited awareness. Through the application of the Analytical Network Process 
(ANP), the study reveals that the work environment has the most substantial influence on productivity (0.68), followed 
by individual characteristics (0.24) and health issues (0.08). The findings stress the need for management to enhance 
the work environment and allow sufficient rest periods for workers. These improvements are not only critical for the 
garment sector but also beneficial for other small and medium-sized enterprises. Future research should integrate 
DEMATEL and ISM methodologies to explore the interrelationships between ergonomic factors, while also 
examining the psychological and cognitive aspects that can drive technological updates in workplace design.

Abstract 
The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) has heralded a new era in human-computer interaction (HCI), particularly 
through the development of intelligent assistants and conversational agents. These technologies have fundamentally 
transformed the manner in which users engage with devices, facilitating more intuitive and efficient communication 
methods. Among the preeminent platforms in this field are Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri, each of 
which employs advanced AI techniques such as natural language processing and machine learning to provide seamless 
user experiences. For instance, Amazon Alexa excels in smart home integration, enabling users to control an array of 
devices using simple voice commands. Google Assistant distinguishes itself through its contextual awareness and 
integration with Google's extensive data ecosystem, thereby allowing for more natural conversations. Meanwhile, 
Apple Siri, recognized for its deep integration within Apple's ecosystem, offers a user-friendly experience across 
multiple devices, thus enhancing productivity. As the prevalence of these smart assistants continues to rise, their impact 
on HCI is significant. They not only simplify routine tasks but also cultivate a more conversational relationship 
between humans and machines, rendering technology more accessible. Additionally, the capability of these assistants 
to learn from and adapt to individual user preferences introduces a level of personalization previously unseen in HCI. 
This paper aims to examine the technological advancements underpinning these platforms, their implications for user 
engagement, and the ethical considerations associated with their usage. Ultimately, it seeks to underscore the 
transformative potential of AI in shaping the future of human-computer interaction.

Abstract 
This study investigates the pivotal function of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in bolstering supply chain resilience by 
forecasting and addressing disruptions via predictive analytics, real-time monitoring, and data-informed decision-
making. In the current dynamic and integrated global economy, supply chain resilience is essential, as disruptions 
present considerable hazards to operational stability. The study begins with predictive analytics to determine existing 
risks and model possible disruptions. Artificial intelligence methodologies, including machine learning and 
reinforcement learning, are used to predict demand variations and improve decision-making procedures. A discrete 
event simulation model, created with Python, precisely represents the supply chain's performance without impacting 
real-time operations. The simulation model is evaluated and executed across 40 replications to guarantee reliability. 
Four AI-augmented resilience strategies are evaluated using AnyLogic simulation software, revealing that the optimal

Abstract 
Bangladesh's ready-made garment (RMG) sector has substantial challenges in the areas of efficiency, traceability, and 
transparency across its intricate logistics and supply chain operations. This study investigates the use of blockchain 
technology, in order to address these issues, particularly the Hyperledger Fabric framework, which provides a 
transparent, tamper-proof, and decentralized platform for monitoring the flow of products from manufacturing to 
distribution. This work demonstrates the advantages of blockchain over traditional systems through a performance 
analysis based on metrics such as latency, throughput, and security vulnerabilities. These benefits include enhanced 
data integrity, process optimization through smart contracts, and stakeholder trust. A more resilient and scalable RMG 
supply chain can result from the incorporation of blockchain and its capacity to accelerate transportation, minimization 
of fraud, and drastically reduce third-party audit expenditures. By developing a model for implementing blockchain 
technology into logistics and supply chains, particularly in emerging markets like Bangladesh, this study broadens our 
comprehension of the non-financial aftereffects of the technology known as blockchain.

1. Introduction
Blockchain technology has been a game-changer in addressing several logistics inefficiencies, especially in 
Bangladesh’s Ready-Made Garments (RMG) industry, which is distinguished by complex and frequently opaque 
supply network. By giving users access to a shared and immutable record of every transaction, blockchain serves as a 
decentralized ledger that guarantees security, transparency, and traceability. From raw materials to ultimate delivery, 
blockchain technology can assist merchants, transportation businesses, and manufacturers in tracking products over 
their whole lifecycle. This capability could address enduring issues in the logistics sector, including fraud, delays, and 
the exorbitant expenses linked to intermediaries (Queiroz and Fosso Wamba 2019; Wang et al. 2018). Consensus 
techniques including Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are used by the system to validate transactions 
and ensure uniformity among all involved nodes. These mechanisms guarantee that transactions are confirmed by 
multiple participants, thereby preventing fraud and mitigating the risk of double-spending.

Furthermore, inventory management and transaction processing are done automatically through the implementation 
of smart contracts, which minimizes manual error and delays. This use of smart contracts aligned with studies by 
Sangeerth and Lakshmy (2021), which demonstrate the way automated contracts in logistics preserve costs by 
eliminating the need for middlemen and streamlining procedures (Sangeerth and Lakshmy, 2021). 
In conclusion, this validation, that is backed up by different literature confirms that Hyperledger Fabric is a rational 
option for Bangladesh's RMG supply chain. Blockchain technology improves traceability, operational efficiency, and 
security. Pilot testing in an actual RMG supply chain setting might be used for further validation in order to evaluate 
performance in an operating setting. 
5. Conclusion
The implementation of blockchain technology in Bangladesh’s RMG sector represents a critical advancement toward 
addressing key supply chain inefficiencies such as transparency, accountability, and fraud prevention. This study 
underscores the effectiveness of Hyperledger Fabric as a permissioned blockchain solution tailored to meet the specific 
needs of the RMG supply chain, allowing for secure, immutable record-keeping and real-time visibility across 
stakeholders. Such implementation of the proposed prototype promises transparency in raw material sourcing as it can 
be used to document, enable the manufacturer to get opinions from suppliers as well as select from their proposed 
deals. By enhancing data accuracy, reducing reliance on intermediaries, and automating compliance through smart 
contracts, blockchain presents a robust alternative to traditional systems, paving the way for enhanced stakeholder 
trust and reduced operational delays. As for the proposed smart contracts, their implementation will make 
documentation and compliance safer and more efficient. The comparative analysis reveals that blockchain’s 
distributed architecture minimizes risks related to single points of failure and upholds a streamlined, resilient supply 
chain that aligns with international compliance standards. Despite challenges such as initial implementation costs and 
technological integration, the study highlights blockchain’s transformative potential in modernizing the RMG 
industry, ensuring both sustainable growth and competitiveness on a global scale. Future research should explore the 
integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain to provide predictive insights 
and further enhance the responsiveness of the RMG supply chain. Although the proposed model has the potential to 
improve the accuracy of real-time tracking and inventory control, the lack of an implementation environment caused 
a partial part of the objective of real-time tracking and inventory control to be accomplished. Although after the full 
buildup of the prototype we can easily integrate it in RMG industries to check its accuracy regarding real-time tracking.

Abstract 
This paper represents the design of an on-body patch antenna for biotelemetry made of multi-wall carbon nanotubes. 
The primary goal of this research is to use a new antenna and monitor changes in the S1,1 parameter to diagnose lung 
tumors. The substrate of the antenna is composed of FR-4, the ground is made of copper and the patch is built of 
MWCNT. The antenna is 1.08 mm thick overall, with the patch being 0.010 mm thick, the substrate being 1.06 mm 
thick, and the ground being 0.010 mm thick. The overall dimension of this antenna is 60 mm by 60 mm by 1.08 mm 
(3888 mm3). The antenna's performance was evaluated utilizing the lung tumor phantom model's two sizes and 
placements. The suggested antenna's resonance frequency was determined to be 7.529 GHz. Furthermore, in 
unoccupied space, we observed a VSWR of 1.2 and -20.75 dB S1,1. S₁₁ is -23.42 dB at 7.452 GHz in the normal lung 
and -20.77 dB in the tumor-affected lung. This antenna operates at frequencies ranging from 3 to 10 GHz. The 
proposed antenna has a SAR of 1.425 W/kg in 10 g of tissue.

1. Introduction
A lung tumor occurs when cells in the lung or airways divide at an abnormal rate or die in an unusual manner. Actually, 
""tumor"" is simply an abnormal development of tissue that happens when cell division or cell death is abnormally slow 
or excessive. Any tumor that develops in the lung tissue or the airways leading to the lungs is referred to as a lung 
tumor. There are mainly two types: benign and cancerous (Cleveland 2022). 
The most common type of cancer in the world is lung cancer. The four main histological classes of human lung 
malignancies are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, big cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma 
Adenocarcinoma is currently the most prevalent kind of lung cancer, and its incidence is rising (Jackson et al. 2001).

5. Conclusion 
A patch antenna has been made from MWCNTs that can effectively detect lung tumors in different positions. 
Basically, in this research two positions and sizes of the tumor have been analyzed, one is the upper position, and 
another one is the lower position in the lung. Using a phantom model, we found that the developed antenna performs 
better than the reference antenna in a number of respects, including resonant frequency, return loss, and voltage 
standing wave ratio (VSWR). The higher performance of the suggested antenna operates in the Ultra-Wideband 
(UWB) frequency range of 3.1-10.6 GHz. The proposed antenna operates at 7.529 GHz suggesting its potential utility 
for other medical applications. The proposed antenna is intended to be used as an on-body device for the early detection 
of lung tumors after all the studies and comparisons of these parameter values are completed.

Abstract 
Nowadays, sustainability within the chain of supply management has already become an issue of the current world 
economic realities, far more than in the context of Bangladesh's garments industry. This paper develops a holistic 
approach to sustainable supplier selection, with a strong emphasis on a dimension that usually does not get the required 
attention — social responsibility. Intermingling Fuzzy AHP and DEMATEL into a hybrid approach for the same has 
rendered research on the selection of such a supplier, who balances economic performance with environmental and 
social considerations, complicated. The framework is structured; containment of expert judgments and multi-criteria 
decision analysis classify and evaluate suppliers with respect to environmental issues, social responsibility, operational 
factors, compliance, and economic factors. These results will give actionable insights to the practitioners in the 
garments sector to improve sustainable practices. This hybrid approach increases not only the robustness of supplier 
evaluation but also meets the growing demand that is growing globally for ethical supply chain standards.

Abstract 
Industrial process contributions are in the range of larger contributors to climate change at about thirty percent of the 
world's total GHG emission. The discussion is on how AI might help companies reduce their carbon emissions by 
enhancing efficiency from the processes. AI-powered solutions, such as machine learning, computer vision, and 
predictive analytic, allow industries to identify inefficiency leaks, predict equipment failure, and drive data-driven 
decisions for process improvement. The machine learning algorithms analyze consumption trends, and AI-controlled 
systems make adjustments in real time to optimize energy consumption and resultant emissions. For example, in cases 
of low demand, it can reduce energy use or switch over to the use of other forms of energy. Computer vision 
technologies monitor emissions for leak detection or inefficiencies that may lead to high GHG emissions. Working 
against typical manual mechanisms, which usually are not very accurate and lack flexibility, continuous monitoring 
by means of AI offers forecast functions, automated process management, and a whole new approach to emissions 
reduction. Though the challenges abound-high costs and lack of qualified labor-AI does represent one practical path 
toward the goal of optimizing resource use and improving productivity in industrial operations. While there is 
continuous development in this regard, supported by policies, AI might become important in helping industries to 
achieve global climate goals.

Abstract 
This research investigates the optimization of electro-conductive coatings using the cold spray process, employing a 
Taguchi L18 experimental design. The study focuses on the influence of various process parameters on coating 
thickness, including substrate material, powder feeding arrangement, stagnation gas temperature, stagnation gas 
pressure, and standoff distance. Three levels of each parameter were tested: substrate materials (Aluminum alloy, 
Brass, and Ni alloy), powder feeding types (Gravity and Argon feeders), stagnation pressures (98, 104, and 108 psi), 
stagnation temperatures (360°C, 380°C, and 400°C), and standoff distances (2, 4.5, and 7 mm). The results indicate 
that the optimal coating thickness is achieved with an Argon powder feeder, Aluminum alloy substrate, stagnation 
pressure of 110 psi, stagnation temperature of 400°C, and a standoff distance of 4.5 mm. The typical coating thickness 
for the low-pressure cold spray process was found to be 1.63 mm, within the predicted confidence interval. Statistical 
analysis, including Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Signal-to-Noise (S/N) ratio, was performed to identify the 
significant factors influencing coating thickness. The percentage contribution of each process parameter was 
determined, revealing that the most influential factors, in decreasing order of importance, are standoff distance, 
stagnation gas temperature, substrate material, stagnation gas pressure, and powder feeding arrangement. These 
findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the cold spray process for high-quality electro-conductive coatings.

1. Introduction
Coating refers to a layer of material, either naturally or artificially applied, to the surface of another material. This 
layer serves to enhance the surface properties of the base material, providing essential technical or aesthetic benefits. 
Coatings act as protective barriers, shielding the underlying material from environmental factors, such as corrosion, 
wear, or temperature extremes, thereby extending the life and performance of the component (Sharun et al. 2022), 
(Darband, Aliofkhazraei, Khorsand, Sokhanvar, & Kaboli 2020). The process of applying coatings can be achieved 
through various methods, each with its specific characteristics and applications. In the case of thermal spraying, for 
example, the thermal or mechanical energy of particulate material is used to deposit coatings on a substrate (Fauchais 
& Vardelle 2012). However, these methods often involve high temperatures, which can lead to detrimental effects

critical at the 95% confidence level. This supports the conclusion from the regression analysis that the separation 
distance plays an important role in determining stratification. The Pareto chart also shows that the most important 
factors are correctly identified and that the model captures the critical effects of the process with reasonable accuracy. 
 
5. Conclusion  
This study on optimizing coating thickness parameters in the low-pressure cold spraying (LPCS) process highlights 
the significant potential for achieving superior coating thickness compared to traditional thermal spraying methods. 
The research shows that adjustments in parameters such as powder feeding, carrier gas selection, and standoff distance 
have a substantial effect on coating thickness and overall quality. Confirmation experiments demonstrated that optimal 
settings, including the use of an Argon feeder, aluminum alloy substrate, 110 psi stagnation pressure, 400°C air 
temperature, and a 4.5 mm stand-off distance, resulted in a consistent coating thickness of 1.63 mm, within the 
predicted confidence interval. These results emphasize the importance of carefully selecting process parameters to 
achieve high-quality, durable coatings, especially in industries requiring precise performance. Future research should 
explore further improvements in powder distribution, separation distances, and the integration of advanced process 
control technologies to refine coating consistency and reduce material waste. Additionally, investigations into 
alternative gas feeding strategies and the effects of different substrates could expand the versatility of the Cold Spray 
process. The study also suggests that optimizing stagnation pressure and temperature can enhance particle velocity 
and softening, improving coating uniformity and adhesion. These findings provide valuable insights for enhancing the 
economic feasibility, durability, and overall performance of Cold Spray coatings in industrial applications.

Abstract 
The classification of Brain tumor, Lung, and Colon Cancer plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of diseases such as 
brain tumors, lung cancer, and colon cancer. These images require precise interpretation due to their complex and 
microscopic patterns, which are often difficult to analyze manually. To solve this problem, a hybrid deep learning 
model combining EfficientNetB7 and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) layers is proposed. EfficientNetB7 is used for 
feature extraction as it can capture complex spatial patterns, while BiLSTM layers are used to analyze the feature 
vectors' temporal dependencies. Transfer learning with pre-trained EfficientNetB7 weights speeds up training and 
improves accuracy, while data augmentation enhances the model's generalization ability. The proposed model 
achieves a test accuracy of 98.17%, a mean precision of 98.23%, a mean recall of 98.50%, and a mean F1-score of 
98.36%, demonstrating its reliability and robustness. An analysis of the confusion matrix also shows minimal 
misclassification, confirming the model's potential for real-world applications in medical diagnostics.

1. Introduction
Brain tumors represent a major challenge in neurology and oncology. They are characterized by abnormal cell growth 
in the brain or surrounding tissues. These tumors can be divided into primary brain tumors, which originate in the 
brain, and secondary (metastatic) brain tumors, which result from the spread of cancer from other parts of the body 
(Louis et al. 2016). Brain tumors vary widely in their histological features, growth patterns, and clinical outcomes, 
making them a complex group of diseases to diagnose and treat. They can be benign or malignant, with malignant 
tumors posing a greater threat due to their rapid growth and potential to invade surrounding tissue (Ostrom et al. 2020). 
Primary brain tumors, including gliomas, meningiomas, and pituitary adenomas, are the most common forms. Gliomas 
from glial cells are particularly common and can be further subdivided into astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and 
glioblastomas (Wen and Kesari 2008). Glioblastoma is notorious for its aggressiveness and poor prognosis, with 
survival rates remaining low despite advances in surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (Stupp et al. 
2005). On the other hand, meningiomas, typically benign tumors of the meninges, are often asymptomatic and can be 
effectively operated on if diagnosed early (González-Aguilar et al. 2019).

5.3 Proposed improvements 
Although the proposed hybrid model shows exceptional performance in classifying histopathological images, there 
are several opportunities for further improvement. Incorporating advanced architectures, such as vision transformers, 
could provide richer feature representations and improve spatial understanding, especially for subtle differences in 
dataset patterns. Ensemble learning methods that combine predictions from multiple models could increase robustness 
and reduce variance, leading to even higher accuracy. Expanding the dataset by collaborating with medical institutions 
to include a larger and more diverse range of datasets could improve the generalization of the model and its adaptability 
to real-world scenarios. In addition, the use of automated augmentation strategies such as AutoAugment could 
optimize data diversity and improve the model's ability to learn from limited samples. Finally, optimization of 
hyperparameters, including fine-tuning of learning rates, dropout rates, and LSTM units, could further refine the 
model's performance. These proposed improvements aim to build on the strengths of the current model and ensure its 
reliability in broader clinical applications. 
 
5.4 Validation 
To ensure the reliability and robustness of the proposed model, several validation techniques were used during 
training. Early stopping was implemented to monitor the performance of the model on the validation set and stop 
training as soon as the validation accuracy reached a plateau to prevent overfitting and conserve computational 
resources. In addition, the learning rate was dynamically adjusted when the validation accuracy stagnated to ensure 
stable convergence and allow the model to avoid suboptimal minimum. The validation dataset, comprising 10% of 
the total data, provided an unbiased assessment of the model's performance during training and allowed the 
hyperparameters to be adjusted in real-time. Together, these validation strategies ensured that the model maintained 
consistent performance and generalized well to unseen data, underpinning its suitability for medical image 
classification tasks. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The proposed hybrid model shows exceptional capabilities in classifying histopathologic images of lung and colon 
cancer, achieving a test accuracy of 98.68%, precision of 98.69%, recall of 98.55%, and F1 score of 98.62%. By 
combining EfficientNetB7 for spatial feature extraction and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) layers for sequential 
modeling, the model captures both spatial and temporal patterns and enables accurate and reliable classification. The 
use of transfer learning accelerated training and improved accuracy, while data augmentation improved the robustness 
of the model to fluctuate in the dataset. Validation techniques such as early stopping and reducing the learning rate 
ensured stable and consistent performance and prevented overfitting. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, 
incorporating advanced architectures such as vision transformers, and exploring ensemble learning methods to further 
improve performance and applicability in broader medical diagnosis tasks.

Abstract 
This study presents an advanced approach to financial fraud detection by combining Graph Neural Networks (GNN) 
and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) in a unified framework called GNN-GAN. Traditional machine learning 
methods primarily focus on individual transaction data, often overlooking the underlying network of interconnections 
that reveal fraud patterns. Our approach addresses this limitation by converting transaction data into graph structures, 
where nodes represent transactions and edges indicate relationships between them. This graph-based transformation 
enables the model to capture complex interactions that signal potential fraudulent behavior. The model incorporates 
three key modules: a Neighborhood Noise Purifier, which uses Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to filter irrelevant 
data; a Graph Neural Network (GNN) layer, which enhances relational insights among transaction nodes; and a 
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) component that generates synthetic fraud patterns to train and improve model 
robustness. Testing on financial datasets, such as Kaggle's credit card transaction dataset, demonstrates the model’s 
effectiveness in improving accuracy, recall, and computational efficiency. By leveraging the GNN-GAN model, this 
study achieves higher detection precision, offering a scalable and innovative solution to address evolving financial 
fraud challenges. This research marks a significant step towards more resilient, adaptive fraud detection systems that 
better safeguard financial institutions.

Abstract 
The accurate demand forecasting is fundamental to efficient retail supply chain management, helping businesses 
optimize inventory levels and align operations with consumer needs. This study focuses on forecasting demand for a 
coffee vending machine using Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) models. To enhance 
predictive accuracy, weather variables such as temperature, humidity, etc., are incorporated, recognizing their 
potential influence on coffee consumption patterns. The analysis combines sales data with contextual weather 
information to develop models capable of capturing seasonal and trend variations more effectively. The forecasting 
performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as the 
primary metrics, with the results showing a MAPE of 32.19% and an MAE of 2.59. These findings demonstrate that 
the inclusion of weather data significantly improves the model’s reliability. The findings underscore the value of 
integrating external variables in demand forecasting, offering actionable insights for retailers to refine inventory 
strategies, minimize waste, and respond to dynamic consumer behavior. By highlighting the interplay between 
environmental factors and retail demand, this study contributes to advancing data-driven approaches for robust and 
adaptive forecasting in complex retail environments.

 Abstract 
Bangladesh faces a persistent energy crisis despite its abundant solar irradiation of 4.5 kWh/m² per day. Rural 
electrification efforts have achieved limited success due to high costs and infrastructural constraints. This paper 
proposes a sustainable and cost-effective DC photovoltaic (PV) water pumping system designed to address irrigation 
demands in rural areas. By directly connecting a PV array to a DC water pump, the system avoids the need for an 
inverter, significantly reducing both initial and operational costs. The system incorporates Maximum Power Point 
Tracking (MPPT) to optimize energy utilization, a DC-DC boost converter to enhance current delivery, and a battery 
to ensure reliable operation during inconsistent sunlight conditions. All components are locally sourced, minimizing

optimizes the solar panels' operating point to maximize power output, thereby enhancing system efficiency, especially 
under varying sunlight conditions. The boost converter plays a critical role by stepping up the voltage from the solar 
panel to meet the pump's requirements, ensuring consistent operation even under low solar input. In contrast, the 
directly coupled system depends solely on real-time solar output, which makes it more susceptible to inefficiencies or 
failure during periods of low sunlight. Additionally, the MPPT and battery storage system offers the advantage of 
storing excess energy generated during peak sunlight hours. This stored energy can then be used during periods of low 
sunlight, thus improving the system's reliability and minimizing downtime. In conclusion, the integration of MPPT, a 
boost converter, and battery storage significantly improves energy efficiency and provides a more reliable water 
pumping solution, particularly in regions with unpredictable sunlight. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The performance of solar water pumping systems depends significantly on their design. In this analysis, we compared 
two systems: a directly coupled solar water pumping system with Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) and a 
system that includes both MPPT and battery storage. Both systems were modeled and simulated using 
MATLAB/Simulink. In the directly coupled system, the rotor speed, flow rate, and armature current are directly 
proportional to solar irradiation. As solar irradiation fluctuates, these parameters also change, affecting the 
performance of the Permanent Magnet DC (PMDC) motor. The efficiency of the PMDC motor depends on its rotor 
speed, with peak efficiency achieved at a specific speed determined by its characteristic curves. Moreover, the water 
demand often limits the input power to the rated capacity of the PMDC motor, which may require selecting a motor 
with a higher horsepower (HP) rating. This increase in HP raises both capital costs and the need for a larger water 
storage tank to accommodate the extra power generated, further escalating the system’s costs. In contrast, a solar water 
pumping system equipped with battery storage and a regulating boost converter offers superior efficiency. This system 
allows the motor to operate at a more consistent speed, improving its efficiency and enabling it to function closer to 
its optimal performance point. The battery storage stores excess energy, providing a buffer during cloudy days and 
enhancing the system’s reliability. Consequently, a motor with a lower horsepower rating can be selected, which 
reduces the initial capital investment and allows for a smaller water storage tank, compared to the directly coupled 
system. While integrating battery storage and a boost converter may increase initial capital costs, the enhanced 
efficiency and reliability of the system ultimately outweigh the benefits of the directly coupled approach. Operating 
at a consistent speed led to higher motor efficiency, lower horsepower requirements, and reduced storage tank size, 
making the system more cost-effective and efficient overall. 
Future work will focus on further optimizing the system's design, particularly the integration of IoT-based monitoring 
for real-time performance tracking and predictive maintenance. This will enable better monitoring of system health 
and improve long-term reliability, ensuring that the system remains a viable solution for irrigation and other 
applications in rural areas.

Abstract 
Risk management is crucial for sustainability and competitiveness in Bangladesh's textile industry because of the 
substantial uncertainties that plague its supply chain. This thesis focuses on supply chain risk management in the 
textile sector by putting forth a Neutrosophic Analytic Hierarchy Process (NAHP) model for multi-criteria decision-
making. Through the use of Neutrosophic logic, this model overcomes the shortcomings of conventional AHP and 
Fuzzy TOPSIS in managing subjectivity and ambiguity. The Research and Innovation Centre for Science and 
Engineering (RISE), BUET, provides financing assistance for the project, which uses data from the renowned textile 
industry in Dhaka to identify and rank the five main risk categories: operational, financial, environmental, social, and 
market. The study also assesses appropriate risk management plan durations, suggesting Immediate (within 1 month), 
Short-term (1 to 3 months), Medium-term (3 to 6 months), and Long-term (6 months to 1 year) as options. The results 
show that the best way to manage recognized risks is with a short-term plan. The results of this study offer significant 
perspectives for resilience and long-term risk reduction in Bangladesh's textile industry.

1. Introduction
Numerous supply chain risks threaten Bangladesh's textile industry, a vital pillar of the country's economy, and its 
capacity to remain sustainable and competitive globally. To overcome these obstacles, a strong framework for risk 
assessment that can handle the ambiguities and complexity of decision-making is needed. The use of the Neutrosophic 
Analytic Hierarchy Process (NAHP) for Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) in this industry is investigated in 
this study. Although popular, traditional techniques such fuzzy TOPSIS and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) 
frequently fail to take into consideration the subjectivities and ambiguities that are a part of risk assessment. Using 
neutrosophic sets, NAHP provides a sophisticated method that allows decision-makers to handle uncertainties more 
precisely and flexibly while expressing preferences. 
Using a real-world case study of Bangladesh's textile industry, this study uses NAHP to rank and assess risk factors. 
Operational, financial, environmental, social, and market risk were the five main risk criteria that were evaluated. 
Other risk management strategies and pertinent sub-criteria were also examined. The study emphasizes how well a 
short-term (one to three months) risk management plan may reduce supply chain risks while striking a balance between 
viability and flexibility. This work improves decision-making under uncertainty and offers practical insights to 
manage the dynamic and constantly shifting corporate environment by incorporating neutrosophic logic into the AHP 
framework. By providing workable solutions that complement organizational objectives and international best 
practices, the findings help the textile sector create a more robust and sustainable supply chain.

5.3 Proposed Improvements 
Future studies could broaden the data collection to include additional textile enterprises around Bangladesh in order 
to improve this research and make the results more reliable and representative. Incorporating additional factors, like 
Technology Development, Political Stability, or Regulatory Compliance, would improve the model's thoroughness in 
evaluating supply chain risks unique to the textile industry. Furthermore, investigating different neutrosophic 
aggregation strategies or including additional MCDM approaches, such as TOPSIS or Fuzzy AHP, could improve the 
model's sensitivity and accuracy and offer a more reliable framework for making decisions. 
Creating a digital tool based on the model would increase the research's practical impact by enabling businesses to 
efficiently perform their own risk assessments. Last but not least, a longitudinal study might track changes over time, 
enabling the model to be dynamically adjusted to changing hazards and the best ways to manage them. 
 
6. Conclusion 
To sum up, this study effectively uses the Neutrosophic Analytic Hierarchy Process (NAHP) to assess and choose the 
best supply chain risk management strategy for Bangladesh's textile industry. A short-term risk management plan (1-
3 months) offers the best balance between timeliness, feasibility, and flexibility, making it the best option for 
successfully mitigating supply chain risks, according to our assessment of five major risk criteria: operational, 
financial, environmental, social, and market risks. Validation methods, such as consistency checks, which show the 
model's resilience and dependability, provide more credence to this view. The incorporation of neutrosophic values 
into the AHP framework improves the model's capacity to manage uncertainty and offers a more thorough tool for 
supply chain risk. 
This work could be further done in the future by adding more criteria and carrying out longitudinal studies to track 
the changing effects of particular risk management strategies. All things considered, this study advances the field of 
supply chain management by providing a refined, flexible, and verified model that may direct textile sector decision-
makers toward efficient risk-reduction tactics.

Abstract 
The problems due to the frequent natural calamities like coastal erosion and flooding are becoming irresistible 
due to Bangladesh's insufficient and inadequate embankment structures. To date, the coastal zones of Bangladesh 
are often overpowered by floods, erosion, and intrusion of salinity due to shedding, and poor and outdated designs 
of the laterite embankments. This study examines existing embankment solutions, identifying their deficiencies 
in design, construction, and maintenance, exacerbated by environmental and socio-economic challenges. To 
propose more effective coastal protection measures, this study analyzes the stability and economic viability of 
three different armor units: Traditional cubes, Tetrapods, and Accropodes. Stability analysis is done according to 
hydraulic stability coefficients, which shows the interlocking capability, as well as the effectiveness of Tetrapods 
and Accropodes in comparison with the Traditional cubes. Furthermore, the economic consequences describe in 
detail about the expenditure incurred at every stage of the armor units, which involves material, construction, and 
maintenance cost factors. This study also includes the design enhancement of a better armor unit among those to 
make that eco-friendly. The study strongly suggests that, the introduction of these technologies will not only 
increase the border defenses of Bangladesh’s coastal infrastructure but also help reduce the effect of erosion and 
flooding at the coast. 
Keywords 
Tetrapods, Accropodes, Stability Analysis, Cost Analysis, Design enhancement. 
1. Introduction
Bangladesh having a tidal shoreline of about 5,810 km is one of the worst-affected developing countries most 
susceptible to climate change-induced natural calamities such as sea-level rise, cyclones, and storm surges. The 
many millions of people who live in the coastal zone are confronted with frequent flooding and shoreline erosion 
that produces extensive socio-economic and environmental impacts. The embankment systems we developed to 
safeguard such areas are normally inadequate, compelling breaches and failures from time to time. Bangladesh 
has had an elaborate tradition of systems of coastal defense through the construction of embankments or more 
specifically formation of earthen embankments/polders, which according to Bangladesh’s Coastal Embankment 
Project (CEP) that was laid in the 1960s currently features more than a thousand kilometers of inter-connecting 
structures supposed to preserve agricultural lands and human settlements from the impact of tidal waves and 
salinity. Spanning approximately 6,000 km and covering more than 1.2 million hectares of coastal territory, this 
embankment system are physical defense against floods; to provide more land that can be cultivated and increase 
agriculture potential. Consequently, this aspect requires a particular need for the coastal defense mechanisms to 
be reliable and at a reasonable cost (Uddin et al. 2022). 
The traditional embankment system in Bangladesh often faces several challenges. The vast majority of such 
structures were built several decades ago, utilizing design standards and construction materials that have become 
obsolete in light of today's climate- and hydrology-related stresses. Research shows that these embankments could 
be failed due to the geotechnically unstable materials and indiscriminate construction practices input in place

𝑁𝑁0 = 1.5 for Tetrapods and 𝑁𝑁0 > 0.5 for Accropodes). The curves are drawn for N = 5000 and are given as 
𝐻𝐻𝑠𝑠/Δ𝐷𝐷𝑛𝑛 versus the wave steepness, ξz. 
 
Figure 9. Comparison of Stability 
The following decisions can be made:  
1. Start of damage for rock and Cubes is almost the same. This is partly due to a more stringent definition of ""No 
damage"" for Cubes (𝑁𝑁0 = 0). The damage level 𝑆𝑆𝐷𝐷 = 2 for rock means that a little displacement is allowed 
(according to Hudson's criterion of ""no damage"", however).  
2. The initial stability of Tetrapods is higher than for Rocks and Cubes and there can be found highly improvement 
in the initial stability of Accropode. 
3. The failure of the slope is found to be the highest in the rock and cubes compared to Tetrapods and Accropodes. 
4. At the failure stage, the 𝐻𝐻𝑠𝑠/Δ𝐷𝐷𝑛𝑛 values are closer in Tetrapods and Accropodes than at the first instance of 
damage. 
Hydraulic stability number 1.5 indicates a likelihood of displacement during wave energy events exceeding 1.5 
meters, which is for concrete cubes. This displacement increases both in structural failure risks and maintenance 
demands. And this number is found higher in Tetrapods and Accropodes. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This research work has comprehensively compared and simulated the effectiveness and economic considerations 
of different coastal defense structures- conventional concrete cubes, Tetrapods– in the context of Bangladeshi 
coastal defense. First of all, the key problems of the current embankment systems in Bangladesh are identified. 
Then, the hydraulic stability and performance of Traditional cubes, Tetrapods, and Accropodes under various 
environmental conditions is assessed. Besides this, a comprehensive economic analysis was done to determine 
the cost-effectiveness of each armor unit. Those assessments conclude that among the three armors, Accropodes 
is the most stable and economically beneficial. Enhancing the design such as adding rough surfaces can ensure 
the sustainability of armor units. Apart from improving the efficiency of the measures taken for the coastal 
protection, this approach combined helps to achieve economic viability, an issue of import for such a country as 
for instance Bangladesh with its restricted fund base. Given that Accropodes are relatively new to the coast defense 
system in Bangladesh, the techniques used in constructing these structures are unique hence may need specialists 
with revelation knowledge to apply. So, identifying appropriate methods for incorporating Accropodes within the 
existing structure of the embankment systems is necessary. Future studies should aim at the development of the 
combined design that uses the benefits of current embankment systems integrated with the features of Accropodes. 
The results show that Accropodes represent the best option for improving coastal protection in Bangladesh. 
Nonetheless, issues such as complicated installation and significant initial expenses need to be tackled. Future

Abstract 
The potential revolutionization changes can be seen in the industrial energy system by implementing green hydrogen, 
giving unprecedented efficiency and environmental sustainability with zero carbon footprints. Produced through 
electrolysis which is powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower which have zero 
carbon emits during its production and its use makes it the best replacement for fossil fuels. Its versatility allows it to 
be one of the best replacements of coal and natural gas in energy-intensive industries creating a significant reduction 
in greenhouse gas. Therefore, hydrogen is one of the most efficient and promising forms of renewable energy sources 
when it comes to high-temperature generation supported by optimization systems. With the advancements in AI and 
the subsequent application of algorithms in several aspects of hydrogen production, storage, and manual workload, it 
mean that the cost of production and overall scalability of the hydrogen supply chain is feasible for industrial use. 
While it is creating substantial growth in heat production, the cost of this facility is high, and have to face challenges 
in storage and transportation. Apart from its virtues as a clean fuel, green hydrogen provides stability for energy 
systems coupling extremely well with renewable energy sources thereby providing reliable energy to industries. These 
cost and technical challenges could be overcome to place green hydrogen at the heart of energy security and an 
environmentally friendly energy mix. AI will continue to be a proactive innovation in the enhancement of green 
hydrogen technology in aspects of efficiency, cost reduction, and observance of production and utilization of 
hydrogen.

Abstract 
Effective supplier management is essential in the apparel industry for optimizing supply chain efficiency and ensuring 
profitability. This study applies Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), using MATLAB software, to evaluate yarn 
suppliers' performance by considering a range of input variables—such as raw material costs, transportation expenses, 
engineering support, serviceability, and lead time—as well as output variables, including scrap rate, profit, and 
warranty offerings. By categorizing suppliers into efficient and inefficient frontiers, the DEA model identifies 
benchmarks and highlights best practices from top-performing suppliers on the efficient frontier. These efficient 
suppliers demonstrate optimal resource utilization, superior engineering support and high standards of cost-
effectiveness and product reliability, providing added value in service and warranty commitments. In contrast, 
inefficient Decision-Making Units (DMUs) gain insights into areas for improvement, such as cost control, product 
quality, service enhancement, and warranty responsiveness. This DEA approach enables a detailed efficiency analysis, 
equipping apparel companies with actionable insights for selecting and managing yarn suppliers to build a resilient 
and competitive supply chain. The study underscores DEA’s utility as a strategic decision-making tool, empowering 
companies to drive supply chain effectiveness, achieve cost savings, and remain adaptable to evolving market 
demands.

Abstract 
This research focuses on the phenomenon of Entrepreneurial agility in the emerging gig economy and entrepreneurship 
and how they are important when dealing with forces such as dynamic market environment, shifts in laws, and 
contingencies from competitors. Thus, the problem is like a race challenge that requires the use of technologies as tools 
for constant innovation by entrepreneurs to operate effectively in a dynamic environment.Despite these challenges, the 
study establishes how various agile strategies like iterative procedures, real-time data analysis, and customer-oriented 
formation can be used to promote innovation as used by agile entrepreneurs. I discuss how dynamic pricing solutions 
and diversification of services are revolutionizing the gig economy business model. The research finally discusses the 
future of the gig economy, specifically highlighting how issues of sustainability, the adoption of emerging technologies, 
and decentralization will reshape entrepreneurial practices, hence the need for the concept of entrepreneurial agility, 
which forms the basis of sustainable business success in the evolving gig economy environment.

Abstract 
Bangladesh faces significant energy challenges, including frequent power outages that disrupt the operation of over 1 
million electric three-wheelers (e-rickshaws) dependent on grid electricity. This study explores the integration of a 
400 W monocrystalline solar panel onto the roof of an electric three-wheeler to reduce grid reliance, address 
environmental concerns, and check the effectiveness of solar panel integration. This study provides an optimistic result 
for the system with an average solar energy contribution of 13.5%, extending battery lifespan by maintaining a low 
depth of discharge (DOD), which increases battery life. On average, the system saves 764 Wh of energy daily, 
reducing CO₂ emissions by 0.382 kg/day and mitigating lead pollution through fewer battery replacement cycles. 
These improvements lower operational costs for electric three-wheeler owners, enhance energy efficiency, and 
contribute to a cleaner environment

1. Introduction
Electric three-wheelers, known as e-rickshaws or easy bikes, have become vital to Bangladesh’s transportation sector. 
Over 1 million vehicles are in operation, projected to increase to 2.5 million by 2025. These vehicles provide 
affordable and sustainable mobility solutions for urban and peri-urban areas, supporting millions of livelihoods and 
playing a vital role in the economy. (Sultana et al. 2024; UNESCAP 2024). However, their rapid adoption presents 
significant challenges, mainly due to their dependence on grid electricity and lead-acid batteries. 
The electricity demand for electric three-wheelers is between 5 and 7 kWh per vehicle daily, which stresses 
Bangladesh’s already burdened power grid (Hossain et al. 2024). Frequent load shedding, caused by fuel shortages 
and increased demand, disrupts charging cycles for electric vehicles. As a result, drivers are often forced to discharge 
their batteries beyond safe limits, frequently exceeding a depth of discharge (DOD) of 90%. This practice significantly

harnessing solar energy. If the driver began trips earlier, capturing more solar power during sunlight hours would have 
been possible. However, to avoid introducing bias into the study, we allowed the driver to operate according to his 
usual routine. 
 
There is considerable scope for improvement in maximizing solar energy utilization. Encouraging daytime operation 
during peak sunlight and ensuring the three-wheeler is parked under an open sky when not in use could significantly 
enhance power generation. These adjustments would improve energy efficiency and reduce the return on investment 
(ROI) period, yielding better overall results.Our data monitoring device, Xavier, consistently consumes 30 W of 
power. Incorporating the Amar Source in our next iteration could help optimize the design and reduce auxiliary power 
consumption. This improvement would enhance the system’s overall energy efficiency and allow for better utilization 
of the available power. 
 
Deploying a few additional solar-assisted three-wheelers for testing is essential to understand better the impact of 
shading in different environments. Rural areas with fewer trees and roadside establishments will likely yield higher 
solar power output than urban ones. Conducting such tests in diverse locations will provide valuable insights into 
optimizing solar energy utilization and evaluating performance under varying conditions. This initiative can be carried 
out as part of further research to refine the system design and enhance its effectiveness. 
 
5.4 Validation  
Our prototype achieved an average solar energy contribution of 13.5%. This is lower than the 30% reduction in grid 
dependency reported in similar studies by Siddique et al. (2015). The discrepancy is likely due to urban shading 
effects, as high-rise buildings and narrow roads in city areas can significantly reduce solar panel efficiency, similar to 
Chowdhury et al. (2014). Our return on investment (ROI) calculation of 1.33 years is consistent with studies indicating 
that integrating solar panels into three-wheelers can lead to substantial cost savings over time, supported by 
Chowdhury et al. (2014). 
 
For further validation, it is essential to establish a comparative analysis by equipping three-wheelers without solar 
panels with the same energy monitoring device. This would allow us to accurately measure and compare energy 
consumption, battery performance, and overall efficiency between solar-assisted and conventional three-wheelers 
under identical operating conditions. Additionally, producing more three-wheelers with solar panels and deploying 
them in diverse geographical locations—urban, suburban, and rural—would provide robust data on the impact of 
environmental factors such as shading, road conditions, and solar irradiance. These expanded trials will enable a 
deeper understanding of performance variations, system scalability, and potential improvements.This initiative forms 
the future goal of this research, aiming to refine the design, validate findings comprehensively, and offer actionable 
insights for scaling up solar-assisted three-wheelers as a sustainable transportation solution. 
 
6. Conclusion 
This study demonstrates the potential of integrating solar panels into electric three-wheelers as a sustainable and cost-
effective solution for addressing energy challenges in Bangladesh. The prototype system effectively reduced grid 
dependency by incorporating a 400 W monocrystalline solar panel, achieving an average solar energy contribution of 
13.5%. This integration extended the battery lifespan by maintaining a lower depth of discharge (DOD), reducing 
lead-acid battery waste and environmental pollution. Furthermore, the system contributed to CO₂ emission reductions 
and lowered operational costs, improving the financial viability for three-wheeler operators.Despite the prototype’s 
success, challenges such as urban shading and suboptimal solar energy utilization due to driver habits highlight areas 
for improvement. Proposed solutions include optimizing driving patterns, enhancing parking practices, and deploying 
additional solar-assisted three-wheelers in diverse environments for further validation. Moreover, integrating 
advanced energy monitoring systems and refining system design will help maximize efficiency and scalability. 
 
This research contributes to the growing knowledge of renewable energy integration in urban transportation systems, 
addressing economic and environmental challenges. The findings underscore the feasibility of solar-assisted three-
wheelers as a scalable and sustainable mobility solution in developing countries, supporting global efforts toward 
clean energy adoption and sustainable urban development. Future studies will focus on broader testing, comparative 
analysis with conventional three-wheelers, and policy recommendations to promote the widespread adoption of this 
technology.

Abstract 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical tool for diagnosing and managing cardiovascular diseases due to its 
non-invasive, high-resolution capabilities and its ability to provide detailed insights into cardiac structure and function. 
This review examines recent advancements in MRI-based image classification, emphasizing the integration of 
machine learning techniques such as deep learning and automated segmentation. These innovations have significantly 
improved diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and reproducibility for complex conditions, including pericardial disease, 
ischemic heart disease, aortic disorders, and cardiomyopathies. By enhancing the detection of subtle abnormalities 
and supporting more informed clinical decision-making, machine learning is poised to further transform 
cardiovascular diagnostics. The review also discusses the broader implications of these advancements and explores 
future research directions and clinical applications in cardiac imaging.

1. Introduction
Heart disease remains one of the most prevalent causes of mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for accurate 
diagnostic tools to enable effective treatment. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a key 
modality in this regard, as it provides a non-invasive, high-resolution view of cardiac anatomy and function. Its 
versatility has allowed for refined assessment and classification of various heart conditions, including pericardial 
disease, aortic disease, ischemic heart disease, and cardiomyopathy (Bai et al. 2021).For pericardial disease, MRI can 
identify fluid buildup, such as pericardial effusion, and evaluate its impact on heart function. This capability makes it 
invaluable for assessing diseases that affect the pericardium, the double-walled sac surrounding the heart. In cases of 
aortic disease, MRI can capture structural abnormalities like aortic dissections and aneurysms, offering clear 
visualization that helps determine the need for interventions. In ischemic heart disease, techniques such as late 
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) allow MRI to assess myocardial damage, providing vital information that guides 
treatment. For patients with cardiomyopathy, including dilated and hypertrophic types, MRI offers detailed insights 
into structural and functional abnormalities, enhancing diagnosis and therapeutic planning (Cocchieri et al. 2024). 
Machine learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), has significantly enhanced the diagnostic capabilities 
of MRI in recent years. By applying ML algorithms to cardiac MRI data, deep learning can now automate the detection 
of specific heart conditions, thereby increasing diagnostic precision and efficiency (Zhou et al. 2024). In particular, 
deep learning models, which simulate brain-like neural networks, are highly effective at identifying patterns within 
imaging data, enabling more accurate and rapid disease classification. By combining these models with conventional

Abstract 
This article presents an operational model designed to mitigate the root causes of a low OTIF (On Time In Full) index 
within a fruit distribution company in Lima, Peru. This case study employed a hybrid approach that combines 
Standardized Work and CVRPTW to address these identified root causes. To achieve our objective, Standardized 
Work contributes to eliminating unnecessary time spent on non-value-adding activities, positively impacting the cycle 
time of the production process. On the other hand, the CVRPTW (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time 
Windows) tool optimized routes, thus eliminating delays and inefficiencies in the transportation process. 
Subsequently, to validate the results of the indicators from the Standardized Work tool, a simulation was conducted 
comparing the initial situation and the proposed scenario. As a result of this validation, the components of the OTIF

1. Introduction
Currently, there is a positive trend toward the development of the logistics services market, which faces the complex 
challenge of balancing operational efficiency and quality amid the increasing volume of freight transportation (Garrido 
et al. 2022). The search for solutions to improve transportation efficiency while minimizing environmental impacts 
has become a strategic priority.In the Peruvian context, a distribution company encounters specific challenges related 
to the country’s geography, transportation infrastructure, and the need to ensure efficient product distribution 
(Cusihuaman-Torres et al. 2023). 
The company under study, like many others in the region, faces pressure to enhance its supply chain and minimize 
operational costs. Specifically, this company, dedicated to the wholesale procurement and distribution of fruits, 
struggles with operational inefficiencies that directly affect its OTIF (On Time In Full) index, currently at 70%. 
One of the most critical issues identified in operations management is poor transportation planning, which causes 
delivery delays, resulting in lost sales and customer dissatisfaction. Inefficient fleet management also contributes to 
delays and product quality issues, affecting customer satisfaction. Prolonged order preparation times are another major 
cause, leading to incomplete deliveries that negatively impact customer satisfaction and sales. Moreover, inadequate 
handling of fruits and products that fail to meet technical specifications has a direct effect on product quality.

In Figure 5, the actual optimized route proposed by the tool can be visualized on the map of the Lima province in 
Peru. Thanks to the Microsoft Bing engine, this type of visualization is made possible after running the Solver, based 
on the routing information and constraints entered in the case. 
 
5.4 Validation 
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the improvement proposals through the Standardized Work tool, simulation 
models were designed for both the current and improved processes in order to identify areas for improvement through 
the comparison of both scenarios. 
The simulation was carried out over a 1-day period, with each day consisting of 8 hours of simulation. This means 
that the simulation state will be finite, as the model stops after a predetermined period of time (Kelton, 2014). 
The simulation model was applied with a 95% confidence level. The performance measures of the model focused on 
critical aspects of the process, such as cycle time, average wait time for a box of fruit in the queue, the number of 
boxes processed in a given period, and resource utilization, including labor and equipment. 
To determine the optimal number of replications in the simulation procedure, a sample of 50 replications was selected. 
After calculating a minimum of 50 replications for both scenarios (current and proposed), the following results were 
obtained, as shown in Table 7. Analyzing the results, it can be concluded that for each of the indicators, the proposed 
model showed better results compared to the current model. It is important to note that these results were obtained 
with statistical validity at a 95% confidence level.

From an economic-financial perspective, the implementation of the proposed tools is profitable, supported by positive 
financial indicators. To assess the feasibility of the interventions, costs for the acquisition and installation of machinery 
and equipment (conveyor belts, commercial scales, and packaging machines) were considered, along with labor costs. 
 
The analysis included a financial cash flow over a 3-year horizon, calculating the Net Present Value (NPV) and the 
Internal Rate of Return (IRR). The results show an NPV of 89,238 soles (Peruvian local currency), positive and above 
zero, and an IRR of 92.36%, exceeding the opportunity cost rate, confirming the profitability of the proposal. 
 
The benefits obtained include a 60% reduction in penalty-related losses, thanks to route optimization tools that reduced 
the number of delayed orders. Additionally, the increase in the service level, achieved through standardized work 
tools, resulted in an estimated 37% increase in marginal revenue from sales compared to the initial scenario. These 
results demonstrate that the proposed solution is not only financially viable but also highly beneficial for the company. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study proposes a model to increase the OTIF index in the outbound logistics of a fruit distribution SME through 
the implementation of tools such as standardized work and CVRPTW technology. The research has demonstrated that 
standardizing activities and optimizing routes are effective strategies for improving operational efficiency and 
reducing cycle times. The implementation of standardized work sheets and staff training helped reduce process

variability, achieving greater consistency and quality in daily operations. Furthermore, the use of simulation software 
to validate the proposed improvements, combined with route optimization through CVRPTW, enabled more efficient 
planning and increased compliance with delivery time windows. In summary, the integration of standardized work 
and CVRPTW technology has proven to be an effective solution for improving the OTIF index in a fruit distribution 
SME, contributing to the sustainability and competitiveness of the company in the market. The results of this research 
could serve as a foundation for future implementations and studies in the field of logistics and perishable food supply 
chain management in Peru.

Abstract 
In the fiercely competitive landscape of the manufacturing sector, reducing downtime and enhancing maintenance 
efficiency are essential for sustained operational success. This research presents an IoT-enabled digital twin ecosystem 
designed to improve maintenance scheduling and minimize downtime in complex smart manufacturing environments. 
The proposed model seamlessly integrates IoT sensors, digital twin technology, and predictive analytics, leveraging 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to create virtual replicas of physical assets and workflows. This integration 
facilitates real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance sensors continuously gathering critical data on various 
parameters, such as temperature, vibration, pressure, and energy consumption. This data is processed using both edge 
and cloud computing, and subsequently incorporated into the digital twin model, which reflects the real-time 
operational status and health of the physical assets. The predictive analytics, driven by LSTM models, analyze 
historical data trends to forecast potential failures, allowing for timely maintenance interventions that prevent 
disruptions and extend the lifespan of assets. To ensure the protection of sensitive information and maintain 
operational integrity, robust security measures—including data encryption and anomaly detection—are implemented. 
By automating maintenance schedules, minimizing unexpected downtimes, and enhancing resource efficiency, this 
ecosystem fosters a resilient and highly optimized manufacturing process., and improving resource efficiency, this 
ecosystem delivers a resilient and highly optimized manufacturing process

Abstract 
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose significant challenges to network security, causing disruptions 
and financial losses worldwide. Traditional mitigation techniques often fall short in adapting to the evolving 
complexity of these attacks. This research work introduces a novel approach to improving the detection and 
mitigation of DDoS attacks through the application of advanced machine learning algorithms, especially the 
Local Outlier Factor algorithm. It is designed to enhance the security and resilience of digital environments, 
effectively countering the constantly evolving nature of such attacks. For this it uses a Deep Q-Network. By 
integrating insights from previous studies and employing a rigorous, cutting-edge approach, this research 
prioritizes not only innovative solutions but also their practicality and effectiveness in real-world applications. 
The proposed model will be able to provide accurate detection of DDoS attacks. Given the constantly changing 
landscape of digital threats, these efforts are vital for safeguarding the stability and durability of global network 
infrastructures. This research highlights the potential of machine learning as a transformative tool in fortifying 
cybersecurity defenses against DDoS attacks.

1. Introduction
There has been significant progress in networking in the past decade in the contemporary digital environment. 
As advances occur, the risks to the network also escalate. Currently, the most significant threat to the online 
realm is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack (Rudro et al. 2023). Over the past few years, distributed 
denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks have resulted in substantial financial damage for industries and governments 
worldwide, as evidenced by information security reports (Anstee et al. 2016). These records align with the 
increasing number of objects connected to the Internet, primarily due to the widespread use of computer 
technology everywhere. This is exemplified by the Internet of Things (IoT) framework, which emphasizes the 
idea of interconnecting any object, anywhere, and at any time. A DDoS attack is executed by an attacker who 
utilizes numerous computers to undertake a denial-of-service attack. The distributed denial-of-service attack has 
altered the conventional peer-to-peer attack method, rendering attack behavior unpredictable (Al-Fuqaha et al. 
2015). Furthermore, the attack employs commonly used protocols and services. Distinguishing between attack 
and normal behavior based just on the types of protocols and services is challenging.  
Detecting a distributed denial-of-service attack is a challenging task (Wang et al. 2015). Consequently, 
researchers have been motivated to detect Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in the past. Several detection methods

5. Conclusion 
This research provides a notable improvement in alleviating distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks with 
machine learning techniques. We propose a system that integrates insights from previous research with a rigorous 
methodology, utilizing the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm for the detection of aberrant traffic patterns and 
a Deep Q-Network (DQN) for adaptive filtering and response. Our framework is engineered to attain technical 
innovation while guaranteeing practical adaptability and strong performance in practical applications. The 
increasing nature of DDoS assaults highlights the necessity of breakthroughs in protecting the resilience and 
sustainability of global network infrastructures. This research emphasizes the possibility of integrating anomaly 
detection with reinforcement learning to proactively tackle cybersecurity issues, hence enhancing digital 
security. Future efforts will concentrate on scalability, adaptation to various network architectures, and 
integration with emerging technology to further improve DDoS mitigation tactics.

Abstract 
This study analyzes Bangladesh's electricity growth trends with a focus on renewable energy development over the 
past two decades. Descriptive statistical methods, including linear trends, were employed to assess growth rates, 
percentage contributions, and global rankings of renewable and non-renewable energy capacities. Data from 
International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) (2000–2023) were utilized. Key variables, such as installed 
capacities and energy source contributions, were categorized by type (solar, hydro, wind, bioenergy) and grid status 
(on-grid, off-grid). The results reveal an annual growth rate of 1,012.57 MW for non-renewable energy and 33.73 
MW for renewable energy, highlighting the disparity in development. Renewable energy's share in total capacity 
declined from 5.23% in 2000 to 3.53% in 2023. Solar energy dominates Bangladesh's renewable capacity (76.32%), 
followed by hydropower (22.87%). However, the country ranks 39th globally in total electricity capacity but only 107th 
in renewable capacity, reflecting limited progress in diversifying renewable sources. The findings emphasize the need 
for strategic policy interventions to enhance renewable energy development in Bangladesh.

1. Introduction
Globally, renewable energy is key to reducing carbon emissions, mitigating climate change, and achieving the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 7, which promotes affordable and clean energy (Siraj et al. 
2024). Unlike fossil fuels, renewable sources such as solar, wind, and hydropower produce minimal greenhouse gases, 
making them essential for limiting global warming and its associated impacts. For Bangladesh, the significance of 
renewable energy is even more pronounced due to the country’s vulnerability to climate change and reliance on 
imported fossil fuels (Bari et al. 2022). Expanding renewable energy reduces dependency on energy imports, enhances 
energy security, and contributes to economic growth by creating jobs in emerging green sectors (Debnath et al. 2023). 
Furthermore, utilizing the country’s ample solar and wind resources can address the growing energy demands while 
promoting sustainable development and reducing environmental degradation.However, Bangladesh struggles to 
succeed in renewable energy development due to inadequate infrastructure, limited financing, and policy 
implementation gaps (Siraj et al. 2022). Additionally, reliance on conventional energy sources and slow adaptation of 
advanced technologies hinders the full utilization of its abundant solar and wind resources. 
From 2000 to 2023, Bangladesh’s total installed electricity capacity increased from 4,396 MW to 28,460 MW, 
representing an impressive growth of approximately 550%. However, the picture is less encouraging when examining 
960","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

forming over 82% of the total renewable capacity. Strengthening both on-grid and off-grid systems, alongside 
investments in smart grid technologies, would ensure better integration and management of renewable energy. 
Furthermore, promoting floating solar plants and rooftop systems can help mitigate land constraints while maximizing 
solar energy generation. Access to affordable financing options, such as green loans, will also be vital to support the 
large-scale adoption of renewable technologies. These measures can help reverse the current trend, where the 
renewable share in total installed capacity has declined from 5.23% in 2000 to 3.53% in 2023, despite an increase in 
absolute capacity.  
 
While comprehensive, this study's reliance on secondary data limits its ability to capture specific local conditions or 
the latest technological advancements. Although effective in identifying trends, descriptive statistical methods do not 
support predictive modeling or scenario analysis for future energy development. Incorporating primary data collection 
and advanced forecasting techniques could offer a deeper understanding of Bangladesh's potential growth trajectories 
in renewable energy. Moreover, the study focuses on growth trends and contributions but does not assess socio-
economic or environmental impacts, which are critical for understanding the broader implications of renewable energy 
adoption. Future research could integrate multi-criteria decision-making frameworks to evaluate these impacts and 
guide more comprehensive policy and investment strategies. Addressing these methodological limitations would 
improve the study’s applicability and contribute to more robust decision-making for Bangladesh’s renewable energy 
sector. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The findings of this study address the research gap identified at the outset, which highlights the lack of a 
comprehensive understanding of Bangladesh’s renewable energy growth trends and its global standing in electricity 
capacity. The results reveal that while Bangladesh has made significant strides in increasing its overall electricity 
installed capacity, the progress in renewable energy development remains disproportionately low. The decline in the 
percentage contribution of renewables, from 5.23% in 2000 to 3.53% in 2023, underscores the persistent challenges 
in achieving sustainable energy growth.The study's objectives of examining electricity capacity growth, assessing 
global rankings, and analyzing the composition of renewable energy sources have been systematically addressed. The 
analysis demonstrates that solar energy dominates Bangladesh's renewable portfolio, contributing over three-quarters 
of the total renewable capacity, with negligible bioenergy and wind energy contributions. Furthermore, the country’s 
global ranking in renewable energy capacity (107th) is significantly lower compared to its total electricity capacity 
ranking (39th), indicating a stark disparity in its renewable energy advancement.  
 
These insights align with the study’s aim of highlighting Bangladesh's inadequate focus on renewable energy 
development. The findings emphasize the need for policymakers to prioritize renewable energy expansion to bridge 
the gap between Bangladesh’s overall electricity growth and its renewable energy contributions. Closing this gap is 
essential for achieving the objectives of SDG 7 and promoting long-term energy sustainability.This study lays a 
foundation for future research and policy interventions by highlighting the dominant reliance on solar energy and the 
limited growth of other renewable sources. To achieve a balanced and sustainable energy mix, targeted efforts to 
diversify renewable energy investments and enhance off-grid systems are essential. These strategies will enable 
Bangladesh to improve its global renewable energy standing, mitigate the impacts of climate change, and promote

Abstract 
The rapid growth in plastic consumption, particularly Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), amidst the surge of 
population and urbanization in Bangladesh, underscores the urgent need for effective recycling strategies to combat 
environmental degradation and foster a sustainable future. This qualitative study delves into the current state of PET 
recycling in Bangladesh, unveiling the strides and hurdles within the sector. It reveals that significant advancements, 
such as the shift to mechanical, hot washing processes, have markedly improved PET recycling efficiency and 
economic value. Notably, the textile industry emerges as a key consumer of recycled PET, offering a potential boost 
to recycling demand. However, challenges persist, including consumer unawareness, inadequate infrastructure, and a 
raw material supply gap, with the country facing an annual demand for around 2 lakh tons of plastic scraps against a 
meager supply of 70,000 tons. Major PET-consuming brands like Unilever and Coca-Cola have played pivotal roles 
in enhancing the recycling landscape through integrating recycled PET into their products and fostering consumer 
education and strategic partnerships. Innovations such as chemical recycling technologies and AI-assisted sorting 
present promising prospects for the sector, alongside governmental incentives like a 10% cash rebate for exporting 
recycled products. The study concludes that while Bangladesh has made notable progress in PET recycling, significant 
opportunities for improvement remain. Addressing the identified challenges and leveraging technological 
advancements can amplify the impact of PET recycling on achieving Sustainable Development Goals, promoting a 
circular economy, and ensuring a greener, more sustainable Bangladesh.

unawareness, inadequate infrastructure, and a mismatch between supply and demand of plastic scraps, directly 
speaking to RO2. 
 
In response to RQ2, our exploration into the prospects for PET recycling illuminated a promising yet untapped 
potential within the sector. The advent of innovative technologies such as chemical recycling and the application of 
AI in sorting processes herald a new era for PET recycling, aligning with RO4. Moreover, the study emphasized the 
instrumental role of major PET-consuming corporations in Bangladesh, including Unilever and Coca-Cola, in 
advancing the recycling agenda through their sustainability initiatives, thereby addressing RO3. These corporations 
not only integrate recycled PET into their products but also actively participate in consumer education and form 
strategic partnerships, fostering a more circular economy. 
 
The research further highlighted the significant impact of governmental incentives, such as the 10% cash rebate for 
exporting recycled products, in bolstering the recycling industry—a critical aspect of RO2 and RO4. Consumer 
consciousness and demand for products made from recycled PET were identified as pivotal in driving the recycling 
market forward, affirming the importance of societal engagement in achieving sustainability goals.This qualitative 
article comprehensively addressed the research questions and objectives by presenting a detailed analysis of the current 
state and prospects of PET recycling in Bangladesh. It underscored the importance of technological innovation, 
corporate responsibility, government policy, and consumer awareness in shaping a sustainable recycling ecosystem. 
While challenges remain, the pathways identified for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of PET recycling 
efforts offer a hopeful outlook for not only mitigating environmental impacts but also contributing to the economic 
resilience of Bangladesh. As the country stands at the crossroads of environmental responsibility and economic 
opportunity, this study serves as a foundational piece for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and the academic 
community to build upon for a sustainable future. 
 
This study has limitations, chiefly its reliance on accessible data and possible variations in recycling practices across 
Bangladesh. It also lacks depth from the perspective of informal waste collectors, critical to a full understanding of 
the recycling landscape. Future research should expand data sources, include more detailed analyses of technological 
impacts on recycling, and investigate the socio-economic implications of enhanced recycling methods. Addressing 
these gaps will enrich the dialogue on sustainable PET recycling and contribute to broader sustainability efforts.

Abstract 
An improved method to create an enhanced Bangla standard and local speech. The wav2vec 2.0 model has been 
fine-tuned using additional datasets collected alongside OpenSLR data. Our findings have shown that there are 
gains in transcription accuracy of as much as eleven percent, which is impressive given the low resources and 
languages employed, proving the merits of transfer learning and fine-tuning. The work of the research is aimed at 
expanding the knowledge base concerning the use of novel deep learning algorithms in small languages in the 
field of speech technology. The evaluation metrics included Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate 
(CER), with the fine-tuned model achieving an overall WER of 11.27% and CER of 6.03%. Comparative analysis 
with previous work shows a significant improvement from baseline models, highlighting the efficacy of the 
wav2vec 2.0 model in leveraging large and diverse datasets. The experimental setup was supported by a cluster 
computing environment with NVIDIA CUDA-compatible GPUs, underscoring the computational resources 
required for effective Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model training. The results demonstrate substantial 
advancements in ASR performance for Bengali, with the fine-tuned model outperforming previous benchmarks 
and showcasing the benefits of self-supervised learning approaches.

1. Introduction
With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence, various facets of human life have improved, thus creating a scope 
of further exploration and research. In the field of Speech Recognition, Speech-to-Text (SST) and voice 
recognition is a well-established field of research addressing some important problems in daily life. Therefore, 
Speech-to-text (STT) is an essential domain of research that has huge impact in real life, including an aid to help 
hearing-impaired people follow through conversations, a method of detecting child abuse (Vásquez-Correa and 
Álvarez Muniain 2023), a tool for transcribing speeches into writings, and voice-controlled interfaces. Although 
there has been active development work in STT systems for large languages like English and Mandarin (Zhang, 
Haddow and Sennrich  2022), (Li et al. 2023) a lot of work remains to be done in the case of many Low Resource 
Language (LRL) (Sinha et al. 2024), including Bangla (Akther and Debnath 2022). More than 290 million people

Abstract 
Fake news poses a significant danger to the accuracy and reliability of online content. This research study investigates 
the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, such as Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random 
Forest, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), to verify articles. It examines existing literature to emphasize the 
difficulties in distinguishing genuine from counterfeit digital content. The research aims to provide a complete 
framework for identifying and alerting to fake news and promoting the dissemination of correct and reliable 
information.  Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks 
(ANN) algorithms provide a practical and easily understandable solution for individuals and organizations seeking to 
combat the spread of misinformation online. Among them, the Logistic Regression model outperforms the SVM and 
Random Forest classifiers in identifying fake news. This research contributes to enhancing the quality of online 
material and facilitating comprehension. The discoveries enhance software quality and user satisfaction by actively 
managing significant issues.

1. Introduction
In today's internet-driven society, particularly on social media, it is highlighting its detrimental impact on public 
perception. As technology advances, preventive measures become crucial due to the deliberate dissemination of false 
information by websites aiming to manipulate public trust (Aphiwongsophon and Chongstitvatana 2018). The 
evolution of the term ""fake news"" and its impact on society, along with challenges in detection, are outlined. The 
paragraph emphasizes the diverse purposes of fake news, from defaming individuals to deceiving the public, and 
mentions efforts by platforms like Facebook and Google to combat this issue (Sohan et al. 2024) (Islam et al. 2021) 
(Potthast et al. 2017). It explores the complex motivations behind generating fake news and discusses various research 
methods, including artificial intelligence algorithms, employed for detection. Despite ongoing research, the 
complexity of detecting fake news demands a holistic solution (Stahl 2018). 
The paragraph concludes by introducing the research's objective: presenting a novel method for evaluating news 
reliability using machine learning techniques. The approach involves determining the news's position, evaluating the 
author's reliability, and classifying the news as real or fraudulent (Aphiwongsophon and Chongstitvatana 2018). The 
subsequent sections of the paper are outlined, covering existing literature, the proposed method, experimental results 
analysis, and concluding with potential future directions. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 
delves into the existing literature; Section 3 outlines our innovative method for identifying fake news; Section 4 covers 
the analysis of experimental results and, lastly, in Sections 5, we offer conclusions and outline potential future

5. Conclusion  
This research showcases the effectiveness of the Logistic Regression model in distinguishing between authentic and 
counterfeit news items, emphasizing its higher performance when compared to the SVM and Random Forest 
classifiers. By thoroughly assessing many performance criteria, we have confirmed the dependability and precision of 
the Logistic Regression method, highlighting its capacity as a feasible and easily accessible option for addressing the 
widespread dissemination of misleading information on the internet. In the future, our proposed research aims to 
expand on these fundamental findings and broaden the research area by including advanced approaches and a 
diversified dataset. By combining sophisticated ensemble learning approaches with NLP methodology, we expect 
substantial improvements in the system’s capacity to identify and alert against false information, thereby supporting 
the overall goal of promoting an educated and critical digital society.

Abstract 
Large Language Model (LLM) is one of the most revolutionary advancements of the modern era. Enhancing human-
computer interaction by understanding human language, generating visuals, providing healthcare suggestions and 
many more. This study analyzes the current impact of both online and offline LLM on code creation, education, 
graphics designing, and healthcare. Based on an online survey and data from various sources indicate an increasing 
trend of LLM users, showing the use of LLM to complete tasks, and learn new things, additionally generative LLMs 
are mostly used for creating visuals for graphic designing, on the other hand, the usage of LLMs in healthcare is still 
low as most of the LLMs are not yet properly trained to provide correct diagnostics and treatment, while LLMs show 
significant importance, the number of negative impacts such as ethical concern, reduction of creativity, not properly 
understanding prompts and many more are also noticeable. The study presents a detailed elaboration on the 
effectiveness and the negative effects of the usage of large language models in different fields, while providing an 
idea on if LLM will take over people’s jobs or help to improve in the job fields.

Abstract 
In Bangladesh, there are 55 public universities and 115 private universities. A significant number of students enroll in 
private institutions due to not being selected in the admission exams for public universities. The objective of this study 
is to analyze the perspectives of students from both public and private universities regarding their ambitions, choices, 
and career expectations. A questionnaire was crafted using Google Forms and distributed among 80 students (40 from 
public universities and 40 from private universities). Data was analyzed through Google Spreadsheets, utilizing 
percentage calculations to derive results. The findings indicated that 80% of private university students have a strong 
passion for their chosen fields, compared to 47.5% of public university students. Additionally, 52.5% of public 
university students indicated a desire to graduate, albeit with less enthusiasm. The study also revealed that a majority 
of students from both sectors aspire to pursue further studies abroad, with the intention of returning to their home 
country rather than settling overseas. Ultimately, this paper provides valuable insights into the future plans and 
mindsets of students from both public and private universities.

Abstract 
In recent years, the expansion of e-commerce in Bangladesh has been nothing short of astounding, compelling 
conventional merchants to build online portals in order to preserve their market position. With a rising number of 
mobile users and extensive internet use among Bangladeshis, the online business sector has grown significantly. This 
study applies conjoint analysis to acquire a better knowledge of customer behavior and preferences in the clothing 
category, concentrating on six main aspects of online buying: shopping website, product line, form of payment, 
delivery time, pricing, and promotions. The shopping brand website is the most important of these qualities, according 
to the investigation, followed by the product type attribute. Interestingly, Aarong appears as the shopping brand with 
the greatest utility score, implying that it has a considerable effect on consumers' purchasing decisions. Price comes 
in third place, followed by delivery time and manner of payment. Promotions, on the other hand, have been shown to 
have the least influence on customers' online purchasing behavior. For online companies looking to draw in and keep 
customers, an understanding of consumer preferences and the factors that affect their decision-making is important. 
The study's conclusions provide useful information for companies engaged in Bangladesh's e-commerce sector. Online 
merchants may refine their tactics to increase customer satisfaction and acquire a competitive edge by taking into 
account the importance of shopping brand websites, product categories, pricing, delivery dates, and other factors.

1. Introduction
Bangladesh's economy and people's way of life have undergone substantial changes due to the growth of e-commerce 
and related industries. Advancements in technology and evolving consumer preferences have granted individuals 
access to a diverse array of goods and services, enabling them to conserve time and alleviate the stress associated with 
in-person shopping. E-commerce has emerged as a vital sector, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, where 
it facilitated access to goods and services, leading to positive economic contributions and increased GDP (Hossain, 
2022). The expansion of e-commerce has significantly transformed the landscape of online marketplaces and delivery 
services, creating new employment opportunities and enhancing trade dynamics. As technology evolves, these 
platforms facilitate broader access for entrepreneurs and small enterprises, allowing them to reach a global customer 
base and overcome geographical limitations (Alkhalifah et al. 2022; Pavlishyna & Kot 2020). Moreover, e-commerce

5. Conclusion 
To summarize, the e-commerce business in Bangladesh is seeing fast expansion and increased rivalry, with both 
domestic and foreign enterprises contending for market share. This report has found numerous major characteristics 
that have a considerable influence on consumers' internet purchasing behavior in the nation. It has been discovered 
that product type, time-saving convenience, payment alternatives, and administrative brand variables all play 
important roles in determining consumer preferences. To be successful in the e-commerce market, businesses must 
emphasize maintaining the quality of their online products and services. Furthermore, because many Bangladeshi 
customers are inexperienced with electronic payment systems, providing easier, more convenient, and secure payment 
solutions is critical. Customers that choose cash on delivery over electronic payment have proven to be popular. 
 
Additionally, when it comes to online buying in Bangladesh, elements like product variety, prompt delivery, product 
pricing, and promotional strategy have a big impact on consumers' choices. E-commerce platforms need to concentrate 
on increasing these features in order to draw in and keep clients. To draw customers, especially those who live in rural 
and isolated places, it is essential to invest in infrastructure, brand utility, internet stability, and better transit networks. 
 
5.1 Implications of this study 
The findings of the study could provide insight into the particular characteristics that customers take into account 
when choosing clothes products to purchase on e-commerce platforms. To match their product selections and 
marketing initiatives with customer preferences, e-commerce merchants and marketers may benefit from this data. 
The research may determine the relative weight of several aspects impacting customer decision-making, including 
price, brand, style, quality, delivery alternatives, and more, by employing conjoint analysis. Retailers may use this 
analysis to prioritize their investments and improve their product offers to fulfill customer expectations.

The study's conclusions could aid e-commerce platforms in enhancing customer journeys, website designs, product 
descriptions, and user experiences to better reflect consumer preferences. This may result in greater conversion rates, 
more satisfied consumers, and enhanced competition in the online clothing industry. 
 
5.2 Limitations of this study 
The study's shortcomings include a possible lack of representation of the target community due to the features and 
demographics of the sample used. This might restrict the findings' generalizability. Furthermore, concentrating on a 
single geographic location or cultural context may limit the conclusions' application to other regions or cultures, as 
consumer tastes and behaviors differ between markets and situations. The conjoint analysis in the study may only 
comprise a subset of the characteristics. If crucial factors related to consumer decision-making for clothes purchases 
through e-commerce platforms are removed, the findings may not adequately portray the complexity of customer 
preferences.

Abstract 
This paper introduces a novel formula to enhance the utilization of accumulating a bunch of series expressions 
sequentially whereas in terms of traditional method limitation causes in case of large datasets. The research explores 
advanced techniques that integrate numerical methods with distinctive analysis efficiently. Current methods often fail 
to work for huge expressions summation such as: n + (n-1) + (n-2) + (n-3) + … … … (n-N) where n>=N. The research 
aims to highlight the continuous decreasing values that sum up and furthermore, works for that equation where the 
values contain two constant differences. That problem also can be solved using novel formulas. If we know the values 
of n=given number from user, m=number of expressions, summation of natural numbers till infinity and in other case 
summation of two continuous deviations from second expression to last one. This method paves the way for more 
efficient modeling in fields such as physics, engineering, and data science, where real-time solutions are critical and 
time consuming. Outcome results demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy and computational time 
compared to existing techniques, particularly in mathematical cases.

Abstract 
This study investigates consumer behavior in the local market, focusing on purchasing patterns, 
preferences, and perceptions of staple foods. The research aimed to understand the key factors 
influencing consumer decisions and identify emerging trends in the market. A total of 176 
respondents participated, categorized into two age groups: 93.4% were under 25 years old, and 
6.6% were above 25 years. The gender distribution included 81.6% males and 18.4% females. The 
findings indicate that rice is the predominant staple food, with weekly purchases being the most 
common pattern. Price sensitivity emerged as a significant driver of purchase decisions, with 
66.7% of consumers prioritizing affordability. Interestingly, 60.8% of respondents were willing to 
pay a premium for high-quality staple foods, signaling opportunities for businesses targeting 
premium market segments. Additionally, 45.2% preferred locally sourced products for their 
freshness and affordability. While 55% of respondents were moderately satisfied with the quality 
of local market products, 33.3% expressed interest in purchasing staple foods online, highlighting 
a growing inclination towards digital shopping. The study emphasizes the need for price 
stabilization, quality improvements, and enhanced digital shopping options. Limitations include 
the focus on a specific demographic and the lack of longitudinal data for tracking evolving 
consumer behaviors.

Abstract 
This research evaluates the effectiveness of statistical and machine learning models in understanding the impact of 
traffic-related issues on academic performance. We analyzed a dataset of 80 survey responses exploring relationships 
between traffic frequency, stress levels, transportation costs, and academic outcomes. Our analysis included Ordinary 
Least Squares (OLS) regression, Poisson regression, Bayesian Ridge regression, and machine learning techniques like 
Support Vector Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Data preprocessing involved MinMax 
scaling for numerical features and encoding for categorical variables. We focused on metrics such as missed classes 
and exam-related stress, assessing model performance using R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error 
(MAE). The OLS regression model excelled, achieving an R² of 0.743, MSE of 0.0192, and MAE of 0.1123. Both 
Bayesian Ridge and Poisson regression demonstrated solid performance. This study underscores the critical impact of 
traffic-related factors on academic success and illustrates the varying effectiveness of different predictive models. 
While machine learning models showed potential, they could not perform as well as statistical models due to data 
limitations. Therefore, additional tuning is necessary to optimize their performance.

Abstract 
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and ovarian cysts are increasingly common health issues 
globally, affecting the physical and mental well-being of women. In Bangladesh, the prevalence 
of these conditions seems to be growing, yet there is limited research addressing their impact. 
This study investigates the symptoms, challenges, and experiences of Bangladeshi women with 
PCOS and various ovarian cysts. The research aims to highlight the increasing trends and 
anticipate the broader implications of these conditions. Data was gathered from some affected 
women through a Google Form survey, focusing on symptoms.. Demographic details, marital 
status, family history, and treatment status were also captured. Clinical data is yet to be included 
to ensure more comprehensive results. This study expects to show how PCOS and ovarian cysts 
are increasingly affecting younger women in Bangladesh, disrupting their quality of life and 
causing long-term complications. Incorporating clinical data will strengthen the findings, enabling 
better awareness, diagnosis, and treatment approaches.Although final results are pending, this 
research underscores the urgent need for greater awareness, early intervention, and targeted 
healthcare solutions to address the growing prevalence of PCOS and ovarian cysts in Bangladesh.

Abstract 
In Bangladesh, student performance is shaped by a range of factors, including parental education, 
occupational status, and access to supplementary tutoring. Understanding these influences is 
crucial for crafting effective educational policies. This study examines how parental education, 
professional engagement, and tutoring access impact students’ academic achievement. The 
research aims to provide evidence-based insights to enhance equitable educational opportunities 
and targeted support systems. A comprehensive dataset was analyzed, incorporating responses 
from online surveys and physical data collection in schools across Bangladesh. Key variables like 
parental education, occupational roles, and tutoring involvement were analyzed alongside student 
performance in core subjects like English, math, and science. Descriptive statistical techniques and 
machine learning models were applied to identify trends, correlations, and the magnitude of these 
influences. Rigorous preprocessing, including categorical encoding and numerical standardization, 
ensured the reliability and validity of the data. Preliminary findings indicate that students with 
parents in professional occupations and with higher educational qualifications achieve better 
academic results. Access to tutoring notably improves outcomes, particularly for students from 
less-educated or non-professional family backgrounds, helping to close achievement gaps across 
socioeconomic levels. The findings suggest that integrated educational policies, focusing on 
parental involvement and equitable resource distribution, are essential for a more inclusive 
education system.

Abstract 
The quality of the seams is mostly responsible for the overall performance of the clothing in usage. The purpose of 
this study is to analyze the effects of different kind of sewing threads on seam performance of woven apparel by 
comparing between the types of sewing threads on the basis of seam performance on same woven apparel. For 
conducting the experiment, three popular fabric types- poplin, gabardine and denim fabrics were chosen and three 
versatile sewing threads were considered for stitching these fabrics. It is evident from the test analysis that the different 
types of sewing threads have a major and advantageous effect on the seam efficiency of woven clothing. Overall, it 
was discovered that plain fabric outperformed twill fabric in terms of seam efficiency because of having more 
interlacements which help it to carry the seam more than the twill woven fabric. The twill woven denim and gabardine 
fabrics showed better seam strength than the other fabrics at 100% polyester thread whereas the plain woven poplin 
fabric showed better seam strength at polyester wrapped thread with a polyester filament core. The result of this study 
thus described the compatibility of the chosen fabrics with the specific threads. As these three fabrics are some most 
commonly used fabrics in our daily life apparel applications, the result of this study will help manufacturers to select 
the required thread to stitch the specific fabric as not every fabric has the same compatibility with all of the sewing 
threads, which will be preventing the unwanted seam ruptures.   
1. Introduction:
Seams and stitches are the fundamental components of high-quality garments. The quality of apparel mainly depends

5. Conclusion: 
It is evident from the analysis that the different types of sewing thread have a major and advantageous effect on the 
seam efficiency of woven clothing. The twill woven denim and gabardine fabrics showed better seam performance 
than the other fabrics at 100% polyester thread when it comes to seam strength variation whereas the plain-woven 
poplin fabric showed better seam performance than the other fabrics at polyester wrapped thread with a polyester 
filament core. This result of our study thus described the compatibility of the chosen fabrics with the specific 
threads. Acceptable seam efficiency values are established for the other test fabric (Ghani, 2011) As these three 
fabrics are some mostly commonly used fabrics in our daily life apparel applications, the result of this study will 
help manufacturer to select the required thread to stitch the specific fabric as not every fabric has the same 
compatibility with all of the sewing threads, which will be preventing the unwanted seam ruptures.

Abstract 
This abstract presents a comprehensive strategy for controlling power sharing in parallel inverters within a single-phase 
AC microgrid. The strategy integrates continuous variable incline and discrete droop control with different gains to 
ensure stability. Additionally, proportional-resonant loops are incorporated to suppress harmonic components without 
impacting the dynamics of droop control. The microgrid system is modeled in a two-time-scale form, with droop control 
tracking real frequency variations in the slower time scale and power sharing dynamics, voltage regulation, and harmonic 
compensation operating in the faster one. Despite the presence of mismatches and uncertainties, the tracking error is 
shown to be asymptotically bounded, and the system remains input-to-state stable around the desired operation point. 
The relationship between control gain and power sharing performance index is analyzed throughout the experimental 
work, and a set of optimal gains is determined to ensure the fastest recovery of the power sharing error. It discusses a 
novel approach to flexible power-sharing control for inverter-based microgrid systems with fuzzification. Key features 
of the control strategy include advanced forecasting techniques for predicting generation and load patterns, real-time 
monitoring of system parameters, and the incorporation of a hierarchical control structure. To demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed control approach, simulation studies were conducted on a representative inverter-based 
microgrid model with fuzzy logics demonstrating excellent dynamic performance in providing stable, fast, and accurate 
power sharing control.

1. Introduction
Microgrid systems (MGSs) are currently developing power-sharing control solutions to handle the unsupplied demand 
from a single distributed energy resource (DER). A distribution system that is connected to a load can receive active 
energy from DER, a power source that combines energy sources and storage. Instead of installing costly new DERs, 
numerous DER units situated in nearby subsystems must work together to use excess electricity to meet the requirements. 
DER, the power interface, and the regional power system (regional EPS) make up a subsystem. In this situation, using 
several inverters at once is frequently required to increase system reliability, particularly when loading priority is 
involved. Converted signals must meet the standard's power quality standards, which include maximum total harmonic 
distortion (THD) and voltage and frequency variation (adapter/load network voltage). In addition to national norms, a 
number of suggestions or standards for energy quality criteria have been taken into consideration, including IEEE 1547

5.4 Validation  
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control approach, simulation studies were conducted on a 
representative inverter-based microgrid model with fuzzy logics. Results indicate improved power quality, 
enhanced stability during transient events, and efficient utilization of distributed energy resources. The control 
strategy effectively minimizes grid disturbances while promoting increased integration of renewable energy 
sources. 
 
Conclusion 
This research describes a new control strategy for accurate power sharing and high-power quality in microgrid 
systems using parallel-operated inverters. The comparative simulation results, which comprise conventional 
droop control (CDC), CDC with robustness, and the suggested method, demonstrate the superior performance 
of the proposed method in a variety of ways. These elements include power-sharing and non-sharing modes, 
as well as transient behaviour during connection and disconnection events.

Abstract 
Brain Drain among undergraduate students in Bangladesh has emerged as a phenomenon causing concerns over the 
capacity of the country to keep skilled talent. Identifying the motivations behind students choosing to study abroad 
will provide insights into the problems at hand. The purpose of this research is to understand Bangladeshi students’ 
perceptions of the local education system, educational opportunities abroad, the prospects of employability upon return 
and quality of life abroad. An online structured survey collected over 90 responses of students studying in various 
public and private universities. Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed to show trends that emerged 
concerning students' educational and career choices. The research is expected to pinpoint the main reasons such as 
higher academic quality, more career opportunities and financial gain which make students prefer foreign universities 
even if those universities are ranked lower than their current universities. Bridging the local quality education gaps, 
increasing the research fund and coordinating academic programs with industry needs are the key steps to prevent 
brain drain. The Bangladeshi Government will benefit from having talented graduates working in the country in terms 
of economic growth and sustainability.

Abstract 
Dengue fever is an infectious disease transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes which is emerging in Bangladesh causing very 
frequent attacks with an increasing tendency in the number of cases and fatalities these days. This necessitates 
immediate and effective preventive strategies. This research will unveil the structure and trend of dengue cases as well 
as deaths associated with them in Bangladesh between the years 2021-2024 along with seasonal variations and annual 
variations. Specific month by month analysis may show the periods of high burden and strengthen evidence-based 
recommendations of prevention and control measures. A quantitative analysis was conducted using monthly dengue 
case and fatality data from official government sources for 2021–2024. The study identifies seasonal and annual trends 
to highlight high-risk periods and offers insights into evidence-based public health interventions. 
The report indicates increases in cases and deaths due to dengue, during the peak months of August and September, 
around 77,000 cases and 274 deaths in September 2023, the highest in these periods of study. Where, in January 2021 
it was 32 and zero respectively. Thus, these data indicate that dengue epidemics follow clear seasonal patterns. 
This research highlights the necessity of prevention strategies and interventions at critical periods like in August and 
September. Strengthening disease surveillance vector control programs and advanced arrangements form a basis for 
reducing morbidity and mortality offering critical insight into the management strategies that would be effective and 
sustainable in the control of dengue in Bangladesh.

Abstract 
This study presents a comprehensive study on the development and construction of a low-cost CNC router tailored to 
the context of Bangladesh. It addresses the need for affordable precision manufacturing technologies in the region, 
particularly for small-scale businesses and educational institutions. The study highlights the design, optimization, and 
implementation of a CNC router machine, considering the specific requirements and constraints of the local industry. 
Initially, a CAD model of the CNC routing machine was developed to visually represent the project and set it as the 
target. By the end of the project, a small-scale wooden prototype was successfully created, capable of cutting various 
materials ranging from wood to steel to acrylic, while remaining easily portable. The instruments and electronics used 
in this project were all industrial grade, including a Daedalus 3018 CNC Router Spindle and a 5-axis Mach3 controller 
board, allowing the project to scale up and meet larger industrial needs while maintaining a low budget for easier 
accessibility. This project aims to enhance access to advanced manufacturing technologies, foster innovation, and 
contribute to the socio-economic development of Bangladesh. The findings and insights presented in this thesis offer 
valuable guidance for future endeavors in the field of affordable CNC router development in similar contexts.

Abstract 
The bullwhip effect (BWE) is a challenging phenomenon in supply chains that cause variability to flow from the 
lowest to the highest echelon which lowers efficiency. Irregular order sizes across multiple suppliers can cause 
bullwhip effect in a food supply chain. This study investigates the presence of the BWE and employs a Design of 
Experiment (DOE) approach to mitigate its impact. Focusing on a case study involving key suppliers, the research 
quantifies the main interaction effects of supplier and production variables on BWE. The DOE methodology highlights 
critical factors such as supplier-level adjustments and production configurations, identifying optimal strategies to 
minimize variability. Unlike conventional approaches that heavily rely on forecasting or demand information sharing, 
this study proposes determining the optimal level of order sizes to minimize variability in the supply chain. By 
isolating and testing factor interactions, the research provides a robust framework for addressing variability without 
the complexities of advanced forecasting methods. The minimum value of the bullwhip effect was obtained by 
calculating the main and interaction effects of high and low values of the supply of three major raw materials. Thus, 
this study provides scope for future research upon these findings by integrating forecasting and real-time analytics for 
a more comprehensive solution.

1. Introduction
The food supply chain is a complex and dynamic network that spans the procurement of raw materials to the final 
consumption by consumers. The food industry is vastly dependent on raw materials and any demand variation can 
heavily affect the quality and efficiency of the supply chain (Sunmola et al. 2024). As a result, the food supply chain 
faces numerous challenges such as climatic, biological, environmental, logistics, and infrastructure (Rojas-Reyes et 
al. 2024). Moreover, this industry plays a critical role in the global economic development of a country, involving 
several players in a supply chain like stakeholders, farmers, manufacturers, transporters, retailers, and consumers (Li 
et al. 2014; Turi et al. 2014).  The food supply chain in Bangladesh is characterized by its complexity and reliance on 
multiple intermediaries, from farmers to consumers (Hasan & Habib 2022). In sectors like dairy and rice, the supply 
chain shows increasing demand for quality products and processed goods like yogurt and ghee (Minten et al. 2013).

Abstract 
Use of sustainable hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) has become essential to reduce fuel dependency as fossil fuels 
are limited for us. The mentioned vehicles are new energy vehicles, which are hybrid electric vehicles/plug-in 
electric vehicles (PHEVs), electric batteries (BEVs), and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). The purpose of this paper is 
the development of more efficient hybrid electric vehicles and a definite solution to current mobility 
issues. Identification of environmental, economic, and technological impacts as well as potential for 
sustainability in using hybrid vehicles instead of the traditional fuel-powered vehicles. This is an exploratory 
study of the exploration by dependence on fossil fuels and increase in energy efficiency through hybrid 
technology with their feasibility, market acceptance, and all progress towards global sustainability goals. The 
research conducted a quantitative research method for collecting data based on an online survey of candidates 
across Bangladesh. The survey was conducted online, focusing on diverse demographics to ensure inclusivity 
across age, gender and income levels. The survey contains both closed and open-ended types of questions on 
attitudes, public awareness, and fondness concerning hybrid vehicles. The collected data was analyzed to 
recognize the trends and key factors influencing the adoption of hybrid vehicles in Bangladesh. The study shows 
that around 70%-80% respondents are expected to consider hybrid vehicles as advance in transportation 
alternation. Furthermore 70%-75% may favor them over traditional fuel vehicles.60%-65% people are expected 
to show interest to invest in premium models because of fuel efficiency benefits. The research shows that the 
majority of the respondents have support for hybrid vehicles as a sustainable, practical alternative to traditional 
fuel-powered vehicles. Respondents realize the advantages such as societal impact, fuel efficiency and 
economic savings. As well as promotions, government aid, and raising awareness can speed up the 
adoption of hybrid vehicles.

Abstract 
The pharmaceutical industry is regarded as one of the leading industries in Bangladesh. Further developments and 
sustainability can be offered through the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in this 
industry as vast amounts of data can quickly be processed and analyzed with accuracy by AI which is crucial for drug 
discovery, and quality improvement of medicines within minimal costs. However, successful AI implementation 
requires strategic planning based on various factors. In this study, eight major strategies were proposed to implement 
and integrate AI and machine learning and also assessed based on eight criteria related to artificial intelligence and 
machine learning. Feedbacks were taken from eight industry experts as Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Elements (DHFEs) to 
build the strategy versus criteria matrices. The feedbacks were then aggregated by using a group decision making 
method: Dual Hesitant Fuzzy Heronian Mean (DHFHM). The scores of those aggregated DHFEs belonging to each 
criterion were determined and the scores of all criteria under a strategy were summed up to find the ultimate score of 
that corresponding strategy. The strategies were then ranked based on their scores. Finally, the robustness of the result 
obtained from DHFHM, sensitivity analysis was conducted by changing the values of parameters and it was found 
that similar results with negligible deviation were generated by the operator and through this the proposed model was 
proven to be validated.

1. Introduction
Intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) theory was developed (Atanassov 1986), which is a generalization of Fuzzy set (FS) 
(Zadeh 1965). Besides the membership degree function, the additional parameters to control the non-membership 
degree and hesitant degree are provided by the IFS, compared to the FS. IFS has been made very useful in portraying 
fuzziness in the real world & have successfully applied to pattern recognition (Boran and Akay 2014; Papakostas, 
Hatzimichailidis, and Kaburlasos 2013; Zhang et al. 2013), decision making (He et al. 2014; Tan and Chen 2010; Tao, 
Zhao, and Zhang 2010; G. W. Wei, Wang, and Lin 2011; G. Wei and Zhao 2012) and more. However, both FS and 
IFS face inherent disadvantages when defining the membership degree of an element to a predefined set and to address 
this, some extensions of FS, such as Type-2 FS (Miyamoto 2005) and Fuzzy Multiset have been proposed, but they 
are insufficient in tackling these problems properly. These limitations are addressed by the theory of hesitant fuzzy 
set (HFS) (Torra 2010). The HFS is based on strong ability on the description of the membership degree and for the

Abstract 
Effective inventory management is critical in the pharmaceutical sector, where the availability of essential medications 
directly impacts patient care. This study investigates the integration of demand forecasting techniques and inventory 
optimization to improve supply chain efficiency, focusing on GLYMIN, a vital drug for managing type 2 diabetes. 
Two forecasting methods, Exponential Smoothing and Linear Regression, were evaluated using sales data. The Linear 
regression has fewer errors with 771.04 MAD, 766,666.29 MSE, and 4.32% MAPE. The study incorporates Linear 
Regression forecasts into an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model to determine optimal inventory parameters, such 
as safety stock, reorder levels, and average inventory. Sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulations were 
conducted to assess the impact of lead time and demand variability on inventory costs and stockout probabilities. 
Pharmaceutical companies can achieve more effective, responsive, and sustainable inventory management systems by 
addressing the particular difficulties faced by the industry, such as perishability, regulatory complexity, and demand 
variability. The proposed framework offers a scalable approach for other medications and contexts. However, the 
study is constrained by the size and scope of the dataset, suggesting future work could benefit from larger datasets and 
hybrid forecasting models to capture seasonality and nonlinear trends. 
Keywords 
Pharmaceutical inventory management, demand forecasting, linear regression, exponential smoothing, and economic 
order quantity (EOQ). 
1. Introduction
Inventory management is strategically planning and controlling an organization's stock levels. Effective inventory 
management helps to reduce overall system costs, satisfy customer demands, and improve supply chain efficiency by 
ensuring that the right amount of stock is available at the right time and place(Nallusamy 2021). Effective inventory 
control is crucial in the pharmaceutical sector to guarantee the supply of vital drugs while reducing expenses and 
waste. Achieving these goals depends heavily on accurate demand forecasting, which lowers the risk of stockouts or 
overstocking and allows supply chains to adapt to changing demand. Forecasting techniques like Linear Regression 
(LR) and Exponential Smoothing (ES) are popular because they are easy to use and can accurately represent demand 
patterns (Billah et al., 2005). Integrating demand forecasting with inventory management has significantly improved 
supply chain performance. Research highlights that combining forecasting models with inventory optimization

6. Discussion 
This study examined how well linear regression and exponential smoothing predict demand in the pharmaceutical 
industry, focusing on the diabetes drug GLYMIN. While both approaches produced precise demand forecasts, linear 
regression surpassed the other with lower error metrics, such as MAD, MSE, and MAPE. Because of its accuracy, it 
was able to reflect the upward trend in GLYMIN sales better and comply with inventory management regulations. By 
incorporating linear regression forecasts into an inventory model, the study produced ideal operational parameters like 
EOQ, safety stock, and reorder levels. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated how lead time and demand variability 
significantly affect important inventory parameters, such as safety stock, reorder level, and average inventory. Monte 
Carlo simulation shows variability in inventory metrics, reflecting uncertainty in demand or lead times to aid inventory 
optimization. 
 
7. Conclusion and future scope 
This research underscores the importance of integrating demand forecasting techniques with inventory models in the 
pharmaceutical industry. Linear regression performed better than exponential smoothing among the tested methods, 
which makes it a suitable option for demand prediction in this context. Applying these forecasts to an inventory model 
demonstrated improvements in cost efficiency and supply reliability. There is a lot of potential for optimizing supply 
chain operations, reducing expenses, and enhancing service delivery in the pharmaceutical industry by integrating 
demand forecasting and EOQ for inventory management. Stochastic modeling, AI, real-time data tracking, and 
collaborative forecasting are all important fields where innovation can keep pushing the envelope of what is feasible. 
Pharmaceutical companies can achieve more effective, responsive, and sustainable inventory management systems by 
addressing the particular difficulties faced by the industry, such as perishability, regulatory complexity, and demand 
variability. However, the analysis was based on a limited dataset, which may restrict the breadth and reliability of the 
results across different contexts. The analysis could include a larger dataset to increase forecasting accuracy and offer 
a more in-depth understanding of demand trends. Future research could use a hybrid model and a larger dataset to 
recognize seasonality and nonlinear relationship trends in demand.

Abstract 
Use of mobile learning applications in higher education in Bangladesh is on an upward trend, but knowledge of the 
impact on academic learning and student involvement is until now very limited. Still, the socioeconomic factors, 
device availability and limited internet access may affect the use by students of these technologies.This study aims to 
investigate the effects of mobile learning applications on academic performance as well as the engagement, obstacles, 
and their effects on academic motivation of Bangladeshi university students.Usage patterns, perceived barriers, and 
the effect of mobile learning apps on engagement and motivation as perceived by university students in Dhaka were 
investigated through a survey. Correlations between how often apps were used and academic performance were 
analyzed 
using 
the 
data. 
It appeared that mobile learning applications positively increased student motivation and engagement. Nevertheless, 
expensive data plans, slow internet and unintuitive apps made it less suited for students with very little cash. However, 
there is a potential for the mobile learning applications to improve academic results; but they need to be solution for 
usability and accessibility issues. Recommendations are brought out to improve the effectiveness with regard to the 
students

Abstract 
This study investigates the challenges faced by smallholder farmers in Bangladesh’s agricultural supply chain, 
focusing on middleman dependency, inadequate infrastructure, limited market access, and insufficient storage 
facilities. The research utilizes qualitative methods, combining secondary data from reputable sources and primary 
data from interviews with farmers in the Rajshahi region. Findings reveal that over 85% of smallholders depend 
on intermediaries, transportation costs consume 15-20% of earnings, and inadequate storage leads to 15-20% 
losses for perishable goods.To address these challenges, the study explores the potential of cooperatives, regional 
marketplaces, and mobile market vans to reduce reliance on intermediaries. Technology integration, including 
digital platforms for real-time market data, blockchain for transparency, and IoT for monitoring storage and 
transport, emerges as transformative solutions. These interventions, complemented by investments in rural 
infrastructure and institutional support, can enhance supply chain efficiency, improve farmer incomes, and 
promote sustainable agricultural development. The paper concludes that adaptive strategies and continued 
investment are vital to creating an equitable and efficient agricultural system in Bangladesh.

1. Introduction
Agriculture is a cornerstone of Bangladesh's economy, contributing 12.9% of GDP in 2022 and employing 40% 
of the workforce (World Bank 2023). It is vital for food security and rural livelihoods in a densely populated 
country of 165 million, often affected by natural disasters like floods and cyclones. Despite its importance, the 
sector faces persistent challenges, including supply chain inefficiencies, inadequate infrastructure, and middleman 
dependency, which disproportionately affect smallholder farmers. These issues lead to lower incomes, significant 
post-harvest losses, and limited opportunities for growth. 
1.1. Objectives 
This research aims to explore the challenges faced by smallholder farmers in Bangladesh within agricultural 
supply chains, focusing on the structural, logistical, and economic barriers that limit their income potential. The 
study seeks to analyse how reliance on intermediaries, inadequate infrastructure, and restricted market access

5.Discussion  
Smallholder farmers in Bangladesh face challenges in agricultural supply chains, including limited market access, 
poor infrastructure, and dependency on middlemen. Targeted solutions can address these issues by improving 
market access through cooperatives, regional marketplaces, and mobile market vans, enabling farmers to sell 
directly to buyers and reduce transaction costs.Technology integration can revolutionize supply chains. Digital 
platforms offering real-time market data and price transparency can connect farmers directly with buyers. Mobile 
apps and SMS-based services provide critical market insights, while e-marketplaces like India’s eNAM serve as 
effective models. Advanced technologies such as blockchain ensure transparency and traceability, boosting trust 
in transactions, while IoT devices monitor storage, transportation, and product quality, reducing spoilage and 
improving standards. QR code systems can further enhance consumer confidence by providing product origin 
details. Institutional support for digital adoption, simplified access to government programs, and capacity building 
in digital literacy and cooperative management are essential. By combining these technological and structural 
interventions, Bangladesh can create an efficient agricultural supply chain, empowering smallholders and 
fostering sustainable rural development.

6. Conclusion  
This research highlights key challenges in Bangladesh’s agricultural supply chain for smallholder farmers, 
including middleman dependency, poor transportation, inadequate storage, and limited market information. 
Middlemen reduce farmgate prices by 30-40%, while poor rural infrastructure and storage limitations force 
farmers to sell immediately after harvest, lowering income stability. Solutions include cooperatives, digital 
platforms, and infrastructure investments to improve market access and reduce post-harvest losses. Technologies

Abstract 
Efficient equipment utilization is critical in the competitive plastics industry, where prolonged setup and 
changeover times, particularly in die-changing processes, impede productivity and delay order fulfillment, 
leading to customer dissatisfaction. This study addresses these challenges by implementing Single Minute 
Exchange of Die (SMED), a key Industry 4.0 methodology, to optimize setup processes in pipe extrusion. 
SMED systematically identifies and segregates internal (machine-stopped) and external (machine-running) 
setup activities, aiming to minimize overall setup time. By streamlining workflows and adopting best 
practices, SMED demonstrates substantial benefits in pipe manufacturing, which often requires frequent 
die changes. A case study revealed that the initial die setup process required 50 minutes and six workers. 
Through SMED implementation, this time was reduced to 20 minutes - a 60% improvement. Learning curve 
analysis further validated this reduction, illustrating how consistent practice and process refinement 
achieved the target setup time efficiently. These improvements resulted in a 40% productivity gain and 
annual cost savings of 518,400 taka (4,320 USD). This research highlights the transformative potential of 
Industry 4.0 tools like SMED in optimizing setup times, enhancing productivity, reducing bottlenecks, and 
maximizing equipment utilization, thereby significantly improving operational efficiency and 
competitiveness in the pipe extrusion industry.

7.0. Results and Discussion 
This study investigated the implementation of Single-Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED) in a pipe extrusion facility 
to optimize setup processes. The results demonstrate SMED's effectiveness in reducing setup time, leading to 
significant cost savings and productivity gains. Analysis revealed a 60% reduction in setup time, reducing it from 50 
minutes to 20 minutes, achieved through targeted improvements. These included modifying the die punch for easier 
replacement, introducing a standardized tool arrangement box to streamline tool retrieval, and performing cleaning 
and lubrication concurrently with other external activities.   
 
Figure 4. Time Saved 
These changes resulted in a more efficient setup process, allowing for increased production. The overall cost savings 
from this productivity gain are estimated to be 518,400 taka/year or 4320 USD/year, based on calculated labor cost 
savings. Furthermore, the reduction in setup time translated to a 40% productivity gain, with total downtime 
decreasing from 200 minutes/day to 80 minutes/day. This increase in productive time signifies higher output and 
improved efficiency. 
 
This study overcame resistance to change and initial production disruptions through active employee involvement, 
training, and clear communication of SMED's benefits. The learning curve analysis showed rapid adaptation, with 
setup times improving daily and stabilizing at the target of 20 minutes by day nine. This highlights the role of structured 
implementation and workforce engagement in achieving sustainable process improvements.  
 
Beyond quantitative benefits, SMED implementation also yielded qualitative improvements. Employees reported 
increased engagement and motivation due to their involvement in the process. Standardized procedures reduced stress 
associated with die changes, contributing to a more positive work environment. Additionally, the streamlined setup 
process minimized errors and enhanced consistency in pipe quality. The successful SMED implementation in this pipe 
extrusion facility aligns with previous research highlighting its effectiveness in optimizing setup times and enhancing 
productivity across various manufacturing sectors. The findings demonstrate SMED's potential to significantly 
improve operational efficiency and competitiveness in the pipe extrusion industry. 
 
8.0 Conclusion 
This study successfully implemented SMED in a pipe extrusion facility, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing 
setup time and increasing productivity while fostering a more engaged and empowered workforce. These findings 
have substantial implications for pipe manufacturers, offering a clear pathway towards optimizing production 
processes, reducing costs, and enhancing competitiveness in a dynamic industry. From a managerial perspective, the 
study highlights the importance of employee involvement and structured change management to overcome resistance 
and ensure smooth implementation. Additionally, the improved setup efficiency contributes to environmental 
sustainability by minimizing downtime and resource waste.

However, the study's limitations must be acknowledged. Conducted in a specific facility with existing automation 
systems, the findings may have limited applicability to industries reliant on manual processes. Furthermore, the 
research primarily focused on the quantitative benefits of SMED. Future studies could explore its impact on employee 
morale, teamwork, and the potential for reducing pipe scrap and material waste during changeovers. To achieve further 
optimization, subsequent research should investigate integrating SMED with Industry 4.0 technologies and lean tools 
such as TPM and VSM. Such integrations could enable online setup adjustments, enhance delivery times, improve 
product quality, and support long-term sustainability within organizations.

Abstract 
Reading habits among young people are significant for learning new things and developing knowledge, but they are 
becoming less common. This research study aims to look at why the number is decreasing day by day and how digital 
technologies play a vital role. Surveys were supervised to a diverse sample of young people to gather quantitative data 
based on reading habits and media consumption .By way of surveys, we prevailed that spending more time on social 
media and online games is abating the numbers of reading. For these issues academic pressure and insufficient time 
are also reasons. Declining of reading books can lead to decreasing analytical skills, reducing the ability to understand 
and increasing de-culture. To reduce this issue, it is mandatory to encourage reading in institutions and libraries, using 
digital media for reading and result in appealing reading experiences. By encouraging the habit of reading in young 
people may accomplish the knowledge by reading books. This study indicates multifarious output re-energization is 
needed for reading habits, which includes upgrading reading in institutions and libraries, promoting the internet for 
reading can create interest in reading.By figuring out, we may stimulate and get used to reading and assure that youths 
acquire the transmuting capabilities of reading books.

Abstract 
In Bangladesh, many female students choose medical studies, often influenced by family and societal pressure. This 
study explores how family expectations shape these decisions, often overshadowing personal interests. A large number 
of female students prefer medical fields, driven by cultural norms and the idea of job security. However, these choices 
are not always based on their passions. The research focuses on understanding the role of family influence in pushing 
female students toward medical studies instead of other fields.A survey was conducted among 55 medical students 
across Bangladesh, asking about their initial career preferences, reasons for choosing medical college, and the role of 
family and society in their decisions. Results showed that 47.3% chose medicine as their first choice, while 63.6% 
were influenced by societal or familial expectations.: Many students admitted that family pressure was the main reason 
behind their decision to study medical college. Some students pursued it out of interest, but societal expectations often 
played a big role. 
To help female students make their own career choices, it is important to reduce family and societal pressure. Raising 
awareness about different career options could inspire them to follow their true interests.

1. Introduction
Lung cancer is the foremost cause of death among all cancer types for both genders, making it the second most 
widespread cancer globally. The worldwide toll of cancer-related deaths, estimated at approximately 8.2 million per 
year, underscores its profound impact, with lung cancer responsible for 1.69 million deaths annually (Kumar et al. 
2019). The recognition of the potential for early lung cancer detection to facilitate prompt therapeutic interventions 
has spurred the implementation of screening programs worldwide. Lung cancer manifests in two primary forms: small-
cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Various factors contribute to the onset of lung 
cancer, including smoking, air pollution, and exposure to secondary or passive smoking (Kumar et al. 2019). 
Prolonged smoking habits are identified as the predominant factor, accounting for roughly 85% of lung cancer cases, 
with the remaining 10-15% attributed to other causes (Kumar et al. 2019). 
Image processing techniques play a crucial role in Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems and lung cancer staging. 
The diagnosis of lung cancer can be achieved through biopsy or various imaging modalities such as X-ray, Ultrasound 
(US), Computerized Tomography (CT), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI). Among these, CT and CT/PET are commonly utilized for identifying lung nodules. MRI, the most recent 
diagnostic technology, is increasingly employed for detecting abnormal cell growth. MRI excels in diagnosing soft 
tissues efficiently and demonstrates a stronger correlation between measured tumor size and shape compared to CT 
and X-ray (Judice and Geetha 2018). MRI yields faster results than biopsy procedures (Hirsch et al. 2020). Research 
indicates that MRI can effectively replace CT scans in diagnosing lung malignancies in approximately 90% of cases

True Negatives (TN) represent cases correctly classified as cases correctly classified as their respective classes. 
MobileNet achieved the highest TN count, followed by InceptionV3 and then RestNet50. False Positives (FP) denote 
cases incorrectly classified as lung cancer when they are not. RestNet50 had the highest FP count, suggesting it had 
the highest rate of false alarms among the models. False Negatives (FN) denotes lung cancer cases misclassified as 
non-lung cancer. MobileNet had the lowest FN count, indicating it had the highest sensitivity in identifying lung 
cancer cases. True Positives (TP) represents cases correctly classified as lung cancer (benign and malignant). 
MobileNet had the highest TP count, reflecting its superior ability to detect lung cancer cases. MobileNet 
outperformed RestNet50 and InceptionV3 in all metrics, making it the most suitable model for lung cancer 
classification in this scenario. While RestNet50 and InceptionV3 also performed reasonably well, their performance 
fell slightly behind MobileNet. Further fine-tuning or ensemble techniques could potentially improve the performance 
of all models. 
 
5. Conclusion  
Early detection of lung cancer is vital for improving patient outcomes since it remains a primary global health concern. 
This study compares various deep-learning models for accurate lung cancer detection. Among them, MobileNet's 
exceptional performance showcases the significance of deep learning in medical imaging. It signifies the beginning 
of a new era in lung cancer detection characterized by enhanced precision and productivity. MobileNet had an 
impressive accuracy of 99%, with InceptionV3 closely behind at 98%. Although ResNet50 showed promise, its

accuracy only achieved 89%. The study highlights the significance of data augmentation and normalization strategies 
in enhancing model performance.

Abstract 
Traffic is a daily struggle in Bangladesh, especially for students who rely on timely commutes to attend their 
classes. Long and unpredictable travel times make students late or exhausted even before they start their day. This 
eats into their study hours or rest time. This study aims to examine how these long commutes affect students’ 
academic performance, considering the unique challenges they face in urban areas. The objective of this study is 
to find out the association between commute time and its effect on students’ academic performance in Bangladesh 
including attendance rate, lack of focus, grade affection, facing stress. The focus of this study is to identify the 
challenges and propose solutions. A survey was conducted using a Google Form with multiple-choice questions 
to collect data. A total of 20 questionnaires were prepared. The MCQs ensured quick responses and simplified 
analysis, and participation was voluntary. In total, 87 responses were collected from participants. The results 
shows that due to traffic congestion, 60.5% of students reported their attendance was affected. 51.2% of students 
lack focus, 58.1% of students reported their grades were affected, 73.3% of students face stress and fatigue. 
Addressing commute related issues requires collective effort. Implementing the suggested solutions will improve 
student attendance, academic success and overall educational experience.

Abstract 
Generative modeling within supply chain management reveals significant potential for enhancing operational 
efficiency, adaptability, and resilience. Leveraging advanced AI-driven methods such as Generative Adversarial 
Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and autoregressive models, this paper investigates their role in 
transforming demand forecasting, inventory management, logistics optimization, and risk mitigation. By simulating 
complex scenarios and capturing dynamic data relationships, these models enable organizations to predict disruptions, 
optimize inventory levels, and streamline logistics, reducing operational costs and improving responsiveness. This 
study systematically examines the capabilities of generative models in addressing inefficiencies in traditional supply 
chains. It demonstrates how GANs mitigate stockout risks by improving demand predictions, VAEs enhance supply 
chain transparency through latent variable modeling, and autoregressive models forecast time-series data to refine 
inventory and production planning. Additionally, generative approaches integrate real-time data to dynamically 
optimize routing and decision-making under uncertainty. Despite their transformative potential, the paper identifies 
persistent barriers, including data quality issues, interpretability challenges, and integration complexities. To 
overcome these, it proposes leveraging federated generative models for secure, decentralized collaboration and 
embedding sustainability metrics into generative frameworks for eco-conscious supply chain management. This work 
underscores the necessity of integrating generative modeling as a core strategy to drive efficiency, agility, and 
resilience in modern supply chain systems.

1. Introduction
In recent years, the digital transformation within the supply chain has introduced large volumes of extensively 
interdependent data which has increased the complexity of supply chain ecosystem and made it more vulnerable to 
disruption (Ivanov & Dolgui  2021; Y. Wang 2023). Traditional management approaches often fail to understand the 
dynamic landscape , decision makers struggle to integrate and standardize interrelation of data across various channels 
resulting in lost revenue, higher costs, and decreased customer satisfaction (Petrescu & Krishen et al. 2020; Wood et 
al. 2013) Modern management necessitates the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies that enable them to simulate 
complex supply chain scenarios giving a shift from reactive to proactive management (Fatorachian & Kazemi 2021; 
J. Wang, Zhou, et al. 2023) However, key Industry 4.0 technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning 
(ML), Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and Digital Twins are still uncommon in
many supply chain sectors, creating a gap between outdated supply chain management practices and modernized
manufacturing processes (Ghani et al. 2024; Raut et al. 2020; Varriale et al. 2021).

Abstract 
This study explores the implementation of an effective relief distribution system in Harirampur, Manikganj, during a 
flood. The primary objective is to establish a central warehouse and optimize the delivery routes to distribution centers 
using the minimum number of vehicles, thereby ensuring timely and efficient relief distribution. The methodology 
involves using the Center of Gravity (CoG) method to determine the optimal location for the central warehouse and 
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) approach to find the shortest delivery routes. Data on population 
distribution and infrastructure in Harirampur were collected to inform the model. The outcome demonstrates that the 
proposed system significantly reduces travel distances and ensures that relief supplies reach affected areas efficiently. 
The total distance covered by the relief distribution routes was minimized, leading to a cost-effective and timely relief 
operation. This study provides a practical framework for disaster management authorities to enhance the effectiveness 
of relief distribution during floods.

1. Introduction
Flooding is one of the most devastating natural disasters globally, and in recent years, its frequency and severity have 
increased due to extreme weather patterns triggered by climate change. Bangladesh, along with West Bengal in India, 
is one of the most flood-prone regions in the world, largely due to its geographical location in the low-lying area of 
the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region. This area is fed by three major rivers—the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and 
Meghna—forming the GBM river system, one of the largest river basins in the world, covering 1.72 million sq. km. 
(Rahman 2014). Nearly half of Bangladesh's land lies within 10 meters above mean sea level, making the nation 
especially vulnerable to frequent flooding. 
The monsoon season, from June to October, brings heavy rainfall, with around 85% of the total annual precipitation 
and inflow from transboundary rivers occurring during this period. Floods destroy infrastructure, displace people, and 
damage agricultural lands, posing a significant threat to the economy and the livelihoods of rural communities. Over 
the last 50 years, Bangladesh has experienced at least seven major floods, with catastrophic events in 1988, 1998, and 
2004, each causing widespread destruction (Rahman S  2024). The recurring floods, combined with riverbank erosion,

6. Conclusion 
This study introduces a detailed model for enhancing flood relief distribution in Harirampur Upazila, Bangladesh, 
using the CVRP to tackle the complexities of post-disaster relief logistics. The research illustrated a strategy for the 
optimal allocation of relief goods during flood situations by evaluating geographical data and determining the shortest 
paths between 23 relief distribution stations and a central warehouse. The model included essential parameters such 
the population density of each distribution zone, the need for emergency supplies, and the capacity of watercraft.  
 
The analysis demonstrated substantial improvements in resource use via the optimized routes, resulting in lower travel 
lengths and a streamlined distribution procedure that minimized the required visits. The cumulative distance traversed 
by all vehicles was 247.26 km, carrying a total load of 199.2 tons of relief supplies. This method emphasizes the need 
of incorporating real-time data, including population distribution and transportation capacity, into crisis management

strategies. Utilizing mathematical models like as CVRP enhances the efficiency, timeliness, and cost-effectiveness of 
relief operations, therefore guaranteeing that essential help reaches impacted areas more swiftly. 
 
This research provides a pragmatic framework for relief efforts that may be modified for other flood-prone areas with 
comparable logistical difficulties. The use of these optimization models might revolutionize disaster management 
procedures by facilitating fair and efficient relief distribution, alleviating suffering, and preserving lives during future 
flood occurrences.

Abstract 
Bangladesh's tourism sector has fluctuated significantly over the years due to global events, local development, and 
infrastructure improvements. The Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) provides annual visitor arrival data from 
December 1981 to December 2021.This study analyzes trends in Bangladesh's visitor arrivals, identifies peak and low 
periods, and examines the effects of global and local factors, focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic.A quantitative 
analysis of yearly visitor arrival data from the BBS was conducted, comparing key years, including the peak in December 
2019 and the decline in December 2021. Major global events such as the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 were 
considered. The highest recorded arrivals occurred in December 2019 (621,131), while the lowest was in December 1981 
(49,315). In December 2021, arrivals dropped to 135,186 due to COVID- 19. Other trends include steady growth during 
the 1990s and 2000s.Despite challenges, Bangladesh’s tourism sector shows recovery potential, supported by 
infrastructure improvements, government initiatives, and growing international interest. Strategic marketing and tourism 
development are critical for sustainable growth.

Abstract 
Self-medication carries inherent risks, especially in rapidly growing markets where access to healthcare is limited. 
When individuals manage their own medication, the possibility of mistakes increases. A promising solution involves 
AI-powered mobile health apps that assist users in managing their medications safely and accurately. This study aims 
to explore public perceptions of AI's role in facilitating safe self-medication. In a survey consisting of 14 questions, 
one key inquiry was whether respondents believed AI could enhance medication management. The results revealed 
that 82.1% of participants agreed, while 14.3% strongly agreed, highlighting a significant level of trust in AI-powered 
mobile applications to mitigate the risks associated with self-medication and enhance safety. Moreover, the analysis 
suggests that these AI-driven apps can effectively reduce self-medication risks by improving adherence to 
prescriptions and instructions. This research is particularly relevant in regions, such as emerging markets, where 
healthcare services are often limited or difficult to access. Ultimately, this study underscores the potential impact of 
AI in promoting safe medication practices.

Abstract 
Efficient vaccine delivery is critical to ensuring accessibility while minimizing transportation costs. Identifying 
optimal regions for vaccine delivery within an existing geographical area is essential for reducing logistical expenses. 
Our system offers a user-friendly solution to identify single or multiple optimal facilities for vaccine delivery with 
minimal transportation costs through a website. The platform leverages the coordinates and vaccine demand at each 
supply point, provided by the user, to calculate the distance between locations. Using the Haversine formula, the tool 
computes distances accurately based on geographical coordinates. This calculation enables precise analysis of 
transportation costs and helps pinpoint cost-effective delivery facilities. Users can access the website to input data, 
such as coordinates and demand at various supply points, and obtain optimal solutions effortlessly. The platform 
supports decision-making for efficient vaccine distribution by minimizing transportation costs and optimizing facility 
locations. This tool is particularly useful for organizations involved in vaccine logistics, allowing them to streamline 
operations and focus resources effectively. By automating complex calculations, it eliminates manual efforts and 
provides actionable insights swiftly. With its ease of use and accuracy, the platform enhances supply chain efficiency, 
supporting equitable and timely vaccine distribution. This innovative solution bridges the gap between logistical 
challenges and efficient vaccine delivery, ensuring cost-effective, data-driven decision-making for public health 
initiatives.

meet up its demand and also supply the vaccine to Cluster C3 and C5. The distance from Cluster C2 to Cluster C3 
and Cluster C5 is minimum. So, transportation costs will be low.   
Cluster C1 will only meet up its demand and Cluster C4 will only meet up its demand 
 
6. Conclusion 
We have built a personal website to find the optimal facility. A user will be able to find out single and multiple 
facilities to deliver the vaccine with minimum transportation costs. To check the validity of our website, we have 
selected five locations corresponding their unvaccinated population. From the google map, we have taken the 
coordinates of the five locations. The distance between each point is measured by the Haversine method. This method 
can result in an error of up to 0.5%. The optimal facility location can be single or multiple points which are measured 
using p-median method.  This method is one of the most efficient methods of locating facilities by which we can 
minimize the transport cost. By using the website, an Optimal facility location can be found for any vaccine 
transportation. We have found the location for vaccine transportation. We have considered the vaccine reservation

Abstract 
The purpose of the study is to make effective waste management for sustainable urban development, particularly in 
rapidly growing cities like Rajshahi City Corporation, where inadequate infrastructure and inefficient practices have 
led to environmental pollution and economic burdens. This research addresses these challenges by proposing a com-
prehensive waste management framework focused on waste categorization and cost reduction strategies. The study 
employs a multi-stage methodology, beginning with waste characterization through data collection and analysis using 
Excel. Subsequently, plastic and compostable waste are sorted and composted, with Google Maps integration utilized 
to optimize transportation routes. Finally, Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is applied to minimize overall 
waste management costs. Analysis of the results reveals a daily net profit of 649,140 BDT, indicating the economic 
viability of the proposed waste management approach. By leveraging technology, cities can overcome waste manage-
ment challenges and advance their sustainability agendas. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the 
potential benefits of adopting innovative waste management practices in urban contexts, offering a pathway towards 
cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable cities.

1. Introduction
The field of waste management has gained increasing attention due to its profound impact on environmental sustain-
ability, public health, and economic welfare. As the global population continues to grow and urbanization accelerates, 
the challenges surrounding waste management have become more complex and urgent. Historically, waste manage-
ment has followed a linear model, where resources are extracted, used, and then discarded, leading to environmental 
degradation and resource depletion. However, this paradigm has given way to a more holistic approach, known as the 
circular economy, which aims to minimize waste generation and maximize resource efficiency. Zorpas (2020) devel-
oped research on ""Strategy development in the framework of waste management"" which encapsulates this shift, em-
phasizing the need to align waste management practices with circular economy principles. Presently, waste manage-
ment is confronted with a plethora of challenges, many of which are exacerbated by rapid urbanization and changing 
consumption patterns. Zhang (2019) developed ""Barriers to Smart Waste Management for a Circular Economy in 
China"" which underscores the hurdles faced in adopting advanced technologies, such as IoT and AI, for waste man-
agement. Colvero (2018) developed the ""Use of a geographic information system to find areas for locating"" which 
underscores the significance of appropriate site selection for waste disposal facilities to mitigate these adverse effects.

also presents opportunities for investing in additional municipal services, thereby bolstering the city's developmental 
agenda. We have allocated the waste of different wards to specific STS or OWCS based on their transportation cost 
but have not considered the capacity of the STS or OWCS. If the capacity of one STS or OWCS exceeds, the remaining 
waste of a ward will go to the second nearest STS or OWCS where the transportation cost is minimum.

Abstract 
Bagasse fibers, like other natural fibers, exhibit geometric irregularities. Their diameters vary not only between 
individual fibers but also along the length of each fiber, leading to considerable variation in tensile strength. In a 
previous study, we analyzed the deformation, stress, and strain behavior of bagasse fiber-reinforced composites in 
ANSYS Workbench, assuming the fibers had a cylindrical shape. This study builds on our previous work by 
incorporating the effects of geometric irregularities. The bagasse fibers were first examined under an optical 
microscope, and images were processed using ImageJ software to measure fiber diameters at multiple points. These 
measurements were then used to model the fibers in ANSYS, employing Blend tool features to create geometrically 
irregular fiber structures. The results indicate that variations in fiber geometry significantly affect the deformation, 
stress, and strain behavior of the composites.

The tensile strength of bagasse fiber is approximately 4.9 times greater than that of epoxy resin, and its Young's 
modulus is about 3.3 times higher, as indicated in Table 1. When the composite is subjected to tensile loading, the 
majority of the load is carried by the fiber because it is stiffer and stronger. This results in higher stress, particularly 
in regions where the fiber experiences greater changes in area, compared to the matrix. In contrast, the matrix primarily 
serves to hold the bagasse fibers in place, distribute the applied load, and provide shape and toughness to the 
composite. Due to its lower Young's modulus, the matrix deforms more to accommodate the displacement and is more 
prone to deformation. As a result, while the matrix experiences lower stress, it undergoes significantly higher strain 
under the same loading conditions. 
The simulation results presented in this paper clearly show that as the level of irregularity in the bagasse fiber increases, 
both stress and strain concentrations occur at locations where there are sharp changes in area. Consequently, the fiber 
weakens in these stress-concentrated zones, leading to a decrease in the fiber's breaking load. These results are 
consistent with the weakest link theory and support the previous simulation findings obtained by He et al. (2001). 
4. Conclusion 
A linear-elastic finite element model is employed to understand the effect of bagasse fiber geometric irregularities on 
the deformation, strain, and stress behavior of bagasse fiber-reinforced composites. The findings of this research are 
summarized below: 
The level of diameter variation significantly influences the tensile behavior of the fiber-reinforced composite material. 
The bagasse fiber is found to carry the majority of the applied load. The stress in the bagasse fiber is roughly 2.32 
times higher than that in the epoxy matrix. This is because the bagasse fiber is much stiffer (with higher tensile strength 
and Young's modulus) than the epoxy resin, and thus carries most of the applied load. 
The strain in the matrix is about 2.15 times higher than that in the bagasse fibers. This is due to the lower Young's 
modulus of the matrix, which causes it to deform more to accommodate the displacement, resulting in higher strain. 
The level of geometric irregularities in the bagasse fiber significantly influences the tensile properties of both the fiber 
and the composite. Both stress and strain gradients are high in regions where sharp geometric irregularities are 
observed. The fiber weakens in these stress-concentrated zones, leading to a decrease in the fiber's breaking load.

Abstract 
Welding is a process where two similar or dissimilar metals are joined to create a complex joint used in various fields. 
Among the many welding methods, arc welding stands out as one of the best. In arc welding, two metals are brought 
into contact, and the junction is heated, causing the metal to melt and fill the gap between the parent metals. This study 
aims to identify the most effective edge joint for arc welding and optimize the process parameters for welding BSRM 
A 415 square bars. Optimizing welding parameters is crucial because they significantly influence the quality of the 
weld. Without determining the optimal values, the experiment cannot be accurately completed, and the resulting prod-
ucts may lack long-term sustainability. BSRM A 415 square bars were chosen due to their quality billets, guaranteed 
strength, safe welding properties, and ISO certification. They are ideal for intricate structural designs and offer both 
strength and cost efficiency. Four input parameters were selected for the welding process: welding current, voltage, 
travel speed, and electrode diameter, with hardness and ultimate tensile strength as output responses. The study used 
the Taguchi orthogonal array and Grey Fuzzy methods to analyze and optimize the parameters. These methodologies, 
along with various tools and techniques, helped achieve the desired outcomes effectively. 
Keywords 
Edge Joint, Arc Welding, Taguchi Method, Grey Fuzzy Method. 
1. Introduction
Bangladesh is developing day by day in many sectors. Specially in technological development is one of the best 
achievements. To make the structural development in any building and construction site welding is must even we used 
it in our practical daily life so. So each and every work field welding is very much important (Srivastava 2017). The 
history of fusing metals through welding goes back as far as 3000 B.C. when humans first started working with bronze. 
The oldest known examples of welding are small golden boxes that date back to the Bronze age over 2,000 years ago. 
During the Middle Ages, the art of blacksmiths was developed and many items of iron were produced that were welded 
by hammering. It was not until the 19th century that welding as we know it today was invented.in modern age devel-
oped in the Soviet Union, friction welding uses rotational speed and upset pressure to provide friction heat. It is a 
specialized process and has applications only where a sufficient volume of similar parts is to be welded because of the

deviation confirms the accuracy and reliability of the optimization process, demonstrating that the experimental results 
align well with the predicted outcomes, ensuring improved welding performance. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Taguchi method used signal to noise ratio, ANOVA analysis. From SN analysis we see that Groove angle is the highly 
impact parameter and voltage is less important parameter in terms of ultimate tensile strength, for hardness groove 
angle is also very high significant parameter and voltage is very low significant parameter. From ANOVA testing we 
see that groove angle has highest contribution on the output parameters for ultimate tensile strength and for hardness 
groove angle has also highest contribution on the output parameters. For grey fuzzy method to find out the optimal 
solution we followed some steps, these are data normalization, deviation sequence, grey relational coefficient and 
finally Grey fuzzy reasoning grade. From each and every step we noticed that in experiment no 24 we got our optimal 
solution. The solution is current(I)= 170A, voltage(V)= 16V, Travel speed (TS)= 11mm/min, welding diameter (D)= 
2.5mm, groove angle = 60 degree. This research opens several avenues for further exploration. Future studies could 
focus on a broader range of material types, including advanced alloys and composites, to assess how different welding 
edge configurations affect performance across various industries. Additionally, examining the impact of dynamic 
welding conditions, such as temperature and humidity, on edge types and joint angles could yield valuable insights for 
real-world applications. Long-term performance analysis of welded joints with optimized edge configurations is an-
other important area for future research. Conducting durability and fatigue tests will help understand how these joints 
perform over time. Furthermore, exploring the effects of modern welding techniques, like laser welding and friction 
stir welding, on edge performance can lead to innovative solutions and applications.

Abstract 
The growing enrollment in private universities in Bangladesh within the last two decades is the clearest sign of easier 
access to higher education. This research analyses the changing trends over the period and the factors that govern 
admission rates and influence the development of the higher education sector.The objectives of this study include 
identifying the associations between increasingly high enrolment in private universities and some selected factors like 
demographic patterns, socioeconomic indicators, and institutional characteristics focusing on the urban-rural divide.In 
this survey study, data were collected by means of a structured questionnaire in order to obtain responses from students 
in different private universities of Bangladesh. The questionnaire covered issues regarding enrolment motivation, 
demographic factors, and institutional perceptions. Various statistical tools such as measures of central tendency, 
probability models, and regression analyses were used to analyze and interpret the responses and findings, all the 
information being represented in the form of bar charts and histograms.The study expects to identify factors driving 
private university enrollments, including socioeconomic status and institutional reputation. Previous data indicate 
urban students account for 70% of enrollments in private universities (UGC Report, 2020), highlighting access 
disparities. Findings will inform strategies to enhance satisfaction and equity.The increase in private university 
enrollment indicates improved educational access. However, quality control challenges and persistent urban-rural 
inequalities require targeted policy interventions for sustainable development of the sector.

Abstract 
This study explores the factors that influence Bangladeshi students' decisions to study abroad, aiming to identify key 
determinants and predict future trends. Using a large dataset from the last 15 years, this study identifies important 
factors that influence students' decisions to pursue an international education, including academic goals, field of study 
preferences, information availability, employment opportunities, and financial accessibility. This study employed a 
quantitative approach, utilizing a large dataset collected from surveys and official academic records of Bangladeshi 
students. Key variables analyzed included academic performance, socioeconomic status, field of study preferences, 
and urban vs. rural backgrounds. The results show that students are more willing to study overseas if they have 
excellent academic records and stronger financial support. One of the main inspirations is the possibility of greater 
career and income prospects abroad. This study’s results will propose ideas on how to give students from less fortunate 
backgrounds greater opportunities to study abroad. Policymakers and educational institutions can use this data to 
inform the development of programs that will assist Bangladeshi students in reaching their international academic and 
career objectives.

Abstract 
This study investigates how ready the people of Bangladesh are for Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology. It 
looks at factors such as public awareness, interest, perceived benefits, concerns, and cultural influences. The study 
emphasizes the importance of education, regulations, and ethical considerations for BCI’s successful integration. This 
study examines the readiness of the people of Bangladesh in regard to Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technology 
focusing on areas such as awareness, interest, possible benefits, concerns as well as cultural issues. To collect data for 
this research, we utilized Microsoft Forms. The research design followed a quantitative approach. 
According to the survey, it is expected that public education campaigns and targeted awareness initiatives will help 
overcome the limited understanding of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and promote a positive view of their adoption. 
By recognizing key concerns such as privacy, data security, and safety, the study forecasts the creation of strong 
regulatory measures to address these issues. Additionally, highlighting the medical advantages of BCI is expected to 
boost public acceptance, even when considering cultural and religious perspectives. Ultimately, a balanced strategy 
that includes government regulation and ethical policy frameworks is seen as essential for the smooth and responsible 
integration of BCI into the society of Bangladesh. The study calls for public education, ethical considerations, and 
policy frameworks to ensure the successful integration of BCI technology into Bangladesh's socio-cultural landscape.

Abstract 
Social media has become a vital part of daily life, especially for younger generations. Platforms like Instagram, 
Facebook, and YouTube play a significant role, with reels and short videos attracting a lot of attention. While these 
formats encourage creativity and fun, they also raise concerns about their negative effects on behavior and 
concentration. This is particularly true in Bangladesh, where social media use among young people is rapidly 
increasing. This research investigates the harmful effects of social media on young individuals, focusing on how it 
affects their behavior and reduces concentration due to excessive consumption of reels and short videos. Data was 
collected through an online survey of individuals aged 18 to 30, examining social media usage patterns, reel 
consumption, and self-reported changes in concentration and behavior. Responses from 100 participants were 
analyzed to identify trends and correlations. The study is expected to reveal significant declines in concentration levels, 
shorter attention spans, increased procrastination, and behavioral changes such as reduced motivation and mood 
swings. Although reels may have some minor positive effects, the findings will highlight their overall negative impact 
on young people's productivity. This research emphasizes the importance of using social media mindfully to lessen 
these adverse effects and advocates for a balanced approach to digital engagement to promote healthier habits and 
protect the concentration and behavior of young individuals.

Abstract 
Rotodynamic type pumps, particularly centrifugal pumps, enable lifting of liquid from a lower to higher level by 
developing dynamic pressure. The effect of the blade exit angle on centrifugal pump efficiency is a crucial aspect of 
pump design and operation as it has significant effects on flow dynamics, energy transfer, and pressure performance. 
So, careful design and optimization of this parameter is important for substantial improvements in pump efficiency 
and operational effectiveness. The study focuses on adjusting the blade exit angles and analyzing their effects on the 
pump's hydraulic performance. Using pumps with varying blade exit angles, a number of tests were carried out under 
close observation of important performance metrics like discharge rate, flow velocity, and overall efficiency. Impellers 
were designed using SolidWorks 2020, and fabricated using additive manufacturing by Polylactic acid (PLA) to 
measure the performance of a centrifugal pump with different blade exit angles ranging from 40° to 90°. The 
experiments were carried out with a motor running at around 2990 rpm. The results showed that the efficiency of the 
centrifugal pump was significantly affected by the blade exit angle, with a maximum efficiency obtained at a blade 
exit angle of 40o. As the blade exit angle decreases, the efficiency of the centrifugal pump increases. When the fluid 
flowed through the impeller, it gained kinetic energy and was directed towards the pump volute where the kinetic 
energy was converted into pressure energy. By decreasing the impeller blade exit angle, the fluid was directed more 
effectively towards the volute and there was less recirculation, resulting in an increased pump efficiency. However, 
decreasing the blade exit angle too much could also have negative effects on pump performance. It is also concluded 
that the metallic impeller has a better discharge rate and flow velocity than non-metallic impellers but is very close in 
terms of efficiency with the impeller of a similar angle. However, the cost of the impeller made using additive 
manufacturing by Polylactic acid (PLA) is far lower than metallic impellers of the same parameters. The experimental 
study sheds light on how changing the blade exit angle of the impeller affects the efficiency of a centrifugal pump. 
Impellers with various exit angles were fabricated using additive manufacturing, their efficiencies were determined, 
and different parameters were analyzed to successfully conduct this experimental work.

Based on the calculations and graph presented above, it is evident that the gunmetal impeller with 90° blade angle had 
the highest discharge and flow rate among all the impellers. But the PLA impeller with the same 90° blade angle 
surpassed the gunmetal impeller in manometric efficiency by 0.02%. To figure out the underlying reasons, the authors 
delved deep into the internal factors influencing these parameters.For the 40° blade exit angle, water flowing through 
the vanes had to navigate a long, narrow channel to reach the periphery of the impeller. Additionally, the lower blade 
angle resulted in longer impeller blades, which caused the water to take more time to discharge compared to the other 
two impeller designs. Intriguingly, the 70° blade exit angle demonstrated better centrifugal action than the 90° blade 
exit angle, despite the slightly longer blades. In terms of efficiency, apart from the original gunmetal impeller, the 40° 
blade-exit angle impeller exhibited the highest efficiency, followed by the 70° and 90° blade exit angle impellers 
respectively. This aligns with the observed relationship between the blade-exit angle and the efficiency of centrifugal 
pumps; as the blade-exit angle decreases, efficiency tends to increase. As the fluid moves through the impeller, it gains 
kinetic energy, which is then directed toward the pump volute where this kinetic energy is converted into pressure 
energy. If, however, the impeller blade exit angle is excessively large, the fluid may not be properly directed toward 
the volute, leading to recirculation back toward the impeller inlet. This recirculation diminishes the net fluid flow 
through the pump, thereby reducing its efficiency.  
 
Thus, a higher blade angle diminishes the efficiency of pumps. By lowering the impeller blade exit angle, fluid is 
directed more effectively toward the volute, resulting in less recirculation and enhanced pump efficiency. That being 
said, overly decreasing the blade exit angle can also negatively impact performance. The impeller with a 40° blade 
exit angle achieved approximately 0.88% greater efficiency than the 70° impeller and 1.45% more than the radial 
impeller.When it came to the 90° gunmetal impeller, it exhibited superior discharge and flow velocity compared to 
the 3D-printed impellers, achieving a discharge rate that was 95.8 cm³/s higher than that of the 90° PLA impeller, with 
nearly similar efficiency levels between the two. The gunmetal impeller benefited from a better surface finish, 
resulting in significantly lower frictional losses compared to the 3D-printed designs. Centrifugal pumps typically 
utilize metallic impellers, which are more durable and possess better finishes than non-metallic 3D-printed impellers. 
The machining precision of traditional methods far exceeds that of 3D printing, which often produces impeller blades 
with rough surfaces, leading to higher frictional losses and lower discharge rates relative to their metallic counterparts. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The experimental study investigated how variations in the blade exit angle of an impeller affect the efficiency of a 
centrifugal pump. Impellers with different exit angles were fabricated, and their efficiencies were measured alongside 
the analysis of key parameters. The primary findings are as follows: 
 
Among the three impellers tested, the one with the smallest blade exit angle achieved the highest efficiency at 51.40%, 
followed by 50.52% for the 70° impeller and 49.95% for the 90° impeller. This suggests that decreasing the blade exit 
angle enhances efficiency up to an optimal point for centrifugal pumps. The 70° impeller had the highest discharge 
rate at 279.2 cm³/s, followed by the 90° and 40° impellers, which produced discharge rates of 253.4 cm³/s and 213.7 
cm³/s, respectively. Therefore, the 40° impeller demonstrated the lowest discharge rate. The study also compared 
metallic and non-metallic impellers, concluding that while the metallic impeller exhibited superior discharge rate and 
flow velocity, its efficiency was only marginally better than that of a non-metallic impeller with a similar blade angle. 
While the 40° impeller delivered the highest efficiency for a half-horsepower centrifugal pump, its fabrication was 
more complex and costly, and it exhibited the lowest discharge rate. Conversely, the 70° impeller, although slightly 
less efficient, achieved the highest discharge rate, with a higher fabrication cost than the radial impeller. Considering 
all factors, the 70° blade exit angle impeller is the most suitable option for a ½ hp centrifugal pump, with efficiency 
comparable to that of the gunmetal impeller. 
 
The results further suggest that while traditional gunmetal impellers still provide the highest efficiency and durability, 
impellers made from PLA using additive manufacturing are a more cost-effective solution for small production lines 
where similar efficiency is required, but high manometric head or extended longevity are not as critical. The 
experiment demonstrates that PLA impellers manufactured through additive processes offer efficiency on par with 
gunmetal impellers, with the added benefit of lower cost. Further research is recommended to address the challenge 
of lower head performance to improve the applicability of PLA impellers.

Abstract 
Road accidents are a significant public health issue in Bangladesh, leading to substantial fatalities and injuries 
annually. This study examines trends in road accidents, deaths, and injuries in Bangladesh from 2015 to 2023, 
identifying key concerns and providing evidence-based recommendations to enhance road safety.To assess the annual 
trends in road accidents, fatalities, and injuries from 2015 to 2023, identify correlations, and explore underlying causes 
to inform policymakers on effective interventions.A retrospective analysis of road accident data from 2015 to 2023 
was conducted using descriptive and inferential statistical methods. The dataset includes annual records of accidents, 
deaths, and injuries. Data visualization techniques, such as line graphs  were employed to enhance interpretability.The 
analysis revealed a significant increase in the number of accidents, deaths, and injuries during the period 2015–2021, 
peaking in 2020–2021, followed by a slight decline in subsequent years. While the number of accidents increased by 
over 70% from 2015 to 2021, injuries and deaths followed a similar trajectory. The decline observed in 2022–2023 
may be attributed to improvements in road safety measures or changes in traffic patterns. The findings highlight the 
need for stricter traffic regulations, public awareness campaigns, and improved emergency response systems to reduce 
road accidents and associated casualties. Further research is recommended to explore contributing factors and evaluate 
policy interventions.

Abstract 
Maintaining sewage systems is vital for public health and environmental sustainability, particularly in urban settings. 
In countries like Bangladesh, manual methods for separating solid and liquid waste expose workers to significant 
health risks and contribute to environmental degradation. To tackle these issues, we have designed the Automated 
Drain Cleaner, a cutting-edge solution that automates waste separation while enhancing garbage collection efficiency. 
The system features a conveyor-based waste separator, a garbage-can level sensor, a clog-detection mechanism, and 
an adjustable structure to accommodate various pathway sizes. Utilizing SolidWorks for design and ANSYS for 
structural analysis, the system is both durable and efficient. Customer insights gathered through surveys guided the 
design process, and Quality Function Deployment (QFD) ensured alignment with user needs. Financial analysis 
demonstrated the system’s affordability and practicality, making it a sustainable and scalable solution. This innovation 
reduces worker exposure to hazardous environments, improves waste management practices, and supports cleaner 
urban sanitation systems.

1. Introduction
Maintaining urban drainage is essential for environmental sustainability and sanitation, yet conventional cleaning 
techniques are ineffective and present serious health hazards. Manual cleaning practices put workers in danger and 
ineffectively handle waste management issues, particularly in developing economies like Bangladesh.By automating 
the collection and sorting of solid and liquid waste in drainage systems, the Automated Gutter Cleaner provides a 
creative solution. The ability to adjust to different gutter sizes, sensors for tracking obstructions, and a revolving 
conveyor belt for garbage disposal are important characteristics. This method guarantees smooth drainage flow, 
reduces manual labor, and increases efficiency. 
The system's cost-effectiveness, ease of installation, and dependable waste treatment are highlighted in its customer-
focused design. Logistical difficulties are further addressed by its capacity to compress solid waste for convenient 
transportation. This essay examines the Automated Gutter Cleaner's conception, creation, and application, 
emphasizing how it could transform urban drainage systems and advance environmentally friendly waste disposal.

The current design incorporates conveyor belts for solid waste collection and transport. While functional, this setup 
requires significant material and regular maintenance due to blockages. Replacing conveyor belts with a simpler 
mechanical lifting mechanism—such as a lever-based or rotating scoop system—could reduce material usage and 
associated costs. These alternative mechanisms are also less prone to mechanical failures and require fewer moving 
parts, thereby enhancing reliability and reducing downtime.This shift would maintain the efficiency of waste 
collection while simplifying the design, reducing manufacturing complexity, and lowering production costs. 
5.4 Validation 
The validation of the Automated Drain Cleaner involved a combination of ANSYS simulations and practical 
assessments to ensure the design met the necessary safety, reliability, and functional objectives. 
Structural analysis using ANSYS focused on critical components such as the frame, conveyor belt, gears, and shafts. 
The simulations evaluated total deformation, equivalent stress, safety factors, and life cycles under typical and peak 
operational conditions. All components demonstrated low deformation and stress values, remaining within material 
yield limits; safety factors exceeding 2.0, confirming robustness under expected loads; life cycles exceeding 500,000 
cycles for heavily used parts, ensuring durability. Preliminary field testing validated the system’s operational 
performance in real-world conditions. The cleaner efficiently separated solid and liquid waste, achieving functional 
goals such as reliable solid waste collection and disposal using conveyor and sensor systems, and smooth adaptation 
to variable drain dimensions with adjustable frame components. 
 
6. Conclusion 
An important step forward in tackling the difficulties of maintaining urban drainage is the creation of the Automated 
Gutter Cleaner. This technology eliminates the inefficiencies present in conventional cleaning techniques and reduces 
the health hazards to sanitation personnel by automating the collection and separation of solid and liquid waste. The 
system's practicality and effectiveness in a variety of operational scenarios are guaranteed by the incorporation of 
essential features such a revolving conveyor belt, real-time blockage-detecting sensors, and adaptability to different 
gutter diameters. 
 
The project's results and execution show that using automation to improve drainage and waste management system 
performance is feasible. Furthermore, the system is a scalable solution for urban and industrial applications because 
of its emphasis on cost-effectiveness, simplicity of installation, and operational reliability, all of which meet the needs 
of stakeholders and end users.This study adds to the expanding corpus of research on environmentally friendly waste 
management technology by emphasizing how automated systems have the power to revolutionize conventional 
methods. Future research may examine additional improvements, such as using IoT for remote monitoring and cutting-
edge materials for greater robustness. The Automated Gutter Cleaner provides a practical route to cleaner, healthier, 
and more effective urban settings by tackling the crucial nexus of sustainability, technology, and sanitation.

Abstract 
In the quest for heightened industrial efficiency, the integration of automated product counting and sorting systems 
with conveyor belts has emerged as a transformative solution. Object sorting, a fundamental process employed across 
various domains in our daily lives, often suffers from human errors and time-intensive procedures. To address these 
challenges, the implementation of Low-Cost Automation (LCA) has been introduced to sorting systems, aiming to 
reduce production time, labor expenses, and processing complexities, while elevating product quality and production 
rates. This project introduces an innovative approach to automatically sort objects based on their height and accurately 
count them. The system employs a conveyor belt, DC Gear motor, servo motor, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor, and an 
LCD display with an i2c converter, all Controlled by an Arduino UNO. Objects traversing the conveyor belt undergo 
height measurements through an ultrasonic sensor, enabling the Arduino to process the data and activate servo motors 
for sorting according to pre-defined height categories. The study successfully demonstrates the sorting and counting 
of objects with distinct sizes, showcasing the potential for improved industrial automation and efficiency.

1. Introduction
In the era of automation and efficiency, industries are increasingly turning to innovative solutions for streamlined 
processes. Automatic product counting and sorting systems, integrated with conveyor belts, have emerged as a game-
changer. These systems leverage advanced technologies like sensors, and Arduino to accurately count and categorize 
products as they move along the conveyor belt. Manual error and time-consuming problems are one of the main factors 
when counting and sorting a product. Relying on manual counting and sorting can lead to human errors, such as 
miscounts, incorrect categorization, or misplaced items. Making an automatic conveyor belt system can reduce this 
manual error and time-consuming problem efficiently and effectively. Komol (2017) suggested the design and con-
struction of a conveyor belt system that sorts products based on color. The system aims to achieve efficient separation 
using color detection technology, contributing to automated industrial processes. Janwe and Sonawane (2021) intro-
duce a semi-automatic sorting system.  
The study outlines a solution for sorting tasks through a combination of manual and automated processes, demonstrat-
ing its potential applicability in various industries. Thike and San (2019) investigated the design and development of 
an automatic color sorting system. The study focuses on the technical aspects of implementing a system that can 
accurately sort objects based on their colors, enhancing industrial efficiency. Kheman and Ramthirth (2023) suggested 
the design and development of an automatic color sorting system. The research emphasizes the practicality of such 
systems in improving production processes through accurate color-based sorting. Nuvaand Ahmed (2022) presented

The 100% sorting accuracy ensures precise categorization of objects, based on their measured heights. There are two 
motors that activate, according to the signal coming from the Arduino, which is programmed by two sizes, 1-8 cm for 
motor-1, and 12-15 cm for motor-2. If the object size stands in the range of 8cm¡object size¡12cm, no motor will be 
activated and it will pass through the conveyor belt, which is called a static situation. This data underscores the sys-
tem’s effectiveness in automating the sorting process with precision. Accuracy comparison across different sizes is 
given in Figure 7. The figure shows that the sensors were able to detect the height of different sizes very accurately.  
 
This table presents data for sorting accuracy and height measurement for objects of different sizes. It includes actual 
and measured heights, motor movements (Motor-1 or Motor-2), and accuracy percentages. The table demonstrates 
consistent sorting accuracy (100%) and varied height measurement accuracy, highlighting performance variations 
for different object sizes and motor movements.

In the dynamic realm of industrial manufacturing, precision and efficiency have taken center stage. Seamlessly man-
aging the product journey, from raw materials to the final output, Therefore, the idea of an automated system for 
categorizing products based on their dimensions is advantageous for big, mass-producing businesses. With this inven-
tion, higher production rates, more uniformity, cheaper labor costs, fewer mistakes, and simplified material handling 
are all promised. Thus, the proposition of an automated product sorting system based on dimensions stands promising 
for large-scale, mass-producing industries. This innovation promises escalated production rates, heightened con-
sistency, lowered labor costs, diminished errors, and streamlined material handling. The cost of implementing this 
prototype in industries is very cheap. By intelligently separating items by size and packaging, it simplifies operations, 
aligning with mechanical and electrical finesse via Arduino, servo motors, and sensors. This system not only saves 
resources but also suits diverse industries, a testament to its simplicity and efficiency. Ultimately, this sorting solution 
is poised to shape industries and contribute to national economic advancement.

Abstract 
This paper presents the design and development of a scissor lift table, focusing on its application as a safer, more 
efficient solution for workers needing access to high elevations in various industrial settings. Scissor lifts have become 
increasingly essential in construction sites, warehouses, factories, and emergency services, where traditional equip-
ment like ladders or platforms pose safety risks due to their instability and limited working space. The objective of 
this project is to address these safety concerns by offering a stable, ergonomic alternative that improves worker produc-
tivity and minimizes the risk of accidents, such as falls, while working at height. Powered hydraulically or pneumati-
cally, scissor lifts use mechanical arms to elevate platforms, with fail-safe options to return the platform to the ground 
by releasing hydraulic or pneumatic pressure. This design feature enhances reliability and safety. The versatility of 
scissor lifts makes them suitable for a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, warehousing, military, hos-
pitals, and emergency rescue operations. By offering a more reliable and secure solution for high-elevation work, 
scissor lifts provide an improved working environment compared to conventional lifting methods. This paper explores 
the practical benefits and innovations in scissor lift design, supporting the idea that such lifts can significantly enhance 
safety and efficiency in industries reliant on elevated work platforms, thus making a valuable contribution to the field.

1. Introduction
Hydraulic scissor lifts are vital tools in a variety of industrial sectors, providing safe and efficient solutions for lifting 
heavy loads, enhancing accessibility, and facilitating material handling. Over the years, extensive research has been 
conducted to improve their design, performance, and cost-effectiveness. Early work by Momin (2015) emphasized 
the versatility, portability, and cost-effectiveness of hydraulic scissor lifts, validating the design using ANSYS simu-
lations to ensure safety and functionality. This laid the groundwork for further advancements in scissor lift technology. 
Arunkumar (2021) expanded on Momin's work by focusing on structural optimization and weight reduction. Using 
Autodesk Fusion 360 for finite element analysis, the study highlighted how innovative I-frame construction and re-
generative techniques could enhance the lift’s performance while reducing material costs. Similarly, Nguyen (2023) 
optimized double-stage lifts by adjusting parametric dimensions and cylinder positioning to improve lifting height, 
stability, and load distribution. These studies underscore the growing focus on maximizing the efficiency and stability 
of hydraulic scissor lifts.  
In addition to structural optimizations, methods like Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) have been utilized to 
improve design configurations. Linh et al. (2022) and Trieu Quy Huy et al. (2022) applied MCDM methods like 
MOORA and MARCOS to optimize lift designs, focusing on factors such as lift force and time, which are crucial for 
industrial applications where efficiency and reliability are key. Furthermore, Solmazyiğit et al. (2022) introduced an

6. Conclusion 
From the results we obtained, it was seen that the yield strength and tensile strength of the Scissor Lift Table are 
sufficient to hold our device in steady condition. From the fixtures results, it was seen no reaction moments were 
found. For the Scissor Lift Table, our design for all the factors and their values was found satisfactory. No Reaction 
moments were found while the loads were applied. Therefore, from the above analysis, our product has shown safe 
and satisfactory values. Thus Scissor Lift Table is safe for use and can withstand stresses.

Abstract 
This study proposes a novel framework to manage organizational agility in uncertain environments while exploring 
the interplay between organizational culture, disruption severity, and AI readiness and responsiveness to emerging 
types of disruption. The research draws its insights from the perspective of dynamic capabilities and asserts that 
organizational culture has the ability to guide AI integration at junctions when disruptions occur. It was based on a 
survey methodology of 383 respondents across 4 sectors – manufacturing, retail, IT services and healthcare. To 
validate hypothesized relationships, Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used. The 
results confirmed that organizational culture has a significant positive impact on AI readiness and responsiveness. 
Additionally, the results indicate that disruption severity is a key moderator, enhancing the effect of organizational 
culture in these particularly disrupted contexts. This shows two roles of organizational culture in ensuring 
technological capability as proactive and reactive. In this study, organizational culture and disruption management 
was unified within a framework to deliver unique insights into the strategic alignment of cultural and technological 
resources. To extend existing literature, and address gaps in the existing literature, the research considers the 
moderating role of disruption severity in dynamic environments. This is actionable guidance for organizations to better 
develop their technological adaptability, especially in a crisis. Future research on cultural dimensions as well as 
longitudinal impacts could enrich understanding as much as possible. The novel contributions of the study make it 
valuable to both academic and practitioner audiences interested in understanding organizational behavior and 
technology management.

1. Introduction
AI technology is quickly infiltrating organizational structures, and this has highly influenced business processes, more 
so during periods of increased disruptions. Concerning recent events like COVID-19, it is evident that the AI capability 
is an imperative instrument for continuity of business and organizational success by addressing risks, planning, and 
recovery from shocks (Modgil, Gupta, et al. 2022). Consequently, these disruptions have demonstrated the potential 
of AI, as well as the fact that organizations are not yet ready to maximize the utilization of AI (Dey et al. 2024a). 
There are some difficulties an organization faces when it comes to attaining AI readiness and responsiveness. AI 
Readiness, the state of organization's readiness to effectively adopt AI technologies is mostly preceded by a foundation 
culture that embraces innovation and flexibility (Wong et al. 2024a). Similarly, operational responsiveness is the 
ability to effectively use AI in an organization’s day to day workflow and addressing the operational requirements by 
embedded AI technologies into decision making. However, scenarios that disrupt the logistics substantially, for 
example, pandemics or disruptive supplies, make these challenges worse for several reasons, they deplete the existing 
resources and reveal the organizational voids (Chaudhuri et al. 2023).

5. Discussion 
This investigation contributes knowledge towards the direction concerning the examination of the association in 
between the caliber of organizational culture, level of disruption and eagerness and flexibility towards AI. The 
hypothesis analyses revealed that organizational culture is a crucial determinant of the AI readiness (H1) and AI 
responsiveness (H2). Also, the severity of disruption was found to be an influential determinant of both AI readiness 
(H3) and AI responsiveness (H4). Moreover, the support for disruption severity as a moderator provided in H5 and 
H6 shows that it strengthens the impact of organizational culture under the conditions of high disruption scenarios. As 
such, these findings underscore the need to ensure that organizational cultural values are well-mapped onto external 
environmental conditions so that the organization can be more adaptable and ready to embrace evolving technologies 
during the periods of uncertainty(Martínez-Plumed et al. 2021). 
 
Nevertheless, some limitations can be pointed out in the context of the present research. First, the cross-sectional 
design restricts the demonstrative temporality and potential smooth interactions. A quantitative longitudinal study in 
future research could produce closely related and probably more refined results. Second, this study only included four 
industries thus reducing the validity and generalizability of the results. It might also be possible to apply the study to 
other sectors and areas to increase external validity (Buettig & Stenmark, 2024). Finally, although this research 
operationalizes organizational culture as a whole, future work can examine cultural dimensions to investigate their 
modality toward the influence of AI capacities (Lee et al. 2024). Subsequent research should also consider the 
relationship between AI enrichment and organizational flexibility to boost the already practical knowledge and 
managerial approaches. 
 
6. Conclusion 
In addressing its objectives, this study offers comprehensive analysis that gives us the opportunity to understand the 
relationships between organizational culture, AI readiness, AI responsiveness, and disruption severity. However, our 
findings indicated that organizational culture is a critical enabler of AI readiness and responsiveness and a key driver 
of adaptability and innovation under uncertainty. This also underlines the dynamic linkage between internal 
organizational capabilities and the external challenges driving AI adoption, and the moderating role of disruption 
severity through a dynamic perspective on AI adoption strategies. 
The unique contribution that this research makes is an integrated analysis of organizational culture and disruption 
severity, which positions these factors as central to shaping AI outcomes. This study bridges gaps in the literature and 
provides actionable insights to organizations that are looking to do so by proposing and validating a robust framework. 
This dissertation expands theoretical and practical discourses related to organizational resilience and AI integration.

Abstract 
The worldwide leather tanning industry is crucial in global trade, making around US$50 billion in sales. However, its 
fast growth has caused significant environmental issues, prompting a careful reconsideration of the industry's 
operation. Tanneries, often situated near the water, highlight the difficulty of balancing making money with caring for 
the environment. Having good plans for managing waste is crucial to deal with these issues. Leather Working Group 
(LWG) certification is a way to transform the industry. Getting LWG certification allows tanneries to sell their 
products to the EU and other places that care about the environment. However, there are challenges for tanneries trying 
to get this certification. This study uses a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making tool to prioritize these challenges 
systematically. By focusing on these obstacles, the research aims to help the industry move towards more sustainable 
practices, ensuring it stays competitive globally while taking care of the environment.

Experts were tasked with determining the best and worst criteria from the identified list. Through thorough deliberation 
and analysis, the dysfunctionality of the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) emerged as the most critical 
criterion. This indicates that ensuring the proper functioning of wastewater treatment facilities is paramount in 
addressing environmental pollution and safeguarding worker health within tanneries. Conversely, lack of education 
was identified as the least significant criterion, suggesting that while education and training are essential components 
of workplace safety, other factors may have a more pronounced impact on overall safety standards. 
Next, experts determined the best and worst criteria. Dysfunctionality of the Common Effluent Treatment Plant 
(CETP) was rated as the most important criterion, while lack of education was considered the least important. Experts 
determined the most crucial criterion, highlighting the dysfunctionality of the Common Effluent Treatment Plant 
(CETP) as a top priority for addressing occupational health and safety concerns. This underscores the critical role of 
effective wastewater treatment in mitigating environmental pollution and safeguarding worker health. On the other 
hand, lack of education was identified as the least significant criterion, indicating that while education is important, 
other factors, such as infrastructure and technology, play more prominent roles in enhancing safety standards. 
Pairwise comparisons were conducted to assess the relative importance of each criterion concerning one another. 
Experts assigned scores to indicate the degree of importance of each criterion compared to others. These scores 
provided valuable insights into the hierarchy of criteria, guiding the subsequent calculation of weights. Pairwise 
comparisons were then performed to establish the relationships between criteria. Experts assigned scores based on the 
importance of each criterion relative to others. Using linear programming, weights were calculated for each criterion. 
These weights represent their relative importance in the evaluation process. The consistency ratio was also calculated 
to ensure the reliability of the results, which fell within acceptable thresholds.  
 
Overall, the results indicate that the dysfunctionality of the CETP is the most critical factor in addressing tanneries' 
occupational health and safety challenges. This underscores the importance of ensuring the proper functioning of 
treatment plants to mitigate environmental and health risks. Additionally, factors such as infrastructural deficiencies 
and lack of financial resources were also found to be significant considerations in addressing these challenges. 
The consistency ratio, within acceptable thresholds, validates the reliability of the derived weights, enhancing 
confidence in the decision-making process. Overall, the findings highlight the multifaceted nature of tanneries' 
occupational health and safety challenges, emphasizing the need for holistic approaches that address infrastructure, 
technology, and regulatory compliance to ensure the well-being of workers and environmental sustainability. The 
findings provide valuable insights for policymakers, industry stakeholders, and researchers in developing strategies 
and interventions to improve occupational health and safety standards in tanneries within emerging economies.  
 
5. Conclusion  
In conclusion, the Best Worst Method (BWM) proved to be an effective tool for prioritizing criteria related to 
occupational health and safety challenges in tanneries. This method provided valuable insights into the relative 
importance of various factors influencing workplace safety through a systematic process of criteria identification, 
expert consultation, pairwise comparisons, and weight determination. 
The findings highlight the critical role of addressing environmental concerns, particularly the proper functioning of 
wastewater treatment facilities such as the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP), in mitigating ecological 
pollution and safeguarding worker health. The CETP's dysfunction emerged as the most significant criterion, 
underscoring the importance of investing in infrastructure and technology to ensure compliance with environmental 
regulations and industry standards. 
Additionally, the results shed light on the multifaceted nature of workplace safety challenges in tanneries, emphasizing 
the need for holistic approaches considering factors such as infrastructure quality, technology utilization, and 
workforce education levels. While education and training are essential components of workplace safety, the analysis 
revealed that other factors may have a more pronounced impact on overall safety standards within tanneries. 
 
6.   Recommendations  
Several strategic recommendations are proposed to address the challenges hindering tanneries from achieving LWG 
certification and improving occupational health and safety. The top priorities recommendations are given below: 
 
Enhancing Wastewater Treatment Infrastructure: invest in modernizing and maintaining the Common Effluent 
Treatment Plant (CETP) to ensure its proper functionality, and regular monitoring and maintenance schedules for 
CETPs are needed to avoid dysfunctionality and ensure compliance with environmental standards.

Improving Infrastructural Deficiencies: upgradation in tannery infrastructure is required to meet international 
standards, focusing on workplace safety, ventilation, and waste management systems and promoting the adoption of 
cleaner and more efficient technologies in tannery operations to reduce environmental and occupational health risks. 
Strengthening Regulatory Compliance: strengthen the enforcement of environmental and occupational health 
regulations, ensuring that tanneries comply with national and international standards and stringent penalties for non-
compliance to deter negligence in maintaining safety and environmental standards. 
Capacity Building, Training, and Research: training sessions for tannery workers focusing on the operation and 
maintenance of wastewater treatment facilities, workplace safety, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) 
should be prioritized, raising awareness among tannery staff and management about the importance of sustainable 
practices and achieving LWG certification and investment in research to explore innovative wastewater treatment 
technologies, such as membrane filtration and bioreactors, suitable for tannery operations could be a fruitful solution.

 Abstract 
This study delves into how efficient it would be to upgrade a fuel-powered engine by swapping it for a more powerful 
version that can generate additional energy. The goal is to use the increased power output to run a turbine, which then 
produces extra electricity. This extra energy can be used for a variety of purposes such as charging batteries or 
powering small devices. By examining the relationship between fuel consumption, power output, and operational costs 
this research evaluates whether these modifications are beneficial overall. We will determine a theoretical percentage 
of optimum energy. We assumed a linear increase to the maximum possible output. Beyond this point, the system will 
experience a constraint due to thermodynamic limitations. Preliminary analysis shows that while this approach follows 
the laws of thermodynamics, the actual feasibility depends on how well we can optimize the use of the extra energy 
generated. The study found that increasing the power output in fuel engines for extra energy production yielded 
promising results. It highlighted the importance of optimizing energy use to make this approach practical and cost-
effective. The findings suggest that with careful energy management and innovative engineering, such engine 
upgrades can significantly improve energy efficiency. These results provide a deeper understanding of how such

Abstract 
A family business refers to a business or organization owned and controlled by members of a family. In this era of 
digitalization, family businesses are struggling with new challenges to stay competitive in the market. This study 
focuses on how such businesses can incorporate technology into their operations and embrace digital transformation 
to stay ahead in the market. The goal is to identify strategies that family businesses can adopt to effectively integrate 
digital technologies. A survey was conducted with family-owned businesses from various sectors such as sheet metal 
industries, container factories and chemical industries to gather insights on their insights on using digital technologies. 
Affluent family businesses mentioned are gradually adopting new technologies, enhancing digital skills, and fostering 
innovation. For example- nowadays sheet metal industries are using CAD software to get helped in designing and 
CAM software to get helped in cutting metals directly from CAD models, ERP software to manage production 
schedules, container factories are also using ERP software, some of the factories use SCM software to manage 
suppliers, inventory levels and demand forecasts, chemical industries have started using APC systems to control 
chemical production processes, IoT sensors to get real time monitoring of temperature, pressure, flow and chemical 
concentrations. These industries are also leveraging social media and online sales platforms to connect with customers, 
enabling them to expand their reach to international markets. By embracing technology, family businesses can thrive 
in the age of digitalization and ensure their long-term success.

Abstract 
E-commerce in Bangladesh has experienced remarkable growth and transformation over the past few years. The rapid
growth of the e-commerce sector in Bangladesh has transformed the retail landscape, making it essential for businesses 
to understand the factors influencing consumer purchasing behavior.  Data was collected from a diverse sample of
online shoppers through structured surveys, focusing on different characteristics and user experience factors. By
integrating advanced statistical techniques such as crosstab analysis, factor analysis, etc. the research offers a holistic
approach to identify and analyze the impact of different variables on purchasing behavior in the Bangladeshi e-
commerce sector. Among the nineteen (19) variables that were analyzed differentially, ten (10) variable was found to
be significant for the e-commerce sector.  The results highlight critical factors such as age, education level, marital
status, monthly income, and occupation as primary drivers of purchase decisions. The variables were grouped into
two categories namely ‘Demographic Influences’ and ‘Accessibility and Affordability’. The contribution of this study
is that it integrates multiple characteristics – demographic, psychographic, behavioral, and value-based that were
typically analyzed separately in previous researches. Additionally, this study systematically groups these variables
into distinct and meaningful categories, an aspect not thoroughly addressed in the existing literature. Finally, this study
provides Bangladeshi marketers and e-commerce businesses useful information that helps them to optimize their
marketing strategies, tailor customer engagement efforts, and enhance overall customer experience in the rapidly
growing digital market of Bangladesh.

Abstract 
Bangladesh struggling through the environmental challenges like pollution, energy consumption, and waste 
management. Environmental management is a critical concern for Bangladesh, given its vulnerability to climate 
change and rapid industrialization. A proper prioritizing effective environmental management practices (EMPs) is 
crucial for sustainable development. This study utilizes SWARA (Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis) and 
WASPAS (Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment) methods to evaluate and prioritize a range of EMPs. The 
research identifies key environmental challenges and considers a range of criteria—including environmental impact, 
1319","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
© IEOM Society International 
From the analysis, Health and Environmental Policy (A3) emerged as the most crucial factor with the highest weight 
of 0.7673, followed by Circular Economy and Waste Management (A4), with a weight of 0.8246, and Energy 
Efficiency and Renewable Energy (A1) with a weight of 0.5706. These factors play a central role in driving sustainable 
practices in industrial operations, which aligns with current global efforts to mitigate environmental degradation and 
promote sustainable industrialization. 
 
Circular Economy and Waste Management (A4) received the highest ranking due to its importance in reducing waste 
and encouraging the reuse of resources, which is critical for long-term environmental sustainability. As businesses 
and industries in Bangladesh face growing waste management challenges, this factor's high ranking suggests that 
investing in circular economy initiatives can significantly improve environmental outcomes. 
 
On the other hand, Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (A1) ranked moderately high. While this factor is 
essential in reducing carbon footprints and promoting green energy, its relatively lower weight (0.5706) compared to 
circular economy practices might indicate that energy efficiency improvements need to be implemented alongside 
waste management efforts for maximum impact.The other factors, including Effluent Treatment (A2) and Pollution 
and Carbon Footprint (A5), also hold importance but have lower rankings. These factors are necessary for addressing 
pollution concerns and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. However, their lower weights indicate 
that their integration into environmental management strategies should be balanced with the top-ranked factors to 
maximize overall effectiveness. 
 
This study provides valuable insights for environmental management policymakers by identifying and prioritizing the 
key factors that contribute to sustainable industrial practices. By highlighting the importance of Health and 
Environmental Policies, Circular Economy and Waste Management, and Energy Efficiency, policymakers can focus 
their efforts on creating regulations and initiatives that support these critical areas. The findings suggest that addressing 
waste management and resource reuse should be a priority, along with promoting renewable energy and improving 
energy efficiency. By incorporating these priorities into national policies, policymakers can guide industries toward 
more sustainable practices, reduce environmental pollution, and contribute to the country’s long-term environmental 
goals. The study’s results can assist in shaping strategies, regulations, and incentives that not only foster environmental 
sustainability but also enhance the economic performance of industries by reducing waste and energy costs. 
 
The findings underscore the importance of developing integrated environmental strategies that not only focus on 
reducing pollution but also promote sustainability through circular economy practices and effective policy-making. 
The results suggest that businesses and policymakers should prioritize initiatives that combine waste reduction, energy 
efficiency, and renewable energy solutions to achieve a greener, more sustainable future for Bangladesh. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study underscores the critical importance of integrating environmental sustainability into industrial practices 
through the systematic evaluation of key factors such as energy efficiency, waste management, and health and 
environmental policies. The use of methods like SWARA and WASPAS allowed for the prioritization of these factors, 
offering a clear pathway for policymakers to address the most pressing environmental challenges. By focusing on 
areas such as circular economy practices and pollution reduction, industries can make significant strides towards 
reducing their ecological footprint while improving productivity. The results of this research provide valuable 
guidance for policymakers, helping them design and implement strategies that align industrial growth with 
environmental protection. Ultimately, the study highlights the potential for a balanced approach that not only meets 
economic objectives but also promotes long-term sustainability for both industries and the environment. While this 
study provides valuable insights into prioritizing environmental management practices, it is not without limitations. 
First, the analysis relies on a set of pre-defined criteria and subjective judgments in assigning weights, which may not 
fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios. The methods used, such as SWARA and WASPAS, depend 
heavily on the quality and accuracy of input data, which may be influenced by biases or incomplete information.

Abstract 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions present a significant environmental challenge worldwide, contributing to the 
worsening of climate change and its associated impacts. In Bangladesh, rapid industrialization and urban expansion 
have exacerbated CO2 emissions, highlighting the need for timely and accurate forecasting to inform effective 
mitigation strategies. This study proposes a systematic approach to near-real-time CO2 emission prediction, employing 
advanced statistical models (ARIMA, SARIMAX) and machine learning techniques (RF, LSTM), as well as an 
integrated LSTM-SARIMAX model. By assessing prediction accuracy across various energy sectors—including 
renewables, bioenergy, solar, wind, hydro, nuclear, gas, and coal—we aim to identify the most effective forecasting 
models. Our findings offer critical insights for policymakers, facilitating informed decision-making and proactive 
measures for emission reduction. This research addresses significant gaps in CO2 emission prediction and enhances 
methodologies for forecasting in Bangladesh.

demonstrated superior performance with an R-squared value of 91. The ensemble approach proved to be a robust 
solution for time series forecasting. Tree-based models like XGBoost and Random Forest showed notable 
improvements when incorporating exogenous variables. A comparative graph of different models has been depicted 
in Figure 6. In Figure 5, forecasting graph of LSTM has been depicted and LSTM-SARIMAX Forecast has been 
depicted in Figure 7. 
6. Conclusion  
This study underscores the necessity of accurate CO₂ emissions forecasting for Bangladesh, a country highly 
vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and striving to balance economic growth with environmental 
sustainability. The SARIMAX-LSTM ensemble demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving an R² of 0.91 and the 
lowest error metrics. LSTM outperformed traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. However, 
SARIMAX remained a viable, interpretable option in resource-constrained scenarios. Tree-based models like 
XGBoost and Random Forest, while limited in capturing sequential dependencies, leveraged exogenous variables 
effectively, showing promise the necessity of using exogenous variables. Accurate CO₂ forecasting is crucial for 
Bangladesh to design effective policies, meet international climate commitments, and plan sustainable 
industrialization strategies, making advanced forecasting models indispensable for informed decision-making.

Abstract 
The Readymade Garments Industry of Bangladesh contributes about 80% of the export earnings and is currently 
positioned 2nd worldwide in exporting clothes and fabric industry. The competition within this industry is intensifying 
rapidly. In addition to fierce global competition labor union movements and higher-quality market demands are 
making it more challenging for brands to maintain their foothold. This study introduces strategies that may improve 
the resiliency of the supply chain in Bangladesh's Garments using AI and Big Data tools. About 3-4 case study designs 
are used in this study to compare the technological developments in Bangladesh's RMG industry with benchmark 
practices in China. Secondary sources such as case studies (HLA group, Alibaba, H&M, Zara), scholarly works, 
industry reports, and regulatory documents were used to gather data. The study shows China's adoption of advanced 
AI tools such as AI-based quality control cameras, Big Query to data analyze, blockchain platforms like Hyperledger 
Fabric, AI-generated digital patterns and Ethereum-based solutions, and physics-based simulators for garment 
modeling, which is contributing at an streamline operations, enhance transparency. On the other hand, Bangladesh has 
applied innovations like computer vision for quality inspections (Aamra vision by Amara technologies limited) and 
predictive analytics for supply chain planning and many . Development is still hampered by inadequate investment in 
digital technologies, a lack of qualified personnel, and inadequate infrastructure. Bangladesh's apparel and garments 
industry can improve supply chain resilience, lower costs, and improve compliance with international standards by 
giving targeted investments in AI and big data and making them a top priority. To ensure sustainability and long-term 
competitiveness, this study offers policymakers, governments and business executives practical suggestions for 
unlocking the full potential of AI and big data.

Abstract 
Modern civilization uses huge amounts of electrical power. Most of this power is generated by using fossil fuel which 
is non-renewable and we cannot produce it according to our desire. If this condition continues, modern civilization 
will face great difficulties. In this case, energy solutions in the future will greatly depend upon the uses of renewable 
energy. Keeping this concept in mind, a work has been designed and developed by using different organic acid-rich 
juices to generate bioelectricity.  Bioelectricity is a new term in the field of bio-energy. The technology of 
bioelectricity generation in the form of fuel cells is microbial fuel cells. In this study, we focused on the development 
of a fuel cell to generate electricity from organic acid-rich biomass such as lemon (Citrus Limon), Bilimbi fruit 
(Averrhoa Bilimbi) and Patharkuchi leaf (Bryophyllum Pinnatum) without having any CO2 emission to the 
atmosphere. In this study, we used these organic acids as electrolytes in batteries. The performance of these batteries 
was tested by measuring open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and capacity. We also examined how factors like 
electrode spacing, pH levels, electrolyte concentration, and time influenced the battery’s performance. Finally, the 
idea of an electrolyte flowing system has been designed and implemented to increase the ion's movement and maintain 
the output voltage constant. We have also proposed to implement this idea in industry which will produce power as 
well as reduce the acidity of liquid waste before disposing it to the environment.

output. These improvements may increase the system's efficiency, dependability, and suitability for large-scale 
industrial applications.  
 
6. Conclusion 
This study shows that organic acid-rich juices, such as lemon, bilimbi, starfruit, and patharkuchi leaf juices, can be 
used as electrolytes in lead-acid batteries. Our research found that while the open-circuit voltage stayed mostly the 
same, the short-circuit current decreased as the distance between the electrodes increased because of higher resistance. 
Increasing amount of electrolyte improved the current flow which improve high number of ion movement. However, 
over time the organic electrolytes became less effective as their acidity dropped due to microbial growth. To solve 
this, an electrolyte flow system was added, which improved ion circulation, stabilized the voltage, and slowed down 
discharge, making the battery more efficient and lasting longer. The idea of electrolyte flowing system reduces the 
fast discharge rate and stables the voltage at a certain level. Moreover, this idea can be implemented in industry on a 
greater scale by using improvised techniques which will provide power as well as potentially abandon the 
environmental impact of liquid waste by reducing its acidity. Future work could focus on improving the stability of 
these electrolytes, making the flow system work for larger setups. This study provides a useful step toward cleaner 
and more sustainable energy solutions.

Abstract 
The Loose Parts Detection System (LPDS) is an important safety feature a Power Plant pipeline. It is designed to 
detect and monitor foreign or loose objects within the Primary Coolant Circuit (PCC). These foreign or loose parts, 
whether left over from maintenance or resulting from operational wear and tear, pose significant risks to the Primary 
Circuit integrity. This paper explores a simulation-based approach to assess the reliability and operational 
effectiveness of the LPDS, focusing on its ability to detect potentially damaging loose items in real-time, thereby 
preventing mechanical failures and ensuring safe plant operation. Acoustic sensors in the LPDS track components 
including the pressure vessel, coolant loops, steam generators, and coolant pumps continuously. Early on mechanical 
problems are detected by the system via vibrations and noises produced by free or loose components. We analyze the 
failure rates of important system components (like sensors and amplifiers) and the effect of system redundancies using

Figure 15. The open list statistics window 
 
During the research, we also fine-tuned the event classification process to ensure accuracy. By adjusting thresholds, 
RMS values, and other parameters, the system was able to better differentiate between real anomalies and operational 
noise. Events that didn’t fit into the predefined categories were flagged as ""Unknown"" and stored for further analysis. 
 
5.4 Final Decision and Follow-up Actions 
The final determination of whether an event was caused by a loose part or another issue can only be made after a 
Safety Oversight (SO) inspection of the components. This inspection allows experts to confirm the findings, ensuring 
that the LPDS system accurately detected a real anomaly and not just operational noise. 
 
5.5 Proposed Improvements  
To improve the Loose Parts Detection System (LPDS) at Rooppur Power Plant, several enhancements can be made. 
Upgrading sensors to detect smaller objects and weaker signals will increase sensitivity, while the use of wireless 
sensors can simplify installation and maintenance. Advanced signal processing techniques can help reduce false 
alarms and improve the system’s ability to identify loose parts accurately. On-site data processing can speed up 
detection and response times, while predictive maintenance tools can help identify patterns that signal potential issues, 
allowing for proactive repairs. Testing the system in challenging conditions, such as during sensor failures or high 
background noise, and adding backups can improve its reliability. Additionally, building a signal database of different 
event patterns will enable quicker and more accurate problem detection. In the future, machine learning could be 
integrated to further reduce false alarms and improve the system’s overall performance, making it more efficient and 
dependable. Also enhance safety which will also contribute to the development of more robust systems for the entire 
power industry. 
 
6. Conclusion  
The Loose Parts Detection System (LPDS) plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and smooth operation of the 
Rooppur Power Plant (RPP) by detecting foreign objects within the Primary Coolant Circuit (PCC). Through our 
research, we evaluated the system's performance using detailed simulations. The results showed that the LPDS is 
capable of detecting small objects as light as 0.05 kg and with impact energies as low as 0.68 J, even under difficult 
conditions, such as sensor malfunctions or other partial system failures. Our findings underline the importance of 
advanced acoustic sensors and well-designed system infrastructure for ensuring high detection accuracy and system 
reliability. Even in scenarios where parts of the system may fail, the LPDS remained resilient, continuing to function 
and detect critical anomalies. This research contributes valuable insights to the field of safety by showcasing how 
simulation-based assessments can help improve safety systems like the LPDS. Looking forward, improvements in 
sensor technology, signal processing capabilities, and the integration of predictive maintenance tools will further 
enhance the system’s capabilities. These advancements will help ensure the long-term safety, reliability, and efficiency 
of Rooppur power plant and similar facilities worldwide, ensuring that the LPDS continues to meet the growing 
demands of operational safety.

Abstract 
In an era of heightened environmental volatility and sustainability challenges, blockchain-enabled dynamic 
capabilities and green innovation are emerging as key drivers of resilience for organization. While its effectiveness in 
supply chain management is well acknowledged, empirical studies examining the effects of blockchain-enabled 
dynamic capabilities on organizational resilience have been underrepresented in the existing operation management 
literature. To address this gap, we draw on the dynamic capabilities view of firms to develop and test a model that 
examines how blockchain technology can optimize and integrate organizational capabilities, enabling companies to 
quickly adapt and innovate in response to changing market conditions. Blockchain-enabled Dynamic Capabilities—
facilitated through alignment and integration—empower organizations to adapt and respond swiftly, driving green 
initiatives that enhance their ability to withstand disruptions and maintain stability in uncertain environments. We 
have developed a theoretical framework that explains how the blockchain enabled dynamic capability, under the 
mediating influence of green innovation, helps build organizational resilience for unprecedented crises. In this context, 
environmental dynamism intensifies the impact of green innovation on organizational resilience, highlighting the need 
for adaptable strategies integration that allow firms to thrive amid uncertainty and maintain a competitive edge. We 
tested our theoretical model using a survey of 152 individuals working in the manufacturing industry in Bangladesh. 
Our findings demonstrate that blockchain facilitates greater operational efficiency, fosters sustainability, and improves 
the overall adaptability of firms in volatile environments. Furthermore, this empirical study extends the dynamic 
capability view by demonstrating how blockchain aligns organizational processes to better navigate dynamic contexts. 
From a managerial perspective, the research underscores the potential for blockchain to enhance decision-making, 
streamline operations, and maintain a competitive advantage, offering valuable insights for firms operating in 
uncertain and rapidly changing markets.

1. Introduction
In order to adapt to changes quickly and change their structures as needed, companies are being forced to reevaluate 
their dynamic supply chain capabilities due to the growing uncertainties and complexity of operating in a digital 
environment (Cohen and Kouvelis 2021; Naughton et al. 2020; Queiroz et al.2023; Ivanov 2023). Major crises, such 
as the COVID-19 pandemic, have introduced substantial volatility and disruption to supply chains (Craighead et al.

insights into the long-term impacts of blockchain technology on green innovation and organizational resilience could 
be obtained by performing longitudinal research and extending the model to incorporate elements such as regulatory 
settings or organizational culture. 
 
6. Conclusion  
This study significantly advances our knowledge of how organizational resilience, green innovation, and blockchain 
enabled dynamic capabilities interact. The study's accomplishments show how blockchain-enabled features, 
particularly dynamic alignment and integration, are essential for promoting green innovation. Additionally, the study 
shows that green innovation plays a crucial role in mediating the relationship between organizational resilience and 
blockchain-enabled capabilities, underscoring its revolutionary potential to improve sustainability. The moderating 
effect of environmental dynamism adds a subtle layer to the theoretical framework by highlighting the ways in which 
outside forces might affect these interactions. Its integration of blockchain-enabled capabilities with the dynamic 
capability view to investigate their effects on resilience and sustainability is what makes this research distinctive. The 
study fills important gaps in the literature and provides a thorough framework for further research by introducing and 
confirming the moderating effect of environmental dynamism and the mediating role of green innovation. In practice, 
the results enable institutions and decision-makers to use blockchain technology to accomplish sustainability 
objectives and increase resilience to environmental shocks. The study provides opportunities for scholars to investigate 
the multidisciplinary relationships among sustainability practices, strategic management, and blockchain technology. 
Although the study admits its shortcomings, its conclusions offer a strong basis for developing theory and practice in 
this developing field. For researchers, the study opens avenues for exploring interdisciplinary connections between 
blockchain technology, strategic management, and sustainability practices. While the study acknowledges its 
limitations, its findings provide a solid foundation for advancing theory and practice in this evolving domain. Future 
research could build on these insights to explore additional dimensions and validate the framework across diverse 
industries and regions.

Leather Chemical Industry, Sustainability, Market dynamics, Future prospects 
Introduction 
The leather industry has long been a cornerstone of Bangladesh's economy, and it is known for its high-quality 
products and significant contribution to national exports. A wide range of chemicals, around 250, are used in different 
stages of leather production in the tanning industry such as Sodium Chloride (NaCl), Soda Ash (Na2CO3), Lime 
(Calcium Hydroxide), Sodium Sulphide (Na2S), Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH), Formic Acid (HCOOH), Sulfuric Acid 
(H2SO4), Basic Chromium Sulfate (BCS), Sodium Formate (HCOONa), Soda (NaHCO3), and Amino Resins. To meet 
the chemical demand in the leather tanning industry, the leather chemical industry in Bangladesh has seen significant 
growth over the past few decades, emerging as a critical component of the country's economy. This sector supplies 
essential leather processing chemicals, including tanning, dyeing, and finishing. Historically, this sector has evolved 
from small-scale, traditional practices to a modern, industrialized industry. Moreover, the leather sector is one of the 
largest sources of employment, engaging around 850,000 workers. The growing demand for Bangladeshi leather

5.1 Limitations 
While this study provides valuable insights into the leather chemical industry’s sustainability potential in Bangladesh, 
several limitations must be acknowledged to interpret the findings and understand the study's scope accurately. So, 
below are some of the limitations that need to be addressed in future work: 
 
Sample Size and Representativeness: The sample size of the tanneries, chemical suppliers, and professionals 
was limited; only 20 participants agreed to participate in the interviews. So, this does not represent the broad 
industry. As a result, the findings may not fully reflect the diversity of perspectives or practices across the 
industry. 
 
Reliance on Self-Reported Data: Since a significant portion of the data comes from questionnaires and 
interviews, the responses may be subject to biases, such as social desirability bias or selective reporting, 
potentially skewing the results. 
 
Limited Time Frame: Changes in market dynamics and environmental practices occur over time, and a short 
study duration might not capture long-term trends or the true impact of sustainability efforts on the industry. 
 
External Factors Not Fully Explored: External factors, such as global economic conditions, sudden regulatory 
changes, or shifts in consumer preferences, might influence the adoption of sustainable practices but may not 
have been fully covered in this study. 
5.2    Recommendations  
Here are specific, practical recommendations focusing on actionable steps that the leather chemical industry in 
Bangladesh can take: 
 
Expand Sampling for Future Studies: Encouraging collaboration with industry associations to access a 
broader pool of participants. This could include reaching out to small- and medium-sized tanneries and 
suppliers to gather a more diverse range of insights. This approach will strengthen data accuracy and ensure 
recommendations reflect a broader spectrum of industry perspectives. 
 
Conduct Longitudinal Studies for Comprehensive Insights: Investing in a multi-year study to monitor shifts 
in market dynamics, adoption of eco-friendly chemicals, and environmental impacts over time. Tracking 
these factors long-term will allow for a more thorough understanding of sustainability progress and 
challenges. 
 
Analyze and Integrate External Market Factors Regularly: Creating a task force or designate team members 
to monitor global market conditions, regulatory developments, and consumer trends. Regular reports from 
this task force could help the industry anticipate and adapt to external changes, supporting smoother 
transitions to sustainable practices. 
 
Broaden Focus to Include Additional Sustainability Metrics: Expanding the scope of sustainability initiatives 
to include waste management, water conservation, and energy efficiency. Establish partnerships with 
environmental agencies to implement lifecycle analysis (LCA) assessments that measure the overall impact 
of materials and processes, providing a more holistic view of sustainability efforts. 
 
Promote Training Programs Focused on Eco-Friendly Chemical Adoption: Designing specific training 
sessions for tanneries and chemical suppliers, focusing on the practical aspects of using eco-friendly 
chemicals and managing production costs. Partner with local or international organizations to bring experts 
who can provide hands-on guidance on best practices.

Abstract 
Product quality is a crucial factor in the manufacturing process today, as it determines the company's competitive 
advantages and the consumer's requirements. The problem arises from traditional techniques and quality control 
methods becoming less effective in the current environments, hence the increasing demand for advanced technologies. 
This study aims to design and evaluate the effectiveness of the deep learning (DL) technique in identifying defects in 
die-casting parts. The dataset has been preprocessed, and data augmentation techniques are then employed to mitigate 
the risk of model overfitting and improve generalization capability. Five pretrained DL models—AlexNet, DenseNet, 
EfficientNet, SqueezeNet, and WideResNet—were compared with a proposed custom Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN) model. The evaluation was conducted using performance metrics, including precision, recall, accuracy, and 
F1-score. The proposed custom CNN model achieved the highest accuracy of 98.08%, outperforming all other models, 
with the next best accuracy being 97.70% from the SqueezeNet model. The results show that the proposed DL-based 
approach, especially the custom CNN model, can greatly improve the quality control process and lower the 
manufacturing of faulty goods.

© IEOM Society International 
In addition to quantitative metrics, the proposed CNN model's superiority is further supported by a qualitative 
comparison. For instance, although DenseNet attains moderate accuracy, its visual performance discloses specific 
constraints. DenseNet frequently experiences false positives or false negatives in extreme cases due to its difficulty in 
identifying slight defect patterns. In contrast, the proposed CNN model exhibits robustness in the classification of both 
defective and non-defective parts, as illustrated in Figure 10, where it accurately classifies tiny defects with high 
precision. 
 
6. Conclusion and Future Recommendation 
This research has concentrated on categorizing die-casting components to enhance the quality inspection processes in 
industrial sectors. The primary objective of this study was to design and develop a deep learning model that can 
accurately classify defects in casting products. The ultimate goal was to enhance manufacturing processes and reduce 
the number of defective outputs. We attempted to improve the generalization capability and robustness of the 
overfitting of the models by diversifying the dataset and enhancing image quality through augmentation techniques. 
Additionally, the dataset enabled a thorough comparison of the performance of five distinct DL models. Our custom 
CNN model was the most successful model, demonstrating 98.08% accuracy. This shows the proposed CNN model's 
ability to classify casting products accurately. The manufacturing industry is significantly impacted by the results of 
this research, particularly in the context of die-casting part classification. Manufacturers can improve consumer 
satisfaction and brand reputation by reducing the occurrence of faulty products, enhancing their quality inspection 
processes, and leveraging DL models. Future research could investigate the inclusion of fusion models, which combine 
multiple deep-learning architectures to improve defect detection accuracy. Additionally, to test the robustness of these 
methods under adverse environmental conditions, diverse datasets employing techniques like (Islam et al., 2024) can 
be involved to validate the performance of these models in real-life scenarios. These models can potentially deliver 
more reliable and robust classification outcomes in die-casting applications by capitalizing on the strengths of more 
diverse data.

Abstract 
This paper thoroughly examines current methodologies and algorithms used to analyze electroencephalography (EEG) 
data to detect fatigue driving states. First, traditional procedures are examined, uncovering their time-consuming 
nature and elevated rates of mistakes. Different methods include collecting and preparing EEG data from the forehead. 
This paper examines traditional methods that include prolonged operation durations and the use of various frequency 
or time domain methods that apply non-machine learning algorithms. A new model is proposed in this paper, using 
machine learning methods with specific classifiers, especially K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF). 
The proposed model has excellent precision, as both classifiers attain impressive accuracy. The research also evaluates 
the model’s performance by using ROC curves, various performance matrices, and k-fold validation techniques for 
binary classification, demonstrating encouraging results. Future research will focus on using deep learning techniques, 
namely leveraging Deep Neural Networks, to improve the processing of EEG signals.

Abstract 
In the last couple of years, unsupervised machine learning has emerged as a strong tool for the analysis of complex 
patterns and relationships in data. Its application in the assessment of anthropometric characteristics and biological 
maturity is of great value for gaining insight into athlete development and performance. The present study intended to 
characterize the body composition, morphology and maturity status of young athletes; classify them according to 
anthropometric measurements; and predict their adult stature. The sample included 138 male athletes of varying 
regional settings in Bangladesh, all of whom were aged between 12 and 14 years. The anthropometric measurements 
used are those prescribed by ISAK. Key variables involved were body mass, stature, girths, and skinfold thickness. 
PAM clustering was used to identify patterns; morphological variable associations with maturity status were 
determined using statistical methods. Results identified two clear clusters, where Cluster 1 was dominated by late-
maturing athletes and Cluster 2 was comprised of averagely matured athletes. Cluster 2 athletes were more physically 
robust, higher in body mass, and more advanced in maturity, hence having greater athletic potential. These findings 
constitute an effective contribution to the identification of talented athletes and specific intervention strategies for 
supporting athletic development in Bangladesh.

1. Introduction
At the core of sports science, kinanthropometry is a fundamental subject in which detailed measurements are made to 
deduce an intricate relationship between human movement, anatomy, and health. Kinanthropometry is derived from 
the Greek roots ""kine,"" or movement; ""anthropos,"" or men; and ""metron,"" meaning measure (Bonilla et al., 2021). 
Kinanthropometry offers a systematic means by which to assess a host of attributes, including body composition, 
nutritional status, and morphological characteristics. Besides international sports federations, some notable examples 
of kinanthropometric adaption are seen in the International Olympic Committee, the American College of Sports 
Medicine, and the National Strength and Conditioning Association. Kinanthropometry has become indispensable in

lead to increased time and effort during operation. Additionally, many existing solutions are expensive, bulky, or 
unsuitable for small-scale workshops, leaving a gap in the market for versatile, cost-effective alternatives. To address 
these challenges, we present the design and development of a Multipurpose Wood Processing Machine, an innovative 
solution that integrates cutting, drilling, and grinding functionalities into a single device. This product aims to provide 
a convenient and efficient solution for woodworking tasks, integrating multiple cutting functions into a single device. 
By combining drilling, sawing, and grinding capabilities, the machine saves time and effort, streamlining the 
woodworking process. It optimizes space in workshops by eliminating the need for separate tools for each task. The 
versatility of the machine caters to a wide range of woodworking projects, making it cost-effective by reducing the 
need for multiple specialized tools. With user-friendliness in mind, the machine simplifies the learning curve and 
allows both beginners and experienced users to engage in woodworking projects with ease. Integration of advanced

5.3 Proposed Improvements  
The initial development and testing of the Multipurpose Wood Processing Machine revealed several opportunities for 
enhancements, both in performance and usability. The following improvements are proposed to refine the machine's 
functionality and increase its appeal to the target market: 
 
5.3.1 Enhanced Performance Metrics 
To ensure optimal performance, further analysis could focus on motor efficiency under different operational loads, 
providing insights into power consumption patterns. Additionally, vibration and noise levels during simultaneous 
cutting, drilling, and grinding operations could be measured to enhance operational stability. Improving the gear and 
pulley system may also reduce power transmission losses and increase overall speed, contributing to smoother 
functionality. 
Durability remains a critical aspect, necessitating long-term fatigue testing of components such as shafts and bearings. 
Understanding wear rates of the grinding wheel and cutting blades would provide valuable data for predicting 
replacement cycles, ensuring consistent operation over time. 
 
5.3.2 Expanded Graphical Results 
Detailed Finite Element Analysis (FEA) could further illustrate the stress distributions across critical machine 
components, such as frames and pulleys. Graphical plots, including deformation and equivalent stress analyses, would 
provide visual insights into the machine's structural integrity under various loading conditions. 
Feedback from customer surveys could also be more effectively presented through additional visualizations, such as 
pie charts and bar graphs, to highlight user preferences regarding ease of use, portability, and cost considerations. 
 
5.3.3 Safety and Ergonomics 
Safety features could be expanded by integrating an overload protection system that halts operations in case of motor 
strain. The user interface might benefit from a digital control panel, allowing users to monitor operations, adjust speed, 
and receive real-time notifications about errors. Enhanced blade guards made of transparent, durable materials would 
further improve both safety and visibility during operation. 
 
5.3.4 Modular Attachments 
To increase the versatility of the machine, optional attachments for specialized tasks such as sanding and polishing 
could be designed. An extendable workbench tailored to fit the machine would address workspace constraints 
commonly faced by small-scale workshops.

Abstract 
Energy consumption in commercial and residential buildings worldwide accounts for about one-third of the 
world’s energy and one-quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. If current trends continue, by 2025, buildings 
worldwide will be the largest consumers of global energy, using as much power as the transportation and industrial 
sectors combined. Recent studies have found that improving energy efficiency in buildings is the least costly way 
to reduce a large quantity of carbon emissions. By changing energy management practices and instituting 
technologies that enhance energy efficiency, building owners and managers can reduce energy consumption by 
up to 35%. However, energy efficiency efforts in buildings alone cannot address future demand for more energy 
by this sector. In order to achieve breakthrough solutions to this problem, it is evident that a coordinated effort in 
whole-building systems approach that emphasizes the necessity of integrating renewable on-site or distributed 
generation and energy efficiency is required to design the buildings of the future. Several International Energy 
Agency (IEA) countries have adopted a vision of so-called ‘net zero energy buildings’ (NetZEBs) as long-term 
goal of their energy policies. This NetZEB is very new in Bangladesh and it starts building green buildings which 
will lead to NetZEB in recent future. However, Bangladesh have to comply with IEA and must accept zero energy 
building concept.  
Keywords 
NetZEBs, Carbon Emission, Energy Consumption, Global Energy 
1. Introduction
According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the building sector consumed more than 20% of the 
delivered energy worldwide in 2015, and this proportion will remain the same in 2040 (Welcome  2024). 
Meanwhile, building-related emissions have increased by 45% since 1990 (Clearvue  2024). In the United States, 
the building sector consumes more energy than any other sector — about 39 % of the country’s total primary 
energy use in 2017 (Department  2024). However, these significant proportions of energy consumption and 
emissions harbor great potential to contribute to energy conservation and carbon emission reduction. Therefore, 
improving building energy efficiency and lowering the associated carbon emissions is a key strategy for 
addressing global issues such as energy consumption reduction, mitigating climate change, and reducing the 
carbon footprint of human activities. 
Recently, net-zero energy buildings (NZEBs) have gained increased popularity in the building industry in many 
countries as a promising solution to reduce building energy consumption. The concept of self-sufficient and

Case studies across diverse climates affirm that Net ZEBs are not merely aspirational but achievable. By 
leveraging advanced modeling, simulations, and meticulous planning, Net ZEBs can redefine sustainable 
development. The future lies in harmonizing innovative technologies, integrated designs, and community-scale 
solutions, driving us toward a resilient, energy-efficient world. 
 
8. Conclusion 
In conclusion, our Zero Energy Project has determined that solar energy stands as the most effective and 
sustainable solution for energy savings and cost efficiency. After thorough research and collaboration, we 
unanimously agreed that photovoltaic (PV) solar panels are the optimal choice for electricity generation. While 
the upfront installation costs may be significant, the long-term savings on energy bills make this investment not 
only economically viable but also environmentally responsible.  
In an era of dwindling natural resources, this approach offers a self-sustaining, energy-efficient, and eco-friendly 
pathway to achieving a truly Zero Energy building. Strategically placing the solar panels on the south-facing 
backside of the building maximizes sunlight absorption, ensuring peak performance and efficiency.  
As Bangladesh advances in integrating solar panels, promoting natural sunlight for lighting, and adopting solar 
heating systems to reduce dependency on air conditioning, the country is paving the way for sustainable 
development. We recommend that, in addition to BNBC guidelines, Bangladesh formulates a comprehensive 
master plan and enforces robust policies for Net Zero Energy Buildings (NetZEBs). These efforts would not only 
enhance energy security but also play a pivotal role in reducing carbon emissions, creating a brighter and more 
sustainable future for our planet.

Abstract 
Road safety has been an issue in Bangladesh, with low safety standards, high rates of accidents, lack of proper 
infrastructure, poor enforcement, and rapid urbanization. Road designs and traffic management in some areas have 
become poor and should consequently make accidents more frequent. In this paper I discuss challenges and I offer 
some policy advice.The aim of this study is to investigate the regional, seasonal, and infrastructural trends of road 
traffic accidents in Bangladesh and to assess the efficacy of the preventive measures. In final, the study will be closed 
with indentifying the contributive factors which cause accidents and corresponding policy measures.This study 
analyzes road traffic accident data from 2015-2023, examining trends, regional disparities, and infrastructure factors. 
It evaluates the effectiveness of safety measures and proposes policy recommendations based on findings.The research 
on road accident trends in Bangladesh indicates an average of 117 accidents per month, totaling 1,404 accidents, 276 
fatalities, and 1,140 injuries. The data presents large discrepancies in severity related to time, location, and conditions; 
the highest rates were found in urban areas such as Dhaka and Chittagong. This finding raises the need to improve the 
infrastructure of the roads, imposition of traffic laws, public awareness, and driver assistance systems for safer 
travel.Abstract Road traffic accidents (RTAs) are currently recognized as a global crisis, and this study aims to 
determine the key factors contributing to RTAs in Bangladesh and to strengthen evidence-based policy 
recommendations.

Abstract 
The 4th Industrial revolution is the newest advancement in the global industrial sector, which denotes revolutionary 
shifts in various sectors like manufacturing and service. Customers' individualized needs are a clear indicator of the 
current state of market instability. Thus, industrial manufacturing systems must be able to adjust to variables like 
scalability, variety, agility, responsiveness of the system, interconnectivity, data exchange automatically between 
manufacturing systems, transparency, and human-machine interaction. Since these elements and tenets form the 
foundation of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), embracing it is indispensable to the long-term sustainability of the global economy. 
Despite the necessity of implementing I4.0, there is a lack of research on the difficulties that may arise, especially in 
the heavy duty flooring solution sector in a developing country like Bangladesh. This study attempts to pinpoint the 
obstacles to I4.0 technology adoption in Bangladesh's heavy duty flooring solution sector. To achieve these goals, 
Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) has been utilized. Using actual data from a field 
survey, a numerical illustration has been presented. After the model's validation, checking its robustness, and ranking 
stability, the best strategy for adopting the I4.0 concept in heavy duty flooring solution industries in Bangladesh is 
selected.

1. Introduction
The pace at which technological growth is taking place has provided room for growth and improvement of the fourth 
industrial revolution, or ""industry 4.0"" (I4.0), is defined by the incorporation of digital technologies into many facets 
of industry and production. This technology encompasses several key components among them Cyber-physical system 
(CPS) is I4.0's foundational technology (Florescu and Barabas 2020). They enables production systems to be flexible 
and adaptable, enabling the mass manufacture of highly customized goods (Nascimento et al., 2019). The CPS, in 
fact, bridges the physical and virtual worlds by connecting organizations, corporeal goals, human performers, 
equipment, and methods across corporate boundaries through IoT communication. They achieve this by transmitting 
data in real-time for decentralized decision-making processes (Trappey et al. 2017).

Abstract: 
In recent years, the FIBC (Flexible Intermediate Bulk Container) industry has increasingly turned to lean 
manufacturing principles to enhance operational efficiency. FIBC manufacturing, like garment production, is a well-
established system that involves a complex array of essential processes. Key performance indicators in the FIBC 
industry include lead times, production output, waste reduction, and labor efficiency. To stay competitive globally, 
FIBC manufacturers prioritize reducing lead times and minimizing waste, both of which are crucial for boosting 
productivity and achieving sustainable development. This drive towards lean and responsive manufacturing has 
intensified the need for advanced tools and techniques to identify and address inefficiencies within production. This 
study explores the application of lean manufacturing tools in the Flexible Intermediate Bulk Container (FIBC) industry 
to improve productivity and reduce waste. As the industry faces increased global competition, FIBC manufacturers 
are under pressure to optimize lead times and eliminate inefficiencies to stay competitive. In particular, manufacturers 
are implementing lean methodologies such as Value Stream Mapping, Root Cause Analysis (RCA) to reduce rework 
rates, Kanban, standard minute value (SMV) and efficient methodologies to meet the expectations of a competitive 
market. This paper shows a case study of an FIBC company where lean tools are used systematically to identify and 
mitigate sources of waste throughout its production process. Initial results show that lean tools can lead to significant 
improvements in production rate, lower lead times, and enhanced operational stability.

Abstract 
Bangladesh has made remarkable achievements over the past decades in developing the healthcare sector despite many 
hurdles and financial constraints. However, the healthcare sector is gradually falling behind in terms of better service 
due to inefficiency and medical errors. This study presents how Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, 
Control) can be systematically used to eradicate inefficiencies and medical errors. The study begins with a brief 
introduction about the health industry of the Bangladesh and how far it has progressed with the current timeline. 
Bangladesh has been striving to develop their health industry but high expenditure, medical errors and inequality in 
service are some of the key obstacles that is hindering the growth of health industry. To overcome the obstacles, Lean 
Six Sigma DMAIC, a data driven optimization tool, is used. Hospital inefficiency, medical errors, lack of better service, 
outdated medical instruments and medicine quality require sufficient improvement. The study is done qualitatively as 
well as quantitatively and the data are collected through questionnaires from 60 patients in Ruma, Chokoria, Chittagong. 
Lack of better doctors, outdated surgical instruments, medical errors and unsatisfactory health services are focused. The 
suggested optimization tool tackles these issues through a structured approach in five phases namely, Define, Measure, 
Analyze, Improve and Control. This allows the health industry to locate the pain points effectively and reduce variation 
in products or services. Collaboration between the hospital management, doctors, medical equipment manufacturing 
companies and health service providers is essential in ensuring sustainable growth and continuous improvement.

1. Introduction
Over the last 42 years since independence Bangladesh has made lot of strides in the health sector (R Hossain 2015). The 
establishment of hospitals, clinics, diagnostic centers, clinical trials, outsourcing, telemedicine and also modern medical 
devices and equipment contributed to this huge growth. Committed to providing better healthcare, the Government of 
Bangladesh increased the budget in its healthcare sector. However recent data presents a growing expenditure in health 
and inequality in service. The lack of skilled health workers combined with poor distribution of the doctors throughout 
the whole country is a major issue. Diseases such as diarrhea, tuberculosis, respiratory infections, heart diseases, 
unplanned urbanization, dengue and many more are prevalent in many parts of Bangladesh. In short, Bangladesh 
healthcare needs improvement in various areas. Although many awareness programs are being arranged by the NGOs 
regarding health issues, it needs to spread out into rural communities as well. Cost of medicines needs to be reviewed as 
many patients are unable to purchase medicine due to poverty. Better doctors are required in minor cities and towns to 
reduce the hassle of going to big cities for better medication for minor issues. Regulatory compliance in pharmaceutical 
processes is critical to ensure the safety, efficacy, and quality of pharmaceutical products (Wei and Nurhaliza, 2024). 
This research paper presents a systematic review of how Six Sigma DMAIC framework can be used to improve 
Bangladesh's Healthcare Sector through a five-step approach. DMAIC means Defining the problem, Measuring the

3. Local equipment and manufacturing companies for surgical instruments increased their production to eliminate 
equipment shortage. 
4. Location wise dedicated maintenance team has been stationed to oversee preventive, corrective and predictive 
maintenance. 
5. Surgical instruments undergo steam sterilization before being used for surgery. 
6. Augmented reality coupled with Artificial Intelligence is being implemented to provide real time analysis and assist 
in decision making while performing surgery. 
 
3.5  Control phase: 
The control phase serves to sustain the creative solutions found after a lot of qualitative and quantitative analysis so that 
the errors no longer persist. Since surgery is an intricate medical procedure, hence ensuring minimum error is paramount. 
If not controlled, then the possibility of further surgical error will only add up which can result in far worse conditions 
than before. Key initiatives to ensure the solutions bring surgical errors to minimum are as follows. 
a. Revising the medical policy to ensure strict adherence to surgical guidelines. 
b. Ensure regular training of medical staff, nurses as well as surgeons. 
c. Establish a culture of safety. 
d. Promoting the use of checklists to ensure appropriate surgical tools are being used. 
 
4. Discussion 
The remedial action taken against minimizing surgical errors proved to be valuable in curbing the amount of surgical 
errors and improved the overall process. The improved result significantly boosted the hospital morale and retained the 
trust of the patients undergoing surgery. The addition of augmented reality and AI assisted the surgeons in performing 
surgery without excessive stress thus reducing the number of wrong surgeries. Furthermore, the wide availability of 
sterilized surgical tools and related equipment made the operation smoother hence, increasing customer satisfaction. 
 
The overall Six Sigma DMAIC process continues to be beneficial in reducing the number of defects and errors related 
to surgery in a systematic way. Enhanced communication between the employees, increased customer and employee 
satisfactions, positive attitude in the workplace, uplifted morale of the employees etc. are some of the benefits gained by 
the hospitals. This systematic approach not only helped the hospitals regain the customer’s trust but also reduce the 
amount of surgical and other related errors, increase productivity, optimize the overall surgical process and reduce 
operational cost.

5. Conclusion 
In this evolving and challenging era, new issues are constantly on the rise for which new tools and techniques are 
continually developed. Various improvement tools are frequently used such as PDCA cycle, Kanban system, Value 
stream mapping, Six Sigma, Process mapping, Pareto chart and many more. In this research paper, the importance and 
application of Six Sigma DMAIC has been presented along with a case study where the Six Sigma DMAIC framework 
has been used systematically to reduce the amount and types of surgical errors in hospitals located in Ruma, Chokoria, 
Chittagong. 
 
Previously, surgical error such as retained faulty equipment and technical error rose to as high as 25% and 33.33% 
respectively, creating a negative impression for the company as well as the quality of the service. To overcome the 
problem, the DMAIC framework has been initiated to systematically locate the key problems and resolve them. After 
implementation, the faulty equipment and technical error reduced to staggering 6% and 10% respectively, achieving a

huge milestone for the medical administration as well as improving customer satisfaction. Considering the overall 
positive impact of the Six Sigma DMAIC framework on improving the surgical procedures, the hospital management in 
Ruma came to a conclusion that the DMAIC framework truly helped in reducing medical and surgical errors as well as 
fostering a positive relationship with the customers. The present study has certain limitations and is mainly designed for 
a specific industry’s specific process. The opportunities are limitless with this improvement tool and can be applied to 
different manufacturing industries, food and beverage industries and smartphone factories as well. Further research can 
be conducted on how the DMAIC framework can be implemented in the context of the Kanban system.

Abstract 
In Bangladesh, hospitals do not offer any blood providing service to patients. Hence, patients are required to arrange 
the required blood by themselves. As a result, many critical patients die because of not arranging the blood at the right 
time. One of the plausible solutions could be that hospitals can provide the necessary amount of blood for their patients. 
This paper aims to explore how hospitals in Bangladesh could design a blood supply chain systems to efficiently 
manage the blood providing service for their patients. Data was collected from three top ranked government hospitals 
in Dhaka city. Based on the collected data, the inventory size, safety stock and reorder point for different types of 
blood for these hospitals were calculated. Hospitals can maintain an inventory of blood according to their forecasted 
demand, provide the blood directly to patients. The inventory could be replenished by taking different strategies, such 
as at a periodic interval or lot-for-lot.  Additionally, a framework is proposed to manage the blood supply chain for 
hospitals incorporating digitalization aspects, that includes when and how to collect blood from donors in an efficient 
way, and sharing of blood among hospitals to tackle uncertainties. In a larger scale, all hospitals in Dhaka city could 
be connected in a web-based system to share the real time information about their inventory status. Different volunteer 
organizations could be included in the web-based system so that they can collect the required amount of blood from 
universities and corporate areas. Finally, several barriers to implementing such a system on a larger scale are reported. 
It is expected that adopting such initiative will improve the healthcare service provided by hospitals in Bangladesh, 
and eliminate the death caused by lack of blood supply in emergency situations.

1. Introduction
Hospital is not an exception to various industries which Blockchain technology is transforming. The potential of 
storing, managing and securely sharing data across decentralized networks in a way that improves operations in the 
healthcare  is high especially in  managing patient data, ensuring supply chain transparency, and improving data 
interoperability (Balasubramanian et al. 2021). Increasing demographics, costs and the like diseases such as diabetes 
and cancer pose increased challenges to healthcare organizations. Such challenges demand creative answers that meet 
the high standard of quality care with delivering them at a cost effective price. There is a need for a new strategic 
approach to address accessibility of healthcare services of different populations and corresponding disparities across 
socioeconomic strata and geographic locations (Nicolai et al. 2023). As a promising tool, blockchain technology is 
able to strengthen the security, transparency and efficiency of various healthcare operations, including management 
of patient data, supply chain transparency and data interoperability (Sanda et al. 2022)

4. Results and Discussion: 
Bangladeshi hospitals today face challenges related to data management inefficiencies, outdated infrastructure, 
evolving customers’ expectations. In this manner, these challenges underscore the requirement for creative answers 
like blockchain technology to improve data transparency, improve security, and help improve the conveyance of 
healthcare service delivery. The model provides structured evaluation of blockchain practices in healthcare, using 
fuzzy logic based inputs to assess blockchain readiness level across three hospitals. In Table 1, the assessments model 
was developed through the identification of blockchain enablers, criteria and attributes which were related specifically 
to healthcare sector. Successful blockchain implementation needs to integrate technology, manage patient data, ensure 
data security, and hold managerial accountability. We assessed performance and importance ratings using expert 
inputs with the centroid method via fuzzy logic. Surveys and interviews from experts such as hospital managers and 
IT professionals were used from whom we got insights. The numerical values measuring the Blockchain Practices 
Readiness Index (BPRI) were obtained by transforming linguistic terms and fuzzy membership functions into 
numerical values. Hospital A  were categorised as “close to ready” with BPRI values of (2.77; 4.35; 6.07) which mean 
that Hospital A have a moderate readiness level for blockchain adoption, but do not have infrastructure and resource 
allocation ready enough to adopt blockchain yet.  
 
Among the weaknesses detected commonly to the hospitals are server readiness, Employees' readiness to embrace 
blockchain technology and Collaborative Culture. The Blockchain Practices Importance Index (BPII) was to identify 
these weakness, including barriers like investments in technological infrastructure or data security measures. Hospitals 
need to work on upgrading their IT systems, whereby educating their staff on blockchain technologies and getting 
leadership support for the new technological implementation to improve readiness. This study finds a comprehensive 
roadmap for leading healthcare administrators who are trying to improve their readiness to blockchain, enhance data 
security and ultimately improve healthcare outcome. When we compare our current readiness assessment results with 
those from other sectors (Anzum & Kibria  2024). we look for similar barriers: resistance for technological changes 
and lack of training are different industry's blockages for mobile software adoption. Once addressed, these challenges 
will pave way to the hospital’s migration to blockchain based systems, improve the management of hospital 
operations, and patient data. 
 
5. Conclusions and Agenda for Future Research 
The purpose of this study is to examine the state of readiness of the healthcare institutions in Bangladesh for adopting 
blockchain practices which intend to improve data transparency, security and will be much more efficient. Based on 
the results of Readiness Level Assessment for Blockchain Practices in the Healthcare Sector, the research reveals 
hospitals in various readiness levels and identifies their weaknesses and required improvements. A major finding is 
1494","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,  
© IEOM Society International 
 
that hospital administrators need to pay more attention to the gaps in technological infrastructure and employee 
training, as well as leadership support, if the blockchain is to be implemented successfully. The study emphasizes the 
same importance of knowledge sharing about blockchain technology, developing the clarity of communication 
channels among the parties involved and the constant appraisal and improving of the adoption process. Hospitals must 
invest in ensuring IT systems are able to work, and also work to create a culture where technological change is 
supported. This study is limited, however, in scope, to considerations of a single country and thus restricts the 
applicability of findings to a broader context. Finally, the sample size of only a small number of hospitals may prevent 
the generalizability of results and self reported data may subject the study to biases. Additionally, a study of blockchain 
readiness provides a snapshot of readiness without measuring progress over time and regional characteristics that 
potentially affect an organization’s level of blockchain readiness were not correctly considered. Even with these 
caveats, this research presents useful lessons about sizing the blockchain constraints, the challenges and opportunities 
in setting up a blockchain network, and the challenges of determining who the intended users, participants, and 
auditors of the blockchain should be. More future research is needed to expand across different healthcare settings, 
correlate the ranking of readiness attributes, and compare with the findings of different regions. This understanding 
of blockchain readiness will be deepened by longitudinal studies and a more inclusive stakeholder engagement, and 
how to effectively implement blockchain will be practicalized.

Abstract 
The healthcare supply chain has many challenges that prevent access to critical medical supplies, particularly in a 
crisis and global uncertainty. The most significant risks must be identified and prioritized to cope with the healthcare 
supply chain management. This study applies integrated multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method to identify 
and prioritize critical risks in healthcare supply chain management based on literature review and the healthcare 
specialists’ feedback and advice. Among multiple risk factors, ten major risk factors were identified using a Fuzzy-
Delphi method. Subsequently, a Fuzzy-TOPSIS approach was used to prioritize these risks, providing a structured and 
robust decision-making process. The results indicate that Supply Chain Disruptions, demand uncertainty, Pandemic 
Crisis are the most important risks. The paper focuses on identifying and prioritizing key risks but does not extend to 
specific mitigation measures. Analyzing the most sensitive risk factors, this study helps to strengthen the risk 
management techniques, hence leading to enhanced resilience of healthcare delivery systems. The results offer 
practical implications for healthcare organizations to avoid and mitigate various risks that affect the sustainable and 
resilient supply chain. These findings can help policymakers and healthcare leaders deepen their understanding of risk 
environments to improve risk management and supply chain efficiencies, and ultimately ensure better patient care 
outcomes for the region, as well as globally.

1. Introduction
Healthcare Supply Chain Management (HSCM) is crucial for ensuring the smooth and efficient delivery of medical 
supplies, equipment, and services essential for patient care. Effective HSCM plays a vital role in improving the quality 
of healthcare, reducing operational costs, and ensuring timely access to necessary resources. However, the healthcare 
supply chain is susceptible to a wide range of risks. These risks have become even more evident in the wake of global 
crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposed significant vulnerabilities in healthcare supply chains 
worldwide. This research focuses on identifying and prioritizing the key risk factors in HSCM. There are still 
significant research gaps, particularly in the context of developing countries like Bangladesh, where the healthcare 
supply chain faces unique challenges such as resource limitations, regulatory issues, and supply chain disruptions 
(Kavaler & Spiegel 2003). This study aims to address these gaps by identifying and prioritizing the critical risk factors 
in HSCM, using an integrated Fuzzy-Delphi and Fuzzy-TOPSIS methodology. The findings are expected to contribute 
to the development of strategies for mitigating risks and improving supply chain resilience, thus supporting the overall 
sustainability and efficiency of healthcare services in Bangladesh.

4. Discussion 
The healthcare supply chain encounters various Risks that critically influence its effectiveness, resilience, and 
sustainability. Supply Chain Disruptions (CCi = 0.195) emerge as the most significant issue, driven by factors such as 
natural disasters, geopolitical instability, and transportation breakdowns, which halt the movement of critical resources 
and delay essential deliveries. Effective risk management, such as alternative sourcing and contingency planning, is 
essential to mitigate these disruptions. Demand Uncertainty (CCi = 0.168) ranks second, reflecting the difficulty of 
accurately forecasting fluctuating patient needs, particularly during emergencies like pandemics. This often leads to 
overstocking or shortages, highlighting the importance of advanced demand forecasting systems and flexible inventory 
management. Cybersecurity Risks (CCi = 0.166) rank third, emphasizing the increasing threat of cyberattacks 
targeting healthcare infrastructure. These attacks compromise data integrity and disrupt operations, underscoring the 
need for robust IT security measures. Natural Disasters (CCi = 0.151) and Logistical Challenges (CCi = 0.150) rank 
fourth and fifth, respectively, as earthquakes, floods, and poor logistics planning can damage infrastructure, delay 
shipments, and reduce supply chain reliability. Other critical issues include Counterfeit Products (CCi = 0.145) and 
Human Resource Shortages (CCi = 0.145), where inadequate workforce training and the infiltration of fake medical 
supplies compromise patient safety and supply chain efficiency. Transportation Failures (CCi = 0.141) and Inventory 
Management Inefficiencies (CCi = 0.137) also contribute significantly, causing delays and stock mismanagement. 
Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive strategies, including investment in resilient infrastructure, 
enhanced workforce development, stringent quality controls, and adoption of advanced technologies like AI-driven 
logistics and blockchain for traceability. Tackling these issues holistically will ensure a more robust and sustainable 
healthcare supply chain capable of meeting future demands. 
 
4.0 Conclusion 
This ranking of healthcare supply chain challenges underscores the multifaceted nature of risks that affect supply 
chain performance. While some factors like demand uncertainty, pandemics, and cybersecurity risks top the list due 
to their potential for widespread disruption, others such as logistical inefficiencies, regulatory hurdles, and human 
resource shortages also play a significant role in undermining supply chain stability. To build resilient healthcare 
supply chains, it is crucial for stakeholders to prioritize risk mitigation strategies based on the severity and likelihood 
of these challenges, ensuring timely responses to emerging risks. Moreover, the research's focus on the healthcare 
1508","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management,

supply chain may restrict the applicability of the findings to other sectors, potentially limiting their broader relevance. 
Additionally, the study's reliance on expert opinions may introduce biases based on the participants' backgrounds and 
perspectives. The analysis of challenges in healthcare supply chain management reveals significant complexities that 
organizations face in their pursuit of sustainability. Through a thorough process involving the Fuzzy Delphi technique 
for identifying key risk factors and the Fuzzy TOPSIS method for prioritization, 10 major risk factors were 
pinpointed. Among these, ""inaccurate forecasts"" was identified as the most critical risk factor, highlighting the need 
for reliable prediction models to support effective inventory management and operational efficiency. Errors in 
forecasting can lead to stock shortages or overstock situations, affecting patient care and operational costs.On the other 
hand, ""limited access to market information"" was found to have the least impact, suggesting that healthcare 
organizations in Bangladesh generally have adequate access to market data. This insight indicates that efforts should 
be directed towards improving forecasting accuracy and addressing other significant risks.The Fuzzy TOPSIS 
approach provides a clear prioritization of these risks, guiding healthcare organizations in focusing their resources on 
mitigating the most pressing challenges. By concentrating on the most significant risks, organizations can enhance 
their resilience and sustainability in the healthcare supply chain.

Abstract 
Geothermal energy may provide a dependable and sustainable answer to Bangladesh's increasing energy needs while 
mitigating the effects of climate change. This research emphasizes base-load supply, power output, and environmental 
advantages and explores Bangladesh's potential for geothermal energy development. A 200 MW project has already 
been approved in Thakurgaon and Habiganj. Titas, Shabajpur, and Thakurgaon are potential geothermal hotspots. In 
light of Bangladesh's distinct geological circumstances, the research examines the viability of geothermal power-
generating methods such as binary cycles, flash steam, and dry steam. Additionally covered is the potential for 
enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) to have a lower environmental effect and greater efficacy.   Geothermal energy 
can be critical in diversifying Bangladesh's energy mix, ensuring energy security, and supporting decarbonization 
efforts. However, careful management of environmental and social impacts is essential to fully harness geothermal 
energy’s potential. This study provides a foundation for future research and policy development to optimize 
geothermal energy utilization in Bangladesh.

been used to detect patterns, trends and seasonal influences in order to generate accurate short-term forecasts. Data 
has been collected monthly, ranging from July to June of each corresponding year. Data processing involved zero-
value occurrences, time-series decomposition and performed tests of stationarity. SARIMA with Exogenous Model, 
ARIMA Model for VIX Index on overridden series have been developed and, forecast performance was evaluated. 
Moreover, prediction range by specifying confidence interval levels has been prepared. It is found a strong monthly 
seasonal effect of production, with peaks in the first quarter and minimum values in July-August compatible with ideal 
rain conditions. The start of a slight upward trend in overall production indicated slow sector expansion. The SARIMA 
model selected had an average forecast accuracy of MAPE=34.84% and RMSE=16,349 MT. The ambiguity reinforces 
the nuanced set of variables which determine if heavy industries like Steel re-rolling mills in Bangladesh are allowed 
to produce.

1. Introduction
Mechanized industry is an indispensable part of the economic development of Bangladesh; this sector providing job 
for a maximum number of people and manufacturing productivity. Accurate demand forecasting is essential to enable 
proper distribution and production planning which in turn helps the policymakers a great deal for making strategic 
decisions as Bangladesh has been on progress path into becoming a middle-income country. In heavy industries-proper 
such as steel, cement and large-scale manufacturing, Bangladesh witnessed a considerable advance in the later years. 
But agriculture has its own obstacles-like seasonal production, infrastructure constraints, and financial instability. 
There lies the importance of developing a state-of-the-art forecasting technique that is custom-made to the industrial 
context in Bangladesh. 
The forecasting of demand is a pivotal activity to drive strategic planning and operational efficiency in Heavy 
Industries like steel Steel re-rolling mills across the globe. Heavy industry is a capital-intense and therefore mainly 
cost-oriented business, accurate demand forecasting plays a critical role in effective supply chain management. (S 
Chopra  2007). Hossain et al (context of developing countries) Heavy industry-specific challenges in Bangladesh such 
as infrastructure constraints, the seasonality of production due to electricity outage limitations, and economic 
variations (Hossain 2017). This has implications for the necessity of stronger forecasting tools for emerging 
economies. The process of predicting the demand in the pharma vertical would have many dimensions, which can 
only be drawn considering a detailed study on data market dynamics, regulation, and emerging Tech. Using the 
demand forecasting model, it is possible to reduce the costs of purchasing and storage of medicines. (Praphan Yawara,

(c) QQ plots on residuals, and (d) ACF of residuals 
 
The implications for industry are several based on these findings. The interplay between the seasonality in demand, 
supply, and operational characteristics means that preparation is critical, this can include aggressive maintenance 
during downtime windows, inventory stocking ahead of prompt months, and changes to workforce scheduling. While 
growth planning appears strong, the relatively low pace indicates areas for strategic investment and policy instruments 
aimed at speeding up sector development. That is why far-sighted risk management – flex production, multi-sources, 
agile inventory systems powered by smart technology that can instantly read demand signals enter the equation with 
wide confidence bands. Although data-driven decision-making performs well, there remains room for better forecasts 
with advanced techniques and models, resulting in a higher number of data points. Last, aspects like economic 
environment/dynamics of the policy/location market/forces/shock/cats in the area can be introduced that were not well 
captured statistically, so you supplemented a forecast or models going into considerations for doing something beyond 
just models. The industry leaders and policymakers will need to weigh these factors.  
 
6. Conclusion 
In this study, a SARIMA model was introduced to predict the demand for finished product in heavy industries of 
Bangladesh like steel re-rolling mill. Analytics showed seasonality by year; Q1 peaks and July-August production 
dips were prominent. This is likely the monsoon season and shows how the weather impacts factory production in 
Bangladesh. While there were signs of some movement generally up in production, this was more suggestive of a mild 
growth scenario for the heavy industries category. This very modest trend is a harbinger for further growth and more 
broadening opportunities. SARIMA (1,1,1) (1,1,1,12) Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): 34.84 % and Root 
Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 16,349 MT Model Performance: Moderate forecasting accuracy The preliminary 
model SARIMA (1,1,1) (1,1,1,12) production is a challenging combination of capturing significant patterns in the 
data while also identifying the substantial variability in productions. The fact that the best we can do is to extend those 
error bars into the future reflects the wide confidence intervals in our six-month forecast, especially for those later 
months. Such undetermined nature mirrors the intricate and lively role of the elements that determine output within 
its heavy industry sectors in Bangladesh.

Abstract 
Demand for renewable energy-based power sources is increasing over time as the world is facing a crisis in non-
renewable energy and is concerned about future sustainability and environmental safety. The solar power bank can be 
a great solution in this context, as the power bank is one of the most demandable devices and the integration of solar 
energy, which is regarded as an easily accessible renewable energy, makes the device more sustainable and 
independent of non-renewable energy. In this study, a model of a solar power bank has been proposed. To ensure that 
the product aligns with the customer demands, a comprehensive survey was conducted collecting data on the usage 
behavior, expectations, and preferences of the customers. The collected data was analyzed to determine the significant 
customer demands which were then reflected in the objective tree and functional structure. A Quality Function 
Deployment (QFD) was employed through which the customer requirements were translated into measurable 
engineering specifications, and the acceptable ranges of values were proposed. Based on the engineering 
specifications, the required components with necessary specifications were suggested and a digital model was formed 
in the Computer Aided design (CAD) software namely SolidWorks. The material selection of the power bank was 
done using the Digital Logic Method (DLM) by which the materials were evaluated and finally, the top-ranked 
material was selected for the power bank which was PVC in this case. The integration of customer-driven insights 
was reflected in this proposed solar power bank with the promotion of renewable energy utilization which can be a 
great support during emergencies like natural disasters.

1. Introduction
Energy shortage is a major issue worldwide. Moreover, excess usage of non-renewable energy sources has detrimental 
effects on the environment and health (Ansari et al. 2017). Renewable energy emerges as a transformative solution to 
these problems because renewable energy is greener and 10-40% of energy consumption can be minimized through 
the usage of renewable energy (Farghali et al. 2023).  Among various renewable energies, solar power is easily 
accessible. On the other hand, portable power storage devices such as power banks are becoming popular day by day. 
However, the conventional power bank is not sustainable because they do not include solar power storage capability. 
Presently, through advancements, the inclusion of solar power storage feature in the portable power bank has been 
possible which leverages the use of renewable energy by reducing extra pressure on the energy supply to charge 
electric devices. This feature makes the power bank independent of the power supply so during emergencies, or in

was negligible with the value 2.007e-04 mm that ensures the stability under loading conditions without significant 
deformation. The material suggested for the product is PVC(rigid) which has higher availability and low 
manufacturing costs. Hence, the design is appropriate for manufacturing as the material suggested is cost-effective 
and has good fabrication properties. Moreover, the stress analysis validated that the product can be used after 
manufacturing as the stress and displacement were within safety range. 
6. Conclusion
This study proposed a systematic strategy for the production of solar power bank which utilizes renewable energy 
sources for the global energy crisis. Incorporating customer-driven insight with the help of Kano Model, QFD, and 
Digital Logic Method (DLM), it guarantees that the proposed solar power bank meets all customers’ preferences.  
The assessment of the proposed model was done by a CAD-based model built by SolidWorks has presented 
proportioned indication. Stress analysis was done to confirm its structural integrity which is necessary for practical 
application as a means of determining the true practical reliability of the device. In selecting materials, DLM was 
applied which also indicated that the material proposed for this project is safe for the environment and can be used for 
a long time. The solar power bank is a versatile power source that promotes the use of renewable energy in both 
normal and emergency circumstances, as well as in remote areas. The proposed methodologies and systematic 
approach outlined in this study is utilized to establish a strong foundation for the development of long-lasting, 
customer-oriented products which aimed to contribute to environmental safety and energy efficiency.

Abstract 
The 4IR technologies adoption in South African higher education institutions has yet to be consistent. Despite the 
extensive literature on the possible contributions of technology to learners’ development, there is a lack of 
knowledge on the benefits of 4IR in HEIs to support teaching and learning. This study identified the benefits of 
4IR technologies in HEIs. To address this knowledge gap, the data used in this research were derived from both 
primary and secondary sources. The secondary data was collected through a detailed review of extant literature. 
In contrast, the primary data was collected through a questionnaire survey distributed to Gauteng province students 
currently registered in universities. In ensuring the reliability of the research questionnaire, Cronbach’s alpha 
coefficient reliability was conducted on the scaled research questions. Findings from the research were analyzed 
using descriptive statistics and exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Research findings were revealed as per related 
categories. The findings revealed that 4IR technologies adoption is not only about perceptions but is also 
influenced by lack of maintenance of 4IR tools, ICT being ignored by the stakeholders of the university/ not 
amended, poor internet connectivity, deprived ICT approach, etc. To address these obstacles and realize the value 
of 4IR in HEIs, institutions must understand the educational scope associated with 4IR technologies. This can be 
achieved by conducting more empirical research on the implications of 4IR technologies on the education sector 
and more training must be conducted.

1. Introduction
In HEIs, the 4IR technologies movement has led to increased data volumes, advanced algorithms, artificial 
intelligence (AI), automation and robotics to improve service quality. Universities across the globe have 
implemented more robotic process automation due to growing demands for service quality, enabling them to 
improve financial reporting, payroll, delivery of modules, and admissions (Duncan & Lundy 2019). A number of 
high-ranking South African universities are also embracing robotic process automation and artificial intelligence. 
To name just a few, the University of Pretoria, Cape Town, University of Johannesburg, and Witwatersrand 
(University of Pretoria 2021; University of Johannesburg 2020; University of Witwatersrand 2019).

development. This factor accounted for 50.301% of the total variance. 
Factor 2: Students international relevance 
Loaded in factor 2 are two variables that are ‘improved academic performance’ (89.3%) and ‘advancement of 
international linked programs’ (84.5%). This factor accounted for 12.894% of the total variance. 
Factor 3: Economic development of the institution 
Factor 3 contains three variables that are ‘high rate of student admissions’ (87.4%)’ ‘low dropout rate of students’ 
(84.3%), and ‘universities contribution to social development’ (55.6%). This factor can be labelled economic 
development of the institution with a total variance of 10.453%.

4. Conclusions and Recommendations
The literature revealed that higher education institutions bring men and women to a high level of intellectual 
development in the arts and science, and traditional professional disciplines and promote high-level research. The 
primary data retrieved from respondents categorized three namely: development of students’ academic 
performance, students’ international relevance, and economic development of the institution. In the former 
category, it was revealed that the most dominant benefits of adopting 4IR tools in higher education institutions by 
developing students’ academic capacity factors are the development of new learning & thinking skills and better 
communication between students & lecturers. Good relationship between the lecturers and students coupled with 
the development of new learning & thinking skills in HEIs, improves teaching, student’s achievements and lowers 
the number of students who drop out because lecturers can easily provide tutorial support via the internet through 
e-mail and forums. Other benefits are that students would use an electronic forum. The university can be ranked
as one of the best universities globally, universities contribute to the country's economy, and lecturers will provide
tutorial support. The students’ international relevance has the following benefits: advancement of international
linked programmes and improved academic performance has the highest benefits. The latter category (Economic
development of the institution) has the following benefits in the order of hierarchy: High rate of student admissions;
Universities contribution to social development and a low dropout rate of students.

Abstract 
Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a vital staple food and industrial raw material, particularly in Indonesia, where 
it holds significant economic importance. Despite its adaptability, cassava cultivation faces serious threats from plant 
diseases, leading to reduced productivity and quality. Traditional agricultural methods, often lacking modern 
technological interventions, exacerbate these challenges. To address this, a web-based expert system was developed 
to assist farmers in diagnosing and managing cassava diseases. The system integrates the Certainty Factor (CF) and 
Dempster-Shafer (DS) methods to handle uncertainty in disease diagnosis. Using the Adira 1 cassava variety, data 
was collected from a 2-hectare area in Bogor, focusing on five types of cassava diseases: Brown Leaf Spot, Blight 
Leaf Spot, Bacterial Blight, Anthracnose, and Root Rot. The CF method quantifies the certainty of specific facts, while 
the DS method combines evidence from various sources to determine the belief level of potential diagnoses. A 
comparative analysis of these models was conducted using 20 case studies. The results showed that the CF model 
achieved a 95% accuracy rate, slightly outperforming the DS model's 90% accuracy. Additionally, the system's 
usability was evaluated using the USE Questionnaire, which rated it as ""Highly Suitable"" with an overall score of 
84.5%. This study demonstrates that while both CF and DS models are effective in diagnosing cassava diseases, the 
CF model offers slightly higher accuracy. The developed expert system is not only accurate but also user-friendly and 
accessible, making it a valuable tool for improving cassava disease management practices.

1. Introduction
Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a staple food for people in the world, one of which is Indonesia, in addition to 
being a staple food, cassava is also used as a raw material for industry and animal feed. Cassava is very easy to 
cultivate, even on marginal soils this plant can grow and give yield This plant first entered Indonesia in 1852. Damage 
to cassava plants is often caused by disease, which is a serious threat that can reduce cassava productivity. The 
countermeasures carried out are still limited and sometimes do not achieve the expected results. This can have a 
negative impact on the quality of crops and the level of productivity of the cassava commodity. Cassava plant

Based on the results of the accuracy calculation using the confusion matrix, it can be seen that the results of the 
comparison of the certainty factor method and the dempster-shafer method that have been validated by experts show 
that the Certainty Factor method has a larger percentage, namely 95%. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The results showed that the cassava plant disease suspicion assessment model using the Certainty Factor and 
Dempster-Shafer methods provided satisfactory results in disease diagnosis. Of the 20 case studies analyzed, the 
Certainty Factor method managed to achieve an accuracy level of 95%, while the Dempster-Shafer method achieved 
an accuracy level of 90%. Although both methods show strong ability in diagnosing cassava diseases, these results 
indicate that the Certainty Factor method is slightly superior in terms of accuracy compared to the Dempster-Shafer 
method. These findings provide valuable insights for practitioners in choosing the most effective method for precise 
diagnosis of cassava disease. In addition, the difference in accuracy between these two methods can also provide 
guidance for further research to optimize the use of each method in different contexts. Although the Certainty Factor 
shows superiority in accuracy, the Dempster-Shafer method still has strong potential, especially in situations involving 
high uncertainty and incomplete data. Both approaches can be used complementarily, depending on the specific 
condition and the need for diagnosis. Thus, this study not only highlights the advantages and limitations of each 
method, but also opens up opportunities for further development in the integration of the two methods, in order to 
improve the accuracy and effectiveness of cassava plant disease diagnosis in the future.
