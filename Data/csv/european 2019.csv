Abstract 
This work describes the efforts of the leading Mexican convenience store company to look for 
opportunities to reduce a high level of customer service variability at the store echelon. The company 
was having high customer service variability originating that 42% of the time, on average, stores were 
out of stock. After an analysis of the structure of the distribution network and the actual forecasting and 
inventory management schemes, the authors found that the main cause behind the deficient performance 
was poor demand forecasting accuracy and incomplete inventory management scheme structures. 
Therefore, the improvement initiatives designed were developed to select correct or adequate forecasting 
procedures for the different demand patterns and the modification of the structure of the inventory 
schemes. Initial results are obtained from a pilot study carried out in all SKU´s of all the stores of the 
Puerto Vallarta plaza of the company. The resulting forecasting mean squared error (MSE) was 
decreased significantly in the order of 43%. The firm estimates a reduction of about 21% of the level of 
inventories and of 22 percentual points of customer service variability at the retailing stores due to the 
improvement in forecasting accuracy

Introduction
An important sector in the Mexican economy where demand forecasting and inventory management are key tools 
for success is the retailing sector. The Mexican convenience store industry is rapidly growing along with the 
evolution of Mexican society. Mexican young families are changing customs, habits and roles. Now, both: husband 
and wife work and stay most of the day outside home. Time has become a very valuable asset to manage. This new 
environment has favored the emergence of the convenience stores (C-S). Location, fast response and 24/7 time 
availability have become key characteristics for the success of this format. Mexican C-S sector was positioned 
number 11 among the first 15 biggest world markets in year 2014 with total sales of 8500 million dollars. This level 
of sales was generated by 17,450 stores established throughout Mexico. The leading company in this sector 
contributed with 12,853 stores and a market share of 88% in that year. This firm will be called “The Main” 
hereafter. 
One of the greatest challenges of convenience stores to be competitive refers to demand forecasting and inventory 
management. These are fundamental to maintain adequate levels of product availability and insure customer 
satisfaction. This aspect represents an important weakness for “The Main”. The company was experiencing high 
levels of variability of its customer service response. 
This work has the purpose of describing the efforts of “The Main” to decrease the firm´s customer service variability 
at the store echelon level. The document is structured as follows. The first section presents an introduction and 
general context. Second section describes a summary of bibliographic research relevant to the problem of interest.

Conclusions  
 
The level of competitiveness of the retailing sector is dependent on the level of product availability at the store. 
Under these circumstances, the effectiveness of the forecasting and inventory management schemes becomes 
important.  
 
The case of study treated in this paper deals with the improvement of the level of precision of demand forecasting at 
the store level. The company was dealing with the problem of having excessive level of customer service variability 
in its stores. An exhaustive analysis of the contribution to this excess was developed and found that forecasting 
performance for inventory management purposes could be improved. Thus, an initiative based on the application of 
the ADIDA (Nikolopoulos et al. 2011) methodology and a change of forecasting procedure could be implemented 
for these purposes. Additionally, it was also identified the need to modify the periodic inventory management 
scheme to include safety stock for B and C-F items. As described in section 4, the impact of implementing the 
previously mentioned efforts was very positive. Simulation studies and pilot program actions estimate a total 
reduction of customer service variability of the order of 79%. 
 
Based on the previous positive results, the company decided to make a full implementation of the initiatives in 
Puerto Vallarta. The following step agreed by the operations management consisted of deploying a similar analysis 
and design scheme for the rest of the plazas in Mexico. The application described in this work provides additional 
evidence of the benefits of implementing ADIDA to improve forecasting accuracy for intermittent demand items.

Abstract 
Huge amounts of paper mill sludge are generated from the paper manufacturing industries and these can pose 
environmental contamination problems if not properly managed. Vermicomposting was therefore investigated as a 
paper mill waste management initiative to produce vermicompost. A total of 3kg of paper mill sludge was fed into a 
vermireactor and allowed to vermicompost over a period of 60 days using Eisenia Fetida as the vermicomposting 
media. The paper mill sludge had a moisture content of 65% and the vermicomposting processed occurred under 
standard conditions aerobically. After the 60 days, the vermicompost was analysed for the total nitrogen (TKN), 
phosphorous (TP) and potassium (TK) composition using standard methods. The vermicompost had an average of 
4.3%, 0.45% and 1.89% for TKN, TP and TK respectively. Vermiwash was also generated during the process and 
contained 1.63%, 0.14% and 0.59% respectively for TKN, TP and TK. The paper mill vermicompost can be used as 
a source of bio fertilizers.

1. Introduction
The paper manufacturing industry generates huge amounts of paper mill sludge as a waste product during the 
processes (Kaviraj and Sharma., 2009). This paper mill sludge if not properly managed can lead to environmental 
pollution and degradation, pollution as well as climate change effect (Basheer and Agrawal., 2013). However, this 
paper mill sludge is also a highly biodegradable material and has potential to be valorised into useful products such 
as vermicompost, a form of bio fertilizer. During the vermicomposting process, earthworms such as Eisenia Fetida, 
E. Andrei, Eudrilus Eugeniae (Yadav and Madan., 2013) feed on the organic material with the earthworm gut acting
as the bio reactor. The earthworm’s excreta during the process are then termed vermicompost and are nutrient rich in

4. Conclusion 
Paper mill sludge can be valorised to vermicompost through the application of the vermicompost technology. 
Vermicompost with TKN, TP and TK with composition of 4.30%, 0.45% and 1.89% respectively were produced. 
Significant increases in these parameters was noted and ascertained by the 39% decrease in organic loading. 
Vermiwash with TKN, TP and TK compositions of 1.63%, 0.14% and 0.59% respectively was also produced.

Abstract 
European refrigerated food companies must be highly efficient under a very competitive environment. That is 
the case for one of the leading conglomerates based on Spain. After an unfortunate event where the group´s 
largest frank production plant was unable to continue working, the company adopted a sense of urgency to 
achieve customer demand increasing the efficiency of the rest of its production network by 25-30%. The current 
study has the purpose of describing the experience of applying the concept of Operational Equipment 
Effectiveness in a Spanish frankfurter plant. This approach is imbedded into a Theory of Constraints scheme 
that insures a positive contribution to the objective of increasing productivity with each initiative implemented. 
A description of the results achieved is provided.

1. Introduction
Evolution towards a global economy plunge companies to a highly competitive environment. To maintain a 
certain level of competitiveness, firms aim for productivity and strive to exceed customers’ expectation. As 
noted by Dollar et al (1993), the best overall measure of competitiveness is one that hast long been used in 
international comparisons: productivity. Additionally, Fleisher et al., (2006) state that the competitiveness of 
manufacturing companies depend on availability and productivity of their facilities. This means companies 
nowadays are forced to innovate, work faster and offer perfect choices at a glance. Huang et al., (2003), due to 
intense global competition, companies are looking for opportunities to improve and optimize their productivity 
to remain competitive.  
The previous situation has been the case for a European corporate company that manufactures refrigerated and 
frozen products. After an unfortunate event where the group´s largest frank production plant was unable to 
continue working, the company adopted a sense of urgency to achieve customers demand by increasing other 
plants production in the very short term by 25-30%. Making this happen required bottle neck elimination and 
productivity raise. This situation led to the need for a performance measurement system that account for the 
different important elements of productivity in a manufacturing process. 
According to Nakajima (1998), Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE) is an effective way of analyzing - 
efficiency of a single machine. As Hansen (2002) states, OEE has been recognized as a fundamental method 
for measuring equipment performance. The OEE measure attempts to identify wastes and the costs associated 
with a piece of equipment. However, as Scott et al., (1998) point out the gains made in OEE at the equipment 
level, are not enough. It is necessary to focus beyond - performance of individual machines towards - 
performance of the whole factory. The main goal is owning a very efficient integrated system.

The results were better than expected, a combination of actions that attacked downtime frequencies and duration 
time, well organized work place, line breakdowns, corrective and preventive maintenance routines, autonomous 
maintenance performance and efficiency together, improved the OEE index in around 5% and reduced more 
than 15% of breakdown time that was previously lost and affected production. 
 
Lines efficiency improved by 9%. For line 3, OEE went from 53.7% to 67.8%, for line 7 OEE went from 51.1% 
to 63.1% and for line 9 OEE went from 59.1% to 64.3%. This improvement led to an increase of franks 
production of 17.5 tons per week. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
With the 15 hours week gained after the implementation of the previous described scheme, the plant was able 
to produce 17.5 tons per week. Lines efficiency went up by 11%, this had not been reached since the production 
had risen in a 28%. Sharing best practices lead to the implementation of better maintenance routines that 
provided better equipment efficiency and resulted in a better working environment. The combination of 
important tools such as OEE and TOC, resulted in important factory level discoveries, its easy replication 
allowed the factory to continue a horizontal deployment to the rest of 9 franks production lines. 
 
A highly efficient integrated system is possible; with the help of a combination of TPM tools, results were 
exceeded. As mentioned in the introduction, the gains made in OEE at the equipment level, are not enough, 
Scott et al., (1998). TPM, TOC, OEE plus operators’ knowledge where the key ingredients for success, 
considering best practices shared by operators in plant around the world gave this project the extra needed to 
perceive results.  
 
Some further recommendations would include considering TPM by itself is already a powerful set of tools that 
are proven to work, but an operator’s knowledge should never be less important than any tool. Consider the 
amount of time a day some operators share with a production line, they know and understand, any little noise 
or vibration made by a machine. Sometimes, given competition and time pressure, people forget the most 
important resource in a plant is human resource. 
 
Once again literature is proven right, the results of TPM and its combination with almost any other engineering 
tool are real. Having the opportunity to read, understand and apply what learned in real life was such a delight, 
what is next is to share this practice to other plants for them to learn from what done with these franks production 
lines and start working for results.

Sustainability in Supply Chains and Operations 
 
Abstract 
 
The sustainable supply chain proposed in this paper aims to study the operational process of a coal-fired 
power plant, to see how a humble fossil transforms into energy, and how electricity is created step by step 
inside the plant. In order to fully understand the eco-design of this supply chain network, we have studied 
the utilization of electrostatic precipitators in a coal power plant, and their ability to remove ash, dust and 
smoke from the flue gas so it does not pass into the atmosphere, thus comply with environmental 
regulations.

Sustainable supply chain, coal power plant, eco-design, electrostatic precipitators, environmental regulations. 
 
 1. Introduction 
 
When we meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own 
needs, that is exactly how we define Sustainable Development, this term has been defined in many ways, and it can 
be interpreted in different ways, due to its huge impact on our social, environmental and economic life, therefore the 
concept of green supply chain or the eco-design of supply chain have attracted a growing interest over the recent 
decade, as a result designing a green supply chain is becoming increasingly critical and very important.  
 
In fact, the prime concern of designing a green supply chain is the management process of placing appropriate logistic 
green infrastructures, and maintaining the profitability and prosperity of such business, therefore sustainability is 
becoming an imperative for manufacturing industries, and it is attracting increasing interest from both academia and 
industry.  
 
In the first place, we suggest to begin our contribution with a study about designing a sustainable supply chain, which 
is one of the crucial planning problems in supply chain eco-design; meanwhile companies have to obey certain 
environmental regulations and several indicators of the environmental performance for that reason it is fundamental

Which lead us to our last part of this contribution, where we focused on the working principle of electrostatic 
precipitators their utilization in a coal-fired power plant, and last we have showed their highlighted points of 
effectiveness.  
 
More than half of the electricity generated in the world is by using coal as the primary fuel, which is why more and 
more researches are being done in the last three decades, in the interest of making the process of a coal-power plant 
specifically, and all kinds of power stations generally, less polluting and more sustainable.

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to help businesses to select the strategic plans most suitable for them. This requires 
using practical and beneficial techniques. To do this, the alternative strategies that are developed for the 
correspondent opportunities need to be evaluated. Only by making an evaluation as objectively and impartially as 
possible, the best decision can be achieved. Techniques that may be applied simultaneously or interchangeably to 
select the best of alternative strategies are as follows: 
•
Factors analysis
•
Strategic option grid
•
Risk drivers
Even if the best strategy is selected by any of these techniques listed above, contingency plans are still necessary 
for the selected strategy in a risky environment. A sensitivity analysis needs to be conducted, taking into 
consideration the possibility that basic assumptions and parameters do not come out as expected and the measures 
considered to be taken in this respect need to be identified.

To do this, they need to evaluate the alternative strategies that are developed for the correspondent opportunities. 
Techniques that may be applied simultaneously or interchangeably to select the best of alternative strategies are 
as follows: 
 
• 
Factors analysis 
• 
Strategic option grid 
• 
Risk drivers 
 
Even if the best strategy is selected by any of these techniques, contingency plans are still necessary for the selected 
strategy in a risky environment. A sensitivity analysis needs to be conducted, taking into consideration the 
possibility that basic assumptions and parameters do not come out as expected and the measures considered to be 
taken in this respect need to be identified.

Abstract 
Cooking is one of the household activities with high energy requirements, especially for communities living off the 
grid in sub-Saharan Africa. Traditionally, open stoves have been used for cooking and these are energy inefficient 
and have potential to release harmful pollutants to the environment. The adoption of eco-friendly cook stoves is 
therefore of importance in order to conserve energy and also improve energy efficiency. The consideration of design

and heat transfer efficiency of cook stoves is affected by the formation of emissions, the combustion chamber 
density, mixing, geometry as well as the air-to-fuel ratio (Jetter et al. 2012).  
 
3.2 Performance parameters of eco cook stove 
Performance parameters of efficient cook stoves are measured through various parameters including the modified 
combustion efficiency, heat transfer efficiency, overall thermal efficiency, fuel burning rate as well as the water boil 
test (Dhopte et al., 2015). 
 
3.2.1 Modified combustion efficiency  
Modified combustion efficiency (MCE) shows how well the fuel burns in terms of conversion to heat and radiant. 
Incomplete combustion results in the production of dangerous pollutants as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and 
methane.  
 
3.2.2 Heat transfer efficiency 
Heat transfer efficiency (THE) is an indication of the amount of energy delivered for cooking against the total heat 
released from fuel combustion. Eco cook stoves are therefore designed to minimize the heat loss to the environment. 
 
3.2.3 Overall thermal efficiency  
The overall thermal efficiency (OTE) is a combination of both the heat transfer and fuel combustion efficiencies 
(Dhopte et al., 2015). Equation 1 represents the thermal efficiency calculation. 
𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂= 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 𝑋𝑋 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻… … … … … … … (1) 
An eco cook stove that is properly designed has a balance of both the heat transfer efficiency and the modified 
combustion efficiency (Jetter et al., 2012). 
 
3.2.4 Process control devices 
Process control devices such as sensors and fan drivers help in the optimal functioning of the eco cook stoves. 
Process control helps in the reduction of emissions as well as improvement of the heat transfer efficiencies (Biomass 
Program, 2011). These can be in their simplest forms in order to reduce cost and increase uptake of eco cook stove 
to the poor of sub Saharan Africa. 
 
3.2.5 Materials of construction 
Various types of materials are required for the construction of eco cook stove’s combustion chamber, insulation as 
well as heating probes. Materials must be able to withstand high temperatures, thermal gradients as well as physical 
stress. The material chosen must be highly durable, cheap and readily available. Due to the factors listed above, 
metals and ceramics are mostly used in the production of eco cook stoves. 
 
4. Conclusion 
Eco cook stoves need to be adopted for usage in the sub Sahara Africa as a means of improving energy efficiency. 
Proper design considerations, process control and automation as well as usage of the right material of construction 
need to be taken into account.

Abstract 
In this study, the potential to make charcoal briquettes from brewery waste was investigated in a bid to utilize brewery 
waste and come up with an alternative source of energy. Brewery spent grains were first shredded to reduce the 
particle size to a range of 2-10 mm and then briquetted at 2 MPa at a 1-minute compaction periods to square biomass 
briquettes. The briquettes were then carbonized at temperatures varying between 200- 600 °C. The charcoal briquettes 
formed had calorific values ranging from 25-32 MJ/kg with the optimum calorific value being obtained at 400 °C. 
The charcoal briquettes produced from brewery waste can be used as an alternative source of energy at the same time 
managing industrial waste to promote environmental sustainability.

3.3 Effect of brewers waste particle size on calorific value 
As the particle size of the brewery waste used to make the charcoal briquettes increased from 2 mm to 10 mm, the calorific value 
of the charcoal briquettes reduced from 32.4 MJ/kg to 25.9 MJ/kg (Figure 2).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2. Effect of brewery waste particle size on calorific value, carbonized at 400 °C 
It is critical to have smaller particles of the biomass for optimal charcoal briquettes calorific values (Kabir et al., 2015; Krizau et 
al., 2015). Larger biomass particles tend to promote incomplete carbonization, this has a potential of lowering the fixed carbon 
content in the charcoal briquettes as well as increasing the ash content hence decreased calorific values.  
4. Technology Management for Briquetting Technology 
Strategies for adoption and uptake of the biomass briquettes from brewery waste need to be found. Briquettes are ecofriendly and 
have high energy value making them easy to easy, however, development of smart partnership for the commercialization of the 
briquetting industry is critical for adoption of biomass briquettes.  
5. Conclusion 
Brewery waste can be utilized as a raw material for charcoal briquettes production. The charcoal briquettes have a high calorific 
value averaging around 28 MJ/kg carbonized at 400 °C for brewery waste particle sizes of 2 mm. The physicochemical 
characteristics of the charcoal briquettes promote high heating values hence their ideal use as an alternative source of energy.

Large portion of the workforce in India is found to be employed in the unorganized sector.  
In the present study, 100 male workers were randomly selected from three unorganized sectors of sand core 
worker, goldsmiths and carpenter from West Bengal, India. Physical parameters of the workers of this study 
were measured.  A detailed questionnaire study on discomfort feeling was done by the modified Nordic 
questionnaire. The existing workstations were assessed by the measurement of work areas. Analysis of 
body posture was done to evaluate the work stress during their job. A new ergonomic intervention was 
introduced to the unorganized sectors with their active suggestions. Subjects were interviewed at the end to 
ascertain intervention acceptance. 
The study revealed that all these three unorganized sectors jobs are performed in awkward postures, with 
the potential risks of musculoskeletal disorders primarily affecting the low-back region.  
The modified process at sand core process enhanced productivity in both types of core making processes. 
Blowing Pipe activity of the goldsmiths increases the fatigue of facial muscles. An ergonomic intervention 
(hand air pipe) eliminate the hazards of manual Blowing Pipe activities of the goldsmiths. As indicated by 
RULA action levels, most of the postures adopted by carpenters with existing handle are awkward and non-
liner in nature. Ergonomically modified handles of hand saw reduce the fatigue of hand muscles and 
improve the carpenters health during work.

Abstract 
Construction industry is a risk industry awing to severe accident occurrence, accidental deaths, and work-related 
injuries. Although construction managers focus on productivity in terms of cost, quality and time, construction projects 
can never achieve their objectives unless professionals become responsible for the safety-related issues. Previous 
researches suggested that the early introduction of occupational safety & health management systems (OHSMS) is an 
important asset in decision-making, as it directs towards the abatement of occupational hazards in the workplace. 
Thus, this paper aims to study the impact of OHSMS on reducing construction site accidents. The paper explored 
through literature review the major causes of construction accidents, and factors to prevent them. Afterwards, the 
implementation of occupational health and safety practices at construction sites in three case study projects was 
analyzed; two projects in Malaysia and a case study in Egypt. The data for the local case study was collected through 
a semi-structured interview that targeted the site safety manager who was responsible the implemented OHSMS. The 
study concluded that implementing OHSMS, would lead to a significant reduction in site-accidents. Moreover, in 
order to improve safety, health and safety should be included from preparation of contract documents.  
Keywords: Occupational Health and Safety Management System(OHSMS), Site-accidents, construction health and 
safety, Construction sites 
1. Introduction
Health and Safety are vital in construction industry due to being a high hazard industry, where, the main force behind 
any construction site is the man power. It is found that without safety, the risks and hazards at a very dangerous place 
like construction sites can get people injured, hurt or even killed and accordingly this can cause any construction site 
delays and extra expenditures. In addition, protections in construction sites are considered the prime right of laborers, 
but for years’ construction workers have been struggling to attain this right (Shamsuddin and Norzaimi 2015).  The 
main objective of an Occupational Health and Safety Management System (OHSMS) certification scheme is to 
encourage and enhance safety awareness, to promote safe work practices, and to raise the safety standards of the 
construction industry (Teo et al., 2005). It is argued by Smallwood that accidents are inevitable in the construction 
2234",,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

of the three projects under study. Moreover, the cases of accidents were minor requiring maximum three days off. 
Furthermore, several major problems in implementing occupational health and safety practices that contribute to 
construction accidents were concluded from the analysis; ignorance of workers on work procedures, lack of financial 
allocation for safety management, lack of awareness among workers and language barrier between supervisors and 
workers. Finally, several strategies were suggested to reduce construction site accidents. These are interrelated with 
the four components of a successful occupational health and safety management system, that are shown in figure 3. 
The suggestions cover three aspects for the implementation of safety practices, i.e. awareness of workers, commitment 
of top management and the allocation of resources.

Abstract 
Manual cutting and slicing of vegetables has proved to be very time consuming and is prone to the risk of 
contamination of the food leading to high rates of foodborne diseases. Various methods have been implemented 
in the process of size reduction of vegetables ranging from manual, electric and automated. The desire to make a 
design that simplifies, that saves time, that is relatively cheaper and efficienct during the process of size reduction 
of vegetables was the main scope of the whole project. The contaminant free products will be produced through 
the use of U.V light and this machine will incorporate U.V light as its integral component. The principle of 
operation of the machine is attached to the theory of rotating hollow discs. Experiments were conducted at the 
Department Laboratory and a force of 19.5N was obtained for the hardest vegetable. The machines available in 
Zimbabwe have posed to be very expensive while they are only availed abroad. The machine must always be used 
with caution since it has rotating elements. In conclusion, the objectives were met and the most importantly the 
cost was in the desired range hence acceptable to the market. From the cost analysis, the total price required for 
the vegetable cutter and slicer is $890.73.

Introduction 
Vegetables are defined as an herbaceous plant or a part of a plant that is eaten whole or in part (Welbaum, 2015). 
Over the years, world vegetable production has increased. For example, there was over four times increase in 
world vegetable production from 1970 until 2009 (FAO, 2011). The increase has largely been as a result of a 
prolonged technological advancement. On a large scale, vegetables are produced to suit the supermarkets and 
some food industries for example those which do canning. The major problem arises on reducing the size of the 
vegetable for it to be easily consumed by the customer. Cutting and slicing have prevailed for over a long period 
of time and several methods have been used to carry out the special tasks. Traditional methods made use of knives 
and other machines devised for those purposes. These methods have posed to be tiresome and great time-
consuming tasks especially in our busy lives.

5.2 
U.V lamps 
The UV beam radiation guards should be well in proper position to avoid scattering of the beam. Before any 
maintenance is carried out, they must be always switched off 
5.3 
Emergency stop devices 
The emergency preparedness devices include the off switch which should be always functional but above all, 
situations which leads to emergency situations should be always be avoided by ensuring optimum safety 
precautions throughout the machine operation. The safety devices will be provided for the conveyor belt (both the 
feed and delivery), the rotating disc such that in the case of any emergency respective action is taken. 
5.4 
Servicing the machine 
The following effective steps should be obeyed while doing any service 
• 
Scheduled services must be carried out using standard task procedures in order to avoid any injuries and 
fatalities. 
• 
The blade must be handled with engineering gloves,  
• 
the disc replacements must be done only when every part is stationery (lock out system), 
• 
the U.V radiation lamps should be carefully handled and before any process is carried out it must be 
ensured that they are off.  
5.5 
Effective use of the machine 
• 
The conveyor belt should not be overloaded, only the rated load should be applied 
• 
The vegetables must be fed only when they have been reduced of their cross-sectional area 
• 
The speed of the disc should match only with the required type of vegetable to be sliced. 
• 
The disc and the dicer should be kept at an enclosed space free from people 
• 
For effective output by the U.V light the machine must operate while the door is closed. 
5.6 
Conclusion 
Designing of the automated vegetable cutter and slicer was successfully implemented within the required budget 
of USD1000, the machine can do several cuts and slice sizes depending on the consumer requirement (macedoine, 
julienne, etc). Moreover, the Implemented U.V platform ensures safe products for immediate consumption 
without any harm both to the user and the food. Use was made of locally available materials to construct the 
design to success thus a great margin was achieved in terms of costs. However, the actual reveals of the machine 
are only visible when it is brought to operation after manufacture and allowed to perform its tasks as according to 
the design.

Caldwell-t Algorithm Validation: 
Alternative proposal to the solution of Gupta for the 
sequencing of activities in processes of slender development

Abstract 
Gupta algorithm was proposed back in 1972 to reduce cycle times, with very good performance results 
and it has been successfully used as a sequencing solution in critical activities in lean software develop 
processes. An alternative to this algorithm is presented with validation evidence on this document, using 
heuristic rules when equal selecting factors occurs. The algorithm, named Caldwell-T, can be used to 
solve, effectively, the possible clashes of activity that can occur in shared resources, as opposed to the 
traditional methodology, which encourages multitasking. Caldwell-t Algorithm obtained 78% 
performance effectiveness over Gupta proposal using a simulation model with Industry data. This 
improvement gives a big impact in software develop projects, when it is applied to critical chains and 
feeding buffers and signal calculations. 
However, the new algorithm may yield less effective results compared with Gupta algorithm for certain 
random configurations of expected times of execution of activities, in approximately 20% of the cases, 
which allows to deduce that it is better to analyze the configuration of the multiproject environment with 
both algorithms, instead of putting them to compete. The results of this research is highly valuable 
because Gupta Algorithm is powerful compare with GA solutions and other IA approaches.

1. Introduction
The development of software applications has been widely studied from several perspectives, such as: project 
management, resource management practices, use of code building standards, good teamwork practices, etc. 
Development methodologies have evolved, from those centralized in architecture to those focused on the 
development of functionalities rather than whole systems. 
Within the study´s approaches and the search for optimization of development methodologies, in contrast to the 
traditional ""waterfall"" or cascade, emerge the agile approaches and in particular, the development of lean software, 
which has gained great relevance and followers. 
At the beginning of the nineties, Womack, Roos and Jones (1991) in the United States published a book that 
changed the way of understanding the process flow. This book entitled: The machine that changed the world, sowed 
the base of what has become popular as lean manufacturing (Lean Manufacturing). This concept caused such a stir 
in academic and business circles that it forced two of its authors (James Womack and Daniel Jones) to write a more

Conclusions And Future Research Work 
 
The Caldwell-t algorithm shows to be robust compared with Gupta's algorithm, to reduce cycle times in slender 
software development environments, significantly reducing waste by sequencing shared resources in multiproject 
and multitasking environments.  
 
Clearly, the new algorithm could become a tool for optimizing the execution of multiple projects to execute faster 
the routines of small cycles of programming of use cases. It can also be used to solve, effectively, the possible 
clashes of activity that can occur in shared resources, as opposed to the traditional methodology, which encourages 
multitasking. 
 
However, the new algorithm may yield less effective results compared with Gupta for certain random configurations 
of expected times of execution of activities, in approximately 20% of the cases, which allows to deduce that it is 
better to analyze the configuration of the multiproject environment with both algorithms, instead of putting them to 
compete. This is important taking into account that both algorithms have the same degree of simplicity in their 
calculation and application by automatic means. 
 
With this research it is demonstrated that the development of tiebreaker rules and algorithms could generate benefits 
in reducing the development times of computer projects and could facilitate the adoption of lean practices. 
 
As a future line of research, the exploration of these algorithms for different configurations of development projects 
with multi-routes and specific variabilities at the time of conclusion of activities is proposed.

Abstract 
Indonesian Toll Management Bureau envisages implementation of the On Board Unit (OBU) usage as part of its 
integrated payment system in lieu of cash and e-card system. Observations and surveys were conducted vis-a-vis 
48,013 toll-road users to determine the suitable OBU types and its potential contributions toward efficient tollgate 
queuing time. Subsequently, it is expected to concurrently determine the appropriate promotion tools that support 
toll-road users particularly in non-tapping payment system of OBU. House of Quality and V/C Ratio are the basis of 
the problem formulation in this research. The study shows that a flexible mount OBU device which displays its 
current available balance are desired by most toll-road users. Moreover, toll-road users expect the single piece 
microwave OBU device to be waterproof, heatproof, and durable. Comparing to e-card system, its usage reduces the 
queuing time by 50% to 60%. Additionally, the study shows that collaboration with gas station is the most 
appropriate promotion model. These research findings provide beneficial feedback for both toll-road authorities and 
related business stakeholders.

1. Introduction
Make Indonesia 4.0 is one of the flagship programs of the government of the Republic of Indonesia under the 
leadership of President Joko Widodo (Ministry of Industry of the Republic of Indonesia, 2018). In line with this, 
Bank Indonesia (the Indonesian central bank) issued a National Non-Cash Movement program, which was warmly 
welcomed by the Toll Road Regulatory Agency, and implemented by toll road developers and operators who 
obtained operating permits from the Government. Since October 31, 2017, all toll road payment transactions have 
been successfully transferred to become non-cash transactions, through the use of e-toll cards. The E-toll card is a 
tool set by the government in the Electronic Toll Collection (ETC). The implementation of non-cash transactions is 
mainly sought to improve services for toll road users, especially in terms of effectiveness and time efficiency of 
transactions. 
Over time and in line with the vision of the Indonesian government, the Toll Road Regulatory Agency continues to 
strive to improve its services. Today's technological advancements enable the development of other devices for 
Electronic Toll Collection, in addition to e-toll cards that still require users to stop their vehicles at the toll door to 
make toll payments. This kind of payment process requires a relatively long time and causes a buildup of vehicle 
queues during rush hour. The model of toll road payments that can be done in parallel is expected to increase 
process efficiency and reduce bottleneck at the toll booth. The solution model for electronic toll collection has been 
implemented in various developed countries (Kitajima, 2017), known as Multi-Lane Free-Flow (MLFF) tolling. 
This MLFF system is a non-touch transaction model where users can make transactions without having to physically 
contact payment equipment. At present, the On Board Unit (OBU) as a device that supports the MLFL system, has 
been used by a small number of toll road users even though its use is still limited to single-lane free-flow tolling

vehicles. However, Toll Gate Cililitan is included in the 'A' category because the amount of both tolls provided is 
sufficient to be able to accommodate the number of incoming vehicles that can freely move according to the 
specified speed limit (V / C ratio = .33). 
 
The observation of the use of the OBU device, which is shown in Table 5, also shows that the smallest V / C ratio 
for the transaction process using the OBU device occurs at the Toll Gate, with a value of .02 and the highest occurs 
at Toll Gate Senayan with magnitude .22. When compared between the use of OBU devices and the e-toll card as 
electronic toll collection, on the toll road the CTC branch shows, that the use of OBU devices improves the toll road 
payment transaction processing time by 50% to 60%. This means that transactions using the OBU device at the 27 
CTC branch of the Jasa Marga toll gate, save transaction time by 50% to 60% for each vehicle that uses it. 
 
 
5. Conclusions and Discussion 
 
The results of this study recommend the use of OBU devices that can be accepted by most people in Indonesia, 
through the design of OBU devices that are fit for the needs of toll road users, promotion models that are suitable for 
users from the Greater Jakarta area (Jakarta-Bogor-Depok-Tangerang-Bekasi) in order to increase the use of the 
OBU device, and decrease the queue or the efficiency of the transaction time at the toll gates. More than 80% of 
respondents supported the government's plan to implement the use of OBU devices as ETCs throughout Indonesia, 
noting that OBU devices that were circulated had affordable prices, were easy to obtain, and provided an adequate 
toll booth for toll road transactions using the OBU device. The use of OBU is still rare nowadays, especially because 
respondents are less aware of where OBU devices can be purchased; even among them there are many who are not 
aware of the presence of OBU device technology for ETC; prices that are still expensive, and many respondents who 
are not bank customers of OBU device providers. The lack of a toll booth that provides ETC with OBU devices, is 
also a complaint from OBU users that needs attention to be addressed, including the OBU sensor which is felt to be 
insensitive, and lack of collaboration with various other banks. The results of this study recommend an OBU device 
that is integrated with a smart card (single piece microwave), with a size that fits in the hand, easy installation and 
placement in the vehicle, and has an LED screen (to show OBU status and balance checking), and features 
communication to support the ease of use of functions on the OBU device. Furthermore, the results of this study also 
recommend OBU devices with components that are waterproof, impact and hot weather resistant. 
 
In addition to providing recommendations for OBU device designs that are fit for users, this study also aims to 
obtain forms of cooperation that are interesting to toll road users to encourage the purchase of OBU devices, so that 
the government's goal to carry out non-cash payments throughout Indonesia can be accommodated. The form of 
collaboration between toll road managers and SPBU companies, which can provide relief for the purchase of OBU 
devices, is highly recommended by the results of this study. With the increase in the use of OBU devices as 
electronic toll collection, not only are touchless toll transaction plans accommodated, but also a significant decrease 
in the queue (50% -60%) can also be more evenly distributed throughout the country. Corrected queue levels can 
significantly support environmental reservations and various other forms of reservation, including health. The 
duration of transactions using the OBU device as an ETC in a matter of 1.46 seconds, is also able to meet the 
government's target of setting a standard transaction for one vehicle for 2.3 seconds. 
 
Finally, the results of this study certainly still require generalization and follow-up to further research, for example 
by using other calculation models that can better accommodate the complexity of the actual conditions, and other 
sampling techniques. In line with the National Non-Cash Movement (Hutauruk, 2017), in the future, more research 
is expected to be able to explore forms of payment transactions that support the implementation of Multi Lane Free 
Flow on toll roads throughout Indonesia, which is suitable for most users in Indonesia, and various forms of 
cooperation and promotions to be able to continue to increase its use.

Abstract 
This study was motivated by the fact that many organisations in Tanzania and Africa in general fails to 
meet security requirements suggested through ISO 27001 security standards, due to the lack of a 
credible cyber-security policy. The purpose was to develop the policy framework suitable in the 
management of the cyber-security in organisation level. Also, the study determined the compliance of 
selected cases for study to procedures for cyber policy formulation and review. The study used the 
qualitative approach. It engaged the literature in the conceptualisation of the study, used the discussion 
between researchers to formulate themes of the new cyber-security policy, used the focus group to 
improve the cyber-security policy framework, and used a survey questionnaire to study procedures and 
the formalisation of the cyber-security policy. Fifteen (15) organisation were represented in the survey, 
while ten (10) participants from six (6) organisations and four (4) countries were engaged in a focus 
group discussion. Both purposive and convenient methods were used in sampling. This study 
formulated a framework for cyber-security policy with seven themes: Data security, Internet and 
network services governance, uses of company owned devices, physical security, incident handling and 
reporting, monitoring and compliance, and policy administrative issues. Moreover, the study confirmed 
that few organisations engages stakeholders in policy formulation and conduct the policy review at the 
interval not exceeding three years.  Moreover, many organisations uses cyber-security policies without 
the authorisation of the top authority of their organisation. The study recommends the formulation of a 
comprehensive cyber-security policy through the use of the Lubua’s cyber-security policy. Further to 
this, the policy formulation procedure must be inclusive, and guided by existing organisation guidelines. 
The maximum of three (3) years is recommended for policy review. The formalisation of the policy 
document must be approved by the top authority of the organisation.

1. Introduction
The number of crimes conducted through cyber platforms is growing fast across the globe. Globally, cybercrimes 
are projected to cost economic investments about six (6) trillion US$ annually, by 2021. This projection suggests 
the increase in cyber incidents to individual users and organisations (Saunders, 2017; Herjavec Group, 2017). 
Unfortunately, nearly half of all attacks are committed to small businesses (Herjavec Group, 2017). The situation 
is more alarming because of undocumented incidents, hence, the situation is likely to be worse. It is unarguable 
that the prevalence of cyber offenses is not suitable for social, political and the economic activities, because users 
become preys to criminals (International Telecommunication Union, 2009). Cybercrimes may lead to the 
defamation of the reputation of an individual, and/or loss of money (Lewis, 2018). Further to this, cybercriminals

policies do not adequately address security issues. Therefore, a total reliance to them would jeopardise the 
organisation. This study, in support of other studies such as Gagliardi, Hankin, Gal-Ezer, McGettrick and Meitern 
(2016), strongly support the formalisation of all cyber guidelines, through a process that solicit opinions from 
stakeholders, and finally receive approval from the top authority of the organisation. 
 
6. Conclusion and Recommendation 
This study addressed three key aspects of the cyber-security policy. First, the study developed the framework 
suitable for policy formulation. The study concludes by suggesting a cyber policy framework with seven key 
themes: Data security, Internet and network services governance, uses of company owned devices, physical 
security, incident handling and reporting, monitoring and compliance, and policy administrative issues. This study 
recommends the use of this framework in ensuring that the cyber-security policy is comprehensive. Moreover, 
study observed that the suggested case for study did not meet the framework’s expectations. This observation is 
equally supported by representatives of other organisations. Factors contributing to the lack of comprehensive 
policy, as per this study, includes the lack of knowledge on policy formulation procedures, failure to involve key 
stakeholders, the lack of formalised guidelines, and the lack of policy review. It is the recommendation of this 
study that all of these activities must be guided by the cyber-security policy or other guidelines of the organisation.

Abstract 
 
Corruption behaviors are usually happened in outsourcing cases and always affect the profit and damage 
the image of an organization. Thus, stop corruption behaviors from happening throughout grasping and 
detecting abnormal behavior pattern would be helpful. However, the patterns of abnormal behavior are 
always hard to be analyzed because those behaviors should be quantified in a higher dimensional space and 
they are sometimes correlated each other. In this research Maholanobis Distance (MD) and Decision Tree 
(DT) are integrated for abnormal behavior pattern analysis. Based on the data of all cases, the MDs of all 
case can be calculated. Then all cases are categorized by their MDs. Any case whose MD is higher than a 
threshold is labeled by abnormal while the remaining are labeled by normal. After oversampling on the 
minority class of abnormal, a DT is built by Classification and Regression Trees (CART) based on the 
labeled dataset. Finally, the combinations of criteria for abnormal categories are extracted from the tree. A 
case of maintenance outsourcing process from a conglomerate was introduced for testing. The results show 
that the combinations of criteria generated by the proposed methodology can provide more exact direction 
for investigation of corruption behavior.

Abstract 
Suppliers have an important role in the supply chain. The problem occurred in supplier, such as delay, quality and 
quantity inaccuracy in the delivery of raw materials, can cause losses to the company. It is complicated for a company 
to manage all suppliers individually, especially when the company has many suppliers. Supplier evaluation has 
become critical for company to determine the suitable action plan in managing each supplier. One effective way to 
manage different suppliers systematically is supplier segmentation. This study aims to integrate supplier evaluation 
and segmentation based on capabilities and willingness dimensions. The methods used in this study are Best-Worst 
Method (BWM) aimed to obtain the weight of supplier evaluation criteria, and Technique for Order of Preference by 
Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to obtain the final score of each supplier which will be the basis for segmenting 
suppliers. The case study is applied to cheese company in Indonesia. The results of this study are segmenting 22 
suppliers of cheese's raw materials into four different quadrants, and recommending suitable action plans to manage 
each supplier quadrant.

Introduction
Cheese company is one of the food industry which have a good prospect in the future, indicated by the growth of 
cheese sales reaching 12.5% annually in Indonesia (Indonesia Ministry of Agriculture, 2017). The key factor for a 
company’s competitiveness is the efficiency of the supply chain (Park, Shin, Chang, & Park, 2010). Suppliers have a 
very important role in the company because they have a high influence on the supply chain’s performance (Omurca, 
2013). Problems that occur with suppliers, such as delay, quality and quantity inaccuracy in the delivery of raw 
materials can cause losses to the company. 
Determining strategies in management for certain suppliers depends on supplier evaluation. One way to determine the 
right strategy for managing different suppliers is by segmentation. Supplier segmentation is done to segment various 
suppliers into groups, therefore the company can determine the suitable strategy for managing all the suppliers. 
2.
Literature Review
Supply chain management (SCM) is an approach to integrate suppliers, manufacturers, warehouses, and stores 
efficiently, therefore products can be produced and distributed with accuracy in all aspects (quantity, time, place), 
which eventually minimize the overall costs and meet service needs (Kain & Verma, 2018). Suppliers have a very 
important role in SCM, which involve suppliers evaluation problem that companies must be considered (Segura & 
81","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Pilsen, Czech Republic, July 23-26, 2019 
© IEOM Society International 
 
Suppliers in quadrant 1 are the worst suppliers. For suppliers in this segment, the company is suggested to replace 
these suppliers with better supplier alternatives (Fransiskus & Sudjatmika, 2015). For suppliers in quadrant 2, the 
company is advised to increase the capabilities of suppliers by offering assistance to improve quality with education 
and knowledge transfer, as well as setting a target for suppliers (Rezaei, Wang, & Tavasszy, 2015). The strategy that 
companies can do to increase supplier willingness in quadrant 3 is to make a long-term commitment and carry out 
communication strategies to increase supplier willingness. Suppliers in quadrant 4 are the best suppliers, therefore the 
company must strive to maintain relationships with these suppliers by improving communication and site evaluation.  
 
5. Conclusion 
 
This study on supplier evaluation and segmentation obtained 8 criteria (with 24 sub-criteria) for capabilities dimension 
and 4 criteria (with 13 sub-criteria) for willingness dimension in evaluating suppliers. Based on calculations with 
BWM, supplier evaluation sub-criteria with the highest weight on the capabilities dimension is Quality, while the 
criteria that have the highest weight for willingness dimension is Commitment to improve continuously in products 
and processes. The results of supplier segmentation for one of the cheese company in Indonesia shows that 3 suppliers 
are in quadrant 1, 3 suppliers are in quadrant 2 , 3 suppliers are in quadrant 3, and 13 suppliers are in quadrant 4. To 
manage suppliers based on the result of segmentation, the company is advised to replace suppliers in quadrant 1, 
provide quality improvement education and target setting for suppliers in quadrant 2, make long-term commitments 
and improve communications for suppliers in quadrant 3, and maintain relationships for suppliers in quadrant 4.  
 
This approach of BWM-TOPSIS for supplier evaluation and segmentation in cheese company is practical and can be 
implemented for company in other industry to manage different suppliers effectively and systematically by evaluate 
and segment its suppliers. The limitation of this study is the number of supplier quadrant, which can be increased by 
including another dimension for segmenting the suppliers. Another limitation relates to adapting the center point of 
scales (0.5) as the transition point of the low and high classification. In future research, the transition point can be 
adjusted based on the requirement of the buying company. Another recommendation for future research is by adapting 
other MCDM methods and comparing the result with BWM-TOPSIS segmentation result, to eventually identify the 
suitability of each method for different situation. Lastly, the number of experts involved can be increased to better 
validate the study.

Abstract 
Recently, companies have chosen to outsource their logistics services. These practices are carried out to achieve 
the most efficient distribution system. In the downside, there's a certain drawback. By outsourcing logistics 
service, the goods delivered are most likely to come late and these could lead to customers' dissatisfaction. In 
order to guarantee the goods arrive on time with minimal costs, redesigning distribution processes is necessary to 
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the logistics system. This study aims to design the distribution process 
improvement in one of logistics service providers in Indonesia to increase the logistics performance of the 
company by streamlining the distribution process time of goods. Business Process Reengineering method is used 
in this study, by conducting observations and interviews with dairy companies and logistics service provider 
companies, then the current distribution process is modeled and simulated using Igrafx BPMN software. 
Improvement of the distribution process is designed to generate the most efficient strategy which is a simulation 
model with a strategy of rearranging orders on Warehouse Management System (WMS) and the application of 
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), using more than one shipping vendor, and using information and tracking 
systems for distributors that achieve time efficiency  by 49,6%.

1. Introduction
Currently, companies have outsourced logistics to logistics service providers in running logistics and 
distribution systems. Third Party Logistics (3PL) is one kind of logistics service provider which specialized in 
logistics intermediary that provides full or partial logistics services to companies. 3PL companies manage 
almost all the functions of supply chain and long-term cooperation to provide effective solutions and improve 
the quality of the company's supply chain as a whole. The business growth of 3PL companies in Indonesia 
continues to increase year by year, as indicated by the projection of the use of logistics providers / 3PL services 
will continue to increase each year and 3PL business revenues will also continue to increase. The company uses 
3PL in managing supply chain activities such as material management from suppliers to product distribution to 
consumers. Based on a survey conducted on 3PL business about the important criteria for the customer, 71% 
of 3PL business choose that it is very important to improve process quality and performance to satisfy 
customers. 
3PL is also used by a Dairy Company in Indonesia for storing finished products (warehousing) and delivering 
products (delivery). Distribution of milk products of this company is divided into general trade (shipping to 
agents/distributors throughout Indonesia) and modern trade (shipping to modern markets). The shipping process 
for this company consists of the lane, which is shipping by land, and also sea freight, which is shipping by sea. 
Yet, problems are still found in the distribution management of dairy companies, namely in-time delivery of 
products to distributors, this shows that there is still inefficient activity in the distribution system. In the delivery 
performance of Dairy Company products conducted by 3PL during January to June 2018, where there were 
1344 shipping orders from a total of 2407 orders that were not delivered on time (exceeding the target set by 
the Milk Company), which resulted in delivery performance reaching only 44%.

By comparing the results of the current distribution process simulation and redesign distribution process with the 
strategy 1,2, and 3 which are strategy of replanning order with the WMS and implementing RFID, using multi-vendor 
shipping, and using information and tracking systems for distributors, the resulting process efficiency of 49.6% with 
the lowest waiting time among other proposed strategy and is able to cut the time to 10.94 days from the current 
distribution process.  
5. Conclusion 
The distribution process carried out by Third Party Logistic is still considered inefficient, this is indicated by the 
performance of on-time delivery for the Medan Area only reaching 36%. The distribution process is currently modeled 
and simulated, resulting in 22.06 days of delivery to Medan area distributors. This paper then generates improvement 
for the distribution process using the Business Process Reengineering approach, which produces four improvement 
Strategy. The distribution process improvement design produces 15 simulation models, which are then tested using 
increasing and decreasing demand scenarios. This research resulted in the most optimal distribution process with a 
rearrangement strategy on WMS, using more than one shipping vendor, and distributor tracking and information 
systems by producing a total delivery time to distributors of 11.12 days. This result shows the distribution process 
efficiency of 49.6%.

Abstract 
The production of liquid milk has many defects which result in the loss of the opportunity to gain benefits that can be 
obtained if the quality of the product complies with the prescribed standards. This study aims to determine what factors 
influence the quality of milk bottled products in the milk processing industry in Jakarta. Quality Function Deployment 
(QFD) is used to find out what factors influence the quality and how to achieve these factors. Failure Mode and Effect 
Analysis (FMEA) is used to determine the risk of potential failure of factors that achieve high credence at the QFD 
stage. The results of the data processing show that workers/operators, production equipment, and production processes 
have the highest importance in influencing product quality in the milk processing industry. The results of the data 
processing also show that the filling and sterilization process have the highest risk of causing defects with Risk Priority 
Number (RPN) above 100. Dented (body) receives an RPN of 240, channeling receives an RPN of 140, dented 
(skewed) receives an RPN of 128, and scratch receives an RPN of 120.

1. Introduction
The Processing Industry in Indonesia accounts for 19.83% and is the largest contributor to Indonesia's GDP in the 
second quarter of 2018. The Food and Beverage Industry contributes up to 31.8% of the processing industry's GDP. 
Therefore, the Food and Beverage Industry is still a mainstay sector for Indonesia's economic growth contributors. 
The growth is driven by the increase of the civil incomes and the growing of the middle-class population accompanied 
by their tendency towards the public consumption pattern which leads to consuming ready-to-eat processed food 
products. In Government Regulations number 14 of 2015 which concerns the master plan for national industrial 
development, one of the basis sectors is the food industry. One of the priority subsectors in the food industry is the 
milk processing industry. This subsector is a strategic industry group and has bright prospects to be developed, it is 
indicated by the growth rate of domestic beverage industry which is able to rise by 8.41% in the first semester of 2018. 
The number of Milk Processing Industries in Indonesia keeps increasing every year, and in 2018 the amount reaches 
36 units. 
There are three types of dairy products that are the leading intake of Indonesian people, namely sweetened condensed 
milk, powdered milk, and factory liquid milk with a percentage of 50%, 30%, and 20% respectively. The volume of 
milk consumption in Indonesia is still dominated by sweetened condensed milk by half. According to statistic of food 
consumption by Ministry of Agriculture, although liquid milk has the lowest market share, for the past five years, 
ready-to-drink liquid milk has the fastest growth rate at 25% per year, followed by sweetened condensed milk which 
grows 11% per year, while powdered milk only grows 4% per year. With the large growth rate of consumption of 
ready-to-drink liquid milk in Indonesia and the increasing number of competitors entering the market, milk processing 
companies must be able to produce high quality and nutritious dairy products. 
One of many milk processing companies in Jakarta has an average amount of liquid milk production of 66,590 liters 
per day. Based on historical data, the average number of products that do not meet established quality standard is 
1,940 cartons out of 320,699 cartons produced or equivalent to 0.62% per month, even though the company determines

In this study, experts consider that the factors of organizational culture and management of labor do not have a large 
influence on the quality of the products. This result is contrary to (Lombard et al., 2014) which stated that 
organizational culture and labor management are important factors that affect the quality of the products.  
 
Based on the results of in-depth interviews with experts in companies who control liquid milk production, it is stated 
that, in other branch factories, there are differences in the tools used in the production process, namely baskets. Baskets 
that are used in Jakarta factories do not have barriers for each bottle, while in other factories the baskets have barriers 
for each bottle. The difference results in a number of different defects. For example, if one uses a basket without a 
partition, the dented products will be produced to a large degree because the products in the basket without the 
bulkhead will intersect with each other. In other words, there will be no limit, but the level of the scratch product is 
small. On the other hand, if one uses baskets with bulkheads, the products will not come into contact with each other 
so the damage to the dented category products is minimal. However,  due to the bulkhead in the basket, the possibility 
of the product being shaken is very high, causing the product head in the form of aluminum foil scratched with the 
upper layer. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
A reliable worker/operator (QR1), a good production process (QR6), and adequate production tools (QR7) are three 
main factors that influence product quality in the milk processing industry. The complexity of production process 
design (TR 3.2); separation of high-risk materials during storage and handling (TR 2.4); and conducting the production 
process according to the procedure or written instruction (TR 7.3) are 3 TR with the highest relative importance. The 
filling and sterilization process have the highest potential of causing defects with an RPN above 100. Dented (body) 
has an RPN of 240, channeling has an RPN of 140, the dented body has an RPN of 128, and dented (skewed) has an 
RPN of 120. Failure in form of a flat bottle gets the highest severity (9), but the ranking for the occurrence frequency 
and the current detection control is so low that the resulting RPN is small. 
 
Based on the results of the above analysis, managerial advice and recommendations that goes accordingly with the 
current condition of the company and can be applied to reduce defects are by replacing the layer with the new one and 
analyzing the layer material currently used to see whether it is suitable for the existing requirements.  Therefore, to 
suppress the number of dents, benchmarking can be done to other branch factories regarding the temperature used for 
the sterilization process in order to reduce the risk of overheating,  resulting the bottle to deform from its initial form. 
In addition to improve the tools and methods used, it is also important to provide problem solving training for 
workers/operators to enhance their skill in taking action as well as increase their contribution in every job (production 
process) that is carried out, such as when there is temperature or pressure instability, workers/operators in the field 
must be able to take an action so that the damage is not too severe.

Abstract 
The increasing electricity demand and consumption push electricity supply must always be available in maximum 
capacity. Selection of suppliers is an important process to overcome the risk of failure in procurement, but it is a 
difficult task because it takes many consideration based on the criteria. This study proposes a selection model of 
spare parts suppliers in power plants using a combination of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preference 
Ranking of Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) method. AHP is used to determine the 
importance weight of criteria and PROMETHEE to produce a ranking of suppliers. This model is applied to select 
suppliers for fin tube and solenoid valve. Results show that Supplier D, which has the shortest lead time even not 
the lowest price, is selected out of four suppliers for fin tube and Supplier E, which has the lowest price with the 
shortest lead time, is selected from three suppliers for solenoid valve. This paper also tests 3 number of scenarios 
against the model.

1. Introduction
Electricity is crucial nowadays. In Indonesia, consumption per capita continues to increase each year which is also in 
line with the increase in the electrification ratio. By June 2018 the achievement of the electrification ratio is at 
97.50%. In maintaining electricity production in Indonesia, operations and maintenance activities are carried out at 
the power plant. Supply Chain Management (SCM) activities facilitate operations and maintenance for a power 
plant. The procurement process is a vital process in SCM because it is the spearhead of the whole process  (Rozi & 
Herowati, 2018).  
Supplier selection is the most important activity in the procurement department (Sun, Xie, & Xue, 2005), while the 
success of a supply chain system greatly effect the selection on the selection of good suppliers. Selection of 
suppliers in the procurement process can reduce the risk of procurement failure that will affect other processes. But, 
the selection of suppliers is difficult because it must consider both qualitative and quantitative criteria (Hanane, 
Brahim, & Bouchra, 2015). The integration development model of AHP and PROMETHEE is proposed to select 
spare parts suppliers for power plants. 
2. Literature Review
2.1. Supplier Selection 
The success of a supply chain system has significant impact on the selection of good suppliers (Chung, 2015). In the 
context of a business competition environment, supplier selection and evaluation process plays important role in the 
performance of a company. Supplier selection is the process where suppliers are reviewed, evaluated, and selected to 
be part of the organization's supply chain (Mukherjee, 2017). The main objectives of supplier selection are to 
minimize purchasing risk, maximize value for buyers, and build close and long-term relationships between buyers 
and suppliers. However, the process of selecting suppliers can be time-consuming and requires resources to collect

From the results of scenario 1, it can be seen that the preference function greatly influences the results. In scenario 1, 
Supplier D is less preferred than Supplier C because supplier D does not offer the lowest price. In the normal 
condition of price preference function value, supplier D is not absolutely defeated against C price preference, but 
preference function in type 1 will only give preference function value 1 or 0 then supplier C has full value for the 
price criterion. 
 
The results of scenarios 2 raise supplier B's rank to the third, since B has shorter lead time than supplier A. For 
solenoid valve supplier, the ranking is the same as in the normal condition. 
 
From the result of scenario 3 for selecting fin tube supplier, supplier A is blacklisted because the lead time exceeds 
the specified one. Supplier C initially has a longer lead time from suppliers D and B, but because the lead time 
weight is no longer used for ranking, as long as it does not exceed the standard, supplier C becomes the most 
preferred choice. The order of solenoid valve suppliers has not changed in scenario 3. 
 
5. Conclusion  
 
The integration model is developed using AHP-PROMETHEE method. Five criteria with 19 sub-criteria to select 
spare parts suppliers for the power plant are obtained . The most important sub-criteria is product spesification. A 
case study was conducted for selecting fin tube and solenoid valve suppliers. The best results for fin-tube suppliers 
are suppliers D with the shortest lead times, even though not the cheapest. Best supplier for solenoid valve was 
supplier E which has the lowest price with the shortest lead time. From the 4 scenarios carried out in this study 
scenario 1 changes the order of fin tube and solenoid valve suppliers, scenarios 2 change the order of fin tube 
suppliers but not with solenoid valve supplier. Scenario 3 reduces the supplier's proposal and changes the order of 
the fin tube supplier but not on the solenoid valve.

Abstract 
Internet of Things (IoT) can be a solution for hospitals to improve the efficiency and quality of operational services, 
however with technical and non-technical barriers such as costs, organization, and experience of users when using 
IoT, it cannot be implemented directly in all parts of the hospital. The aim of this study is to establish a framework to 
prioritize which hospital units to be implemented the Internet of Things (IoT) technology based on their current 
performance. This research used DEMATEL (Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory) based ANP 
(Analytical Network Process) method to calculate the influence weight between factors. VIKORRUG 
(VlseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje for Ranking Unimproved Gap) method was used to analyze 
the performance gaps in 9 units at a private hospital in Jakarta. Based on the results of calculations, the Emergency 
Room (UR3) has the highest priority to be implemented with IoT. After doing four scenarios of extreme circumstances, 
it was found that the One-Day-Care has the highest priority to be implemented with IoT instead.

Introduction
Population growth in Indonesia is growing rapidly. It is estimated that by 2034 the population will reach more than 
303 million. As population continues to grow, the needs for health services are also increasing. The number of 
hospitals in Indonesia in 2018 already reached a total of 2,841, which increased by 5,2% since 2012. The comparison 
between the number of private and government hospitals is 66.7% and 33.3%. 
IoT can be used as a solution to improve services in hospital. Globally, about 60% of hospitals have implemented IoT 
in their service systems (Aruba Networks, 2017). IoT is a technological innovation that can help hospitals to easily 
process a variety of information in order to treat patients appropriately and reduce treatment errors. By 2020 there will 
be as many as 26 billion units of devices connected to the Internet of Things (Falcone & Sapienza, 2018). Prior to 
implementation of IoT technology in the system, hospitals have to consider the barriers such as organizational 
problems, financing, and user experience (Moore, 2018). The aim of this study is to establish a framework to prioritize 
which hospital units to be implemented the Internet of Things (IoT) technology based on their current performance.

Literature Review
IoT is introduced by Ashton in 1999 (Gubbi, Buyya, Marusic, & Palaniswami, 2013) which stated that computers can 
observe, identify, and understand anything in the world without human intervention by using IoT technology (Ashton, 
2009). IoT concept has the purpose to increase the benefits of internet connectivity in human life (Dachyar & Risky, 
2014).  
IoT has entered various industries including logistics, manufacturing, maritime, transportation, and healthcare (Gubbi 
et al., 2013). Some of the benefits from IoT have been experienced in many hospitals in the world. Most IoT systems 
that currently exist are used for patient and device monitoring, energy use scanners, and location-based services (Aruba 
Networks, 2017).

4.2 Analyses of Scenarios 
This research calculates the priority results of unit selection with four scenarios of extreme circumstances. In the first 
scenario, there is a global spread of viruses but those viruses have not attacked this hospital yet. The importance of 
security dimension is increased to 100%. The result shows that the priority change from the Emergency Room unit to 
the One-Day-Care unit as we can see in Table 4.

In the second scenario, we examine the priority results of unit selection if the viruses had already attacked the hospital. 
IT capability, organizational readiness, and good technical knowledge are needed in the organization to recover lost 
data. The importance of the organizational dimension is increased to 100%. It was found that there was no change in 
priority and the Emergency Room was still the first choice. 
 
In the third scenario, we examine the priority results of unit selection if the internet network or system are shut down 
globally. Technology possessed by each unit must be ready to be used and the organization must be prepared to deal 
with this situation. The importance of the technology and organizational dimensions are increased to 75%. It was 
found that there was a change in priority from the Emergency Room to the nursery. 
 
In the final scenario, we examine the results of unit selection priorities if the hospital wants to obtain an accreditation 
regarding technological innovation. A high level of competitiveness and superior technology are needed. The 
importance of the environmental and technological dimensions are increased by 50%. It was found that there was a 
change of priority from the Emergency Room to One Day Care. Summary of priority results before and after the 
scenario can be seen in Table 5.

5. Conclusion 
This research found 29 factors with 5 dimensions that can influence the implementation of IoT in hospitals. The 
dimensions that have been used in this research are Technology, Organization, Environment, Security, and Cost. We 
found that Environment, Technology, and Security dimensions have big influence on other dimensions. Hospitals 
should focus on three units that had the smallest gap because these units had performance values that are close to the

level of aspiration. These units include Emergency Room (UR3), One-Day-Care (UR9), and Babies Room (UR6). 
After doing scenarios of extreme circumstances, it was found that the One-Day-Care unit was the first priority unit 
for IoT implementation.

Abstract 
The study seeks to develop an evaporative cooler that can assist the small scale agro producers in preserving and 
maintaining the quality of vegetables, to avoid the deterioration which may result in possible decline in market 
value. It was established that the lack of cheap and effective preservation methods has constantly created a problem 
for small scale farmers in the country. Three cooling system concepts were generated. The best solution was chosen 
by the use of binary dominance matrix for further development into a detailed design development. Simulations 
were done using solid works on the operations of the unit. Also cost and evaluations were carried to test the 
feasibility of the concept implementation. It was recommended that tests be carried out before large scale production 
of the refrigerator to accommodate any relevant practical adjustments for functionality.

1. Introduction
In Zimbabwe, agriculture forms an important role in ensuring food security. The diverse agro-climatic conditions 
prevailing in the country enables the growing of many crops and vegetables (Narman 1991). There is need to reduce 
the deterioration process of vegetables thus making possible an appreciable gain in terms of shelf life and marketing 
periods (James and James 2013).Most people in the country rely on selling agricultural produce to earn a living and 
they are also involved in farming to ensure they have food for their families. Small scale farmers grow vegetables 
and fruits. Most of the post-harvest losses incurred on agricultural produce are mainly due to inadequate produce 
preservation or storage facilities. The vegetables need to be as fresh as possible for good market value. Vegetables 
like tomatoes always create problems for storage and transportation because they are perishable in nature. Such 
losses are significant in developing countries due to less investment in produce preservation. In developing 
countries, statistics show that post-harvest loss ranges from 20 to 50% (Kader 1992). It is against this background 
that some study is necessary to develop a cooling system that is affordable, environmentally friendly and big enough 
to store varied vegetable produce. Lower quality vegetables has reduced market value, there is need to create an 
effective produce preservation method for small scale. 
2. Background
Chilling increases the life of food before any signs of decay are identifiable. The process involves the lowering and 
maintaining of the temperature of a product such that bad changes which can occur to the quality of the produce are 
significantly reduced. These changes include growth of microorganisms, color changes and loss of nutrients and 
moisture (James and James 2013).  Temperature reduction sometimes increases a food nutrient value. Lower 
temperatures decrease significantly microbial activity (James and James 2013). Consumers regard chilled food to be

6. Recommendations and conclusion 
 
The research conducted throughout this study showed the importance of food preservation and how the evaporative 
cooling could be employed in food preservation.  
The developments and design of the cooling unit was important although there is need for continuous improvement 
for the design. This refrigerator unit  is specific for vegetable since it does not freeze foods. It is effective in the 
preservation of vegetables (i.e. temperature values above 0 C
°
), but it is not able to freeze food below the 0 C
°
mark.  
To make this a universal cooler, there is need to improve it so that it is able to freeze foods. It is recommended to 
use modern control electronic devices like microprocessors to adjust the temperature of the cooler. Other foods 
especially meats are best preserved when they are in frozen form, therefore there is need to improve the performance 
of this design. 
It is recommended that this unit can be improved on a larger scale for use on farms and market gardening units to 
store a variety of vegetables before taking them to the market in a fresh condition.

Abstract 
This research study assessed the challenges faced in managing e-waste in the case study industrial area with a view 
to develop a sustainable e-waste management framework for e-waste generated by industries based in the vicinity. A 
questionnaire based survey was use to evaluate e-waste management methods currently implemented by industrial 
operators; and to establish challenges restricting e-waste management. Effort was made to characterize the e-waste 
generated by various operations in the area. The survey established that resulting lack of e-waste strategy was 
attributed to low awareness levels, and lack of procedures or technology to manage e-waste hence no proper 
collection and disposal of e-waste, high growth of e-waste, lack of e-waste policy and stakeholder collaboration. The 
study recommended the development of a framework towards a sustainable e-waste management system which 
entails a process of e-waste inventory management routine, proper collection and recycling schemes as well as 
possible strategic and synergistic approaches towards e-waste management.

1. Introduction
Industrialization has been greatly influenced by advancement in technology hence most industries are now 
incorporating electrical and electronic equipment in order to enhance production processes. However, the high 
obsolescence rate of these equipment and related components has seen the maintenance management crews in most 
industries experiencing an increasing inventory of discarded electrical and electronic equipment. According to 
(Gaidajis et al 2010), all components, consumables and sub-assemblies which are part of any electrical and 
electronic equipment when obsolete are categorized as electrical or electronic waste (e-waste). E-waste is one of the 
fastest growing waste streams worldwide and it constitutes of valuable metals and non-metals as well as hazardous 
substances such as lead and mercury that contaminate the environment (Mahajana et al 2015). In an attempt to 
effectively manage such form of waste, there is need for safe, scientific and environmental sound treatment methods 
that are governed by adequate infrastructure and policies as requirement (UNEP 2007). Integrated waste 
management procedures which involve reuse and recycling are adopted as the most preferred treatment methods to 
attain the benefits of reduced environmental health threats whilst realizing conceivable economic incentives from 
the electronic waste materials. Despite the possible benefits of e-waste management, Zimbabwe like most of the 
developing countries lacks a defined e-waste treatment strategy. At industrial level, conventional methods of solid 
waste management have proved failure to accommodate e-waste. Many at times when repairs or replacements are 
done, the unwanted electrical and electronic equipment components are just added to the increasing inventory due to 
lack of a proper framework to manage these obsolete items. As a result, there rises a need to urgently characterize 
the nature of e-waste being generated in various industry operations, evaluate the current e-waste handling methods 
hence design an enhanced and practical framework for the effective e-waste management implementable in the local 
industrial environment.

collection (47%), drop off (45%) and curbside collection (8%).Therefore, the researchers identified that the most 
appropriate approach for collection of EOL electronics is for industrial consumers to bring their e-waste material to 
permanent collection points that will be set in the locality. However, permanent collection points carry pitfalls in that 
they shall require costs in storage infrastructure and supervision although the process of mounting such collection 
points will act as a recycling awareness campaign to the industrial community. Collection infrastructure requires 
establishment of e-waste collection points and storage area in a geographical region. Basing on this assumption, one 
collection point is proposed because the number of industries is generally lower than the required numbers to launch 
one collection site, hence the single collection point can be thought to be favorable to accommodate all. Thus, a 
central position in the area would be best suited as a location for a collection centre, and such a locality should be 
easily interlinked to every other industry via a well planned road network. Proper storage is achieved by providing 
sorting container specific to each e-waste product collected to ensure that the waste is segregated. The researcher 
proposed that products for cooling appliances such as refrigerators/freezer, display equipment with CRT tubes such 
as desktop computers, lighting devices dominated by fluorescent bulbs shall be separately stored from all other 
containers with e-waste materials such as passive components. Containers of appropriate size and shape should be 
used for segregation of e-waste items to facilitate effective handling. Furthermore, containers can be made either of 
wood or plastic or mild steel or any appropriate material with sufficient strength for holding the e-waste. 
Segregation of the collected e-waste components is essential in that, components such as CRTs and florescent lights 
contain glass hence fragile and easily break to release hazardous substances contained in them such as lead in CRTs 
and mercury in fluorescent tubes. Adding to that, refrigerators and air conditioners carry the risk of leakage of 
compressor oils, CFCs/HCFCs if any. Passive components such as transformers, motors and electrolytic capacitors 
might be containing oils as well hence should be segregated properly to avoid spillages. Impermeable surfaces on 
the storage area will be a necessity to avoid leachates from e-waste components to penetrate the soil and affect 
underground water tables.  
8. Recommendations 
The gaps found by the researchers, included insufficiency in addressing the uniqueness of e-waste and lack of  
clarity on key stakeholders’ roles in e-waste management. A suggested rectified policy will not stop e-waste but 
regulate its disposal, handling and management infrastructure and processes hence reducing its effects to the health 
of citizens and the environment. This could be implementable through higher taxes on substandard products or 
engaging certified distributors of original equipment manufacturers. Licenses could be issued to local recyclers 
hence initiate development of formal e-waste collection and recovery facilities. The local authorities could also 
formulate by-laws to manage e-waste at industrial levels such that the uniqueness of the waste in observed and 
institute proper segregation prior to disposal. Economic and regulatory incentives could be developed to stimulate 
best practices like importation of green equipment in the industrial environment. There is need to improve awareness 
level among stakeholders on e-waste handling techniques, economic opportunities realized the resource value of the 
waste and its hazards due improper handling. The improved awareness ensures for the increased number of 
participants in the e-waste management system hence effective collection and treatment of the targeted waste. The 
industrial community therefore requires an e-waste fund establishment to ensure sustainable financing of e-waste 
management activities. Sustainable funding will ensure proper collection and disposal infrastructure. The waste 
recyclers need to be given operational license to accommodate e-waste collection and treatment since the recyclers 
have potential to modify their systems to include e-waste. 
 
9. Conclusion 
The outcomes of the study would serve as a model when developing e-waste management systems for other 
industrial areas. Furthermore the research yielded the required background knowledge for the authorities, when they 
draft a policy to regulate e-waste. The research would also be an eye opener to the local investors to venture into the 
lucrative trade of e-waste recycling, a topic hardly mentioned in the local industry. This will enlighten local 
manufacturers that they can save a lot by reuse of the waste thus reduced sourcing for virgin raw materials as well as 
energy in processing them. The study raised awareness on the dangers associated with e-waste mismanagement 
hence saving the environment.

Abstract 
This study seeks to develop a motorized car jack with maximum lifting capacity of 2 tons. The design incorporates 
an electric motor that is powered by a 12-volt battery of a small vehicle and the device would be connected through 
a cigarette lighter adapter in the vehicle. The common challenge with the currently available car jacks on the market 
is that they are manually operated and need a substantial amount of physical effort is required to lift the vehicle. The 
authors generated three possible solution concepts based on simple engineering techniques and knowledge of 
existing jacks. Binary Dominance Matrix analysis was used to evaluate and determine the best solution for further 
development into a detailed design. Solid works 2016 software was used to simulate the operation and loading of the 
resultant design. The purpose of this study is to try and modify the design of the already existing car jack in use.

Jack, hydraulic, motorized, design, vehicle 
1. Introduction
In existence there are a range of car jacks that are designed to lift a vehicle from the ground. Most of these are however manually 
operated which implies that they require extra physical effort from the operator. This may mean that it is not easy for elderly and 
handicapped to operate them. For operation of these jacks, operators are required to be in prolonged squatting position for some 
duration which can lead to the problem of backache. World over the car jack is an essential device all car owners should possess 
to assist in servicing their car when need arises and normally, the need is often necessitated by flat tires that need repair or 
replacement. This study seeks to reduce labor in the car lifting process using a jack as most car jacks are manually operated there 
is need to modify them and incorporate them with a prime mover system which replaces manual handling of jacks during 
operation making it easier and reducing drudgery during maintenance operations. Also time consumption in the process of 
hoisting a vehicle will be reduced as using the available manually operated car jacks is a very time consuming process, thus there 
is need to design a motorized jack that improves the timeliness and efficiency in lifting. There will be reduced risk of injury as it 
is known that for a car jack to be hoisted, the operator has got to be near the vehicle and operating close to the vehicle during 
jacking is risky, so to reduce the risk of getting injury in the case of malfunctioning of the device the motorized jacking system 
enables operator to be at a safe distance during the jacking process. 
2. Background
During road-side emergency like tire puncher, a jack is required to lift the vehicle (Choudhary 2016). It has also 
been noted that the roadside assistance to come and assist, is not readily available in the remote rural roads of the 
country. Vehicle workshops are equipped with hi-tech car lifting system where vehicles are raised and lowered using 
an electrically powered system. However, this is not the case for portable lifting devices. Due to the high cost, 
maintenance and size, such lifting devices have been found to be mostly confined to work in workshops only and 
such functionality can neither be placed in car nor be owned by vehicle owners. Hence there is need to design a 
motorized portable car jack that does not only reduce human efforts but also save time needed to repair the vehicle 
and that is easy and safe to use. This will be an advantage when it comes to replacing a vehicle tire on the roadside.

6. Recommendations  
The system is associated with a certain level of vibration due to the rotation of the motor and also other components 
like the gears and links. Therefore the system can be equipped with rubbers in the linkages since the rubbers absorb 
some of the vibration energy. This also reduces the noise associated with such kind of a system. A remote control 
system can also be incorporated to improve the compatibility of the system by limiting the amount of cabling needed 
for the motorized jack electrical components. Also this enhances safety of the jack and ease of use. The device can 
also be designed to operate using android application. An alternative power source should also be availed as part of 
the motorized jack kit, to avoid problems when say, the car battery is flat. This prompts future scope to also involve 
the development of an alternative power source to the jack. A solar and battery system can be incorporated into the 
device so that it can function in such a way that the solar panel is used to charge a 12V battery. A scope can be 
considered to look beyond a maximum of a 2-ton vehicle, and develop the jack for it to be applicable even to be 
used for heavy duty vehicles. 
 
7. Conclusion 
The principle of the existing car jack was modified by making adjustments and using a prime mover which is the 
electric motor to control the lifting operation of the jack. The car battery (12V) is used to supply power source to the 
motor. Human effort was eliminated in raising the jack by the use of the torque generated by the motor as in rotates. 
The use of long cablings to control the motorized operation meant the jack would be safe to use as the operator can 
use the jack in a comfortable position and as far away from the vehicle as possible. The torque supplied to the 
system is more than enough to lift a vehicle weighing around 2000 kg (2 ton). This design of the motorized carjack 
can considered to be a huge benefit in the lifting and lowering of 2 ton vehicles.

Abstract 
The manufacturing process optimization problems are complex owing to the non-linear relationships and interactions 
may occur among process factors. Traditionally, engineers commonly employ the experimental design to resolve the 
problem. However, the experimental method has some limitations in practice. This study applies computational 
intelligence approaches to solve the process optimization problem. A real case study of a casting company located in 
Taiwan is demonstrated. In this case, the process output, tensile strength, is the larger the better. First, engineers from 
different areas of expertise formed a team and field-based data were collected for process improvement. Based on 
engineering knowledge, the project team identified some possible factors that may affect the tensile strength. Then, 
feature selection techniques, including neural network, regression analysis, support vector machine, random forest, 
and rough set theory were implemented to screen out the important process factors that affect the process output. The 
final key process factors for further study were selected by the majority rule. Next, the team utilized these key process 
factors to predict the tensile strength by using the backpropagation neural network. The trained network, describing 
the relationship between the process factors and the process output, was employed as the fitness function in the genetic 
algorithm. The control factor values were then transformed into a chromosome to represent the potential solution. By 
setting appropriate parameters, genetic algorithm was used to optimize the solution. In this study genetic algorithm 
was executed in several runs and the best solution from each run was saved. The optimal solution with the highest 
tensile strength was selected from these possible solutions. By using this optimal solution in the manufacturing process, 
the case company can significantly improve the product quality and reduce manufacturing costs.

Abstract 
Engineering graduates’ inability to apply theoretical knowledge in practice has become a challenge during the 
graduates’ transition into the industry. Engineering graduates require the competence to apply theoretical 
knowledge. Through experiential learning, and with the assistance of a senior and/or experienced professional acting 
as mentors, this is achievable. This study explores the perspectives of academic and industry professionals with an 
engineering, construction and academic background on what benefits mentoring provide in getting the engineering 
graduates to build the relevant practical skills. A qualitative research approach using semi-structured interviews was 
conducted with participants. The study findings based on the analysis of data collected shows that through 
mentoring graduates accelerate career development, experiential learning, and skills development. Mentoring can 
foster the acquisition of the practical skills required for the engineering graduates to be attracted, integrated and 
established in the industry. Graduates also become aware of the significance of mentoring in exposing them to 
experiential learning and professional development. They are therefore better informed to participate in mentoring. 
Organisations and employers therefore become more encouraged to support mentoring programmes in generating 
competent human capitals. 
Keywords 
Engineering graduates, experiential learning, mentoring, engineering professionals.   
1. Introduction
One of the increasingly important ways that graduates attain competency and the ability to establish a successful 
career path in the industry is experiential learning, that is, the acquisition of practical skills and access to relevant 
experience. Lack of experience or practical skills has been associated with the issue of engineering graduates’ 
inability to enter the workplace and industry (Du Toit & Roodt, 2008; ECSA, 2012; SAICE, 2006; Sandelands & 
Hall, 2009).  The engineering and construction industry in general assesses graduates based on their practical skills 
background for their attraction and retention in the industry (Custovic, 2015; Locurcio & Mitvalsky, 2002). As a 
result, it is important for engineering graduates to access opportunities that will support their ability to acquire 
experiential knowledge. 
Previous attempts focused on addressing graduate engineers’ lack of experience or practical skills through skills 
development programmes, job shadowing, holiday placements and other initiatives is not always successful (ECSA, 
2012; Mateus, Allen-Ile & Iwu, 2014; Sandelands & Hall, 2009). Similarly, numerous researches have been 
conducted on the lack of skills among engineering graduates and how it affects their attraction into the workplace or 
industry (Chetty, Bird & Lawless, 2016; Du Toit & Roodt, 2008; Mateus, Allen-Ile & Iwu, 2014; Sandelands & 
Hall, 2009). Of utmost importance is that industry requires the continuous availability of experienced engineering 
professionals to take up professional responsibilities (Du Toit & Roodt 2008; ECSA, 2012).  
Presently existing literature relates to the importance of mentoring and how mentoring approach is vital in 
developing practical skills, building and facilitation of knowledge base of an individual based on experiential 
learning (Akili, 2014; Custovic, 2015; Marsh, 2017; Mavuso, 2007; Vesilind, 2001). Marsh (2017) stated that the

Three of the participants are of the views that multiple mentors are very crucial in the life of the graduates because 
mentors will identify mentee’s area of strength in terms of soft skills and guide them accordingly, and by learning 
new skills, learning new concepts and understanding skills, graduate’s benefits from mentoring. Literature 
established that organisations uses mentoring or mentoring programme as a means of bridging the skills gap that 
exists between academic learning and the practical skills required by graduates to transition into the industry (Akili, 
2017; Baldwin & Hemingway, 2010; Marsh, 2017).  
 
In contrast, a participant felt that mentors will only be alerted to the need for students or graduates to develop these 
skills but that it is the student or graduate’s responsibility to develop and practice the skills. Two of the participants 
also expressed that a lot of these skills should instead be accommodated within the study programmes or should be 
part of professional training. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
Mentoring has been established from literature to be beneficial in the area of experiential learning and practical 
skills acquisition. Most specifically, mentoring has been associated with career, academic, and personal 
development. Through mentoring, the engineering graduates have access to opportunities to acquire the needed 
practical skills and gather the knowledge necessary for the industry. Thus, engineering graduates are encouraged to 
access mentoring as senior professionals share experience and transfer knowledge to assist them in acquiring the 
needed practical skills.  
 
Participants in this study gave the benefits that mentoring provides as; career development, experiential learning, 
and skills development. It is clear from the findings and literature reviewed that the impact of mentoring on 
graduates’ professional and personal development can be quite significant. This study details the benefits associated 
with mentoring. The perspectives shared by the participants suggest that mentoring will have a significant impact on 
graduates’ personal and professional development with resulting effects for experiential learning. The literature on 
mentoring is increasingly demonstrating that mentoring has significant benefits including its impact in experiential 
learning. Students and young graduates are the future generation of professional engineers and they depend on the 
senior professionals to access relevant experience.  
 
The senior engineering professionals have a part to play in getting the students and young graduates competent. The 
senior engineering professionals should therefore be accessible and be willing to share experience and transfer 
knowledge to the younger generation. Mentoring assists students and graduates to have access to experiential 
learning and practical skills acquisition. A carefully organised mentoring experience or opportunity can significantly 
impact their experience in project based learning. Overall, the recognition and practice of mentoring in this crucial 
environment shows how vast and how beneficial it is.

Abstract 
This paper reviews the extent of the disruptive nature of Industry 4.0 technologies applied to existing manufacturing 
industries. The inherent efficient and precision nature presented within the Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and the 
nine pillars of Industry 4.0 technologies will increasingly exploit industry operations. This development of strategies 
and the impact thereof is significant for the drivers impacting on competitive forces within industry as well as 
consumers across the globe. 
The paper objective will therefore by means of research study illustrates how to (i) critically analyse the current 
developments of the nine pillars Industry 4.0 (ii) identify the dynamics of CPS’s in the short term and (iii) how a 
multitude of exponential improvements can be realised for the early adopters of a digital strategy as a catalyst for 
increased organisational capability maturity through exponential continuous improvements and sustained innovation 
opportunities. 
The research results obtained therefore assisted in the design and testing of a comprehensive integrated Lean Six-
Sigma (LSS), Critical Success Factors (CSF’s), Design For Six Sigma (DFSS) and CMMI framework interacting 
and supported by Industry 4.0. The developed framework is undergoing testing at an international auto manufacturer 
in South Africa. The framework will assist the organisation to optimise processes and product quality coupled with 
product performance transcending into successful capability maturity outcomes in the pursuit of increased customer 
loyalty.

1. Introduction  
Continuous Improvement remains a pursuit to perfection striving for improvement in products, services and 
processes. Two classifications of improvements are observed, with one characterised through incremental 
improvement over a period of sustained Kaizen activities and another of breakthrough improvement of all at once.

(2016) and  in Geissbauer, Vedso, J. and Schrauf, S. (2016) underlines the significance and the necessity to 
comprehensively position and also strategically adjust the organisations position to use Industry 4.0 technology to 
improve the customer relationship, market penetration, operational efficiency such as cost and speed and ultimately 
secure a sustainable and integrated organisational CI strategy inclusive of capability maturity. 
 
 
Figure 3. CMMI 4.0 - Integrated Capability Maturity Model developed to harness 
multiple Continuous Improvement methodologies within CMMI. 
The constant review of Industry 4.0 as enablers to increased cost and customer satisfaction metrics are pivotal in 
achieving CMMI level 4 and 5 but also economically. 
The CMMI 4.0 framework includes a plethora of existing ISO standards and some in advance stages of review and 
development, affording the user a navigation map in achieving increased levels of Continuous Improvement with a 
linear increase in organisational maturity capability. 
 
10. Conclusion 
The final graphical representation of an integrated framework constructed (figure 3) was) made possible with 
analysis of standardised tools available and inputs in Phase A.  The results of the extensive empirical research 
undertaken confirm the validity of the research objectives.  
The research objectives reliability and inter-correlation for CSF’s identified are high and acceptable. This would 
apply to all of the research objectives such as CSF’s confirmation for LSS and CSF’s establishment for DFFS 
(Research Objectives 1 and 2), the Contribution of CMM to LSS and DFSS implementation (Research Objective 3), 
the significance of Leadership in achieving, Capability Maturity (Research Objective 4) and how an integrated 
framework assist organisations to achieve Capability Maturity (Research Objective 5).  
It is concluded that the theoretical integrated Capability Maturity Model proposed in Figure 4 (CCMI 4.0) as well as 
the five Research Objectives identified and assessed are valid and provides for construct of a hybrid Continuous 
Improvement framework. This assumption is based on organisational capability maturity proposed in CMMI and 
ISO standards necessary for the dynamics of the technology influx presented to organisations in Industry 4.0.

Final note is that it is observed that numerous organisations do not embrace either DFSS, Agile Scrum, CMM or 
TOC as part of their CI strategy. The impact of Industry 4.0 technology on organisational improvement is vast but 
unfortunately also not understood by many organisations. The limited responses for DFSS deployment suggest that 
the CSF’s determined in the research document requires additional research and could change the CSF’s identified 
but also their ranking of importance.

Abstract 
Indonesian’s population is one of the highest in the world and create a potential market in the service industry 
especially healthcare. By the end of 2019, 85% of world business plans will implement Internet of Things 
(IoT). Implementation of IoT was driven by business innovation and business efficiency. This paper aims to 
establish a framework to integrate Internet of Things in healthcare industry especially hospital, in order to 
improve the overall quality of healthcare processes. Six experts’ opinions are used to identify the relationship 
and select the factors and sub factors that supports the integration of Internet of Things in Indonesian hospital. 
Analytic Network Process (ANP) method is used to obtain the decision priority of healthcare practices 
supported by the implementation of Internet of Things. Zero-One Goal Programming (ZOGP) method is used to 
choose which healthcare practices will be implemented based on the optimal number of IT’s employees, 
decision priority of ANP, procurement cost, installation cost, training cost, maintenance cost constraints. The 
case study was conducted to private and public hospitals in Jakarta.

1. Introduction
Indonesian’s population has an average annual increase of more than 1%. By 2035 there will be more than 305 
million people living in Indonesia (Badan Pusat Statistik, 2014). This relatively high number of population 
attracts service sector especially in healthcare  industry. In 2018 there are 2776 hospitals all over Indonesia, 
where more than 63% of them are private hospitals. Once again this shows how much potential the healthcare 
industry in Indonesia has (Kementerian Kesehatan RI, 2018). 
With such a great potential offered in healthcare industry, healthcare provider couldn’t keep up with the 
customers’ standards. As reported by the government, healthcare issues is the most discussed and complained 
topic. The report stated that healthcare issues become the number one most complained issues in 2017 and early 
2018 (LAPOR!, 2017, 2018b, 2018a). 
By the end of 2019 85% of business plans will implement IoT, this plan was driven by two main objective: 
Business innovation and Business efficiency. Report showed benefits of implementing IoT far exceeds the 
expectation, these will drive the business world to massively adopt IoT in 2019 (Aruba Networks, 2017). 
About 60% of healthcare organizations in the world have adopted IoT, 80% of them clearly see the benefits of 
such adoption and 73% of them stated that one of the biggest benefit is cost saving (Aruba Networks, 2017). In 
this paper we, try to establish a framework to integrate Internet of Things in healthcare industry especially 
hospital, in order to improve the overall quality of healthcare processes Indonesia.

Based on the result obtained from scenario 1 through 3, it can be seen that budget constraint is inelastic to the 
objective function. In scenario 2 when the budget multiplier is increased by 100%, it only improves the 
objective function by 30.6%, whereas decreasing the budget multiplier by 50% in scenario 3 only worsen the 
objective function by 12.41%. This difference in objective function is solely affected by the first constraint 
(weight of ANP). 
    
5. Conclusion  
 
This research found 8 factors and 29 sub factors that can support the implementation of IoT in healthcare 
practice, Those factors are functional stability, performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, reliability, 
security, maintainability, and portability. Drug dispenser System, Smart Hospital System,  and Pharmaceutical 
Compounding System are IoT supported-healthcare practices with the highest value based on qualitative 
parameters. One healthcare practice can be implemented in any scenario based on the results of ZOGP. That 
healthcare practice is Drug Dispenser System.

Abstract 
The humanitarian operations arena and the Humanitarian Supply Chain (HSC) in response to crises or disasters 
are times where the need for leadership is paramount.  Similar challenges to those of the HSC are encountered by 
the military in operations, this familiarity combined with a great emphasis on leadership of individuals, teams, 
and organisations make the military leader a significant asset to any HSC and humanitarian operation.  This study 
assesses the contribution of the military to the HSC via a qualitative review of the experience and actions of those 
involved in humanitarian sphere.  The findings grouped into themes support the view that engagement of the 
military in the HSC or in support of humanitarian operations has a positive effect overall, but specifically on 
leadership of the HSC. 
Key words: Military Leadership, humanitarian operations, SCM 
Introduction 
The business of the military is leadership; however, this is not the only quality setting the military apart, 
coordination, capacity, readiness and broad ability to respond are some other factors. Structured and trained to 
succeed on the battlefield, these skills and capabilities translate almost seamlessly into humanitarian operations, 
disaster response, famine relief and the provision of security.  This is underpinned by familiarity with austere 
operating environments, and the inherent supply chain challenges, fragility, congestion, capacity issues and far 
bank control (the bridgehead or airport in country) and distribution; although the attributes are positive, 
paradoxically perhaps the presence and the influence of the military may not be considered so; this is supported 
by Le Riche (2004), in his review of the co-option of humanitarian aid in conflict zones.  
The use of military assets to provide assistance is a tempting proposition when seeking solutions to distant 
problems, however as Smith (2008) points out frequently and in detail, there are limitations to ‘the utility of force’, 
and where the military is seen as an option careful consideration is necessary.  These insights and those that follow,

mistake, could lose or delay a vaccination costing lives, it is completely different’.

Leadership has many descriptions and contributory factors, one component of successful leadership which is 
common to all models is communication, effective communication.  All interviewees cited clear communication 
as a key factor in HSC, in the preparation, delivery and recovery phases.  
‘Where we communicated directly(with the military), it worked well, when we had to work 
through intermediaries, it caused problems.’

Diplomacy and Tact 
‘As we were not the lead organisation, it required a mixture of leadership and diplomacy to 
advise OGD’s and NGO’s to review their methodology’ 
Military logistician West Africa 2014 
‘I used tact and diplomacy to ensure other NGO’s delivered the right support to my facility; 
when we had difficulties the ‘country lead’ was a great asset, a communicator. Other NGO’s 
and local leaders were happy to listen’ 
Senior NGO clinician Liberia 2014 
Protection vs Push 
The interviewees, despite service from the Balkans in the 1990’s to West Africa and the Caribbean in 2014 and 
2016 had never had to choose between force protection or the conduct of humanitarian operations.  This was 
unexpected, based on the age and experience of the sample.  However as a finding it is valid and illustrates the 
rare occasions where HSC operators resort to force to achieve their aims. 
Discussion and Conclusions 
A limitation of this study is the military background of the majority of the interviewees, their deep understanding 
and experience of supply chains and the HSC made their responses valid and insightful.  A balance was struck 
with the inclusion of a 3-PL provider, civil servant and an NGO clinician, with equal experience and 
understanding.   
This study has shown that leadership is understood to have a positive impact on HSC operations, it may not be 
expressed explicitly, but implied through other aspects of the HSC, communication, diplomacy, co-ordination, 
but it is always there, a central plank of the military approach to any and all operations.  It is the incorporation 
into other aspects of the HSC which may explain the paucity of discrete papers devoted to leadership in the HSC. 
The pursuit an early acceptance of the military presence and the inherent capability within their organisation 
would enable NGO’s and OGD’s to concentrate on discrete aspects of their operations, identifying the population 
at risk and opportunities for longer term projects while allowing their supply chain specialists to benefit from the 
capacity and experience of military logisticians.

Military leadership and presence my not always be welcomed in the HSC or on humanitarian operations, it is 
however frequently relied upon to enable and empower the actions of other HSC stakeholders, it is testament to 
the leadership qualities of the armed forces that they have been able to lead and support without side-lining, enable 
without alienating and guide without directing disparate organisations and maintain relations with them 
throughout critical situations, rewards come in many forms, for the military leading in the HSC it is the knowledge 
of a job well done.

Abstract 
Roles played by industries in promoting economic growth makes them the highest consumer of energy. The energy 
used by industries has proved difficult to forecast due to the nature of the independent variables. In recent years, 
artificial neural network (ANN) with multilayer perceptron (MLP) backpropagation function has been broadly utilized 
in the machine learning area. Most noticeable is in the field of forecasting. The MLP-ANN is applied to forecast South 
Africa’s energy consumption of five subsectors (basic chemicals, non-metallic minerals, basic iron and steel, basic 
non-ferrous metals and other manufacturing), with input variables in the form of activity, structure and intensity 
whereas energy consumed is the output from 1970 to 2016. In contrast with regression model, the results demonstrated 
a higher accuracy of industrial energy consumption in terms of statistical measures of performance.

1. Introduction
Roles played by industries in promoting economic growth makes them the highest consumer of energy. Industries 
utilize electricity to put in the working state the following: industry motors and machines, lights, computers/ laptops, 
workplace tools and for facility heating, cooling, and ventilation equipment among other things. The development of 
any economy is not a long way from her energy and material assets (Kant and Sangwan 2015). The different 
classifications of energy resources include fossil fuels, renewable and nuclear resources (Demirbas 2000). Considering 
the best classification of energy resources to utilize ought to be based on economic, social, environmental and security 
reasons (Azadeh, Babazadeh et al. 2013). Despite the fact that renewable energy emerges from the classifications, 
there are numerous hindrances keeping its regular use. Numerous reasons can be calculated in for preparation of how 
energy consumption should be modelled in the future. Extremely huge among the reasons are the constraints of energy 
resources and unremitting increment in energy consumption trend. 
Estimating both renewable and non-renewable energy use are fundamental for both local and industrial use. These 
estimates can be essential in future energy decision plans (Ermis, Midilli et al. 2007). The use of energy cannot be left 
out in the future energy plans (Ermis, Midilli et al. 2007). The significance of such estimation is depicted in Figure 1 
below. A successful planning for future energy use will include understanding the relationship between energy and 
the factors responsible for the consumption, which eventually prompts its forecast. These predictive tools are generally 
referred to as energy models. Policies on energy can be effortlessly guided using energy models (Kialashaki and Reisel 
2014). 
Different energy systems can without much of a stretch be forecasted using numerical models regardless of the 
dependable fluctuating parameters (Kialashaki and Reisel 2014). The capacity of numerical models to examine the 
past and inform the future makes it pertinent to energy modelling (Kialashaki and Reisel 2014). Conventional 
statistical methods like the regression analysis have proved helpful to benchmark and to predict. Machine learning

5. Conclusion 
 
The applied MLP-ANN to forecast the yearly energy consumption from five industrial subsectors demonstrated an 
exceptionally viable result. Apart from the performance exhibited by the ANN, which can be attributed to the extensive 
number of information, constantly offered promising results, more remarkable results were achieved through statistical 
measures of performance. Reference to the ANN’s use of three input variables, the relative errors resulted in extreme 
low values when compared to those of the regression model. This implies that ANN can give a worthy prediction of 
industrial energy consumption. The regression model, however, obtained good performance as evidenced in the 
correlation coefficient of more than 50%. It is envisaged that the results during the study can open opportunities on 
the road to future projection regarding industrial energy consumption. 
 
Accurate energy demand plays an essential role for planning programs as depicted in Figure 1 above. Forecasting by 
the developed MLP-ANN, owing to its high precision, can be utilized for energy efficiency management decisions.

With such prevalence illustrated, this model can likewise serve to schedule energy demand forecasting in the industrial 
environment. Further studies will consider other ML techniques which include Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and 
Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) to contrast with MLP-ANN in the energy prediction. Such comparison will give light 
to how best to plan when energy use in the industrial sector is concerned.

Abstract 
This paper presents a case study conducted for 47 Fire Stations that involves determining manning requirement for 
Fire Fighters; and provide a model whereby Fire Department could use to adjust existing or determine new Fire 
Station manning requirements. The model uses a recursive calculation process which can be broken down to 3-
stages. In first stage, initial crew size per fire apparatus was determined using a complexity index that captures the 
fire station profile from its nearest support, type of coverage, and its risk classification. In second stage, the number 
of fire apparatus for initial effective response was determined by ensuring each fire station can cover 90% of their 
incidents on their own with a supplemental support from nearby fire stations and in cases where a fire station is 
remote, the number of fire apparatus was adjusted to ensure those stations can provide effective response.  In third 
stage, the manpower requirements per shift were determined using the results from the two stages along with 
incorporating applicable international and local standards. Then, manning requirements in stage 3 were used to build 
a business planning model to perform scenario planning for changes in existing fire station profile or addition of 
new fire stations.

Abstract 
In this paper the results are published of a post-doctorate research done at the Brazilian Aeronautics Technological 
Institute (ITA) in 2006. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate and to discuss the relative efficiency of the main 
Brazilian carriers in the period from 2000-2006 by comparing their operational and relative efficiency with international 
airlines chosen from among benchmarks in this industry. These data, originally collected in 2008, were updated 
according to the IATA yearbook for the period 2012-2016. For this purpose, the airlines were grouped into 3 classes: 
Full Cost Companies (FCC’s), Low Cost Companies (LCC’s) and Regionals and 4 scenarios were established. In two 
of these scenarios (I and II), they were compared, independently of the category and in two of them (scenario III and 
IV) the comparison was established with airlines of the corresponding class (FCC’s and Regionals). In the survey, 41
international carriers were selected in North and South American, European and Asian markets. The method used in
this research is the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is a well-known family of mathematical programming
tools, based on the Frontier approach. The results obtained with the utilization of software’s like EMS, and Frontier
Analyst allowed to conclude that large airlines with high load factors and a concomitant production of passenger and
cargo had the best efficiency score.
Keywords : Effciency, relative efficiency, airlines performance, international airlines efficiency. 
1. Introduction
Until recently, scheduled passenger and freight services were heavily regulated in most countries in both domestic 
and international markets. Meanwhile, there is a consensus among air transport specialists that unnecessary restrictive 
regulations may have led to significant losses in efficiency. The governments of different countries, among them

In graph 3, it can be depicted a comparison among scores of scenarios III and IV. It can be observed that some airlines 
maintained exactly the same punctuation in both scenarios:  Portugalia Airlines, Rico, Pantanal, Oceanair and Total. 
GOL Transportes Aereos showed a regular efficiency in both models (app.77%).  
 
GOL is the Low-cost airline, which had the in recent years the largest expansion in the Brazilian market, reaching 
already in 2002, the status of an international airline, according to Araujo et al. (2006). It should be remarked, however, 
that TAM, currently, the largest Brazilian was not compared in scenarios III and IV. Some companies considered 
efficient, according to their efficiency score in the scenario III, did not reach the efficiency frontier in scenario IV (China 
and Virgin Atlantic). The low-cost airline Virgin Atlantic had a relative efficiency score under 50% in scenario IV, 
possibly, due to the low participation of the output RTK.    
 
8. Conclusion    
The objective of this paper is to compare the relative efficiency of Brazilian airlines with those of international 
companies. The research made possible the application of the DEA method with both variants VRS and CRS and with 
and without weight restrictions. It was not possible, however, in this research, to consider different operating conditions 
among American airlines that operate in a hub-and spoke system and South American and Asian companies operating 
point to point.  
The results obtained with the utilization of software’s like EMS, and Frontier Analyst allowed 
to conclude that large airlines with high load factors and a concomitant production of passenger and cargo like American 
Airlines, Delta Airlines and JAL had the best efficiency score. In scenario II, Air Berlin (LCC with 50 aircrafts and 80 
destination) and Singapore Airlines, operating aircrafts intensively and in long distances, also achieved the efficiency 
frontier, as shown in Fig. 2. In scenario III, Air Berlin and Virgin Atlantic obtained a 100% relative efficiency with and 
without inputs weights restrictions.  
 
Among the Brazilian regional airlines, due to the personnel structure, both Passaredo and TAF, when compared under 
conditions of variable returns to scale, reached also, the efficiency frontier. In scenarios III and IV, GOL obtained a 
relative efficiency of appr. 76%. Among the American regionals, the US Airways, when compared under variable 
returns to scale, is also positioned on the efficiency frontier. Concerning the Asian LCC’s and regional airlines, the best 
performance was that of Air China with a 100% score of relative efficiency, when compared with variable returns to 
scale.

Abstract 
Machine scheduling is a common problem found in many manufacturing and service industry. In this study, the stated 
problem is imitated from real-world beverage industry. We consider integrated problem of workforce allocation and 
parallel machine scheduling with sequence-dependent setup time and machine eligibility restrictions. Due to 
complexity of the problem, a rule-based heuristic is occurred to arrange production schedules in practice. Though this 
heuristic could make planner arrange the schedule effortlessly, much time is wasted on unnecessary setup which causes 
the completion time of all job fall behind what it is supposed to be. To overcome this circumstance, the problem is 
formulated into mathematical model with the aim to minimize makespan.  Based on the result of the experiment, it 
can be concluded that the proposed model could obtain more effective result than those of the existing rule-based 
heuristic and LPT significantly.

1. Introduction
Industries are seeking for high utilization of their resources, particularly in the manufacturing and production 
industries.  One of the most relevant is efficient machine scheduling.  In previous studies of machine scheduling 
problem, they are frequently assumed that the setup time could be ignored or considered as a part of the processing 
time.  On the other hand, these assumptions might be inappropriate for some manufacturing industries, which setup 
time is essential for cleaning and changing fixtures before processing, such as those in chemical processing, metal 
processing, and beverage industries.  In addition, setup times become more crucial when the amount of setup time 
required strongly depends on the sequence of jobs to be processed on the machine or well-known as sequence-
dependent setup time.  A typical example is the printing or painting industry, the setup time of changing from black 
job to pale color is greater than changing from pale job to black job because extensive cleaning is required.  As 
sequence-dependent setup time is the most complicated case for machine scheduling if setup time has occurred, many 
researchers have developed algorithms to solve sequence-dependent setup problems on various criteria.  Bowers et al. 
(1994) applied a mathematical technique, Cluster Analysis, to a single machine scheduling with a sequence-dependent 
setup.  With this technique, a product grouping procedure helps aggregating products which have similar setup 
requirements. Resulted in significantly improved production schedules.  Luo et al. (2006) introduced dominance rules 
for single machine scheduling with sequence-dependent setup and due date and applied the rules to the Branch and 
Bound Approach, aiming to minimize maximum tardiness of all jobs. The result proved that the optimal solution was 
obtained with less computational time.  Yet, there was no study on accommodating proposed rules with other 
computational techniques.  A two-stage Ant Colony Optimization algorithm for unrelated parallel machines with 
sequence-dependent setup time was proposed by Arnaout et al. (2009).  The performance of the heuristic was 
compared with those of Tabu Search and Meta-Heuristic for Randomized Priority Search proposed by Helal et al. 
(2006) and Rabadi et al. (2006) respectively.  Another algorithm for dynamic parallel scheduling with sequence-
dependent setup was developed by Lee et al. (2010), a restricted simulated annealing algorithm that incorporates

5. Conclusions 
 
 
Many effective algorithms for parallel machine scheduling were developed in the past several decades.  Yet, 
there are only few studies that consider machine scheduling together with workforce allocation.  Thus, this paper 
considers the integrated problem of workforce allocation and parallel machine scheduling with sequence-dependent 
setup time and machine eligibility restrictions production system, which is imitated from is imitated from real-world 
beverage industry.  The mathematical model is proposed to solve such problem.  The experiment was set to test the 
efficiency of the proposed mathematical model by comparing the results of the introduced model with those of the 
existing rule-based heuristic in real practice and the common LPT dispatching rule.  The experimental results establish 
that the suggested model could reduce value of maximum completion time of all jobs from the existing rule-based 
heuristic and LPT significantly.

Abstract 
Assuming costs have a major impact for decision making of any project, comparing the variety of cost 
calculation alternatives, this article emphasis the certainty of a risk degree. Risk is generally taken as part 
of business and working with affects the financial results of any company. So, it is considered as an 
uncertain event which leads to the possibility of losing. However, it can also be an opportunity. This 
research focuses on working with project-related risks, with a developed analyse on costs. In order to build 
a project budget, it is necessary not only to choose a suitable calculation method but above all is to identify 
all threats and opportunities and to analyse them thoroughly. Furthermore, it is important to define the 
procedure by which the risk will be quantified. The output of the study is the design of an appropriate 
project cost management model.

1. Introduction
Investment decision making is one of the most important managerial functions at all, and therefore requires highly 
sophisticated approaches and methods that need to be followed to further develop the business. However, problems 
with investment decision-making are linked to inadequately suited assessment methods, and firms are making their 
investment decisions more intuitively. Underestimating this issue can lead to negative consequences. One of the most 
important factors in deciding on the implementation of the project is the budget. This must include not only all standard 
cost items but also risks associated with the project. 
Risk is generally taken as part of the business, and work with it greatly affects the results of the business. Industrial 
businesses face a great deal of risks from strategic focus, make-or-buy decisions, quality of delivered products, 
compliance with negotiated terms to customer's payment risks. The risk is mostly related to the possibility of loss, 
damage or failure. It can be understood as an uncertain event that, if it occurs, leads to the possibility of losing, but it 
can also be an opportunity. 
Expert literature dealing with project risk issues and their projection into the project budget deals with often rather 
complex methods and complicated mathematical apparatuses. Using complex procedures for simpler projects can not 
only be unnecessary and lead to a prolongation and expense of the project, but it can also have negative psychological 
impacts on the project team. On the other hand, large-scale and complex projects of major importance, important 
projects with publicly guarded dates or high costs require thorough preparation and detailed analysis. Even in such 
cases, however, it is advisable to choose the planning method as complex as is strictly necessary. Although this 
principle, which is actually the paraphrase of Occam's razor for project planning and management, seems to be quite 
obvious, unfortunately, in practice, it is often not respected. One extreme case is the effort to apply complicated 
procedures inappropriately to a small scale of the project, which may be motivated by the idea that using such practices 
will increase the prestige of the people responsible for the project. The second extreme is when an important and 
extensive project is conducted inappropriately simply without the necessary preparation and analysis of options. Both 
extremes usually lead to unnecessary prolongation of project duration and increase in project costs. In the latter case, 
the achievement of project objectives is also seriously threatened.

costs are included in the expected costs. The sum of these costs with the risk margin will indicate the total estimated 
costs of the project. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
The aim of the study was to create a concept for calculating project costs, including the methodology of quantification 
of individual risks and their projection into the project budget. Firstly, basic information was provided on projects 
where not only the course of the project is but also the types of projects based on important criteria. The next part 
contains an overview of the used calculation methods, with examples of their application in projects. There is a 
considerable amount of risk and uncertainty about projects, so it is necessary to find out what models, degrees and 
types of risk exist and also, how to work with the risks and the possibility of their projection into the project reserve. 
 
The final chapter deals with the proposal of a suitable method of calculating project costs. The starting point is that 
the calculation will be made in the pre-investment phase of the project. This is a preliminary calculation method. 
Projects were divided into several groups according to their complexity and purpose. The risks were divided into 
continuous and discrete. Their evaluation will be done in one of 3 selected ways. Part of this work is also a table for 
selecting an appropriate method of risk quantification depending on selected criteria. A model for working with a 
threat or opportunity has also been created. This is followed by the risk creation process. 
 
The output of the article is a proposal for a project cost management model based on the PKR method. This method 
makes it possible to calculate the costs that are usually included in the manufacturing process in a procedural manner, 
thus making them transparent. While some cost items will continue to fall between overheads, we will be able to 
quantify and identify most of the related items specifically and identify the relevant measurement quantities for them. 
 
The next step will be to verify the usability of the proposed solution in practice. The model will be progressively 
upgraded and refined so that we can better integrate not only the costs but also the risks associated with the projects.

Abstract 
This study examines the main Industry 4.0 technologies that, according to the literature, might reinforce the 
capacity of lean manufacturing (LM) to improve plant performance. Moving away from the existing studies 
that typically handle this question at a high level, we opted for a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis 
(fsQCA), which enables multiple antecedents and their combinations to be identified to determine the 
outcome. Necessary data were obtained from a multisector sample of 568 manufacturing plants (NACE 
codes 15–37) from six European countries. The results support the argument that different causal paths 
among LM and Industry 4.0 improve plant performance; however, contrary to the initial expectations, the 
findings revealed that Industry 4.0 technologies (specifically digital technologies and additive 
manufacturing) seem to be, by themselves, sufficient conditions that can improve the results. In fact, in 
contrast to conventional lean wisdom, the findings suggests that in 4.0 technology-intensive shop floors, 
certain lean practices, those conceived for high volume-low variety (HVLV) manufacturing systems, might 
be counterproductive.

Abstract 
The success rate of LM in non-Japanese firms is extremely low. Although many different reasons have 
been cited, two of them reflect a certain consensus. On the one hand, there is no agreement on which 
sequence to follow regarding organizational tools and cultural change during the transformation processes. 
On the other hand, there are also different views on what the correct rhythm should be. This article 
synthesizes and compares empirically the different theoretical perspectives on both issues and tests them in 
a wide dataset of 1,692 North American manufacturing firms. Results suggest that cultural change totally 
mediates the relation between the deployment of tools and enhanced plant performance. While tools play 
therefore an essential role as triggers for stimulating lean transformations, our evidence proves 
quantitatively that they will only improve performance through the cultural change they can potentially 
provide. These findings not only allow for the integration of Western and Japanese approaches, but also 
suggest a tentative sequence and rhythm in the deployment of lean tools and values.

Abstract 
Lean Six Sigma (LSS) methodology is becoming popular in South African companies, motivated by the drive to 
reduce costs and optimise operational processes. There are indications from literature of various challenges 
experienced by companies in their journey to implement and sustain LSS. There is no authoritative statistics around 
the scale of LSS implementations in South African organisations or on the success and failure rates of these 
implementations. This research’s chief objective was the development of a dynamic model which could be used to 
predict and sustain LSS deployments in local companies. The research also purposed to expand the body of 
knowledge on factors affecting the sustainability of LSS. 
Multiple case studies were employed for concept building in this research. A three phased approach using interviews 
and a survey was employed in conducting the research.  
The research confirmed that companies were experiencing various challenges including lack of top management 
buy-in and support and lack of skilled and knowledgeable employees. Positive feedback was received, as the 
measures of LSS sustainability and existence of the predictors for LSS sustainability received generally high 
scoring. The data collected from the case studies was limited as the population of employees who have received 
various levels of LSS and actively participating in LSS projects was limited within organisations. This research 
contributed to the body of knowledge by increasing understanding on the sustainability of LSS implementations and 
by developing a dynamic model which could be used to predict and sustain LSS deployments.

1. Introduction
In their attempt to continuously improve their operations, many organisations around the world have embarked on 
various business improvement methodologies, ranging from simple quality inspection to complex business 
improvement methodologies. According to Byrne (2007) the following common business improvement 
methodologies were implemented by different companies over the years: statistical quality in the 1950s; Toyota 
Production System (TPS) in the 1960s/1970s; Just-in-time (JIT), Total Quality Management (TQM) and Six Sigma 
in the 1980s; Lean Production and Business Process Reengineering (BPR) in the 1990s and LSS in the 2000s. Some 
business improvement methodologies were observed to have performed better than others. Accenture Global 
Management Consulting observed that desirable improvements from these business improvement methodologies 
were short-lived in most organisations (Iversen & McCoy, 2010). Whilst some of the business improvement 
methodologies have survived, others were reported to have fallen away to be replaced by a successor.

development of operational evaluation, assisting practitioners to more systematically assess the outcomes of LSS 
sustainability on regular intervals. To illustrate the value and practicality of this aspect, an evaluation framework is 
proposed for future research. A dynamic feedback model to prove and predict the condition for LSS sustainability 
was developed. The model may be used to predict from the industry research data which companies will succeed or 
fail to sustain LSS implementation in time.

Abstract 
This study investigates the relationships between agility and sustainability and the individual and 
combined impacts of both agility and sustainability on the performance of the oil and gas 
enterprises. This predicated upon the fact that whilst agility or sustainability has been corrected 
with organisational performance, there is no empirical study current that investigates the influence 
of agile practices on the extent to which organisations could translate sustainability practices into 
sustainability performance or overall organisational performance including the traditional 
financial measures and operational performance objectives. In particular, it is not clear if agility 
servers as an effective mediator or moderator of sustainability. This is significant given that 
sustainability has now become an important competitive objective. A survey of the oil and gas 
industry in the UK was carried out with a resulting response of 311 participating organisations. 
The oil and gas industry was chosen because of the impacts of its operations and products on the 
global carbon footprint. Using a structural equation modelling (SEM), the result indicates that agile 
practices are enablers of sustainable supply chain practices and that these capabilities play an 
important role in mediating the impacts of sustainability practices on competitive bases of 
profitability, flexibility, innovation, quality, speed and proactivity. These results also suggest that 
agile capabilities are necessary conditions for maximizing the impacts of implementation of 
sustainability practices on sustainability performance. In other words, the results show that 
enterprises with highly agile supply chains can benefits more from their efforts in implementing 
sustainability practices to improve overall organisational performance.

Abstract 
Industry 4.0 provides many unique challenges for business leadership. The volumes of data availability reside in 
numerous locations, which were not even in existence a decade ago. The affordability of huge data storage and the 
new techniques of gathering data are resources that are in the nascent stages of development. Within this new data 
frontier exists the human element of the business world. Automation and artificial intelligence have replaced many 
repetitive jobs, while the need for knowledge workers continues to develop. The opportunities to apply innovation 
through the analysis and application of data are limitless. Leadership must provide a method for taking advantage of 
the data, while developing their employee’s skills to become knowledge workers. This transition of employees to 
knowledge workers can be accomplished by specific application of several elements of the existing Quality Body of 
Knowledge. A knowledge worker, as a member of a high performing team, is able to provide contributions to 
companies in their pursuit of organization excellence. 
Keywords: 
Leadership, teamwork, quality processes, organizational excellence, big data. 
Extending quality culture in the digital age provides unique opportunities to apply the tools and concepts of quality 
to non-traditional situations. In these non-traditional situations, the human aspect of quality extends beyond the 
walls of business and can be utilized to support activities that enhance our personal lives and the lives of those 
around us. The digital age has experienced the entrance of the Millennial generation of highly educated and 
technically competent professionals in all industries. This generation has developed a strong affinity for the 
gathering and application of data to situations in both their personal and professional lives. The analysis of the 
volumes of data available to support business decision making is overwhelming. Millennials must develop their 
skills in performing data analyses as a routine process to provide the leadership of contemporary businesses with the 
facts and options available to make informed business decisions. Millennials are being called upon to address the 
importance of organizations’ and their employees’ contributions to the communities and societies in which they live. 
Of course, this line of thinking necessitates a thorough discussion of the ways in which quality can meet the goals of 
both business and society by combining their mutual interests and by blurring the boundaries that exist between 
them. To that end, this paper addresses how leaders can develop high performing teams of employees by applying 
basic quality tools in their role of supporting the improvement of the knowledge process within a company. 
Big data is the driving force behind contemporary business in this age of Industry 4.0. The Internet and the 
explosion of social media are disrupting the planning and operations in almost every type of industry. Basic 
questions require new and innovative answers. How can business remain current? Moreover, how can business be 
proactive in planning for the future? This data invasion can provide business with new and unforeseen opportunities 
as they develop their future strategies, as well as continue to manage their routine processes effectively and to 
maintain customer satisfaction. But, where do we begin? And, of greater importance, how do we begin? These basic 
questions need to be addressed in order to develop a plan for exploiting the opportunities provided by big data. 
The elements necessary to provide effective planning for capitalizing on the data opportunities reside within the 
current Quality Body of Knowledge (QBOK). Many of the basic tools, elements of leadership, team building 
processes, and the ability to recognize how to utilize existing knowledge management are four of the key topics that 
support change. To be effective in this regard, company leadership must view quality from the perspective of

Abstract 
The main purpose of this paper is to find the most critical substations (S/Ss) in the Electrical Power Infrastructure 
(EPI) network, to give a better understanding for the top managers when decision performed. This paper discusses the 
interdependencies of EPI through a real-life case-study to reveal the most critical parts of the network. By applying 
Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) method, the paper examines the physical interactions of thirty electrical 
substations in EPI according to their influence. Furthermore, the paper identifies the driving substations that can affect 
the others. The proposed model uses Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC) to 
analyse the driving power and dependence of each S/S. Finally, based on the results, the paper concludes that the 
suggested approach can shape the foundation of a new method of EPI network analysis for better decision-making. 
Actually, the paper addressed a new way of investigating the EPI network by using ISM-MICMAC tool to give a 
wider figure for high authorities in the EPI’s organization and give them the opportunity to allocate their resources in 
the most needed area of their the network.

I.
INTRODUCTION
A Critical Infrastructure (CI) System is a system of interdependent parts and components, (Rinaldi 2004). One
of those CIs is Electrical Power Infrastructure (EPI) that serves societies (Zio 2016). EPI is a man-made system, 
designed to function synergistically to generate a continuous and sustainable flow of services. Its malfunction or 
breakdown would have a debilitating impact on our security (Han et al. 2009). Recently, the protection of EPI has 
become a major concern of many countries (Frei et al. 2013; Attri et al. 2013). Although those countries estimate the 
criticality of EPI, no one has specifically identified the most critical system of EPI network. Those systems are; Power 
Generation (PG), Power Transmission (PT), Power Distribution (PD), Consumed Load (CL) and End-User (EU). A 
failure of one of those systems can affect the entire network of EPI and it could lead to negative consequences on the 
economy, safety, and health services of the country (Gutierrez et al. 2013). Today, communities totally rely on those 
systems of EPI for supplying electrical power. EPI systems consist of substations (S/Ss) which are connected directly 
or indirectly through physical links e.g. (Electrical Power Cables or Over-Head-Line). Such systems are 
interdependent, that some of them rely on others and some are almost completely isolated. The more dependent on 
EPI the community is, the more complex and harder to control those systems become. One crucial factor that has a 
big impact on EPI’s systems is interdependency (Rinaldi 2004).  
Interdependencies of EPI’s systems could be used as a starting point for determining the criticality of each part 
of the EPI network. Nevertheless, the issue of EPI systems’ interdependencies is still not clear (Han et al. 2009). 
Scientists have been investigating the problems related to the criticality of EPI and its interactions with other 
infrastructures to know the most critical infrastructure (Singh et al. 2014). Yet, as to the beast of this paper knowledge, 
no one has investigated and measured the interdependencies between the EPI’s systems PG, PT, PD and CL and their 
components S/Ss, through an analytical tool such as Social Network Analysis (SNA) or Interpretative Structural 
Modelling (ISM) combined with Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification (MICMAC). In this 
paper, the EPI systems are considered as infrastructures which need to be investigated to find their criticality level. 
Some researchers, such as (Han et al. 2009), considered infrastructures as to represent the most vulnerable elements 
within the network. Others like, (Zimmerman 2004), classified infrastructures by their system failures; i.e. some 
infrastructures are the common cause of failure to other infrastructures or some infrastructures are affected by the

The diagram in figure 3 shows all substations distributed in different places all over the clusters, which means that 
the substations network has different characteristics based on the driving power and dependence. Cluster-I has only 
one substation (7), which means it is an autonomous substation with weak driving power and weak dependence. In 
Cluster-II, there are ten substations (17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26). Those are greatly dependent substations 
that have weak driving power and strong dependence. Cluster-III includes fourteen substations (6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 
14, 15, 16, 27, 28, 29 and 30). Those substations have strong driving power and strong dependence, which means they 
are unstable - any disturbance on those substations could generate a big effect on the whole network. Cluster-IV 
consists of five substations (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5) which have strong driving power and at, the same time, have weak 
dependence and are called independent substations. 
 
V. CONCLUSION  
By finding the most critical substation in the EPI, this paper has met its main objective, through using a new 
analytical method into the electrical system network. The result shows that there are some critical substations need 
special care for preventing the system from been be disturbed. The paper also provides a general understanding of the 
interdependencies of EPI. Insights are provided regarding the importance of substations levels within the network. 
This is achieved by identifying and analysing the relationships among substations by using ISM mode and 
implementing the MICMAC technique to analyse the characteristics of each and every S/S in the network of EPI. The 
substations in MICMAC are categorized according to their driving power and dependence for finding their location 
on the plot clusters. Such a model can give a clear picture of the direct and indirect relationships among the substations 
of EPI and their dependencies, rather than considering those substations as isolated hubs in the network. In addition, 
the findings also show that from the sample of the Electrical Power Infrastructure - EPI of Sharjah Electricity & Water 
Authority - SEWA, power generation is the most critical substation among others. Another important point that even 
if the substations have the same characteristics, sometimes they have advantages on each other’s, in terms of locations 
and numbers of connected links, e.g. S/S 6 and S/S 7 in our case. The analysis of individual parts of each substation 
cannot give a clear idea of the network structure. However, the configuration of ISM with MICMAC, that was 
developed based on the perceptions and insights of experts, generates a broad result. This can be helpful to top 
management and can give more solid decisions efforts directing to tackle the root cause of any electrical network 
problems emphasis sustainability of electrical industry’s markets. This research paper is useful for specialists who are 
involved in policy implementation and planning for better protection of EPI’s substations. The paper will also be of 
great help to scholars who are concerned with an advanced analytical tool for EPI network, especially with such a 
case study where real data has been applied. Basically, the model was applied to a small sample of the electrical power 
network to prioritize substations based on their importance in the network. Nevertheless, the study needs to be extended 
to cover more substations in a much larger network in all of the five categories (Generation, Transmission, Distribution, 
Load-Station, and End-user), this is to reduce the complexity in a critical network such as EPI. In fact, the unity of 
generation substation could be a limitation for our paper. By default, when there is one power generation–substation, it 
will be the most critical hub in the network (As in our case). But the question is, what about if there is more than one 
power generation substation? In fact, this can raise a new future research question that if there are a redundancy of the 
same substations that have the same characteristics, which one of them is the most critical one and how the system will 
daffier the level of criticality between them?

Abstract 
Nowadays, economic condition and consumer demand are changing rapidly in terms of product quality, minimum 
lead time, and consistent product at a lower price. Accomplish all these demands of the consumer have been a 
challenge to the industry. These changing demand can only be fulfilled by the effective applications of scientific 
methodologies like Lean manufacturing. The idea behind the lean manufacturing is that to maximize the customer 
value and reducing the waste. There are different tools of lean manufacturing those are used to remove non value-
added activities (waste) from the system and encourage value-added activities. The Overall Equipment Effectiveness 
(OEE) is also a performance measurement tool of lean that helps to recognize and reduce the bottleneck operations, 
quality loses and etc. OEE has been implemented in different industries, however, there is a need to implement this 
useful lean tool in the textile and clothing industry as well.   
This study implemented OEE in garment manufacturing unit for making a process smooth, consistent, and rejection 
free. For this purpose, a T-shirt manufacturing unit of a garment industry was selected and methodology was defined 
to implement OEE in the selected manufacturing unit. At first stage, the baseline study was conducted to measure the 
current value of OEE that revealed that the value of OEE factors i.e. availability, performance, and quality is 82.13%, 
82.24%, and 57.96% respectively. While the overall value of OEE is 39.15%. These values were compared with world-
class values of OEE that helped to highlight the deficiency areas which create waste or loss of resources. The route 
cause analysis was carried out to remove or mitigate the effect of potential problems to improve the values of OEE 
factors and ultimately the overall values of OEE. This process was carried out in three stages. After continuous 
improvement, the values of availability, performance, and quality improved to 88.64%, 87.44%, and 84% while the 
overall value of OEE improved to 65.11% which is far away from the world-class value i.e. 85% however, it is above 
the industry average value of OEE.  
The successful implementation of OEE indicated that the quality and productivity can be monitored and improved by 
looking at the values of availability, performance, and quality. This study has been conducted at the macro level by 
taking the complete manufacturing line however, the further study should be conducted at the micro level by 
implementing OEE on individual operator/operation.

Abstract 
Welding of dissimilar metals has attracted attention of the researchers worldwide, owing to its many advantages and 
challenges. There is no denial in the fact that dissimilar welded joints offer more flexibility in the design and 
production of the commercial and industrial components. Welding of Ferritic and Austenitic stainless steel in 
general and GMAW of such steel in particular, can well be considered as one of the areas where more extensive 
research may contribute, in a significant way, to the precise control of the welding process for better and acceptable 
quality of weldment. The purpose is to study the influence of the selected parameters: welding current, Gas flow rate 
and Nozzle to plate distance on the quality of weld Dissimilar Welding of AISI 316L Austenitic Stainless Steel to

1. Introduction
Joining dissimilar materials is often more difficult than joining the same material or alloys with minor differences in 
composition. However, many dissimilar materials can be joined successfully with the appropriate joining process 
and specialized procedures. In the present work, dissimilar joints between AISI 409 ferritic stainless steel and AISI 
316L austenitic stainless steel, are made by GMAW using ESAB AUTO rod 316L as filler wire. Weld quality 
mainly depends on features of bead geometry, mechanical –metallurgical characteristics of the weld as well as on

In Figure 8 and figure 13 dendritic structure of ferrite is observed along with layers of austenite. Figure 9 gives 
evidence of ferrites in austenitic matrix. Figure 10 reveals austenite with ferritic stringers in the microstructure. 
Grain boundary austenite is found in Figure 11 and Figure 12 within ferrite matrix. Microstructure of weld metal its 
consists of austenite and δ ferrite, Ferrite shape is lacy and vermicular, in figure 13 is given coarse grain HAZ. 
Primary austenitic grains are clearly seen. Proeutecoide and Widmanstaten ferrite on grain boundaries can be seen 
too. Inside the grains microstructure consists of bainite and martensite. Martensitic layer near grain boundary is 
detected too. 
 
 
 
7. CONCLUSIONS  
• 
Visual inspection and X-ray radiography test reveals that in few samples defects like porosity, lack of 
fusion, undercut occur. However almost defect free joints are also observed, under some parametric 
conditions. 
• 
Tensile test results are found to be satisfactory, excepting for few samples. The variations in input 
parameters have influenced the mechanical properties to a certain extent.  
• 
Measurement of hardness at different zones of weldment indicates that hardness in weld metal is more than 
hardness in HAZ and base metal. HAZ hardness is found to be a little bit smaller than base metal. However 
variation in hardness at different zones is not found to be too excessive. The graphical plots show similar 
pattern for all the samples. 
• 
Dendrite structure of ferrite is observed along with layers of austenite. Microstructure of weld metal its 
consists of austenite and δ ferrite, Ferrite shape is lacy and vermicular. Micro structural characteristic are 
more or less consistent with result of tensile test.

Abstract 
Two possible pricing formats are commonly used in advance selling: discount and premium that depends 
on the pre-order price is lower or higher than the spot selling price. Discount price induces the early 
purchase of the customers who are uncertain about the quality of the product, and premium price grants the 
product availability for those who are eager to obtain the product. We use a two-period model, advance 
selling and spot selling to denote the profit optimization for a retailer who sells one product. The retailer 
faces two types of customers:  novice customers who barely know the product and veteran customers who 
are familiar with the similar product. Population size of these two types of customers and product capacity 
in the spot selling period affect the price decision in advance selling for the retailer.  A Stackelberg game 
is used to characterize the optimal price decisions, and in numerical study, several settings of scenarios are 
examined to gain more managerial insights.

Worm Optimization Algorithm for the Euclidean 
Location-Allocation Problem

Abstract 
Facility location is a critical aspect of strategic planning for a broad spectrum of public and private firms. 
Whether a retail chain sitting a new outlet, a manufacturer choosing where to position a warehouse, or a 
city planner selecting locations for fire stations, strategic planners are often challenged by difficult spatial 
resource allocation decisions. In fact, the literature reports that most of the models developed to solve the 
facility location problem are very hard to solve to optimality, as most problems are classified as NP-hard. 
One of the toughest facility location problems is the location-allocation problem, which comprises of two 
elements – Location: where to locate the central facilities; and Allocation: which subsets of the demand 
should be served from each facility. The Euclidean uncapacitated location allocation problem involves 
generating m new facilities to be located in R2, that will serve n fixed demand points with the objective of 
minimizing the transportation costs. Supply centers such as plants and warehouses may constitute the 
facilities while retailers and dealers may be considered as demand points. 
This study addresses the Euclidean location-allocation problem with an unknown number of facilities, and 
an objective of minimizing the fixed and transportation costs. Since practical scenarios often require a large 
number of facilities and customers, heuristics for this problem became popular in the literature. 
Accordingly, a Worm Optimization (WO) algorithm is introduced and is applied to this NP-hard problem. 
The novel WO is based on the behaviors of the worm, which is a nematode with only 302 neurons. 
Nevertheless, these neurons allow worms to achieve several intricate behaviors including finding food, 
interchanging between solitary and social foraging styles, alternating between dwelling and roaming, and 
entering a type of stasis/declining stage. 
WO’s performance is evaluated by comparing its solutions to solutions of two other known metaheuristics 
for the problem under study, and the extensive computational results indicated that the proposed WO 
performs best.

Abstract 
Project Portfolio Management (PPM) has a proven record of success in organizations. There is a growing set of 
literature focusing on the success criteria of PPM. These set of standards affect the PPM success and has an overall 
outcome on the business success in organizations. From the strategic perspective, project selection plays a substantial 
role. In the world of a dynamic market with colossal competition, taking up the wrong project will not only end up 
using resources but in the long run, it can be critical. Indian Auto Component Industry (IACI), due to varying demands 
and global competition, face the daunting task of survival in such a situation. The research paper is written on the 
empirical study and focusses on the effect of project selection in the portfolio on business success in IACI. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
In this highly competitive world with rapidly changing demand for the products, sustainability is a big question now 
for any organization. Those whose are following standard practices and adapt themselves to the changing internal and 
external factors, do not strive hard for success. PPM has evolved as one such way of managing multiple portfolios, 
programs, and projects efficiently. PPM is one of the most thought-provoking problems in contemporary business 
(Cooper et al., 1997, 2001, 2006). Firstly, it deals with future measures in an organization and the data gathered for 
the decisions is uncertain. Secondly, investments in project portfolio are at different phases of completion, so it is 
challenging to do the comparative analysis of the investments that are estimated. Thirdly, the organizational 
environment is very dynamic because of which the status of the portfolio keeps on changing, and new data or 
information is made available. Finally, resources constraints are majorly impacting the projects wherein insufficient 
funding for another project may take away the allotted resources for some other projects. In the world of globalization, 
new business practices are motivating organizations to reassess their competition level strategy. An organization’s 
success mostly depends on its capability to grow globally. IACI caters to the need of the Indian automobile industry. 
The companies are nowadays facing tremendous problems due to rapid change in demands. Singh et al. (2007), carried 
out a survey of 75 Indian auto component manufacturers to mention challenges faced by the automobile sector. 
Looking at the tremendous growth potential and big market in India, many multinational auto companies have already 
established their businesses or are planning to do so. In such a situation, there is a fierce competition to survive in the 
market, not only to domestic companies but those who also collaborated with the multinational companies. Moreover, 
the auto component manufacturers feel the pressure of producing high-quality component at a lower cost, products 
with shorter lead time and customizing the products as per the requirement of Original Equipment Manufacturers 
(Singh et al., 2007; Jain et al., 2008; Scavarda et al., 2009). The companies need to implement new industry practices 
so that it will take care of the challenging tasks and also a restructuring of the IACI is required (D’Costa, 2004). Owing 
to such challenges, it has become essential for the IACI to increase its performance and competitiveness by considering 
more continuous improvement approaches and impactful business practices to take advantage of the increasing 
business opportunities. Moreover, to survive in the global cut-throat competitive automotive industry, developing and 
emerging economies must adopt and upgrade to world-class manufacturing practices and standards (Barnes and

of the research is to analyze the influence of project selection on the business success of the organization in IACI, 
regression analysis was carried out. The hypotheses derived from the model were tested. The following table shows 
the result of the hypothesis testing:

Above results show that project selection does have a positive impact on the business success of an organization of 
IACI. Due to the dynamic nature of the businesses and to sustain in the cutthroat competition, there are high chances 
that the organizations may pull in the projects without actually worrying about the resources at the strategic level. 
Moreover, the organizations having less turnover might go for the projects which may account for financial benefits 
rather than balancing the given portfolio of projects. The practice of PPM in its real-life context is slightly messier 
and less rational than the decision-process cantered frameworks (Martinsuo, 2013). 
 
7. Conclusion 
To build an optimal project portfolio in a competitive business environment is a significant concern for every 
organization. The method of generating a good portfolio mix of components with excellent potential, with many 
constraints, is complicated and knowledge consuming. This complexity is mainly because of the numerous dimensions 
in decision making. The decision maker has to deal with multiple criteria, multiple objectives, uncertainty and risk, 
interdependencies between different components, and balancing effectively with varied goals of the organization. 
Mostly the decision is regularly made by top managers with dissimilar perspectives that need alignment of the projects 
across the portfolio building stages. Considering the increased competition in the market, there is a much broader 
scope of possible strategic directions that need the active participation of top-level management, which helps in 
navigating for both long and short-term strategy. It suggests that a commitment, both regarding actions and time, is 
desired. This also indicates that the management involved in operational aspects has to be supported with a proper 
project methodology on individual project level and also on a portfolio of projects. Project selection is indeed an 
essential phase in PPM. The results show that there is a good understanding of project selection is there in the 
organizations of IACI. But this can be only one side of the coin. A strategy should be accompanied with an in-depth 
plan of implementation of it. Without the effective implementation of the strategy, the probability of business success 
is reduced.

Abstract 
The paper deals with testing and evaluation of a modified Self-Organizing Migrating Algorithm (SOMA) applied to 
different discrete event simulation models. These models are focused on real problems in industrial companies. The 
SOMA heuristic optimization method is derived from the Differential Evolution method, which is effective for 
different dimensional search spaces of the simulation models. We specify the ranges of each algorithm parameter and 
test all the possible combinations of settings of the algorithm within the specified ranges. We repeat the simulation 
optimization experiments to reduce the random behaviour of the algorithm. We propose a methodology using different 
evaluation criteria to analyse the SOMA behaviour of finding the optimum of an objective function specified for each 
discrete event simulation model.

1. Introduction
Most managers know that an industrial company is a complex and tightly connected system affected by many external 
and internal factors. Managers have to make many decisions in a good way and without bad consequences. A possible 
answer to quality management is the use of discrete event simulations to test different scenarios without the need for 
physical implementation in a company. We can use a digital replica of physical assets, processes, people, etc. – digital 
twins (Krajcovic et al. 2018). The other advantage of using simulation experiments is preventing problems, e.g. 
manufacturing optimization – identification of the bottlenecks, low utilization of resources etc.; logistics optimization 
– idle time, shortening shipping time; warehousing – low amount or large amount of supplies, etc. (Buckova et al.
2018), which may occur, and which we cannot imagine due to the high complexity of the simulated system. Discrete
event simulation in connection with optimization – simulation optimization - can be more effective for management
because it can avoid bad human decision-making and show the efficiency of different possible scenarios (suitable
solutions to the modelled problem) that can be implemented in a real system. A suitable solution represents the feasible
settings of the simulated system under specified constraints. The search space is usually boundary-constrained, and is
defined as follows:
𝑋𝑋෩= ෑൣ𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗, 𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗൧
𝑛𝑛
𝑗𝑗=1
, 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗≤𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗 
(1) 
Where 𝑋𝑋෨ denotes the search space; 𝑛𝑛 denotes the dimension of the search space (number of the input parameters of 
the discrete event simulation model); 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗 denotes the lower bound of the interval of 𝑗𝑗-th decision variable (input 
parameter of the discrete event simulation model); 𝑏𝑏𝑗𝑗 denotes the upper bound of the interval of 𝑗𝑗-th decision variable. 
Simulation optimization is a technique for finding the global optimum of the optimized objective function respecting 
the specified constraints. The equation reflects a process of finding a possible solution using experimentation with a 
discrete event simulation model reflecting the modelled problems.(Weise 2009),(Zelinka 2016)

If we compare the relative frequencies of the mapped objective function values of the discrete event simulation model 
and the relative frequencies of the objective function values found by the optimization method, the strategies strongly 
tend to converge to the global optimum. If we select less suitable optimization method settings the relative proportion 
starts to increase in other areas of the interval – see Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure 10. Appropriate setting of the 
optimization method leads to a lower number of optimization experiments to find the global optimum (a steeper 
convergence to the global optimum and the lower relative frequency in the area of global extremes of the objective 
function values). 
A small relative frequency around the optimum is due to the selected type of termination criteria. A possible criterion 
of termination is a Value to Reach - if the candidate solution is found (its objective function value is equal to the 
objective function value or the objective function value is within the defined tolerated deviation from the objective 
function value of the global optimum), the simulation optimization experiment is stopped. Each series – repetition of 
optimization experiments with concrete settings of the optimization method - was evaluated according to different 
evaluation criteria. One of the evaluation criteria is Optimization Method Success - finding the global optimum (the 
candidate solution whose objective function value is within a defined tolerance of the global optimum objective 
function). Figure 11 shows the comparison of the success of each SOMA strategy from the best to the worst settings 
of the optimizing method for one selected model (with the highest differences of the objective function values).  
The AllToOne strategy (index 0) is prone to wrong optimization method parameters settings in our case of discrete 
event simulation models. This strategy is followed by the SOMA strategy AllToRand (index 3), the AllToAllAdaptive 
strategy (index 2) and the worst strategy AllToAll (index 1) to set the wrong optimization method parameters.

6. Conclusion 
The testing of the SOMA optimization method confirmed that it is a quite successful and generic optimization method 
according to different objective function landscapes of our tested discrete event simulation models. This method found 
the global optimum or an acceptable solution even in the case of the worst settings of this optimization method. This 
method is derived from Differential Evolution but some SOMA strategies provide worse solutions than Differential 
Evolution. We tested all the SOMA strategies under the same conditions of the simulation experiments – the same 
termination criteria, number of repetitions in the series, and the same setting of the basic parameters of this 
optimization method. The AllToAll strategy of SOMA is not useful when the second termination criterion is set hard 
– the user sets a small number of simulation experiments to perform. We tested AllToAll strategy with a higher number

of simulation experiments in the series. This SOMA strategy was better if we specified a softer second termination 
criterion – SOMA can perform more simulation experiments. 
If we compare the SOMA strategies, the AllToOne strategy is prone to wrong optimization method parameters settings 
and is able to find the global optimum of the objective function, or the local optimum near to the global optimum of 
the objective function in the case of our tested discrete event simulation models. If we sort the quality of SOMA 
strategies from best to worst according to the versatility of using the strategy when the user can perform a limited 
number of experiments, the order is: AllToOne, AllToRand, AllToAllAdaptive and the worst strategy is AllToAll.

Abstract  
 
Exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) chart is one of the most powerful techniques for 
detecting small and moderate shifts. The curtailed inspection has been broadly used in acceptance sampling 
plans to reduce the average sample number substantially. This research presents an EWMA chart 
employing curtailed inspection (curtailed EWMA chart) to monitor the fraction nonconforming p of a 
process with attribute characteristics. A design algorithm is developed to optimize the charting parameters 
of the curtailed EWMA chart. The proposed curtailed EWMA chart is compared with the traditional 
EWMA without curtailed inspection (abbreviated as EWMA chart in this research) using the same false 
alarm rate to ensure a fair comparison. The overall detection ability of the charts is measured in terms of 
the expected average run length over a wide range of shifts, and the p shift is assumed to follow a uniform 
distribution. The findings of this research reveal that the curtailed EWMA chart has a superior overall 
performance than the EWMA chart without curtailed inspection. On average, the former is more effective 
than the latter by 35%, considering different circumstances. The high overall effectiveness of the curtailed 
EWMA chart is mainly attributable to curtailed inspection.

1. Introduction 
A control chart is one of the most useful tools in Statistical Process Control (SPC). It is commonly 
used as an on-line surveillance technique in the manufacturing industries and service sectors. 
Recently, many control charts and SPC surveillance techniques have been developed 
(Shamsuzzaman et al. 2014, Chiu and Lu 2015, Khoo et al. 2015, Haridy et al. 2017a). The 
binomial Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) chart is widely used for monitoring 
the fraction nonconforming p of a process. The extensive application of the binomial EWMA chart 
and attribute charts, in general, is attributable to many factors. These factors are not just related to 
the simplicity of handling attribute quality characteristics, and the capability of checking multiple 
quality requirements, but also to the ease by which they allow people at different levels of an

the EWMA chart by 35%. This reflects the contribution of the curtailed inspection to improve the 
overall detection effectiveness of the EWMA control chart. The curtailed inspection allows the 
curtailed EWMA chart to use a reasonably large sample size so that it is sensitive to small p shifts. 
On the other hand, when a large p shift takes place, the curtailed inspection enables the curtailed 
EWMA chart to signal the large p shift before all of the n units in a sample are inspected. This 
ensures that the curtailed inspection mechanism can improve the performance of the control charts 
for detecting both small and large p shifts. 
 
 
5. Conclusion 
This research proposes a binomial EWMA chart employing curtailed inspection for detecting 
increasing shifts in fraction nonconforming p. The curtailed inspection was able to considerably 
improve the overall detection effectiveness of the EWMA chart compared with that of the 
traditional EWMA without curtailed inspection. The developed curtailed EWMA chart is superior 
to the conventional EWMA chart under different settings. On average, the former is more effective 
than the latter by 35% in terms of expected average run length (EARL). 
The curtailed EWMA chart can be implemented using a well-developed procedure. Once the 
curtailed EWMA chart is designed, it can be used continuously as long as there is no change in the 
process and the improvement in detection speed can be gained. The observed ARL0 of the curtailed 
EWMA chart is usually very close to the desired false alarm rate, despite the discrete nature of 
attribute characteristics.  
In this article, the curtailed EWMA chart is implemented with a 100% inspection. It can also 
be used to detect increasing p shifts when sampling inspection is employed. Another prospective 
future work is to use the curtailed inspection to enhance the power of other control charts such as 
the time-between-events and synthetic control charts.

Abstract 
This paper analyzes the weaknesses of meta-analyses (MAs) in the field of operations research and 
management using a more mature scientific field as a benchmark and source of inspiration for 
improvements: the field of medicine. In following this approach, we suggest that there are four areas in 
which common operations and management MA practices should improve: i) availability of information 
and replicability of primary research; ii) correct application of statistical support; iii) execution of 
heterogeneity analyses; and iv) standardization of results reporting. Using a representative study on a 
management topic published in a reputable journal, we qualitatively identify the aspects that can be 
improved at each stage of the meta-analytic process as it is applied to management. We show the different 
results that could have been achieved by following procedures that are standard in the field of medicine, 
and we propose a standardization of the meta-analytic procedure - beyond statistical analysis - in which we 
incorporate various ‘good practices’ used in clinical research. Overall, these recommendations are aimed 
at improving the transparency, credibility and replicability of the MAs, which not only facilitates the 
building of cumulative scientific knowledge but also helps to validate the dialogue between academia and 
practitioners.

Abstract 
In a highly competitive and uncertain industry, as is the area of the logistic services, creating new 
offers, complex, customized and integrated, and their differentiation are the levers of performance and 
profit to the logistics service providers. Being a specialist, force of proposals and innovation appears 
to be essential for these third-party actors (noted LSP). Faced with changing their profession, what the 
added value for the LSP to use information and communication technologies especially Internet of 
Things (IoT)? What can be the strategies implemented by the logistics service providers to sustain its 
activity? 
This article will lay the theoretical foundation for reflection on the strengths implemented by LSP 
manifested mainly by the use of radio identification chips (RFID: Radio Frequency IDentification). 
We will present a novel approach to integrate the RFID smart and legacy Tag in the logistics 
outsourcing process by using the publish/subscribe pattern with the MQTT (Message Queueing 
Telemetry Transport) protocol. This approach allows integrating an RFID system continuously to the 
logistics outsourcing process and reporting event in real time regarding the performance of the LSPs.

Abstract 
Outsourcing logistics has known a considerable development since 1990. However, though their 
expected results, most of outsourcing logistics projects could not meet their expectations. The 
unplanned risk assessment is one of the causes. Therefore, risk assessment has become a main 
objective in terms of outsourcing. 
Our suggestion in this paper would be a creation of a risk assessment model linked to 
outsourcing logistics process. To achieve this objective, we propose as a first step some 
modeling tools, and then we will execute the ARIS Model to outsourcing logistics process for the 
sake of prioritizing, anticipating and managing the risks. Last but not least, our study will end up 
with an operational model determining guidelines and processes. Our proposal will be validated 
upon a real outsourcing logistics case which will enable us to understand how the case study is 
assessing the potential risks and what are their backs up strategies.

Abstract 
Supply chains from automotive industry are very complex. Reason for its complexity becomes from a 
great number of partners, from suppliers (inbound supply chain from automotive industry include a 
huge number of supplier tiers), producers, distributors to retailers and customers, and also from great 
number of different components that are necessery for final product. This level of complexity is 
present also in supply chains from electronic industry, aviation industry etc. Logistics management 
represent imperative for efficient and effective managing of automotive industry, as a very complex 
area. Each partner in supply chain has a task to integrate all aspects of logistics: Internal logistics with 
focus on networking procurement, transportation, inventory control with information systems, 
planning, production, inspection, and delivery of final product in one process. And external logistics 
with focus on networking internal operations with sub-suppliers, sales, warehouse management, 
distribution networks, service providers, and customers. 
The challenge of this paper is to create new concepts and tools of monitoring to develop production on 
sequencing, remove 3PL from supply chain and optimizing space and stock value (Handling & 
warehouse cost) in fact the product cost to be optimized. 
The aim axis will be following this chronologic: 
✓ Theoretical study of the market expectation: Literature review 
✓ Research methodology: Analyzing of Sample and define of hypotheses 
✓ Research results and discussion

Abstract 
In the past two decades, sustainable development has attracted increasing attention from both researchers and 
practitioners in different industries. For project-based organizations, an effective way to satisfy the three pillars of 
sustainable development (economic, environmental, and social) is to develop guidelines that integrate sustainability 
into project management processes and practices, which mapping sustainable development of project management 
processes can achieve. This paper identifies and maps sustainability practices of the five project management process 
groups that the Project Management Body of Knowledge Guide recognizes, which include controlling, closing, 
executing initiating, monitoring, and planning. This study comprised a comprehensive literature review and 
consultations with experts in the construction industry in the United Arab Emirates. Accordingly, eighty sustainability 
practices related to the three pillars of sustainability were identified and mapped onto the five processes that the 
PMBOK Guide recognizes. The results of this study are of value to project managers in the construction industry who 
are interested in incorporating sustainability into project management practices, thus achieving the sustainable 
development objectives of their organizations. The results may also contribute to integrating sustainability into project 
management standards.

1. Introduction
The perceptions of sustainable development associated with the triple fundamentals of economic, environmental, and 
social development have evolved into a concern of prominence for projects (Labuschagne et al. 2005; Valdes-Vasquez 
and Klotz 2013). Although sustainability has become an essential factor for scholars and professionals in project 
management (Silvius et al. 2013; Sánchez 2015; Silvius and Schipper 2015; Sarkis et al. 2012; Valdes-Vasquez and 
Klotz 2013; Labuschagne et al. 2005) and project management can enhance the integration of the dimensions of 
sustainability (Bocchini et al. 2014), an inconsistency is present between the perceptions of the prominence of the 
need for sustainability and the substantial usage of sustainability in project management (SPM) practice (Martens and 
Carvalho 2016a). Additionally, project management, which focuses upon eco-design is an incipient theme (Brones 
and Carvalho 2015) a deficiency exists in the eco-design literature (Brones et al. 2014) as little research has associated 
these fields with each other. Thus, although the literature about this research topic has emerged, it persists in being 
discrete (Martens and Carvalho 2016b). Confirmation of this is present by the exclusion of fundamental controversial 
issues concerning sustainability in the governing bodies in the project management field. Additionally, further research 
is required for advancing methodologies, techniques, and tools (Singh et al. 2012) and in addressing the absence of 
the integration of sustainability in project management routines (Cole 2005; Brones et al. 2014). Sustainability can be 
connected with project management in several ways. For instance, this linkage could include leading variables that 
must be handled to achieve sustainability during a project life cycle and an assessment of indicators like the impacts 
that a project has on money, people, and the planet. (Carvalho and Rabechini 2011). The motivation of this study is 
the need to bridge sustainability in project management (Brones and Carvalho 2015), given its increasing importance 
in the current business environment. Silvius et al. (2012) distinguished between what sustainability means for projects

Abstract 
In today´s hectic age, not only people who have a physically demanding job but also people who spend their 
workday at a computer have an experience with occupational illnesses. This type of activity does not seem to be 
physically demanding, but for people can be even more dangerous than heavy work. According to Czech 
Statistical Office the most common occupational disease in the Czech Republic is the carpal tunnel syndrome, 
which can be caused by limb overloads (over 320 reported cases in 2017) or by vibrations (over 140 cases in 
2017). Not only people who works in manufacture, but also people who work in the office can suffer with this 
illness. In these days the carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common hand disorder and most affected are women. 
The number of women in industrial companies has been increasing since the economic crisis in 2008. As the data 
of the Czech Statistical Office shows that in 2008 number of women in industrial companies was slightly over 
450 thousand, in 2016 it was almost half a million. The Czech Statistical Office shows international comparison 
of employment of women and men in industry in 2014. This comparison indicates higher gender equality in 
industry sector for women in the Czech Republic than in other countries of EU. Compared to average number of 
employment of women and men in Industry in EU 28 (females 10,9 %, males 31,4 %) the value is above-average 
(females 22,7 %, males 47,6 %). The carpal tunnel syndrome can be usually evaluated by integrated 
electromyography (surface Electro-Myo-Graphy). This method is non-invasive and belongs to the experimental 
investigation methods that allow objective evaluation of neuromuscular activity by the registration of bioelectric 
potentials. On the muscles of the hand (extensors, flexors) are attached electrodes that sense the local muscular 
load. The paper is focused on comparison of EMG results on the same working positions operated by men and 
women. A group of men and women from the Czech population aged 30 to 55 were measured by integrated 
electromyography and evaluated. During measuring the local muscle stress on the hands of men and women, it 
was an effort to maintain a similar physical constitution and also age for a quantifiable comparison of the 
measured values. 
Keywords EMG, integrated electromyography, local muscular stress, occupational disease, gender.

Abstract 
 
The objective of this research was to determine the project constraints that must be considered to ensure 
project success in a typical manufacturing environment like a pulp and paper plant. The research 
methodology used to answer the research questions was a mixed –method approach.  The modes of data 
collection were literature study, case studies and a survey questionnaire.  The data was analysed using 
between-methods triangulation. The research presented was limited to data obtained within the South 
African Pulp and Paper Industry.  The research will give project managers, and anyone involved in execution of 
projects in a Pulp and Paper plant environment more insight and better understanding of which constraints to consider 
to ensure better project success rates. The research concluded that Triple constraints are not the only 
determinants of project success in the Pulp and Paper plant.  Additional project constraints were identified 
were; Risk; Human resource management; Legal requirements; Technical performance

1. Introduction 
 
Over the last few decades worldwide organisations have slowly but surely become more projects-centered.  This has 
led to an expansion and redefinition of project management principles and tools (Andersen, 2010) (Taylor, 2013).  The 
Iron triangle or, Triple constraints as it is commonly known, are a framework to evaluate the competing demands and 
manage trade-offs of a project.  The triangle, indicates the balancing of the triple constraints of scope, time and cost.  
The general understanding is that project management is summarised in this triangle; the three elements must remain 
balanced for the project to be successful (Van Wyngaard, 2013).  The triple constraints are defined by the Project 
Management Book of Knowledge (PMBOK) as a framework for evaluating competing demands and managing 
competing project requirements (PMI, 2004).  
 
Manufacturing is mainly process based, thus project management will be effective as it is also process based (Bateman, 
2012).  A manufacturing environment can be described as a multi project environment.  Multi project means that 
various projects of different sizes, importance, requirements and urgency are undertaken at the same time, utilizing 
the same pool of resources. Resources are the largest constraining factor in manufacturing plants (Gress, 1997). 
 
The pulp and paper industry is a subsector in the Manufacturing industry.  Projects in a manufacturing environment 
and typically in the pulp and paper industry are undertaken in order to optimize the process, improve efficiencies, 
upgrading of equipment, and improve quality of product and save costs. Project Management Institute (PMI) in the 
PMBOK Guide, Fourth Edition replaced the triple constraints by a larger list of project constraints that project 
managers should consider.  The list of project constraints proposed by PMI is an extension of the triple constraints. 
Besides scope, time and costs, it includes resources, quality and risks (Nguyen, 2010). On a blog hosted by (Duggal, 
2011) many of the respondents agreed that project managers must consider the environment in which projects are 
being undertaken and must broaden their perspective to include other constraints, besides the triple constraints, that 
may impact the project outcomes.

The desire for a clean and healthy environment has to be traded off against other desires in society as well as the cost 
to the mills (Koren, 1975). The respondents in the survey also cited that some project failures had been due to failure 
to meet the legal requirements.  Legal requirements were also identified as an additional constraint.  
In Case study C, the project failure rate was consistent with the statistics representing the manufacturing industry as 
stated by (Labuschagne, et al., 2013) that 20% of projects failed in this industry. Resources are the largest constraining 
factor in manufacturing plants (Gress, 1997).  In this case the human resource of skilled labor was the main constraint 
that led to projects not being successful. The lack of skilled labor was also highlighted in a report by the Institute of 
Economic Research on Innovation (IERI), the report stated that over a third of the total, skilled trades’ people and 
artisans account for the greatest proportion of vacancies in the Pulp and paper sector (Pogue, 2008).  
7. Conclusion and Recommendations
The research questions were proven to be true.  Q1: Triple constraints are not the only constraints to project success 
in a pulp and paper plant. Q2: There are other constraints that must be considered that contribute to project success in 
a pulp and paper plant. The additional constraints as triangulated from the literature review, case studies and survey 
are: 
•
Risk (including market condition assumptions)
•
Human resource management (contractor management, scarce skills)
•
Legal requirements
•
Technical performance
These findings were found to be in line with the current theories and perspectives in terms of project constraints.  The 
(PMI, 2017). (Duggal, 2010), (Gress, 1997) other sources are all in agreement that project constraints are unique to 
each project and that the triple constraints are an outdated parameter.    
This study was based on a literature study, a limited number of secondary data as case studies and had a rather poor 
survey response rate.  During the study it was evident that there is very limited information or literature on projects 
and project management in the Pulp and Paper Industry in general.    There were little or no project management 
statistics obtainable.  It is recommended that a study be done into the status of project management within the Pulp 
and Paper industry in South Africa to build up knowledge in this area. From this study it can be recommended that 
the additional constraints be taken into consideration as project success limiting criteria in order to improve the chances 
of project success.

Abstract 
Project portfolio management (PPM) is nowadays more talked about in the industries. The various components 
accounting for PPM is well researched with its implication on the business success. Business success is a very broad 
term and is bit difficult to define by only one or two parameters. Business success is always affected by the risks 
associated with it. Managing the risks in time does require skills and experience. Managing project portfolios do 
need proper risk management. Indian Auto Component Industry (IACI) has evolved as one quality parts suppliers to 
the various giants of automobile manufacturers. In the era of global competition and dynamic nature of the market, 
even IACI is facing challenges in terms of meeting the customer requirements. The project portfolios handled in 
IACI needs a deep insight as it affects the business success. One of the main components of PPM is risk 
management .This research paper talks about the risk management in the project portfolios in the different 
organizations of IACI through an empirical study.

Abstract 
The ever-increasing demand for complex product geometries along with superior product features has led to a rapid 
increase in the use of super alloys. However, the difficulty in machining of these alloys had made non-traditional 
machining processes an attractive substitute to conventional machining. In this paper, an attempt has been made to 
optimize the performance parameters namely material removal rate (MRR) and overcut in machining of Inconel 800 
alloy by WEDM using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This is achieved by performing the experiments according 
to the Taguchi L16 orthogonal array. Different ANN network structures were developed and compared taking into 
consideration pulse on time (Ton), pulse off time (Toff), current (I) and servo voltage (SV) as the controlled parameters 
for identifying the optimal network. The predicted results were found to have a close consensus with the experimental 
values.

1. Introduction
Inconel 800 is an iron-nickel-chromium alloy. It has good resistance to carburization and oxidation at high 
temperature. The use of Inconel 800 is particularly found in the petrochemical industries, rocket engines, piping 
industries, space crafts, seals and combustors, gas turbine blades, steam generators in nuclear-pressurized reactors etc

Figure 8 shows the comparison of predicted overcut by network 4-8-8-2 in ANN and experimental overcut. The plot 
is made with respect to run order as shown in table 2. It can be clearly seen that the predicted and experimental overcut 
follow similar trends. The minimum absolute percentage error for the network was found to be almost zero whereas 
the maximum absolute percentage error was 13.25%.

5. Conclusion 
On the basis of experimental values of Ton ,Toff , I , SV, MRR and overcut, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for 
WEDM process is structured in MATLAB using nntool. The optimal network structure 4-8-8-2 with R-value of 
0.99794 is obtained from 15 different network structures. It has been seen that the predicted MRR follows a similar 
trend as the experimental MRR. However, the optimal network predicted approximately 16% more MRR for 16th run 
order. The minimum absolute percentage error for the network was found to be almost zero whereas the maximum 
absolute percentage error was 15.61%. Similarly, the predicted overcut also follows a similar trend to the experimental 
overcut. The minimum absolute percentage error for the network was found to be almost zero whereas the maximum 
absolute percentage error was 13.25%. Hence it can be concluded that the network structure 4-8-8-2 provides the best 
result for the four selected controlled parameters and the two performance parameters in ANN.  
Based on an exhaustive survey of literatures available,expert opinion and preliminary experimentations, the four most 
significant input process parameters were selected for the present study. However, the effect of other process 
parameters on the machining process were not investigated and can be a scope for future work. Besides it is very 
difficult to consider all parameters of WEDM at a time due to the complexity of the process itself. Finally other 
optimizing and predictive methods like Polynomial Neural Network (PNN), Group Method of Data Handling 
(GMDH) etc can also be used for parametric optimization of WEDM for Inconel 800.

Abstract  
 
Aluminum extrusion is considered as one of the very challenging processes to produce good quality and 
low cost products. This paper presents an optimization design of the X &R  chart for effective statistical 
monitoring of output of aluminum extrusion process. The proposed optimal X &R  chart is compared with 
traditional 3-σ X &R  chart, in terms of the average extra quadratic loss (AEQL), for detecting a wide range 
of shifts in the mean and variance. The results reveal that the optimal X &R  chart overtakes the 3-σ X &R  
chart by 94%, in terms of AEQL. In addition, the former has the smallest out-of-control average time to 
signal (ATS) over almost all shifts. Consequently, the replacement of traditional X &R  chart by the optimal 
one is recommended to detect the mean and variance shifts more efficiently and as a result, reduce the 
process variation and avoid economic loss.

1. Introduction 
Aluminum extrusion usage has been increased in the last decades. It approximately represents one-
third of the global aluminum production. Products of aluminum extrusion are usually seen in our 
daily life from cars and airplanes to wall elements and window frames. It is considered as a 
complex process since it depends on material properties and many process parameters, such as 
initial temperature of billet, die geometry, friction at the outlet, cooling temperature and ram speed. 
Products produced by the extrusion process can have complex geometrical designs achieving 
customized cross-sections. However, due to the nature of the process, variations in geometry 
always takes place, which lower the capability to meet strict tolerance limits of the final product.  
Lucignano et al. (2010) used two neural networks to optimize the aluminum extrusion process. 
Zhang et al. (2012) developed a numerical model to study metal flow attributes during aluminum 
extrusion. The numerical results were validated by comparing with the nose ends of two extrudates 
in practice, and the comparison showed that the numerical model developed in this work could

chart element. The values of Average Extra Quadratic Loss values (AEQL) are also indicated in 
Table 1. The index AEQL is a performance measure used to evaluate the overall performance of 
the control charts over a wide domain of shifts rather than at a specific shift. AEQL directly relates 
the chart performance with the economic outcome based on Taguchi’s loss function (Ross, 1988).

The smaller the AEQL, the better the chart is. It is found that the optimal X &R chart with a sample 
size n of 2 can outperform the traditional 3-σ X &R  chart by 94% in terms of AEQL.

Table 2 shows that the optimal X &R chart outperforms the 3-σ X &R chart over almost all process

of the Average Time to Signal (ATS).

5. Conclusion 
This study aims at improving the effectiveness of detecting shifts in mean and variance in the 
aluminum extrusion process in a manufacturing plant, and hence lowering the number of defective 
items produced. The proposed case study emphasizes the supremacy of the optimal X &R  chart 
with n = 2 over the traditional 3-σ X &R  chart with n = 5 in terms of AEQL and ATS. It is found 
that the optimal X &R  chart is more effective than the 3-σ X &R  chart by 94%, in terms of AEQL. 
In addition, the former has the smallest out-of-control ATS for almost all shifts except for small 
pure mean shifts.

This study is conducted assuming that the quality characteristic x of the output of the aluminum 
extrusion process follows a normal distribution with a known in-control μ0 and standard deviation 
σ0, while δµ and δσ are assumed to follow Rayleigh distribution. It is interesting to carry out further 
studies on the performance of the X &R  chart when µ0 and σ0 are unknown and need to be 
estimated, or when x follows non-normal distributions.

Abstract 
Over the ongoing time we all are facing the impact of ‘Climate Change’, which is also known as ‘Global Warming’
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
or in other words “An unnatural weather change”. One of the significant reasons are increase in level of Carbon
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dioxide in the atmosphere. Now a day, the main concern of the researchers is to discover how to reduce the carbon
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
 
 
 
discharge to decrease the unnatural weather change. ​In our study, we investigate how firms manage carbon footprint
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in lot sizing problem under ‘Carbon Emission Trading’ mechanism. So, we used the concept of Pochet and Wolsey’s
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
capacitated lot sizing problem formulation and give a new formulation with carbon footprint constraints. The
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
problems under consideration are single level, the single item production problem with a finite time planning
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
horizon and the demand is also deterministic. We also consider the shortage cost. As per our knowledge in the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
literature, there is no such work has been done over single item capacitated lot sizing problem with shortage variable
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and with strict carbon cap constraint. We considered initial inventory and end period shortage is zero (I​0 ​= S​T​.= 0)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
Also, for shortage cost, in earlier formulations are unable to eliminate them; however, our formulation is able to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
eliminate all shortage (We used the concept from Shrama et al (2017)). This is a solid theoretical contribution as it
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
   
 
 
 
  
offers significant computational savings.

In the literature, Lagrangian Relaxation has been used to solve simple plant location problem with carbon footprints
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
constraint. We extend the work by introducing shortage variable. The target of the traditional lot sizing problem
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where carbon cap constraint was not considered, was to minimize the total cost (variable and fixed cost) of the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
supply chain. We consider the carbon cap constraint to check how significantly carbon emission reduction is
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
possible without significantly increasing the total cost. In the presence of carbon emission considerations, the firm
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
must account for the emissions associated with various decisions regarding ordering, production, and inventory
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
holding. Also, by using variable reduction technique, we have reduced the number of variables. In addition, the
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reformulation has a smaller number of factors than traditional formulation since production and shortage variables
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are replaced by setup and inventory variables. In this way, our reformulation and computational time can be better
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
than the traditional model, also some improvisation can be expected in terms of number of iterations and the number
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of node calculation. Considering all the factors, a huge diminishing in computational effort can be expected. 
It has been noticed that all constraints are linear in nature. We are undertaking an empirical study that plans to
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
determine the efficiency of both formulations (Traditional and the new one).

Abstract 
 
During operation in the coal-fired power plant, the cyclic operation of the plant exposes components and systems 
such as boilers to high pressure and temperature, resulting in mechanical and thermal fatigue damage. Like most 
engineered systems, maintenance of these boilers is required to improve the availability and safety of the plant. 
However, delays are common in the execution of these maintenance projects. This study explored factors 
contributing to delays and their effects on boiler maintenance during half station shut down in a coal-fired plant. 
The study adopted a qualitative approach using project documents and open-end questionnaires as a data source. 
The findings identified sixteen factors contributing to delays, and twelve effects thereof. Additionally, mitigation 
for dealing with contributing factors is also presented. The study results can assist practitioners working in boiler 
maintenance to adopt a proactive approach to manage delays and contributes to the global field of knowledge.

1. Introduction  
 
Coal-fired power plants are energy converter systems and primary electricity generators in South Africa and 
globally. Water under pressure is converted into steam through heat generated by the combustion of pulverized 
coal as fuel. Steam is expanded through a turbine to produce mechanical power. The mechanical power in the 
turbines rotates the generator rotor to produce electrical power (Babcock and Wilcox Company 2005). During 
operation, systems and components of the coal-fired power plant such as boilers are exposed to high pressure and 
temperature resulting in wear and fatigue of tubes and other components, thus adversely affecting the efficiency 
of the plant and reducing its design lifetime. Like most engineered systems, to improve the conditions indicated 
above, availability and safety of the plant, maintenance of these boilers are important to minimise breakdowns 
and to avoid expensive plant shutdowns. 
 
A coal-fired power plant owned and operated by an energy generating company in South Africa embarked on 
boiler maintenance commonly known as half station shutdown (HSD) from October 2017, with a planned 
completion date of March 2018. The HSD is a preventive maintenance philosophy adopted by the energy 
generating company to improve plant reliability. The HSD involved performing maintenance on half of the total 
boiler units in a power plant in parallel. For example, if a power plant consists of six boiler units, maintenance is 
performed on three of the six boiler units simultaneously. The scope of work of the HSD included replacement 
and repair of systems such as boiler pressure part systems, high-pressure piping and burners with the objective of 
preventing the development of risky operating conditions, optimize operation and energy efficiency. Due to the 
nature of work, it is important that delays during the execution are minimised, and that boiler units on maintenance 
return to service as scheduled to reduce the burden on the national grid (Van der Nest 2015). However, the 
completion of the maintenance was faced with several challenges. A significant challenge faced during this 
maintenance execution is delays. These delays emanated from various sources, resulting in maintenance 
contractors resorting to strategies such as recruitment of additional manpower, requesting time extension and 
extending working hours as remedies in attempt to meet schedule obligations. These practices prove to be not 
only costly but ineffective, as the project resulted in a calculated overrun of two months. 
 
 
A case study was conducted to find factors contributing to delays and their associated effects in boiler preventive 
maintenance (HSD) in a coal-fired power plant in South Africa, focusing on boiler scope. By identifying these 
factors, the boiler engineering maintenance company can adopt a proactive approach to deal with factors 
contributing to delays. The results of this case study are not declared as general for all the coal-fired power plant 
projects in South Africa or anywhere else in the world but remain specific to the power plant understudy.

Abstract 
The concept of sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) has received increasing recognition in both theory and 
practice. Current dependency on the oil and gas industry for economic development and social activities necessitates 
research into the sustainability of the industry’s supply chains. Previous studies on SSCM practices in the industry 
have paid little attention to context dependent factors that either enable or hinder progress towards sustainability in a 
supply chain. Our aim is to address this gap by exploring the relationship between organizational culture and SSCM 
practices, as well as the resultant effect of this interaction on performance outcomes. Specifically, this study examines 
SSCM as one possible explanatory mechanism through which an organization’s culture influence its performance. A 
survey of 192 oil and gas companies was conducted. The data collected was analyzed using structural equation 
modelling. The results provide evidence that SSCM practices mediate the culture-performance relationship. Thus, 
managers should ensure that SSCM is embedded in their organizational culture in order to achieve greater 
sustainability performance. For instance, organizations could pursue characteristics of the culture that enable 
innovation and risk-taking, and aim at increasing long-term value, rather than short-term economic benefits.

Abstract 
In today’s rapidly evolving market, it is difficult for startup companies to survive if they do not have a high-growth 
profile. Scholars believe that either the startups expand rapidly to capture major market segment or they slowly die 
out. Large companies usually outsource non-core activities to invest additional resources in the core activities, 
whereas, expanding startups have limited flexibility and have to outsource business activities in order to survive the 
high-growth expectation of the market. With limited resources at the entry level, startups certainly have no other 
choice except outsourcing business activities. There are various advantages and disadvantages of outsourcing 
depending on the business the company is operating in. Various companies fall into the trap of outsourcing activities 
that are important to keep inhouse. The present study offers a decision tree comprising the most critical parameters 
that enables the user to differentiate activities to be kept in-house from those to be outsourced. These parameters 
include measuring the business activity on the basis of standardisability or specifiablity, receiving input for innovation, 
establishing proper barriers to entry in place, and keeping correct contract agreements setup with the suppliers.

Outsourcing, Decision tree, High-growth startups 
1. Introduction
Business owners have been practicing outsourcing for a long time. Managers outsource business activities not only to 
capitalize on labour costs (Tate et al., 2009) but also on offering products and services that are not within their 
capability. Activities that are not core activities are outsourced to gain maximum competitive advantage (Sharpe, 
1997). Companies hire suppliers that manage non-core activities; therefore, the overall efficiency of the organization 
increases that provides the possibility to invest more of the available resources in the core activities. Thus, it is 
important for organizations to consider the option of outsourcing (Tayles and Drury, 2001). 
Outsourcing is dissimilar compared to other major business trends such as servitization (e.g., Tauqeer and Bang, 
2018), personalization (e.g., Kavadias et al., 2016), and sharing economy (e.g., Zervas et al., 2017) etc. because 
outsourcing primarily focusses on organisation capability whereas other business trends are customer oriented.  
Our literature review reveals various advantages of outsourcing business activities. Outsourcing enables companies to 
become agile to market disruptions and provides the capability to quickly adapt to market changes (Dess et al, 1995; 
Moore and Barnett, 2004). It enhances the core capabilities of the organization and the overall competence level 
(Blumberg, 1998; Quinn, 1999). Cost efficiency through offshoring (Oshri et al., 2015) and avoiding vertical 
organizational bureaucracy is achieved (Lei and Hitt, 1995; Robinson, 2001). On the other hand, the demerits include 
the dependency on suppliers, and losing control such that the suppliers become the bottleneck and start controlling the 
business (Cullen et al., 2006). In several cases, suppliers become competent enough and started marketing the products 
and services independently. Hence, companies need to trade-off between these merits and demerits, to decide what to 
outsource. 
Established companies generally have the manoeuvrability to strategically inhouse or outsource business activities. 
However, many startup companies have to primarily rely on outsourcing in order to become a high-growth company.

2.2 Input for innovation  
 
Studies significantly regard innovation as the forefront of sustainability of the companies. Outsourcing can be a key 
hindrance to innovation especially when major business processes are outsourced. Generally, organisations innovate 
by acquiring tacit knowledge of the business processes. Therefore, ensuing input for innovation is a key concern while 
outsourcing business activities. 
Input for innovation becomes irrelevant if non-core activities are outsourced e.g., IT support. However, when major 
business processes like production are outsourced, input for innovation becomes a significant concern. Recently 
production intensive companies like automakers have adapted to acquire input for innovation despite outsourcing 
production by obtaining data from the vendors and deploying their engineers at various levels of the production 
facilities of the vendors (Becker and Zirpoli, 2017). Before deciding to outsource a business process, input for 
innovation shall be addressed. Else, the company may lose competitive advantage over time.  
 
2.3 Barrier to entry  
 
Another concern while outsourcing business processes is barrier to entry. Vendors can gradually become better and 
can originate as potential competitors. Various examples in electronics industry exists where the suppliers started 
offering the same products and services as their clients. This challenge can be lowered through intellectual property 
rights such as patents, trademark and brand. However, strictly speaking, patents provide some protection to the 
potential entrants but it is often possible to go around them. A portfolio of patents around the business may serve the 
purpose. Protection in terms of brand also requires massive marketing costs and significant duration to be well 
established. Barrier to entry is business dependent and varies across businesses and business activities. Therefore, the 
major concern is that the barrier to entry shall be carefully considered before outsourcing a business activity. 
 
2.4 Right contract setup (other risks) 
 
Contracts setup is among the critical concerns while outsourcing. Through the establishment of a suitable contract, 
barriers to entry and input for innovation can be ensured. It is vital to set up a contract with the vendors that provides 
protection against various other risks. Such risks include for instance, sharing data or information to third parties 
and/or exploitation of intellectual property rights. For startup companies, hiring consultants that have expertise in 
contract setup can be a useful way to mitigate various unknown risks associated with outsourcing of the activities. 
 
3. Conclusion 
 
Outsourcing has various advantages and disadvantages. However, for startup companies aiming to become a high 
growth company, outsourcing is nearly vital. The present study highlights four major parameters to be considered 
while determining to outsource business processes. They are parameters like measuring standardisability or 
specifiablity of the activity, receiving input for innovation, having barriers to entry in place, and keeping correct 
contract agreements setup with the suppliers. The present study has emphasised that startup companies cannot 
overlook these foremost parameters while outsourcing business activities. These parameters are arranged in a decision 
tree with easy ‘yes’ and ‘no’ options so that they can be applied by the leaders of startup companies to decide which 
activities to outsource and which to keep inhouse.

Abstract 
 
Control science is more than an engineering discipline. Its record of success in engineering 
applications—enabling the design of systems that were previously impossible, improving 
performance and reliability, and achieving cost-efficiencies in design and operation—can be traced 
to underlying principles that are universally relevant for all dynamical systems. Indeed, it is not a 
stretch of the imagination to claim that, “Control science is the only rigorous approach to optimized 
decision making in complex dynamical systems”! 
 
Advanced control has had tremendous economic and societal impact in engineering. Facts and 
figures from various industry sectors (including industrial processes, commercial buildings, 
aircraft and spacecraft, and automotive) attest to the benefits achieved—e.g., $1 additional profit 
per barrel for oil refineries. Advanced control systems comprise elements such as sensors, 
actuators, models, estimators, and optimization, and involve distributed, decentralized, and 
hierarchical control architectures.  
 
With this background, we can explore how technology management, as manifest in project 
management, innovation initiatives, portfolio allocation, and the like, can profit from a systems 
science perspective. This is not just a matter of drawing a management activity as a feedback 
control loop. Control science provides insights that can enlighten managerial decision makers and 
lead to improved decision-making performance.  
 
About ten such “insights” have been compiled. I outline a few here: 
• All advanced control relies on models of the system under control. In fact, all “informed” 
(i.e., nonrandom) decision making by people is also based on models—except in this case 
the models are in the crania of the decision makers! 
• Feedback is essential for counteracting uncertainty. If we have no uncertainty about how a 
system—whether engineered or organizational—will perform in response to different 
inputs (i.e., with a perfect model and absent noise or disturbance) we can dispense with 
feedback and just give a “feedforward” command. For higher (e.g., faster) performance in 
the face of uncertainty, however, both feedforward and feedback are needed. 
• Adaptation and robustness are often used interchangeably in common parlance. In control 
science these two terms have different meanings. Adaptation refers to the ability to change 
the control law (or decision-making heuristics) as the environment or the system changes,

Abstract 
For laboratories wishing to comply with the requirements of ISO 17025 quality management system, 
maintenance and improvement becomes two processes that are mutually inclusive. Like any other 
system, ISO 17025 system needs to be maintained through continual improvement. To effectively 
maintain ISO 17025 system through continual improvement in laboratories, certain critical success 
factors must be present. This study seeks to demonstrate the benefits for maintaining ISO 17025 
system by identification of critical success factors for continual improvement of ISO 17025 system 
in a coal testing division. The study aims to highlight that through continual improvement of ISO 
17025 system, organizations gain marketing edge and competitive advantage. The study process 
adopted a mixed method research by triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data. The research 
strategy used was a single case study by means of structured questionnaire. Convenience sampling 
method was adopted and 23 coal testing division employees participated in the study. The study 
highlighted that effective maintenance of ISO 17025 system through continual improvement may not 
necessarily guarantee error-free coal testing laboratories, but it will generate the needed confidence 
among coal end-users that the coal tested will satisfy coal quality requirements.

1. Introduction
Company X has provided testing services to the local and international mining industry since 1975. It is a key 
third party service provider to the global mining industry in sampling and analysis worldwide 
(Www.CompanyX.co.za Access date: 26/03/2018). Although the greater focus of testing service provided by 
company X to mining industry is in coal and iron ore, each of the tested commodities are used for different 
purpose(s) and the significance of their testing is as important as their daily use by mankind. This study will 
make reference to coal testing as the majority of testing laboratories of company X servicing mining industry 
are focused on coal testing. Been part of the commercial division of company X, the desirable end-result of 
coal testing division business strategy is to make as much reasonable profit as possible. This will result in 
stability within the business.  
According to (Kaziliunas 2010), the application of international standards benefits manufacturers, service 
providers, users, consumers and regulators as well as supporting sustainable development. According to (Zhu 
2014), the use of standards within organizations is a requirement for entry into the global trade. This study 
seeks to demonstrate to a greater extent the benefits for maintaining ISO 17025 quality management system 
through continual improvement. This will be achieved through identification of critical success factors for the 
maintenance of ISO 17025 quality management system in a coal testing division. The objectives of this study 
will be achieved by adoption of mixed methods research process through triangulation of quantitative and 
qualitative data by comparison of the literature review, company X commercial division quality management 
system case study and the structured questionnaire feedback. Twenty three relevant coal testing division 
employees participated in the study.

5. Conclusion
From the literature review, the benefits for maintaining ISO 17025 quality management system revealed 
include improved customer satisfaction, greater market share (Competitive advantage), operational credibility 
with government and customers, international recognition and stronger risk management. With regard to 
answering the question on, how to improve ISO 17025 quality management system within coal testing division? 
there must be an enforcement of customer requirements awareness to ensure everyone within coal testing 
division is familiar with customer requirements. Creation of an effective and open communication system on 
quality policy and objectives for all coal testing division personnel is vital. There must be an empowerment 
managed by designated personnel stationed in each laboratory to ensure an ongoing improvement of ISO 17025 
quality management system which will result in the reduction of reaction time to quality related issues. Coal 
testing division staff at all levels must be provided with education and training providing to equip them with 
the necessary knowledge to allow them to continuously improve ISO 17025 quality management system. An 
effective customer communication system must be established within coal testing division for providing 
customer service information, handling of enquiries, orders and customer feedback. Measuring and monitoring 
system must be established for service conformity to ensure all customer needs are met. There must be a 
creation of a system for identification and control of non-conformances and to prevent their unwanted use.

Abstract 
An assembly line is a technique used in mass production industries especially in the automotive 
industry, it consists of many work stations organized along a belt transport system or another handling 
equipment. The Assembly line balancing problem (ALBP) is a crucial question because it affects 
directly the productivity of the whole manufacturing system. In this paper we give an up to date review 
about this topic and we discuss the development of the classification of the assembly line balancing 
problems (ALBP) and the procedures and algorithms that propose solutions to the ALBP in our case. 
Keywords  
Assembly line, Assembly line balancing problem, Productivity. 
1. Introduction
The objective of the assembly line balancing problem (ALBP) is to assign multiple tasks to an ordered sequence 
of workstations, such as the precedence relations are satisfied, and some measurements of effectiveness are 
optimized. (E.g. to minimize the balance delay or minimize the number of work stations or the cycle time; etc.) 
in order to increase the system productivity which is the ratio of output over input and it depends on several factors 
such as workers skills, job methods and machines used. (Nuchsara and Nalin 2007). 
Salveson was the first who published a paper about the assembly line balancing problems (ALBPs) in 1955, he 
suggested a linear programming solution to this type of problems. Since then, the topic of line balancing has been 
a great field of research in the industry field. However, since the ALB problem falls into the non-deterministic 
polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) class of combinatorial optimization problems, it has consistently developed the 
efficient algorithms for obtaining optimal solutions. Many research efforts have been directed towards the 
development of algorithms or heuristics that propose solutions to the ALBPs (e.g. Kilbridge and Wester, 1961; 
Helgeson and Birnie, 1961; Hoffman, 1963; Arcus, 1966; Baybars, 1986) and exact methods to solve the ALB 
problems. (E.g. Jackson, 1956; Bowman, 1960; Van Assche and Herroelen, 1978; Mamoud, 1989; Hackman et 
al., 1989; Sarin et al., 1999). Recently two articles by Scholl and Becker (2006); Becker and Scholl (2006) provide 
the review of the exact and heuristic solution procedures for simple assembly line balancing (SALB). In this paper, 
we give a review about the development of the classification of the ALBPs and a comparison of the procedures 
used in the balancing of assembly lines in the automotive industry. 
2. The Assembly Line
2.1 Definition
An assembly line consists of a set of work stations where some specific tasks are carried to produce a product. 
Work stations are linked together by a transportation system that moves the work in process from one work station 
to the other.

As a result of this comparison, SALOME outperforms the other algorithms with respect to all of the measures, 
Eureka shows less precision, more idle time in the workstations and takes more time in computation than the other 
algorithms, OptPack is performing in the average relative deviations but it fails in proving optimal solutions in 
the majority of the instances. 
 
Though SALOME contains no initial heuristic, its flexible enumeration scheme aiming at finding very good 
solutions as early as possible leads to good and often optimal solutions very quickly. The dynamic rule controlling 
the bidirectional selection of stations is responsible for constructing rather small enumeration trees allowing for 
proving optimal solutions.  
 
Conclusion 
 
This paper tries to compare between the branch and bound procedures (SALOME, Eureka, FABLE, OptPack) and 
concerning all the measures, SALOME clearly outperforms the other procedures. But it needs improvements in 
reducing the size of the enumeration tree, which is reduced in the OptPack Algorithm by using the tree dominance 
rule.  
The limitation of this research is related to the constraints of workstations, so this research cannot be generalized 
to the automobile industry in all the cases. So, in the future, this research can be done with the optimization and 
minimization of those constraints.

Abstract 
This paper converge the discussion of payment delays in supply chain management literature by way of a systematic 
literature review of high ranked journals in operation management. Demand, Inventory, Cash Flow, Financial 
Decision, and supply chain coordination were identified as major issues in Supply chain Delay in payments. In our 
research, we noticed an increasing trend in publications for analytical research which limits the generalizing of the 
findings due to the different assumptions used in the modelling process. Most of these studies were conducted in the 
retail sector due to its coordinate organizational structure. We found that Delay in payment, as a coordination tool, 
can improve both the supplier’s and retailer’s profit as we proposed a conceptual model that resume the impact of 
Delay in payments in the issues discussed above. Future areas of research are identified like research under dynamic 
scenarios, including multi-echelon partners.

1. Introduction
It has been generally observed that the credit period has become a major concern for most of retailers, as it not only 
has direct influence on inventory and finance, but also on the demand of an item (Ebrahimi et al, 2017). In practice, 
vendors often provide buyers with forward financing. A number of studies dealing with inventory problems under 
delay in payments have been published over the years. (Teng, 2002 ; chen and Kang, 2009, Tsao, 2014)it is observed 
that payments are made to the supplier immediately after receiving the items. In practice, the supplier will offer the 
retailer a delay period in payment for the amount of purchase to increase the demand known as trade credit period 
(Yang, 2013). Offering such a credit period to the retailer will encourage the supplier’s selling and reduce on-hand 
stock level. Simultaneously, without a primary payment the retailer can take the advantages of a credit period to reduce 
cost and increase profit. (Ming et al, 2012 ; Jana et al 2012) The customer does not have to pay any interest during the 
fixed period but if the payment gets delayed beyond the period, interest will be charged by the supplier(Kumar,2010). 
This arrangement comes out to be very advantageous to the customer as he may delay the payment till the end of the 
permissible delay period. (Maihami et al,2016). During this credit period the retailer can start to accumulate revenues 
on the sales and earn interest on that revenue. Thus, the delay in the payment offered by the supplier is a kind of price 
discount since paying later indirectly reduces the cost of holding and it encourages the retailers to increase their order 
quantity (chan et al, 2010). Moreover, paying later indirectly reduces the cost of holding stock. Hence, trade credit

Abstract 
Supply chain management involves adapting to changes in complex global network of organizations, and thus we 
will not examine it as a set of sequential, vertically organized transactions representing successive stages of value 
creation but as a whole system. Operational complexity and dispersion are making the supply chain more vulnerable 
to risks. In recent years, there have been a number of high-profile events and persistent problems that have severely 
disrupted the ability of firms to produce and distribute their products, including devastating earthquakes, political 
turmoil, fuel crises, diseases and terrorism. Evidence suggests that a firm that responds to a disruption better than its 
competitors could improve its market position. Our study focus on identifying critical success factors in supply 
chain resilience and understanding causal relationships between them. In This paper we consider the supply chain 
resilience as a complex system as we describes it with an application of a systems approach known as the current 
reality tree from the theory of constraints, the study was conducted in a group-based model-building environment 
with a group of students who specialized either in supply chain management or process engineering science. We 
developed our conceptual model including supply chain robustness, agility, flexibility and visibility to deal with 
resilience complexity and we suggest that understanding the dynamic nature of supply chain resilience through 
cause and effect relationships is critical to build future resilient strategies

natural resources, and to enable humans to engage profitably in commerce and trade. ( Casson, M. (2013). The very 
extensive supply chain literature addresses supply chain practices and performance (e.g., Swink et al., 2007; Flynn et

Abstract 
 Using system dynamics modeling and simulation on a moroccan retail industry, we investigate wether and how 
delay in payment enhance supply chain resilience. Potential risks for the retailer’s resilience performance include the 
possibility of a mismatch between supply and demand, as well as serving the store inefficiently and causing on-shelf 
stock-outs due to the lack of cash-flow, Thus, resilience is determined by investigating the dynamic behaviour of 
stocks, shipment responses, cash in hand, and invoices payments. We show that retailer’s that face liquidity shocks 
are more likely to default on their market response, especially when the shocks are unexpected, supply chain 
partners with little liquidity, are likely to be credit constrained or are close to their debt capacity. Credit constrained 
firms would thus pass one their liquidity shocks on to their suppliers down the trade credit chain,we show that firms 
provide liquidity insurance to each other and that this mechanism is able to alleviate credit constraints. The method 
allows insights into the system structures that would not be evident using simulation alone, including a better 
understanding of the influence of control parameters on dynamic behaviours, and the impact of payment delays on 
supply chain resilience.

narrow functional silos such as purchasing, logistics, IT and marketing(burgess et al ,2006), The different 
interactions constitutes a complex set of relationships among buyers and suppliers, between a buyer and a supplier 
as well as between competing suppliers (Nair et al, 2008), so the supply chain management involves adapting to

management that more accurately reflects its true underlying complexity and dynamism. (Choi et al, 2006), so due

The simulation show that in a situation of a financil crisis with high, unpaid rate, the simulation show that a supply 
chain with permissibl payment delays, abosrb the disruption better and the supply chain surplus, in contrast with a

The sensivity analysis proved a light impact of the unpaid rate on the margin, as the volume of units is important. 
 
5. Discusion  
 
By using system dynamics mdeling and simulation on on a moroccan retail industry, we showed, 
based on a real life case study, how payment delays impact supply chain behavior. The study 
proved that in a case of financial crisis, where demand dropped drastically, payment delays 
increase significally as the supply chain surplus reached 3 billions, as it’s alleviate inventory and 
reduce costs across supply chain. 
 
6. Conclusion  
 
This paper presents findings of a simulation that managers can use to unlock the power of delay 
in payments along the cross cutting themes identified in the study. The findings show that the 
payment delays is a nowaday necessary tool to do business and supply chains should embrace it 
in order to build superior capabilities which can become a decisive competitive advantage. 
Organizations need to leverage the information across supply chain to share the real time 
information, better understand customers, optimize supply chains and human resources, improve 
financial metrics and develop the critical insights for decision making. It is important to have an

Abstract 
The growing demand of composite for variety applications are facing the depletion of petroleum resources, 
had made many researchers focuses on using natural materials. Rattan as one of them, are prepared in a 
woven tailored to reinforced epoxy based matrix, this aimed to partially reduce the synthetics. The fibers 
are previously conducted in alkali to optimize the cohesiveness of fibers into the matrix. The synergistic 
effect of adhesives silane and dimethylethanolamine (DMEA) into rattan woven can be boosted on 
shortening the curing time which results to an ultimate property of composite and reduces the production 
cost. The porosity and a hydroxyl content of fibers are might be obstacles to the series process which can 
be affected to the failures of maximizing the toughness of the product. The proper treatment can solve these 
problems.

1. Introduction
Composites can be used in a wide variety of applications not only for electricity, thermal, environment, and many
others. Composites are a combination of two materials, one served a reinforcer in the form of fibers, sheets, or granules 
which are transmitted into the matrix phase. The reinforcer conducted a load carrier is stronger than the matrix. The 
matrix served a load transfer medium between fiber to protect fiber from environmental damages, but if properly 
designed it will show better strength material.  
Fiber-matrix adhesion is a condition to make sure the property of good composite can be maintained in maximum 
stress level across the interface. If the adhesion is under the optimum the load has to be reduced. Surface treatment or 
coating is a way to increasing fiber-matrix adhesion. Silane is used on finishes of glass fibers [1], and rattan fiber for 
improving fiber-matrix adhesion [2].  It was applied to be used to fiber surface after being coated a resin. Using the 
natural fiber for the composite fabrication there are several advantages besides its cheap production cost it also has 
better mechanical properties [3]. The uniqueness is its porous fiber enabling on absorbing moisture which 
comprehensively impacted to properties of composite [4].

The results above when compared to the synthetic epoxy alone for thermal test the melting temperature is 64.39. If it 
is associated with the cost production of using natural fibers with the ranging of fraction weight is 23.69 to 42.77 from 
the total composite, it is much cheaper than a synthetics. Using matrix comprises a blending of synthetic epoxide with 
edibles epoxide to natural fiber with the assumption the fraction weight is same with above, the production costs will 
be more reduced. If the synthetic epoxide is still decided to be the matrix to reach the composite strength, using silane 
can be considered to be put in the formula for composite fabrication because the production time is shorter than DMEA 
so it will reduce production costs. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Some considerations on making composites from rattan fiber naturally have relatively high levels of water content the 
process of dispersing fibers in the matrix will not be effective. Thus giving dimension instability of the final product. 
Natural fibers are generally hydrophilic so are not compatible with the most matrix. To increase the wetting ability of 
fibers the surface needs to be modified so it becomes hydrophobic. Adding adhesive booster to the formula is much 
reduce the production cost because the curing time has reached the short time of production. This study has 
recommended on using Silane in the composite fabrication if using rattan fiber.

Abstract 
According to the literature about knowledge management capabilities, there are four main capabilities 
that need to be established and managed effectively in the company, to enhance the performance. The four 
main capabilities are technical resources, structural resources, cultural resources, and human resources. The 
main purpose of the current study is to identify the availability of the four capabilities and test their effect on 
service quality. A research model has been developed to describe the hypothesized relationship between the 
study variables and the needed data to test the conceptual model that has been collected from Saudi Binladen 
group (SBG) in Jeddah- Saudi Arabia. The data was collected by using a questionnaire that was developed 
based on the previous literature and according to the statistical analysis of the collected data, there are a 
positive effect for all the knowledge management capabilities on service quality. Several statistical 
techniques have been used to validate the model and test the hypotheses such as Reliability analysis and 
Regression analysis. The results of the current study contribute in filling the gap in the theory regarding the 
effect of knowledge management capabilities on service quality especially in Saudi Arabia. Also, the results 
enhanced the managers awareness about the importance of developing and managing effectively the 
knowledge management capabilities to improve the service quality. 
Keywords: knowledge management capabilities, service quality, and Jeddah. 
1. Introduction:
Knowledge management could be defined as reusing knowledge to improve organizational effectiveness by
providing the appropriate knowledge to those that need it. Knowledge management is expected to have a positive 
impact on the organizational effectiveness (Jennex, 2005). In 2005, Jennex and Olfman pointed out the importance of 
knowledge management practices as a critical success factors (CSFs), they identify 12 critical knowledge management 
practices. In knowledge-based age, knowledge is viewed as the key strategic resource for organizational subsistence,

Abstract 
Considering that 120 million people in the EU face the risk of poverty or social exclusion, while at the same time a 
35% of perishable food is unnecessarily discarded at supermarkets, the redistribution of the perishable food surpluses 
could provide a complete and balanced diet for almost 60.000 people a day or an equivalent reduction of ~100 million 
€ per year expenses in poverty confrontation. Moreover, the reduction of food waste through the timely donation to 
facilities that support socially vulnerable groups of a small amount of a food product (that most probably will end up 
to waste), could significantly promote a company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy. Under this context, 
the purpose of this paper is to explore inventory control policies that at a specific time instance close to the expiration 
date donate food when the inventory level is above a certain threshold and thus, reduce the expected amount to be 
disposed at the expiration date. Analytic and numerical models are employed in a single period setting to calculate 
optimal order quantity and threshold values that maximize the company’s profit. Numerical experimentation for a 
specific case discusses the conditions under which the proposed policy is feasible.

Abstract 
In keeping with the urgent goals of maintaining a healthy environment and providing clean energy 
alternatives at reasonable prices, Saudi Arabia is moving towards electricity generation using wind. 
Selecting optimal wind farm locations is an important challenge in which one seeks to reduce the levelized 
cost of electricity. A four-level multi-criteria decision-making model was developed that used the analytic 
hierarchy process to consider wind availability, electricity demand, employment costs, maintenance costs, 
infrastructure costs, sale prices, and energy production capabilities to optimize wind farm locations. In 
addition, this study introduced multiple factors that affect wind farm success. In this study, the analytical 
hierarchy process was implemented using mathematical simulations to compare three wind farm locations 
in Saudi Arabia.

Introduction
The Saudi Arabia 2030 Vision supports the advancement of the renewable energy industry and seeks to increase
the renewable energy capacity within the Kingdom to 9.5 GW by 2023 (General Authority of Statistics 2016). On July 
23, 2018, the Renewable Energy Project Development Office at the Ministry of Energy, Industry, and Mineral 
Resources of Saudi Arabia hosted bids for the first utility-scale wind farm in the country. It is expected to cost 
approximately $500 million and generate 400 MW of wind power to supply up to 70,000 Saudi households (Saudi 
Arabia Ministry of Energy 2018).  In addition, the wind energy industry is growing. Recently, it has grown by 
approximately 16% per year, reaching 435 GW of installed capacity at the end of 2015 (World Wind Energy 
Association 2016). The invention of electric cars is one of the initiatives that have been made. In addition, new 
techniques have been implemented to exploit energy from renewable sources. 
Recently, the level of discussion regarding shifts from classical to renewable energy within Saudi Arabia has 
increased. Thus, there is ongoing research on renewable energy sources such as wind. Optimization of wind turbine 
locations is important to power generation and the turbine life cycle. In particular, selecting an optimal site maximizes 
the benefits of wind farms (Ali et al. 2018). Several factors affect wind farm location decision-making. Cost is 
important — this includes maintenance and infrastructure costs, as well as labor costs. The latter can include 
uncertainty in currency fluctuations, economic changes, and political situations (Almaktoom et al. 2016). In addition, 
the quantity of energy produced affects location decision-making regardless of cost. Decision-makers also consider 
the opportunities associated with each location. These opportunities include energy demand (the number of 
households in the area) and wind availability as measured via wind speed. Opportunities, costs, and energy output 
significantly influence location decision-making.  
This study sought to rank the criteria used in selecting an optimal wind farm location in Saudi Arabia by 
importance via the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). This paper establishes a four-level model that includes wind 
farm selection criteria, sub-criteria, and alternatives such as locations A, B, and C. The AHP model used to rank these 
criteria was developed based on Saaty (1980). The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 analyzes 
applications of AHP. Section 3 introduces the wind farm criteria ranking method. Section 4 includes a case study of 
criteria ranking for wind farm location optimization. Finally, a summary is provided with recommendations and further 
work.

The resulting sub-criteria percentages and ratios are shown in Tables 6, 7, and 8. In order to link the sub-criteria 
to the criteria, one must weigh the former according to the main criteria weights (Figure 2).  
Figure 2. AHP model for wind farm location selection with criteria and sub-criteria weights. 
In order to choose the optimal wind farm location using the AHP method, the sub-criteria information must be 
determined for each location and the weights summed. The location with the highest weight is the best. However, this 
method is most effective when the sub-criteria are qualitative. In this case study, the sub-criteria such as wind 
availability, employee salaries, etc. are all quantitative. In conclusion, the AHP is not sufficient for identification of a 
suitable wind farm location. Further studies should be performed. Thus, this area of research will continue to adopt 
other techniques to achieve its objectives. 
5.
Conclusions
Wind farm turbine technology can make important contributions to the energy needs of Saudi Arabia. This study
presented a model that can be improved to help in developing a model that help in reducing energy costs. This study 
used the AHP, which is an MCDM method, to rank and evaluate wind farm allocation criteria. Due to the weaknesses 
of the AHP in multi-level ranking and dealing with quantitative data, further studies should integrate other methods 
to help achieve better rankings. It is recommended to extend the study and use other MCDM techniques that are more 
effective in ranking multi-level problems using qualitative and quantitative data. To overcome this gap, the technique 
for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) described in Choudhary and Shankar (2012), 
Roszkowska (2011), Srikrishan et al. (2014), and Ahmadi et al. (2013) should be integrated with AHP. It is also 
suggested to conduct further studies that consider the effects of uncertainty like Almaktoom (2017), Almaktoom and 
Krishnan (2016), Wang et al. (2013, 2014), and Krishnan et al. (2016) on optimal location selection.

Abstract 
 
The paper is concentrated on the topic of collaborative robots, especially the preparation of their implementation in 
the Czech Republic. The conditions in the Czech Republic are relevant in the part of the paper concentrating on the 
analysis of the safety requirements. Firstly, the paper introduces the topic of collaborative robots. They are described 
and compared with traditional industrial robots. This is followed by an analysis of the safety requirements which are 
an important base for implementation. Not respecting the safety requirements can have significant consequences for 
the company. The next part of the paper is the analysis of a company for cobot implementation. There is a description 
of the important steps for preparation of implementation (company overview, definition of potential workplaces for 
cobot implementation and analysis of potential workplaces). The last step is the final preparation of cobot 
implementation into specific workplaces. In this step, the specific cobot and integration company is chosen, then it is 
determined if the workplace is suitable for automation, and finally the technical implementation solution is created, 
including the investment calculation.

1. Introduction 
 
Nowadays, one of the most frequently mentioned subjects in modern industry is Industry 4.0. It has a significant 
influence on industry and on robotics, which is as one part of it. The development of robotics has led to a wide range 
of applications from medical to military applications. One area in industry that complements traditional industrial 
robots is the field of collaborative robots, which this paper deals with. 
 
The paper is concentrated on the topic of collaborative robots, especially the preparation of their implementation in 
the Czech Republic. The conditions in the Czech Republic are relevant in the part of the paper concentrating on the 
analysis of the safety requirements. These conditions are very similar to those in other EU member countries. It could 
inspire the other countries about what their analyses could concentrate on. 
 
Firstly, the paper introduces the topic of collaborative robots with a comparison between collaborative robots and 
traditional industrial robots. It is followed by an analysis of the safety requirements that establish an important base 
for implementation. The next part of the paper is an analysis of a company for cobot implementation. There is a 
description of the important steps for preparing implementation (company overview, definition of potential 
workplaces for cobot implementation and analysis of potential workplaces). The last step is the final preparation of 
cobot implementation into specific workplaces. In this step the specific cobot and integration company is chosen, then 
it is determined if the workplace is suitable for automation, and finally a technical implementation solution is created, 
including the investment calculation.

After this step, the cobot is ready for implementation according to the technical implementation solution. 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The paper concentrates on the topic of collaborative robots, and especially the preparation of their implementation in 
the Czech Republic. The paper can be taken as recommended instructions or inspiration for future collaborative robot 
projects or similar projects related to implementing new technology into production. It shows the importance of the 
analysis of the safety requirements which establish an important basis for their implementation. Not respecting the 
safety requirements can have significant consequences for the company. The other parts of paper also describe 
important topics for the preparation of implementation, namely, analysis of a company for cobot implementation and 
final preparation of cobot implementation for specific workplaces. Following these steps can significantly improve 
the success of implementing collaborative robots.

Abstract 
In a global market scenario inventory is one of the most significant possessions in a manufacturing trade. ABC 
analysis is a technique for inventory categorization which is most extensively used in manufacturing industries. The 
aim of this research is to deal with assignment of minimizing excess inventory by means of ABC classification and 
forecasting technique in a medium scale manufacturing industry. The main reason for the excess inventory is due to 
not following proper forecasting technique based on their original demand. The forecasting technique is used by 
simple moving average method for the previous three months production which leads excess inventory. This excess 
inventory is in the form of raw material, work in process, semi-finished product and finished product. Initially, the 
products need to be classified for inventory optimization and inventory forecasting. In this study ABC classification 
was used for optimizing the inventory level of the industry. Forecasting error time series method based on actual 
demand was used for predicting the future demand for reducing the current inventory level. From the results it was 
observed that, the percentage of forecasting error in actual demand and future prediction was reduced to 15.6%.

Introduction 
Inventory tool is used to direct and control the order, storage and machines usage of manufacturing 
industries since the majority of industries are applying the policy of minimizing their investment in fixed 
assets; which still highlights the proposition of minimizing the inventory 
level. 
Demand 
and 
sales 
forecasting are the most significant functions of manufacturers, distributors and business organizations. 
Keeping demand and supply in balance, the manufacturers reduces excess and shortage of inventories to 
improve their profitability. When the manufacturer’s aim is to fulfill the overestimated demand, excess production 
results in extra stock - keeping which ties up excess inventory. On the other hand, underestimated demand causes 
unfulfilled orders, lost sales, foregone opportunities and minimizes service levels which lead to inefficient 
supply chain. Thus, the accurate demand forecast is a real challenge for participant in supply chain. The 
ability to forecast the future based on past data is a key tool to support individual and organizational decision 
making. In particular, the goal of Time Series

Abstract 
This paper proposed a scalable approach for solving vehicle routing problems by breaking down a large scale problem 
to small sub-problems where the reinforcement learning model is employed recursively. The approach is inspired by 
large scale vehicle routing problem in a city with some pre-defined district clusters (E.g. Hong Kong). The result 
within every sub-problems is obtained using a sequence to sequence deep learning network trained by policy gradient. 
Despite the time required for training, the model outperforms traditional heuristics models with a comparable amount 
of time.  
Bello et al. (2016) have proposed a framework for solving neural combinatorial problems with reinforcement learning. 
A pointer network (Vinyals et al., 2015) has been employed to process sequential inputs. Nazar et al. (2018) have 
replaced the pointer network with an LSTM recurrent neural network that accepts both static and dynamic inputs. Our 
proposed model broke down the vehicle routing problem to a city level problem (VRP for a group of districts) and 
many district level problems (VRP for groups of nodes) given the districts labels. Each problem is solved using the 
reinforcement learning model given its generic properties proven in previous studies. 
The model receives an input  array  𝑋= {𝑥%, 𝑖= 1, … . , 𝑀}. Each input 𝑥% = {𝑙∶𝑑, 𝑛} composes of the concatenation 
of a 2D array, the location for each node and the demand in the specific location, as well as the corresponding district 
𝑛. The location of nodes are represented as latitudes and longitudes which will be mapped to cartesian coordinates. 
The result will be passed to the encoder of the network. An attention mechanism is employed for constraining the 
amount of computation in the model. 
Parameters of the network are updated using the REINFORCE algorithm in which the baseline in the equation is 
estimated by a critic network which learns the approximated time required for tours travelling. The network will be 
trained and updated concurrently with the sequence to sequence (actor) network. The rewards generated by the 
environment equal to the negative amount of tour travelling time. The model objective is approaching the optimal 
policy 𝜋∗ that assign high possibility to the tour that require less amount of time. The stochastic policy generated by 
the network are calculated as follow :  
𝑝(𝜋| 𝑠) = 9  𝑝(𝜋(𝑗) | 𝜋(< 𝑗), 𝑠)
<
=>?
 
where 𝑠 represents the previous state of the network. 
The centroid of the districts will be calculated and pass to the city level model. In every step of the city level model, 
a district level model with independent parameters is executed. The result of the district level model will be passed 
back to the city level model and the city level model will proceed to the next step by policy sampling. 
The preliminary results indicated that the model outperforms traditional heuristic algorithms such as Clarke-Wright 
Savings Heuristic and Sweep Heuristic. The significance of the study is that it provides an approach for solving 
large scale vehicle routing problem which is highly computational expensive with traditional algorithms.

Abstract  
In the present competitive world most of the manufacturing industries are skirmishing by providing their best 
productivity. In this research article an attempt was made to analyse and implement the total productive maintenance 
system in a yarn manufacturing industry. At present the textile yarn manufacturing industry is incapable of 
supplying the product to the customer at the right time in turn to satisfy the customer to increase the productivity. 
This problem is occurring due to the high lead times in the regular manufacturing process. More over the frequent 
breakdown of machines leads to consume more cycle times for the existing process. Hence, by proper analysis and 
implementation of total productive maintenance system the overall efficiency of the industry may be increased and 
the said problems may be minimized. From the results, after implementation of total productive maintenance it was 
found that the overall equipment effectiveness has been increased between 5 to 8% for the various components. 
Similarly, the availability of the machines has also been increased up to 90%.

1. Introduction 
 
In the current production scenario, most of the manufacturing companies are facing the recurring problems like 
breakdown of machines, frequent repair and quality defects. In this research, a case study has been conducted in a 
textile yarn manufacturing industry. Due to regular machine breakdowns, the industry currently encounters low 
availability and performance efficiency of the machines. Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) is extensively used 
as a key performance indicator to measure the availability of machines. Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) 
eliminates breakdowns and promotes Autonomous Maintenance (AM) by operators through day to day activities 
involving total workforce thereby, maximizing the availability of a machine. The goal of any TPM program is to 
improve the overall productivity and quality along with increased employee morale and job satisfaction. Earlier, 
preventive maintenance was considered as a non-value added process, but currently it is an essential requirement for 
longer life cycle of machines in an industry to minimize the overall lead time and cycle time of the process.

Abstract 
One of the major challenges facing many Engineering companies today is a lack of sufficient resources to 
staff all projects concurrently. The objective is to understand the challenges that Engineering projects 
experience due to a lack of resources. All projects require human resources because they play an important 
role in any project. These resources may contribute to either a projects success or failure. That is why having 
the correct people for the project is extremely important. The most common and widely experienced 
challenge on a project is insufficient team skills. Organisations should consider leadership’s skills, human 
management and skills management to ensure a projects success. Engineers are required to have technical 
knowledge and skills, understand standards of engineering practice and have intellectual skills. The findings 
revealed that a projects success is achievable by complying with the planned budget, time lines and 
performance criteria

1. Introduction
One of the greatest challenges today, is the delivery of basic services to meet an expanding population. 
Innovation in Engineering is fundamental to address these challenges. A major issue facing many 
Engineering companies is the lack of sufficient resources to staff all projects concurrently. Therefore, 
projects compete with each other for resources and people are often assigned to several projects at the same 
time. Engineers with special expertise of scarce skills may be in high demand due to constraints. In South 
Africa, a shortage of key skills is affecting business growth and this requires government intervention. 
Research conducted in 2016, Green revealed that Engineering was on the list of the top three of the ten most 
prolific job titles being recruited.  
According to Marks, organisations rely on projects to ensure their business needs. Therefore, projects rely on 
the effective employment of finite resources, whether these are people, equipment or facilities, anything 
required to complete a project activity or task and has a financial implication. According to Ford and Bennet 
the most common and widely experienced challenge is insufficient team skills. Therefore, organisations 
experience the challenge to ensuring that they make the most of these available finite resources. According to 
Dubber, changes in management, either resignation or transfer, has a negative effect on a projects 
performance. The root cause of limited resources identified with South Africa is a brain drain [Hopply] and 
this leaves the country short of the skills needed to meet the challenges of economic development [Benidict]. 
Many Engineering companies find it difficult to fill Engineering posts because Engineers with 10 to15 years 
of experience are required [Rambaran], while on the other side, many newly graduated Engineers are 
struggling to find employment. With Local Government and Municipalities in South Africa facing an 
unhealthy position, one finds few or in some instances no civil engineering professional in their employ.  
In South Africa, one Engineer services 3 166 people of the population, compared to Brazil’s 227 and 
Malaysia’s 543 per engineer [Rambaran]. The discrepancy in the benchmark highlights that South Africa has 
a dire shortage of competently qualified Engineers. All projects require human resources, because people are

3. Conclusion 
Based on the findings of the survey, the lack of skills and brain drain were the two main reasons for the lack 
of resources in Engineering projects. The lack of skills is predominantly due to professional leaving the 
industry and in some instances leaving the country. Political instability leads to economic recession causing 
limited implementation of infrastructure requirements by Government. With the lack of implementing 
infrastructure, Engineering jobs are scarce and thereby resulting in lower salaries. Therefore, Engineers often 
take their skills abroad where there is a demand for the Engineering profession.  
Suitable and correct resources are required for any project to succeed. Unrealistic deadlines and poor 
planning of resources puts additional pressure on resources, resulting in a failed task or project. A lack of 
skilled resources is also a challenge because the incorrectly skilled resource tasked on the project may not 
meet the deadline or the client’s requirements. Another challenge with resourcing is shifting resources 
around, either to assist others or carry out damage control. In Engineering, a balance is required between 
experience and expertise. The environment of a project is always dynamic, so success factors might change 
over time. 
To ensure the success of a project, compliance with the planned budget, time frame and performance criteria 
is required. A project is to have competent team members. The project goals and the team roles and 
responsibility are to the clearly defined.

Abstract 
Every industrial revolution causes changes in technological, socioeconomic and cultural features. Among the 
technological features belongs also maintenance management. The approach towards equipment maintenance has 
changed throughout the revolutions from reactive towards predictive. Instead of fixing breakdowns, companies try to 
predict them and minimalize the risks and costs associated with it.  
The main objective of this article is to put the changes in maintenance management strategies in the context of 
industrial revolutions. Throughout a literature review, the article summarizes the characteristics of each industrial 
revolution and maintenance management approach together with paradigm shifts that accompanied them. Namely the 
relation of the first industrial revolution with breakdown maintenance, the second industrial revolution with preventive 
maintenance, the third industrial revolution with preventive maintenance and finally the fourth industrial revolution 
with predictive maintenance.

1. Introduction to maintenance
Production machines, equipment and devices will always be liable to wear and the requirement for maintenance. 
Alongside the advancement of industry goes the improvement of maintenance. As far back as the mankind began 
making devices that fulfilled their requirements there was the requirement for maintenance. Records of maintenance 
can be found already in the ancient Egypt. An old Egyptian document, dated 600 b.c. mentions a stoppage of supply 
of cedar wood required for the maintenance of sacred boat of Amun Ra. (Brugsch-Bey, H. 1881)  
The approach towards maintenance has changed throughout the years. It has been transformed from reactive 
(corrective) actions to ongoing predictive activities with an aim to optimize the time, costs and quality. While 
nowadays it could be foreseen as a competitive advantage or area, whose improvement may increase profit and 
bring many benefits, some still consider maintenance as the “necessary evil”. In this paper, we identified four key 
maintenance concepts that correspond to the industrial revolutions.  
Nowadays the maintenance management aims to decrease both the unscheduled downtime and scheduled downtime, 
which both reduce the available time, in combination with optimization of safety, environmental risks and costs. 
Available time, production quality and performance are the basic key performance indicators (KPI), which 
combined give the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) (Legát et al. 2007). 
Literature gives many definitions of maintenance. Swedish standard SS-EN 13306 characterize it as a “Combination 
of all technical, administrative and managerial actions during the life cycle of an item intended to retain it in, or restore 
it to, a state in which it can perform the required function” (API STD 689 2007 ).  
Maintenance management covers all actions including inspection, adjustments, cleaning, lubrication, testing, and 
replacement of expendable parts, as necessary to maintain the serviceability of the equipment (API RP 8B 2012).

Abstract 
Nowadays, a large percentage of power electronic based home appliances are connected in distribution system. It has 
become necessary to analyze the behavior of these loads. The steady state, transient and harmonic behavior of home 
appliances have been analyzed in this paper. In addition, current signature technique has been used to measure the 
current transient response of home appliances. The current signature technique is already found applications in 
identification of motor faults. The information achieved from current signatures is beneficial to power utilities, 
consumers and appliance manufacturers. The power factor of various home appliances was also measured and results 
are presented in this paper.

1. Introduction
The distribution system carries electrical power from transmission system and delivers it to various types of 
consumers. Various linear and non-linear based appliances are installed throughout the low-voltage distribution 
network. The non-linear appliances  are basically power electronic converter based loads. Non-linear loads such as 
switch mode supplies, Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units, compact flourecent lamps (CFLs), fluorescent 
lamps, adjustable speed motor drives, CRT and LCD television sets, DVD players, desktop computers, laptops, fax 
machines and  battery chargers etc are connected with distribution system. During last couple of years, the use of 
nonlinear loads have increased tremendously. Various studies have been conducted to investigate the different aspects 
of home appliances.  Approaches like harmonic analysis (Asres et al. 2019), (Bakar 2008), (Djordjevic et al. 2018), 
(Ghorbani et al. 2011), (Huang et al. 2011), (Mahar et al. 2011), (Nikum et al. 2016), (Patidar and Singh 2009), (Panda 
et al. 2019), (Sun et al. 2011) current signatures during steady state (Bakar 2008), (Lee et al. 2004), (Hart 1992), 
(Sultanem 1991) Active/Reactive power signatures (Laughman et al. 2003), (Wilsun and Dong 2012) etc were used 
to analyze the characteristics of home appliances. In some studies, waveforms of full wave rectifiers were used to 
analyze the startup characteristics of domestic loads (Ting et al. 2005). The term “signature” of an appliance means 
the changes of voltage and current on the electrical circuit when the appliance is turned on, off or changes its states 
(Lia et al. 2012).  
In this paper, current signatures during transient state of several home appliances are presented.  The harmonic 
spectrum and power factor of these loads are also included in this paper. The research paper organized as follows: 
Section 2 describes the methodology and experimental setup. Section 3 presents the experimental results of several 
home appliances. Section 4 describes the comparisons of results and final section 5 includes conclusion.

5. Conclusion  
In this work, current signatures, current & voltage waveforms, power factor and harmonic spectrum of several home 
appliances are presented. It is concluded from the transient results that the current signatures are distinctive for 
different appliances. It is also clear from the results that motor driven home based appliances loads draw a large 
maximum current during turn on but it gradually comes to normal within few cycles. The non-linear loads like desktop 
PC and CRT TV set also draw high inrush current during startup. The information achieved from current signatures 
of home appliances is much prudent to the power companies, supply consumers and appliance manufacturers. 
Moreover, this information is quite beneficial for the selection of home protective devices. These devices can be fuses, 
circuit breakers, earth leakage circuit breakers, magnetic contactors, relays etc.  In this research work, the harmonics 
spectrum of various nonlinear loads were analyzed. The harmonic order and power factor of various loads are also 
compared. It is clear from the experimental results that the loads like laptop have low power factors and highest THD 
magnitude as compared to other loads. The loads such as CRT TV, desktop computer and energy saver have highest 
value of 3rd harmonics.

Abstract 
The increasing trends in technological advancements have opened up a new horizon of opportunities for 
organizations. With the penetration of mobile technologies, the aspirant organizations have found a 
new medium to engage their stakeholders. Brick and mortar retailers often seem to invest high 
costs on technology and infrastructure, but the need of time emphasises to change the behavior of 
decision making. Various technology adoption models (TAM) have been deployed in past which 
help to adopt new technologies to sync with current systems. A new format called ‘brick and click’ 
retailers has flipped the traditional format of retail models and has opened up new possibilities for 
upcoming technologies.  Though, past researchers have identified technological compliance for ‘brick and 
mortar’ retailers but there is still not evident literature which connects the technological need for brick 
and click retailers. Also, there is no model available which could show that how segmented technological 
models can be used for different format of e-tailers. 
This study helps in identifying the upcoming Internet of Things (IoT) technology suitable for 
different formats of retailers, i.e., e-hypermarkets, e-specialty stores, and e-convenient stores. The 
model analyses assertive compatibility of IoT and Intranet of Things with the existing retail formats.  
The study proposes theoretical model which helps to evaluate and adopt upcoming technologies 
(IoT, Intranet of Things, RFID, etc.), and comments on the adoption strategies for different e-tailers. 
For this study we have considered various e-tailer formats operating in asian region specifically India, and 
empirical investigation is performed. The study proves significant at global level as the structure of 
e-tailers are seminal throughout the world.

Abstract  
 
This paper develops a single-vendor single-retailer supply chain for multi-product. The proposed model is based on 
Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) approach and vendor uses the retailer's data for better decision making. Number 
of orders and available capital are the constraints of the model. In this system, shortages are backordered; therefore, 
the vendor’s warehouse capacity is another limitation of the problem. After the model formulation, an Integer 
Nonlinear Programming problem will be provided; hence, a metaheuristic algorithm called Imperialist Competitive 
Algorithm has been used to solve the model. Consequently, order quantities, number of shipments received by a 
retailer and maximum backorder levels for products have been determined with regard to cost consideration. Then, a 
numerical example is presented to describe the sufficiency of the proposed strategy. Furthermore, the model is also 
solved using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and compared with the Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA).

 1. Introduction 
 
Supply Chain Management (SCM) concerns the integrated and process-oriented approach to the design, 
management, and control of the SC, with the aim of producing value for the end customer, by both improving 
customer service and lowering cost. Each stage in the supply chain need to perform many activities and must 
interact with all other stages in supply chain. The primary purpose of a supply chain is to satisfy the needs of the 
customer as well as generating profits. Nowadays, inventory management plays an important role in reducing total 
costs of supply chains (SC). Supply chain management (SCM) techniques with the aim of coordinating all parts of 
SC from supplying raw materials to delivering and/or resumption of products, tries to minimize total costs with 
respect to existing conflicts among the chain partners. An example of these conflicts is the interrelation between the 
sale department desiring to have higher inventory levels to fulfill demands and the warehouse for which lower 
inventories are desired to reduce holding costs. Due to the uncertainty involved in demand, unbalancing (shortage or 
surplus) has always been one of the main problems in demand predictions, especially at lower echelons of SC, 
namely retailer and supplier. As a result, several approaches or policies were proposed in the literature to manage 
and control inventory levels in retailer-supplier partnerships. The most well-known policies are: Continuous 
replenishment policy, Periodic Replenishment Policy, Quick Response Policy, Vendor Managed Inventory Policy. 
Among them, VMI, sometimes called vendor-managed replenishment (VMR), is the most popular approach based

So, we can conclude that the cost function is best optimized in ICA compared to PSO. The increased iteration and 
increased population size give the best result. ICA is better than PSO with respect to total cost. Convergence

7. Conclusion and recommendation for future work 
In this paper, an inventory model was developed under conditions multi-product and multi constraint for the vendor 
managed inventory (VMI) system in a two-echelon supply chain. Moreover, it was assumed that shortages are 
backordered, so the vendor’s warehouse capacity was limited by an upper bound for available inventory or 
maximum inventory. Since in inventory models, constraints like number of orders, available capital, and average 
inventory have an important role, these constraints were added to the model, too. The obtained model was an Integer 
Nonlinear Programming (INLP) problem; thus, the Imperialist Competitive algorithm (ICA) was proposed to solve 
it. Furthermore, Particle swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was also used to compare the results. Finally, a 
numerical example was presented to describe the sufficiency of the proposed strategy.  
  
 Supply chain is a very complicated system. It includes many parameters and involvement of many people to run 
effectively (Krajewski and Ritzman, 2002). The vendor managed inventory model used here presents a 
simplification considering as one retailor has many products, many distributors and a number of retailers and 
suppliers. The real-life scenario is much more complex. Since the product considered here is supplied all over the 
country to a thousand of retailers, it is not possible to collect the data for the research in such extensive level with 
limitations like sources of information and cooperation. The more the members are included in the model, the more 
the realistic policy would be found with the help of genetic algorithm. Thus, by including more and more members 
and information of the supply chain, this limitation can be mitigated 
 
For future work extensions, the followings are recommended for other researchers:  
1.The lead-time effects can be considered.  
2.Alternative meta-heuristic search algorithms such as Tabu search (TS) or simulated annealing (SA) can be used.  
3.Other situations like variable costs and discounts can be considered.  
4.Non-deterministic parameters such as fuzzy or stochastic demand can be considered.  
Other cases of VMI system like the single-vendor multi-retailer, multi-vendor single-retailer and multi-vendor 
multi-retailer systems can be modeled.

The Triple-Helix sub-revolution and the hype of Industry 4.0

Abstract 
Society and operations managers are confronted with the hype of the FIR (fourth industrial revolution) in many 
ways. The magnitude of the next industrial revolution is a huge reality but it also needs to be seen for what it really 
is in terms of its progress, sub-revolutions, social dangers and unique cyber-physical systems (algorithms). The 
smart telematics, machine-to-machine (M2M) technology and connected devices through computer-based systems 
are not all new or disruptive. The notion that disruption is by default an inherent FIR value may be questioned 
especially when personal transformation is demanded or thriving in a time of endless innovation. An agile business 
in the digital age is not the only option for innovation improvement or for commendable transformation journeys. 
The FIR identity therefore needs to be clarified by means of an accepted model. An qualitative exploratory research 
approach was used to look deeper into the FIR movement and to address the research problem by providing 
perspectives about the hype, identifying Triple-Helix (TH) as a significant sub-revolution of the FIR and to make 
suggestions for further research to clarify its identity.

Introduction 
The global economy is producing new type of leaders for exponential organisations. Bigger and better becomes a 
new norm with universities becoming businesses partnering with industry and government in terms of Triple-Helix 
(TH) configurations. These organisations perform in terms of the triple bottom line (3BL) known as `people, planet 
and profit`. Part of this movement is to upscale agility with leaders who think differently and leading others to a 
transformation journey. These leaders disrupt themselves first to model the way how to create agile businesses for 
the digital age. They need to master personal transformation to thrive in this age of endless innovation. Getting agile 
by deploying a wave of agile teams seems to be a sub-revolution on its own (not discussed in this paper) and an 
underlying force currently at work.  
Previous revolutions (with technologies associated with electric power) and the recent digital technology remain 
fundamental for more revolutions to come. In the early seventies Braverman (1974) introduced the concept of a 
scientific-technical revolution that cannot be understood in terms of specific innovations. The FIR (fourth industrial 
revolution) is also inadequately characterized by a handful of key inventions that need to be understood holistically 
(in its totality) as a mode of production into which science and exhaustive engineering investigations have been 
integrated as part of ordinary functioning. This new big thing - the FIR movement – has many underlying social and 
behavioral dimensions and is not to be found in electronics, automatic machinery, aeronautics, chemistry or atomic 
physics but rather in the transformation of science itself into capital. 
The magnitude of the modern economy and changes taking place cannot be ignored because we see social sub-
revolutions (eg. social ergonomics) underlying the “smart factories” with machine-to-machine communication. We 
see how production organises itself by means of unique cyber-physical systems. We see a new kind of knowledge 
society and the changing ethos of universities to do business in a time of super-complexity. Entrepreneurial 
universities find new kinds of knowledge management becoming a natural phenomenon of our time regardless of

consist of institutional partners for the sake of innovation. Dondofema and Grobbelaar (2018) used case study 
research to analyse innovation platforms in South African healthcare sector. The authors provided an innovation 
ecosystem perspective and a value chain perspective on innovation platforms. Their study included concrete 
observations, predictions and the evolution of theoretical frameworks. There are many international examples of 
ecosystems designed for innovation not for (or because of) the FIR.  
 
Visits to top entrepreneurial and innovative universities provided multiple observational and informational artefacts 
of industrial engineering, technological developments, triple-helix (TH) and the upscaling of agility as sub-
revolutions of the next industrial revolution. The perspectives obtained share intuitions that technical artifacts are 
objects that exist by human intervention and technical artifacts (contrasted to natural entities). Perspectives obtained 
indicates that the FIR is not the cause of changing the rules of business through digital disruption for a hyper-
connected world but rather the result of multiple sub-revolutions (movements) of normal culture shifts and sound 
strategic management. The following section briefly describes ten examples of institutional artefacts of TH 
strategically positioned within a specific eco-system for innovation observed during research visits:  
 
• 
Maastricht University Brightlands ecosystem - their `core` philosophy stands for collaborative open 
research education. They create TH hotspots on the Brightlands campuses. This is a continuation of the

Park and business centres in the Leuven region. 
• 
Kennispark Twente - this innovation campus is in the midst of high-tech SME’s. The innovative ecosystem 
has innovation centres such as for advanced materials, road safety, thermoplastic composites, micro and 
nano technology, medical imaging and technologies for recycling, wireless sensors, cloud computing and 
re-using textile. Apollo Global R&D centre in Enschede, Cottonwood Technology Fund and Foseco R&D 
center are located in this region due to the vibrant eco-system. Medimate Twente is another production 
location for healthcare solutions and nano-products

Conclusions   
 
The paper indicates a weak FIR identity that may be improved (clarified in a model) by acknowledging the 
unnecessary hype and other sub-revolutions. The FIR is not the cause of changing the rules of business through

digital disruption for a hyper-connected world but rather the result of multiple sub-revolutions (movements) of 
normal culture shifts. A sceptical perspective was discussed and it also highlighted some potential dangers of the 
FIR (and its hype). The paper identified and discussed other dimensions of the FIR and especially highlighted the 
massive sub-revolution of TH and its eco systems. Other sub-revolutions (eg. agility and social ergonomics) are 
identified for further research.  
 
In terms of further research, a Quadruple-Helix model could be developed for the FIR. The quadruple helix model 
adds a fourth component to the framework of interactions between university, industry and government, namely 
civil society and the media. It was first suggested by Carayannis and Campbell (2009) as the `Quadruple-Helix’ 
model towards a 21st century fractal innovation ecosystem`. The aim is to bridge the gaps between innovation and 
civil society (the social sciences). Indeed, this framework claims that under the TH model, the emerging 
technologies do not always match the demands and needs of society, thus limiting their potential impact. This 
framework emphasizes a societal responsibility of universities, in addition to their role of educating and conduction 
research. This is the approach that the European Union has intended to take for the development of a competitive 
knowledge-based society. In terms of this paper (and the sub-revolutions mentioned) a quadriple helix model of the 
FIR can be considered.  
 
Civil society, CSR (corporate social responsibility) and social ergonomics are only a few terms associated with a 
new social revolution. Since we can’t digitize human talent, dreams, humour, creativity, morality, ethics, life, 
experience and so forth, successful organisations will be those that are able to fuse the digital world with the social 
sciences. Social ergonomics may fit the model because the increased respect for human well-being makes 
ergonomics a social-technical science. The overwhelming focus on aesthetics of things at the cost of the well–being 
and quality of work–life (QWL) of people has led to this concept (social ergonomics) utilising a combination of 
engineering, design, and social science to assist companies to change how people interact with technology 
(MacLeod, 2008). This is especially powerful when individuals are educated to improve their own ergonomics in 
terms of their own work environment to work smarter, safer and healthier. This sub-revolution focuses on personal 
empowerment, job enrichment, community ergonomics, new work paradigms, participatory design and virtual 
organisations. The social ergonomics philosophy promotes the best technology that fits people by challenging the 
status quo (www.socialergonomics.com). 
 
The spiritual leaders of today will advocate the human element and to improve organisations will have more open 
conversations, understand end users, be exceptional in the eyes of the internal and external customers, consider new 
kinds of skills to be future-fit, learn to listen to alternate voices and nurture human talent.

Abstract 
In modern industry, metal pipelines are an important means of transporting energy. However, the pipe can 
corrode with time elapsed. Corrosion is one of the major causes of failure in gas pipelines. The purpose of 
this paper is to present a probabilistic approach to predicting the residual life of gas pipeline with 
corrosion defects. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, instead of deterministic one, a 
stochastic model is adopted to deal with the variability in corrosion growth rates. Second, the failure 
probability of the pipeline is obtained by using PCORRC, one of widely used codes to calculate the pipe 
failure pressure. Third, the remaining pipeline life is predicted by using ISO 16708, a global standard of 
limit state method on pipeline reliability. The feature of the presented method is that it accommodates the 
probabilistic behavior of corrosion growth and deals with the uncertainty of various pipe parameters. This 
makes it possible to obtain more realistic prediction results. An illustrative example is given by using an 
inline inspection data. Finally, based upon the residual life prediction, a future framework is provided for 
the pipeline prognostics management required in the era of Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Abstract 
Lean Manufacturing has become one of the pillars of modern industry. For that, many manufacturing companies are 
implementing this Japanese approach; whose main objective is to minimize their costs and maximize their profits. 
Among these manufacturing companies, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which have the same objectives. 
However, many companies apply Lean Manufacturing, without prior studies, which lead in most cases to several 
problems. 
It is in this context, the aim of our paper is to study the critical success factors (CSFs) during the implementation of 
Lean Manufacturing in enterprises, especially in SMEs. Therefore the chance of successful Lean implementation is 
improved and evaluated before its implementation. 
Keywords 
Implementation, Critical Success Factors (CSFs), SMEs, Lean Manufacturing. 
1. Introduction
These last years, the challenge of global competition became more important. It prompted manufacturing companies 
to pay more attention to several aspects such as: quality, cost, delay and flexibility. The manufacturing companies 
reach then to improve the quality of their products and their productivity, to reduce costs and cycle times, to be more 
flexible, as well as to respect the deadline for deliveries. Hence, the adoption new manufacturing approaches such as 
Lean Manufacturing became essential. 
Lean Manufacturing is considered as a philosophy and a set of tools and practices for continuous improvement of 
operations (Liker 2004). However, the implementation of the Lean approach is a strategic activity within an 
organization, these activities incorporate both basic and support activities such as: business infrastructure, human 
resource management and technology development (Antony et al. 2005). It can create a balance between quality and 
finance by developing the most efficient and effective method to provide more value for customers (Zidel 2006).  
Despite the significant benefits of implementing lean manufacturing, not all enterprises attempt these benefits, due to 
the failure of it implementation. In fact, introducing Lean philosophy into an organization is quite complex and 
difficult and many factors need to be considered when implementing Lean Manufacturing.   
Although the Lean approach is becoming a popular approach for improving productivity, Small and Medium sized 
Enterprises (SMEs) are still unsure of the cost of implementing it and the tangible and intangible benefits they can 
achieve (Achanga et al. 2006). Most of these companies are concerned that the implementation of Lean manufacturing 
is expensive and time consuming (Achanga et al. 2006). 
Despite that SMEs are the corner stones in the industrial structure, with an important part of a country’s economy 
(Johansson, 2002), they do not only directly provide a major part of manufactured output but they are the essential 
seeds from which larger businesses grow as well (Johansson 2002).Competent SMEs, as potential suppliers, attract 
larger companies to invest in manufacturing facilities within the country; Furthermore, new small companies function 
as seedbeds from which larger export oriented domestic companies grow and emerge (Johansson 2002). 
However, SMEs faces many difficulties when implementing a Lean philosophy, three dimensions that distinguish 
SMEs from large enterprises can be explored: Resources, Management and Organization (Von Axelson 2007). Given

resistance to change by employee that usually comes from the fact that some positions may be eliminated because 
they are considered as ones of the no add values activities.  
According to Womack et al. (1990) and Cheng et al. (2011), Lean philosophy or culture should be shared by employees 
across the entire organization. So, ample supports and active involvement reaching from top management to individual 
employees are crucial to the success of Lean implementation, as a result, the involvement of employees will be 
converted through teamwork, that is vital to the implementation and sustainability of any improvement initiative 
(Cheng et al. 2011, Sureshchandar et al. 2001) 
Companies need to create regular Lean training opportunities which enable employees to have up-to-date knowledge 
and respond faster to changes in products and processes (Womack et al. 1990), subsequently, it will help them to 
develop autonomy to make quick decisions and undertake business process change. 
6.4.3 Adoption of soft practices and good Lean tools 
A good selection of tools is a crucial step when implementing any philosophy, especially Lean Manufacturing which 
has a multitude of tools, the reason why we must choose the right tools for SMEs. Knowing that, implementing soft 
practices, i.e., small group problem solving, customer involvement and continuous improvement is considered as a 
distinctive characteristic of successful Lean plants, since soft practices are related to principles, managerial concepts, 
people and relations, which are more likely influenced by potential deviations from the ideal organizational culture 
for Lean implementation (Bortolotti et al. 2014) 
Soft practices help create the appropriate environment for implementing hard Lean tools, by educating managers, 
employees, customers and suppliers about the importance of changing the production system according to a Lean 
perspective (Bortolotti et al. 2014) 
6.4.4 Project monitoring and evaluation of performance 
The development of a performance measurement system is essential when implementing any system, since it allows 
you to measure the performance of the system during and after its implementation. The enterprise can identify what 
to improve and how its limited resources can be used for this improvement. 
Performance measurement also has an important communication role to play, by making people aware of what is 
important to the organization’s success and the areas that the organization needs to improve (Gopal 2002). 
Additionally, performance measurement can induce success by encouraging and rewarding the appropriate attitudes 
and behaviors and by making the degree of progress prominent (Gopal 2002). 
The challenge is choosing the right measures for the appropriate level of the organization (Booth 1996). However, the 
real beneﬁts of Lean are difﬁcult to quantify, since that Lean Manufacturing improve several aspects measurable and 
other unmeasurable.The establishment of a performance measurement system during the implementation of a Lean 
Manufacturing project within SMEs is a key to the success of the project since the measurement of the performance 
of the process makes it possible to ensure tracks of research and improvements. 
The measurement system requires the intervention of the management of the company to manage the system and these 
various interventions as well as these resources to ensure use of necessary tools for the performance measurement. 
 
7. Conclusion 
Lean Manufacturing remains a philosophy that is recognized worldwide thanks to the elimination of wastes in 
processes (for example: too much stock of finished products, too much production waste), in order to increase the 
production capacity, while reducing costs and production cycle time. That is why many companies implement it, but 
it is not always a success and can lead to failure if the implementation is not well studied. 
It is in this context, this paper has reviewed the literature of different articles dealing with the implementation of Lean 
Manufacturing in several firms from different sectors (food, industry, aerospace, automobile...) and categories (SMEs, 
Large companies), which allowed us to extract a multitude of critical success factors necessary for the implementation 
of Lean Manufacturing in any organization, which we summarized later in twenty five CSFs. 
Subsequently, we calculated the occurrence of each factor identified in the literature and established a Pareto chart in 
order to obtain the most important CSFs during the implementation of Lean Manufacturing, which were summarized 
in thirteen CSFs. Those factors were then analyzing in the SMEs environment and classifying them according to three 
main categories that distinguish SMEs from Large Enterprises (Organization, Resources, and Management).

Abstract 
Energy subsidies are commonly used by governments for many social and economic objectives.  In some rich 
countries, energy products are supplied to beneficiaries at subsidized prices as a way of wealth-sharing. Despite the 
objectives of energy subsidies, they have critical impacts on the efficiency of energy use. Saudi Arabia, which 
previously heavily subsidized fuel and electricity prices, recently reformed its energy subsidies as an incentive by 
which to increase the efficiency of domestic energy consumption. This paper estimates the impact of the residential 
electricity subsidy reform in Saudi Arabia. The price-gap approach is applied in this paper to estimate the cost of 
electricity subsidies in 2018 if the electricity prices remained unchanged. Additionally, the impact of the price gap 
removal on the elasticity of demand is estimated in order to measure the efficiency of current residential electricity 
consumption. Residential electricity subsidies accounted for 0.8% of Saudi Arabia’s GDP in 2017, which is equivalent 
to 5.382 billion USD. It is estimated that the energy subsidy reform will lower the government residential electricity 
subsidy bill by 52%. In addition, the efficiency of electricity consumption is estimated to increase and, thus, result in 
a 22,031 GWh decline in electricity demand.

1. Introduction
Saudi Arabia is a Middle Eastern country with a relatively low population. It is internationally recognized as the 
world’s top oil exporter. Saudi Arabia is home to an estimated 268.5 billion barrels of oil reserves (MEIM, 2019). 
Prior to January 1, 2018, the government of Saudi Arabia used to heavily subsidize the domestic consumption of 
energy. Energy products were supplied to the residents at lower prices than the international market’s prices (Mehrara, 
2007). Table 1 shows the subsidized prices of some energy products in Saudi Arabia. These subsidies were considered 
an opportunity loss for the country since the domestically consumed oil resources could be sold at full price in the 
international market (Gately et al., 2012). Additionally, many drawbacks are believed to arise from subsidizing energy 
prices, such as over consumption and energy products being smuggled across borders.  
One major avenue of the domestic consumption goes to generating electricity, which counts for 39% of the energy 
consumption in Saudi Arabia (Alowaidh & Alnutifi, 2010). In 2017, more than 45% of the electricity consumption in 
Saudi Arabia was residential (Figure 1) (ECRA, 2019). The low prices of electricity are believed to have negatively 
influenced consumer behavior by encouraging unwise and inefficient electricity use (Alnatheer, 2005).  Thus, the 
government of Saudi Arabia recognized the need to reform the energy subsidy program, especially after oil prices fell 
in 2016, which limited the country’s financial resources since the country’s economy is highly dependent on oil 
exports. In response to this situation, a 5% value-added tax (VAT) was imposed to all local sale of goods, including 
oil products. Additionally, the prices of energy products were increased and brought closer to the international market 
prices starting January 1, 2018 (Table 1). This paper will only estimate the impact of residential electricity subsidies 
reform in Saudi Arabia due to the limitation of data availability of the other sectors.

the lowest two consumption brackets: 1-2000 KWH and 2001-4000 KWH. The electricity prices reform should bring 
a total of 22,031 GWH reduction in residential electricity demand as illustrated in Figure 6.  
 
 
Figure 6: Post-Subsidy Reform Electricity Consumption Reduction Distribution   
 
Next, the price-gap approach was used to estimate the fiscal gain of the electricity prices reform on the residential 
subsidies bill. Before the reform, the residential electricity subsidies bill was 5.382 billion USD (2017), which was 
equivalent to 0.8% of Saudi Arabia’s GDP. Figure 7 shows the impact of the electricity subsidy reform on the 
residential subsidies bill. It is estimated that the subsidy reform will yield a 52% decline in the subsidies bill from 
5.382 billion USD to 2.584 billion USD based on the 2017 data and the fiscal gain of the electricity subsidy reform 
program is estimated to be 2.8 billion USD. 
 
 
Figure 7: Post-Subsidy Reform Residential Electricity Subsidy Bill 
 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
Saudi Arabia has recognized the need to increase its energy consumption efficiency and decrease the economic 
burden of its energy subsidies. To this end, it established an energy subsidy reform program on January 1, 2018. In 
addition to the economic gains that could occur due to a subsidy reform program, the efficient use of energy results in 
environmental benefits as it lowers CO2 emissions released by the generation and use of energy. However, many 
researchers have suggested that monetary interventions related to inefficient energy consumption has a limited long-
term impact on consumption behaviors. Therefore, it has been suggested that non-price interventions, such as 
providing feedback to the consumers about their consumption, can result in a better long-term benefits. Nevertheless, 
the energy subsidy reform in Saudi Arabia has certainly yielded significant fiscal gains by reducing the subsidy bill, 
even if the reform program will have a limited long-term impact on increasing the efficiency of energy consumption.

In this paper, the price-gap approach and price elasticity of demand method were applied in order to study the 
effectiveness of the residential electricity efficiency incentive subsidy reform in Saudi Arabia. The price-gap approach 
is widely used to quantify deviations in commodity prices in a country compared with the world. On the other hand, 
the price elasticity of demand is a popular economic measure used to evaluate the responsiveness of consumer behavior 
toward price changes on the cost of goods and services. The analysis in this paper shows that the recent energy subsidy 
reform is expected to yield a decline in the residential electricity subsidy bill and electricity demand by 2.8 billion 
USD and 22,031 GWh, respectively. For future research, similar studies on other energy sectors are needed in order 
to assess the overall effectiveness of the energy subsidy reform in Saudi Arabia compared with the two new subsidy 
programs created in Saudi Arabia.

Abstract 
Maritime transport is a strategic function with over 80% of global trade by volume. Throughout the last century, 
seaborne world trade volume, has seen a general trend of increases but continues to be largely determined by 
developments in the world economy and trade. In 2018, according to UNCTAD Africa is having 7% of the share of 
maritime trade in export and 5% imports by volume, but only 4% of container trade, despite his economic potential. 
This can be explained by the low quality of the infrastructure of the port, but also of the hinterland. This paper aims 
to explore global hub port criteria in an international context in order fill in the gap on the basic criteria that can make 
a hub port in Africa. In addition, it will investigate the driver of the development of a hub port in Africa, an overview 
of the top three major African hub ports (Tangier Med, Port Said and Durban) is provided. The results and 
interpretations of this finding could have a significant effect on the African stakeholder’s to understand main factors 
inducing to develop global hub port in Africa.

Introduction 
Transport and logistics services assist the progress of the international trade. The quality and efficiency of logistics 
services is imperative for the international trade. Logistics infrastructure and operational processes can be the principal 
advantage of the global trade integration (1). Efficient and cost-effective transportation is strong link of the global 
supply chains and the drive of economic development. UNCTAD valuated that over 80% of a global trade by volume 
and more than 70% of the value of the merchandise are moved by sea and handled by ports (2017). The maritime 
transportation is a strategic function and the most important mode of international transportation. The trade 
competitiveness of all the countries relies on the effective access to international shipping services and ports efficiency. 
According to Albert Zeufack, World Bank chief economist for the African region “growth has rebounded in sub-
Saharan Africa, but not fast enough. And still far from pre-crisis growth levels” With only 1.7 of the economic growth 
in 2016. It accounts for approximately 2.7% of global trade by value. The continent contributes higher shares to global 
seaborne trade – 7% of maritime exports and 5% of maritime imports by volume. While one-third of African countries 
are landlocked, maritime transport remains the main gateway to the global trade and depends heavily on ships and 
ports to service its intercontinental trade. (UNCTAD 2017)

2012. For comparison, existing benchmarks for container dwell time the dwell time in international ports is around 3 
to 4 days. (36-37-38) 
In the other hand, to support the adoption of appropriate technologies and solutions in ports, there is a number of 
measures to take in consideration (including customs automation and port community systems).  The use of 
technologies and digital solutions aim to facilitate transport and trade, cut inefficiencies, improve processes and 
enhancing transparency. In this respect, Africa will have to revise the strategy of seaborne to improve its cargo 
services, the adoption of modern shipping transport technology that enables ships to navigate quicker. (27) 
3.3- Hinterland  
Efficient transportations, inland waterways, rail and road infrastructure, as well as transit regimes are all important 
instruments to improve a hub port (44). Starting from 2010, the adoption of PIDA “Program for development of 
infrastructure in Africa” have kicked off the development of corridors and links Gateways to hinterland. Improving 
access to the hinterland and landlocked countries by multimodal infrastructure, transport corridor approaches and 
harmonizing transport regulation. This can lead to reduce transport costs and improve African countries’ position in 
the global shipping networks. Vessel traffic and ports are essential elements of the Priority action Pan (PAP’s) 
planning of transport corridors linking island states to the mainland and trade routes. The special needs of fragile states 
in terms of regional infrastructure are recognized and will continue to be addressed by PIDA, For example, we can 
find the projects below: 
 
Corridor multimodal Praia-Dakar- Abidjan project : this program will enhance maritime transport and 
links island to  continental countries by creating a new maritime service between regional ports and 
facilitating it through a modern computer system linking the maritime service to the ports and road corridor 
of the Dakar-Abidjan Corridor 
 
West African Port and Rail Platform Program to address future capacity problems in West African ports  
 
 Program for a port platform and rail link in Central Africa. This program aim to address the future 
problem of capacity in Central Africa   
 
3.4- Governance 
The Government has a determinant role in supporting small and medium-sized ports to adapt to the new situation, 
including through policy and facilitative arrangements that can enhance their services in the hinterlands, ant to compete 
the for international trans-shipment hub.  To help smaller ports maintain their position and emerge as a regional hub 
steps should be engaged to identify the strategy permitting to attract mainline or feeder service providers. 
Performing international or regional performance needs private sector participation. However, private sector 
participation requires environment that includes proper design of concessions, through transparent, well-designed 
competitive, long-term (at least 25-year) concessions.(46) The benefits of private sector  are realized when the 
incentives are weighted depending on the market and a high level of operators control. Enhancing port performance 
by encouraging private sector participation seems to be appropriate in Africa. The evolution of port governance 
regimes (except in South Africa) participates to the modernization and equipment of all the ports and assist this 
increase in tonnage. Thus in the West Africa (Dakar, Tema, Lomé, Douala, Pointe Noire, Luanda) and in the East 
(Mombasa and Dar-es-Salam)the containerised traffic strongly increase these last years (26). These evolutions are 
taking place for competitiveness for African hub port. For example, Tangier-Med through ‘its an innovative 
governance mode with the creation of a public limited company “the Tangiers-Mediterranean Special Agency 
(TMSA)”, Responsible of the development and management of the Tangier Med industrial port complex’, is now 
playing an increasingly important role as a West African hub. 70% of its transhipment volumes are destined for 
Atlantic African ports (Nouadhibou (Mauritania) and Namibe (Angola)). Tangier Med benefits from the strategies of 
global operators who have heavily invested in the hub and offer shorter direct lines of the feeder type to African ports. 
The operation of the terminals, and all port activities are carried out under concession contracts by world-renowned 
operators. The Tangier Med port thus counts in its ranks the largest world shipping companies (Maersk, CMA-CGM, 
MSC...) as well as port leaders such as APM TERMINALS and EUROGATE. 
. 
 Conclusions  
 
The growth in global trade over the past decade, together with increasing containerization and an improved policy 
framework in Africa have boosted demand for African port capacity. With 80 percent of the volume of world trade 
carried by maritime vessels, the port is playing an essential role in the logistics supply chain. However, congestion, 
low productivity/efficiency, and low connectivity to other regions blocked the development of port in Africa. 
Furthermore the emergence of hub port. African port need to address challenges in port and terminal infrastructure,

operation efficiency, hinterland and governance. The analysis of this finding suggest to develop a hub port in Africa 
a package of measures is needed , this requires interventions by national regional and international actors, these include 
in particular: 
 
Prepare African ports port facilities to handle ever-larger ships by increasing their draught and ensuring 
appropriate equipment; 
 
Improving access to the hinterland and landlocked countries by multimodal infrastructure, transport corridor 
and harmonizing transport regulation including road and rail transport; 
 
Improve connectivity of maritime or land transport and improve the position of African countries in global 
maritime networks. 
 
Governments can help to fix inefficiencies and unblock capacity in ports through regulation, incentives, 
policy support and investment, to provide the effective operation of border management and customs 
clearance. 
 
Encourage the Public private concession,  through transparent, well-designed ,competitive, long-term 
concession 
 
These measures can lead order to reduce transport costs and develop the efficiency of ports; these new major African 
ports are not necessarily destined to become major continental hubs. They remain away from the large East-West ring 
road that concentrates the large flows and from which the need for transhipment and interlining are gigantic. In on the 
other hand, the ability to serve the hinterlands (consumption basins, isolated areas) will allow the emergence of 
regional hubs. The emergence of such hub ports is important for the regional economic integration of African countries 
and for their integration in the world trading system. 
Key measures in the process to transform ports into regional hubs include encouraging and ﬁnancing integrated port 
and transport facilities. In addition, policies that introduce and enhance competition are necessary to increase 
efﬁciency. In both these areas, global experiences have shown that the transformation of a public services port into a 
private model leads to a successful result.

Abstract 
 
Public sector is often considered to be the most important customer within a country. Using this purchasing power 
governments can promote sustainable development principles in the public tender process through establishing laws 
and government guidelines, innovation and also market demand for sustainable services or products. This paper 
reviews literature about sustainable procurement in the public sector and focuses on the case study of Morocco, to 
identify efforts made to encourage sustainable procurement especially that the new Moroccan decree of Public 
Procurement integrated, amongst others, sustainability and environmental protection concerns, ensuring that economic 
growth goes hand in hand with protection of the environment and social inclusion.

1. Introduction  
 
The current patterns of consumption and production are exerting a big pressure on the environment and its resources, 
and represent a key risk to human health, biosphere and biodiversity (Lorek, 2013). Taking into account climate 
change, environmental deterioration, insistent global poverty and overconsumption, it is obvious that this kind of 
development is incompatible with sustainable development principles.  
Changing the ways societies consume and produce is then fundamental to make growth more sustainable (Takase, 
2005), and requires the participation of diverse stakeholders and perspectives. Local to global efforts are also necessary 
to set up a positive vision of a world in which essential human needs are met while protecting and safeguarding the 
natural systems on which we all depend (Kates, 2005). 
The World Commission on Environment and Development defined in 1987, in the Brundtland report, sustainable 
development as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their own needs. The report was followed by major international meetings including the 1992 
United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) at which the Agenda 21 recommended that 
governments work in partnership with international organizations, business, regional, state, provincial and local 
governments, and non-governmental and citizens’ groups (Thomson, 2007), and the 2002 World Summit on 
Sustainable Development that extended the standard definition with the widely used three pillars of sustainable 
development: economic, social and environmental, created a collective responsibility to advance and strengthen the 
interdependent and mutually reinforcing pillars of sustainable development at local, national, regional and global 
levels and promoted public procurement policies that encourage development and diffusion of environmentally sound 
good and services (WSSD, 2002). 
It is in this context that the second sustainable development strategy ‘A Better Quality of Life’ stipulates that 
embracing sustainable development requires from local government to extended their responsibilities to encompass 
the wellbeing of the local community and to incorporate environmental, social and overall economic costs in the 
procurement decision making process. 
In this paper, we focus on sustainable procurement in the public sector at the global level, then, and as a case study, 
we will identify the efforts made to promote sustainable procurement in Morocco.

7. Conclusion
The public procurement sector in Morocco has made valuable progress to boost its procurement process and enhance 
its public investments’ performance, by ensuring more accountability, transparency and shared prosperity, involving 
a legal reform.     
The new procurement regulatory infrastructure introduced sustainability and environmental protection concerns for 
the first time in Morocco which is important to lending legitimacy and guarantying the follow up of SPP measures. 
Research shows that this step is one of the most important necessary conditions for enabling SPP. GoM should 
complete the other conditions to enable the public sector to truly take charge of sustainable procurement. In particular, 
the recommendations expressed by the dedicated studies and that still wait for an effective application. Every such 
measure might eventually be a topic of a separate and more thorough study.

Abstract 
 
Always changing world scenarios require industries to constantly optimize their processes and 
resources to remain competitive. In this aspect, one has the importance of the production 
engineering to act in front of the decision making. The present work was carried out in practice in 
a hygiene products industry in the south of Brazil, in the company's manufacturing sector. As a 
case study, and using statistical and mathematical tools linked to production planning and control, 
it can be concluded that activities can become more balanced among employees with the 
withdrawal of an employee of the sector, making the efficient production, making it possible to 
reduce costs and reduce time wasted. 
 
 
Keywords  
Line balancing, Simulation, Time study, Planning and production control. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
With the first Industrial Revolution, initiated in the mid-eighteenth century, production systems began to worry about 
the need to expand production, optimizing the processes and resources involved, creating a new conception of work. 
However, it was not until the beginning of the twentieth century that the Scientific Administration, a concept pioneered 
by Frederick W. Taylor, which began to identify working methodologies, was able to establish methodologies to 
improve processes. Taylor (2010), in his work, was concerned with showing that the activities involved in the 
processes can become more efficient over time, provided there is a prescription of the (standard) execution 
methodology for each of these activities. 
For Barnes (1977), there are several procedures that can be used in problems linked to productivity. One of them is 
worth mentioning: chronoanalysis, which seeks to stipulate the standard time of each activity through some 
techniques. 
Thus, essentially in the last decades, the balancing of production lines has become a tool that makes it possible to 
evaluate the system as to its capacity and also to highlight points that can be improved, and it can be used of 
chronoanalysis as a contribution to the balancing. 
In view of the presented context, the objective of this work was to map the current scenario of the cotton manufacturing 
sector of a personal hygiene industry, regarding the occupation of the resources, besides seeing the changes to be 
established and suggest possible scenarios of changes, to do the balancing of workforces. 
This is because the lines that have a balanced balance show a clear and continuous flow of work, because the 
employees carry out the activities at the same pace, obtaining a greater degree of a possible application of the labor 
and equipment. The greatest difficulty in balancing a line, which was denoted in the execution of this work, is in the 
set of tasks that have the same duration. Generally, activities are performed over large time intervals, with considerable 
execution times.

Thus, following the main objective of this work, the best scenario that equates the occupations of the operators is the 
scenario with improvements and without the OperatorLC2, through four collaborators without so many differences 
between them. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
After following the 4 steps of this work, it is noted that there are many aspects to be improved in the system of the 
current scenario. The intermediate products take about half a turn until they leave the manufacturing sector. From the 
established scenarios, it was concluded that the most plausible result regarding the equalization of occupations is with 
the withdrawal of one of the collaborators. In this case, OperatorLC2 would leave the industry and could be allocated 
to some other part of the company. 
Therefore, the activities, as mentioned in the previous subtopics, would be divided among the four operators, in 
addition to following a pattern (flow) between the parts of the sector. 
In addition, activities in this scenario would be less cluttered because of diminishing resources. Another good option, 
as demonstrated, would be to change the layout of the productive sector. This would certainly require further study as 
well as the feasibility of such an investment. Also, the transport times, with the change of layout, would change, and 
therefore, there should be a new study of the times of these activities to obtain concrete results from the simulation. 
Therefore, the changes are plausible and can be executed without harming the current scenario. With this, the LC2 
Operator could be allocated to some other location of the company, giving space for optimization, expansion and 
improvement to the company. 
Therefore, the production system adopted would have four employees, in order to allow expansion to the sector and, 
therefore, to the company. The work allowed to work with several areas of industrial engineering, from process 
mapping, to chronoanalysis and simulation, being an integrated project with impressive results, as demonstrated in 
every development.

Abstract 
Exchange rate fluctuation increases the risk of global supply chain management. In this paper, we study a 
global supply chain of a nonstorable commodity, which involves transactions to be settled at a foreign 
currency between a manufacturer and a supplier. Both parties are risk-averse, and they negotiate a supply 
contract through a Nash bargaining process. To hedge against the exchange rate risk, they can purchase 
forward exchange rates in the financial market. In addition, the manufacturer can also procure the 
commodity from a local supplier.  This avoids the exchange rate risk, but incurs another risk because the 
quantity available from the local supplier is not very certain. We formulate the problem as a Nash bargaining 
game where the two players have mean-variance preferences over their profits. We derive the unique 
equilibrium supply contract under a random exchange rate and a random local supply, from which we can 
characterize the optimal forward exchange rate level and the local procurement level.

1. Introduction
Due to globalization of the economy, many firms are engaged in transactions in foreign countries through 
global supply chains. These include trades of large nonstorable commodities, such as crude oil, natural gas, 
agricultural produces, etc. The prices of these commodities are, however, more volatile than those of other 
products. Indeed, price uncertainty of nonstorable commodities, whether caused by government policy, 
currency rates, climatic disasters, or political/civil instability, is inherent in commodity markets (Kang & 
Mahajan, 2006). For nonstorable commodities, suppliers and buyers usually commit their transactions 
through bilateral contracts so as to avoid the possible price fluctuations in the spot markets (Grey et al., 
2005).  Industrial firms with transactions in such a global supply chain may, therefore, have to hedge the 
exchange rate risks through appropriate operational strategies and/or financial instruments. How should a 
firm ameliorate the exchange rate risk by operational and financial instruments? How should a firm 
determine the optimal supply contract in presence of spot markets and unreliable local suppliers? How

Finally, our model has mainly focused on a one-period two-participant bargaining process. An interesting 
but challenging extension would be to allow two-participant to negotiate through multiple periods. In that 
setting, the multiple period negotiations will impact the player's profit and risk. And a more general 
extension would be to consider multiple sellers and multiple buyers to negotiate through multiple periods.

Abstract 
Principles of conceptual research and a practical case study were used to provide new and creative 
perspectives on mixed methods research (MMR). The argument of the article is the high value of 
integrated MMR. It debates, supports, and illustrates the array of possible creative research designs. The 
authors present a relatively complex MMR case in the Southern African context, utilised by a PhD 
student from the University of South Africa, from which post-graduate students can benefit. The context 
of the case is service quality for private higher education institutions (PHEIs). The article explains how a 
five-step integrated methodological approach was used for the development of a total quality service 
(TQS) framework. The unique design shows, among other aspects, how the five primary steps included 
sub-phases, how the phases built upon each other, and how the unique integrated approach provided two 
sets of narrative data from thematic analysis. The article may assist both established and novice 
researchers by providing additional options for the development of MMR designs.       
Keywords 
mixed methods research (MMR), qualitative findings, quantitative results, integration, total quality service (TQS) 
Introduction 
The freedom to use creative research designs promotes research. Conventional typologies may have been too 
narrow, with only a few objectives in mind, such as explanatory, exploratory, or descriptive research. This article 
argues that, although conventional typologies of research designs are of great benefit to inexperienced researchers, 
creative unconventional designs should be promoted to encourage the freedom to choose and to increase the options 
available. This is in line with the mixed method research (MMR) approach. The article thus supports the philosophy 
of creative integrated research designs to address any research problem. The five-step MMR case presented in the 
article is unique in terms of a few secondary dimensions, and, together with other examples of MMR, could be of 
great value to the majority of Southern African post-graduate students who tend to select single methods. 
The article therefore does not promote one school of thought, or compare research designs, or attempt to create 
airtight distinctions between broad qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The work address possible 
weaknesses of existing methodologies with Southern African students in mind. It promotes research quality and

Multi-item, Multi-location Transshipment Model for Cross 
Filling

Abstract 
 
Distribution centers (DCs) usually receive orders from the customers (mostly retail stores) located in its area; and 
deliver goods in the following day. In order to secure fulfilling all orders every day, the DCs will have to maintain a 
high level of inventory, which will deteriorate the profitability. As an alternative to high level of inventory, cross 
filling is, after closing the daily order receipt, to ship the surplus items to other DCs that lacks the same item during 
the night to improve the order fulfillment rate. The economic justification of such cross filling will depend on the 
trade-off between extra cost of transshipment and saving of shortage cost. In this paper, an LP model is proposed, 
which determines the optimal quantity of items and number of trucks to transship so as to maximize the profit of cross 
filling for a day. Unlike most existing research on this problem where transshipment cost is proportional to the 
transshipped quantity, transshipment cost is considered as proportional to the number of trucks used for the 
transshipment, regardless of the quantity loaded in it, which we believe is more realistic. The proposed LP model also 
allows the ‘simultaneous chain transshipment’, which enables distant locations to supply surplus to the location that 
faces shortage.

1. Introduction 
 
1.1 Background 
 
As information technology develops, physical distribution and delivery of goods to the customers is becoming the 
bottleneck in today’s fast business environment. The supply chain of most manufacturers comprises factories, 
distribution centers (DCs), and retailers. Even on-line commerce employs DCs as an important component of its 
supply chain for efficient storage and order picking to supply goods. Order fulfillment has been one of the critical 
performance measures in most DCs. Shortage of a certain item at a DC will very likely lead to the shortage of the item 
at the customer stores, which will cause potential loss of sales, and jeopardize the satisfactory service for the 
consumers.  
 
In order to avoid shortage, DCs are pushed to hold high level of inventory, which will incur substantial cost. As an 
alternative, cross filling has been studied in academia, and practiced in business for decades. Cross filling is, after 
closing the daily order receipt, to transship the surplus items to other DCs that lacks the same item so as to avoid 
shortage with relatively lower level of inventory. Such a lateral transshipment is also referred to as lateral resupply, 
reallocation of stock, and stock transfer (Paterson et al., 2011). Shortage can be either backordered or result in the loss 
of sales. 
 
Such transshipment of surplus items will obviously incur extra cost such as trucking cost and material handling cost. 
However, depending on the cost parameters, transshipment can be economical, especially where shortage is critical 
such as special type blood supply in the hospitals. Successful implementation of transshipment can reduce inventory 
cost, while maintaining higher level of service for the customers.

Using Excel to solve the proposed linear programming problem, we obtain X232=20, X321=20; and N23 = N32 =2, that is, 
to transship 20 units of item 2 from DC2 to DC3; and 20 units of item 1 from DC3 to DC2 using two trucks. The 
minimized total cost of 1,816.04 is obtained, whereas the total cost without any transshipment is 3,300 so the total 
cost is reduced by 45 percent using the optimal transshipment method that we proposed. The computation time of 
Excel to solve this example is less than 2 seconds.  
 
4. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, we address the transshipment problem for a common configuration comprising single supplier and 
multiple non-identical DCs, each of which supply goods to the customers (retail stores) located in its geographical 
region; and each DC orders to the supplier every day using order-up-to policy. A linear programming model is 
proposed which determines the optimal quantity of items to transship, number of trucks to transship between pairs of 
DCs so as to maximize the profit of cross filling for a day.  
 
Three features that make this paper a unique one are as follows. Firstly, unlike most existing researches on this problem 
where transshipment cost is assumed proportional to the quantity transshipped, in this paper transshipment cost is 
considered proportional to the number of trucks used for the transshipment, regardless of the quantity loaded in it, 
which we believe is more realistic, despite it makes the model more complicated. Secondly, unlike some studies where 
possible links are limited to a certain number, in this paper, possible links between DCs are limited based on the 
distance (or, correspondingly, travel time) between them. That is, the optimal transshipment is constrained by the 
length of time window (T) during which transshipment is carried out. This aspect is practically important, since more 
distant DCs can be considered for transshipment as T increases by, for example, more efficient order picking in DCs. 
Thirdly, volume constraint of items to transship is considered, which has not been addressed in the literature. 
Depending on the size of the items, it is not unusual for the total volume to transship to exceed a volume capacity of 
a small delivery truck. Furthermore, authors are exploiting the vehicle routing problem where both pickup and delivery 
over multiple locations is considered for transshipment, in which case volume constraint becomes a critical one.  
 
Another fruit from the model is that ‘simultaneous chain transshipment’ is formalized, which has not received 
appropriate attention in the literature. This simultaneous chain transshipment of items can be of practical tool for the 
cases where surplus is not available in its vicinity, but surplus from far distant site can reach the needing site by 
simultaneously moving the same quantity in a supply chain.    
 
One may criticize the proposed model in that transshipping multiple truckloads between DCs every day is unrealistic 
in the real world logistics practice. However, under order-up-to replenishment policy and highly variable demand, 
transshipping a relatively large amount can reduce more shortage with substantially lower inventory level. Also, in 
the near future some new transportation tools such as drone may become a common carrier, in which case multiple 
carriers to transship among multiple DCs or locations can be a practical tool for cross filling.   
 
For further research, a solution procedure needs to be developed to find the optimal order-up-to value for our 
transshipment model. One may extend the problem to the case when transshipment cost is negligible, for example, 
where there already exist trucks visiting routinely a sequence of locations. One possible research avenue is to 
implement replenishment policy other than order-up-to policy, such as reorder point policy or periodic order policy, 
which we believe is more practical since most upstream replenishment from factory to DCs are unlikely to occur every 
day. For these cases, one may develop a simulation model in which the proposed optimal daily transshipment repeats 
over a long time so as to evaluate the average performance of the proposed model. Using the simulation model, the 
value range of the parameters that makes this transshipment economical can be identified; and the impact of the 
replenishment policy on the average performance of the transshipment can be better understood. Also the simultaneous 
chain transshipment can be further exploited to identify its characteristics.

Abstract 
The construction industry is one of the largest contributing sectors towards the Gross Domestic Product of countries 
globally, and South Africa is no exception. The construction industry in South Africa is marred with persistent and 
extensive delays. This study investigates the project delay factors in construction projects, particularly the Passenger 
Rail Agency of South Africa and Transnet traction substation projects in the South African railway engineering 
environment. The research also presents the remedial actions and mitigations suitable to be implemented to manage 
project delays in the project engineering environment. The research was conducted through a literature review and a 
questionnaire survey and the research approach was deductive. An online questionnaire survey was employed to 
collect primary data. The literature review revealed eight top project delay-causing factors in traction substation 
projects, forming the basis of the questionnaire; and the questionnaire results correlated with the literature review. 
This paper proposes suitable measures to manage delays in construction projects, improving the quality of work and 
managing cost and schedule overruns.

1. Introduction
In the modern era, the construction industry significantly contributes towards the global economy through employing 
and developing an infrastructure. Project delays are major challenges, hindering the successful completion of 
construction projects (Srdic and Selih 2015). Quality, time and cost are considered the primary requirements to be met 
for a project to be regarded as successful. Of the three, the construction industry perceives time to be a crucial 
parameter to evaluate the success of the project (Ansah and Shahryar 2018). According to Kazaz, Ulubeyli and 
Tuncbilekli (2012), project performance is heavily affected by delays experienced in the project. 
Hussain, Zhu, Ali, and Xu (2017) mentioned that termination of contracts, disputes, extension of time schedules, 
interrupted work, budget overrun and unhappy clients contribute to project delays. Events in the project engineering 
environment suggest that it is becoming custom for several construction projects to attempt to remedy the problem of 
project delays by spending more funds (contingency) to accelerate and fast-track the project. These endeavours aim 
to meet the set milestones, such as adding more resources to the project or working overtime. Nielsen, Özdemir and 
Gündüz (2013) suggest that the norm of relying on contingency has set a negative precedent in the project environment 
to solve project delay challenges. 
Several researchers, including Williams (2016), conducted studies on project success factors. The team selection for 
a project is a crucial factor (Duke 2016) that could either make or break the project; and Williams (2016) stated that 
the iron triangle, comprising time, quality and cost, are the considered factors determining the project’s failure or 
success. 
2. Problem Statement
The construction industry is marred with project delays, both in South Africa and globally (Marks and Ellis 2017). 
Too many construction projects are delayed, due to schedule overruns, resulting in negative cost implications

Elawi, Algahtany and Kashiwagi (2016), Chanmeka, Thomas et al. (2012); Zidane and Andersen (2018), and Parsons 
(2015) (in their respective publications), included the design changes during construction amongst the project delay-
causing factors. The survey results emphasized theory indicated in the literature; over 40% of respondents attested 
that they encountered delays in their daily running of projects; as a result, the progress of the project was often affected. 
The shortage of project resources was also emphasized to cause delays in construction projects (Zidane and Andersen, 
2018; Parsons, 2015). The results show that the majority of respondents sensed that only at certain times the project 
was delayed due to a shortage of project resources. This information suggests that project managers in these projects, 
performed their duties well, allocating project resources; 36% of respondents indicated that they did not often 
experience delays due to resource shortages. 
Rentschler et al. (2017) suggested the implementation of the following mitigation in construction projects to manage 
delays: Timely project planning is encouraged; Run independent construction activities in parallel; Allow for 
contingency; Involve the construction team in engineering processes, such as designs and Organise labourers 
accordingly. The survey participants sensed that it would expedite the construction activities if independent activities 
in construction projects could run parallel or simultaneously; 55% agree, whilst 25% strongly agreed with the proposed 
mitigation. The scores in Table 5 below indicate that the results can be interpreted according to the following ratings: 
Strongly disagree = 1; Disagree = 2; Undecided = 3; Agree = 4 and Strongly agree = 5. The scores below indicate that 
most responses were “Agree” and “Disagree”; the average score is 4.32.

6.1 Conclusion 
Delays affect several construction projects in South Africa and globally. History reveals that project delays were 
always part of construction projects. The difference between the past and the present is the accelerated rate of the 
project delays. Delays in the construction environment are categorized into excusable delays. These delays are caused 
by external interferences, such as weather and politics. They are also classified into the category of non-excusable 
delays. The prescribed processes and procedures were not followed in some phases of the project. Some projects are 
simple; they may be completed in a brief period and without difficulties. Certain projects are complex and are extended 
over long intervals. 
Various authors from the reviewed literature indicated that delays in construction projects have negative implications 
on the economy of several countries globally; the construction industry is one of the largest contributors to the GDP 
of several countries. The questionnaire survey respondents agreed and validated the identified project delay factors as 
indicated in the literature review. The most general project delay-causing factors in traction substation projects were 
identified; suitable mitigations were recommended in this study. Several researchers established that project delays 
are not peculiar in the project engineering environment, but that they are common. Delays vary from project to project; 
it could be hours, days, weeks or even years. That does not necessarily indicate the extent of the financial loss incurred. 
It is possible that the project that was delayed by a few hours, suffered a severe financial setback, additional to a 
project suspended for a year.

6.2 Recommendations 
A general viewpoint for several authors and researchers is that it may not be possible to avoid delays completely. 
Recommendable remedial actions and suitable mitigations are available that could be introduced and implemented in 
construction projects to manage project delays. The feedback from the research questionnaire and the literature review, 
recommends the following measures for project management implementation to manage project delays: 
 
Project managers need to attend technical courses. The technical training could improve the technical 
competency of project managers (especially newly appointed project managers). 
 
Efficient project managers should not micro-manage their project team; they need to let them freely express 
themselves. They need to assess them, based on their productivity. 
 
The good traits of a good project manager indicate proactive planning and timeous identification of potential 
delay risks. 
 
To expedite construction projects, it is advisable to run independent construction activities concurrently. 
 
An efficient project manager needs to manage scope changes or scope creeps, imposed on the project by the 
client. 
The research revealed the following mitigations to be suitable to manage project delays in construction projects, 
particularly traction substation projects: 
 
Proactive planning and timeous identification of potential delay risks. 
 
Running of independent construction activities in parallel. 
 
Involving construction teams in the engineering processes, such as designs. 
 
Understanding of laws, rules and regulations that could hinder the project. 
 
Ensuring availability of project funding, prior to the construction commencement. 
 
Preparing a detailed construction plan and adhering to the set milestones. 
 
Appointing experienced and reputable contractors and consultants. 
 
Refraining from appointing a contractor, based on the lowest bid price only. 
 
Promoting good engineering ethics and accountability.

Abstract 
Increasing levels of competition for customers have challenged organisations to adopt strategies to acquire new 
customers and to retain existing customers. The strategies to acquire new customers, regain lost customers and retain 
existing customers form part of customer relationship management. In the past years, the company in this study has 
lost customers and sales opportunities that also translate into a loss of profit. The current study was undertaken within 
the context of a company that is part of a global organisation providing engineering products and services and 
operating as a sales unit in South Africa. The main objectives of the study were to assess the current application of 
customer relationship management in the case study company; and to identify the challenges thereof with the purpose 
of developing strategies to close the gap. The study employed survey research and questionnaires as the research 
strategy and a data collection method. The results of the study indicate that the case study company paid more attention 
to customer focus, organisational culture and organisational compatibility. Information technology and department 
collaboration were identified as the areas which require improvement for the company to realize the benefit of effective 
customer relationship management and implementation.

Customer Relationship Management, Customer Focus, Knowledge Management 
1. Introduction
An increasing number of service providers have accepted the use of customer relationship management (CRM) 
strategies in order to enhance customer acquisition, loyalty and the customer value over the customer-organisation 
relationship lifecycle (Andotra and Abrol 2016). In an attempt to gain a competitive advantage, organisations have 
gradually employed CRM to undertake the approach of not just selling products to customers but also providing the 
services that support the products (Saarijärvi et al. 2013).  Foster (2013) maintains that there are no agreed success 
factors in the implementation of CRM. The implementation of CRM is highly influenced by the organisational culture, 
the attitude toward customer focus and knowledge management (Saarijärvi et al. 2013). Despite the claim by authors 
in the field of CRM, this research did not identify a study which attempts to identify the challenges affecting the case 
study company in the effort to implement CRM and develop the strategy to support the organisation. 
The case study company is part of a global organisation operating as a sales unit in South Africa providing engineering 
products and services and the company is embarking on initiatives to implement CRM as a competitive advantage 
tool. In the past years, the company has lost customers and sales opportunities which also translate into a loss of 
profits. Garrido-Moreno et al. (2014) suggest that not all companies that have embarked on CRM implementation 
realized the benefits associated with CRM strategies. The failure of CRM implementation originates from a failure to 
incorporate and communicate customer knowledge throughout the organisation (Akgün et al. 2014).

6.6 Strategies to improve IT use for CRM purposes 
To improve IT use for CRM purposes, updates to employees in the form of an email should be sent with links showing 
them how to navigate the various pages within the intranet platforms. 
6.7 Strategies to improve the CRM organisational culture 
To improve CRM organisational culture, awareness needs to be created for non-customer services staff regarding 
customer service activities through customer focused training. 
6.8 Strategies to improve organisational compatibility towards CRM 
The improvement of organisational compatibility towards CRM requires a strategy to have wide organisational input 
regarding the aspects of the organisation that would need to be modified to be compatible with CRM.  
7. Conclusions 
After the data collection and analysis was performed, it could be concluded that not all of the factors could be retained 
as they were with the items used for their measurement. The scales for the factors of organisational compatibility for 
CRM and organisational culture were indicated to lack reliability and validity. The scale for customer focus could be 
used with caution as it shows a degree of reliability and validity to some extent. The CRM success factors that were 
adequately identified in the current study were that of knowledge management, organisational commitment, IT use 
for CRM, management support and department collaboration.   
 
It was established through an analysis of the items means for the various success factors that customer focus was the 
factor that was mostly practiced in the case study company. This shows that the company does focus its business 
around customer needs. An organisation that conducts business in a manner that best provides value to its customers 
is recognized to be market oriented. This indicates that there is an awareness within the case study company of the 
importance of knowing what the market demands. 
 
Organisational commitment towards CRM was indicated to have the highest items mean out of the five factors with a 
satisfactory Cronbach’s alpha for reliability, indicating an item mean of 3.583. This was followed by management 
support with an item mean of 3.542. This corresponds to what is highlighted by Garrido-Moreno et al., (2014) that 
management support is a vital aspect of CRM which is closely linked to the organisational commitment towards CRM.  
 
Management with an attitude oriented towards accumulation and sharing of knowledge enables the knowledge 
management process (Hasanian et al., 2015). Consequently, having a relatively high indication that management 
support is present for CRM within the case study company makes it conducive for the company to enable knowledge 
management practices. 
 
There is an indication that the case study company has made efforts to be customer focused, internally, however, 
efforts to enhance collaboration between departments have been comparatively neglected. Improving such 
collaboration between departments could be enabled by knowledge management practices which, amongst other 
things, encourages collaborative learning between departments. Having such a low collaboration between departments 
would hinder the company from effectively gathering market intelligence, as collaboration between departments was 
considered critical for adopting a market-oriented approach. It was recommended that the case study company should 
involve all the departments in the implementation of CRM. The future research should identify the impact of industry 
4.0 in the implementation of CRM.

Abstract 
This paper presents a design of solving Taxi-Delay during peak hours utilizing techniques from graph theory. The Minimum 
Spanning Tree algorithm (denote MST) is efficient for searching optimal transport routes between locations. The intuition of 
the MST problem is that it depicts different sort of scenarios where it is crucial to use this theoretical approach and how to use 
this tool for discovering a solution. Graph theory incorporates various algorithms for searching the minimum spanning tree and 
this paper uses one of them. To model the situation of Taxi-Delay optimization we use connected weighted graph where vertices 
represent locations and the edges represent the transport routes between the locations. The weight of an edge represents the time 
to drive the Taxi between two locations. A theoretical discussion and a model example are carried out to assess the MST.

1. Introduction
According to Thomson [16] and Ang [1], Transport Traffic Management (TTM) is a logistics sub field, interested in the 
planning, control and purchase of transport services necessary for the physical movement of vehicle. This is depicted in Figure 
1 bellow. In metropolitan cities such as Johannesburg TTM requires special attention because of the time it takes for a taxi to 
reach a specific destination. Many people have experienced this fact, especially in the city of Johannesburg.

Abstract 
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are an important contributor to the global economic growth. Nevertheless, 
owing to their lack of managerial capability to manage the impact of business uncertainty, they are prone to business 
failures. To prevent this situation, identification of risks affecting sustainability of SMEs and preparing appropriate 
risk mitigation strategies are important. Most of the previous supply chain risk management studies discussing the 
sustainability risks are focused mainly on large enterprises and fail to address this in the SMEs context. To address 
this research gap, this paper presents a preliminary study of the typology and categorization of supply chain 
sustainability risk faced by SMEs in the context of a developing country Indonesia. A preliminary survey to identify 
and categorize supply chain sustainability risk faced by Indonesian SMEs is accomplished by deriving sustainability 
risk dimensions and variables based on the triple bottom line concept. The study presents supply chain sustainability 
risk dimensions and variables from SMEs of various sectors. We have also identified opportunities for further study 
from this initial effort.

Abstract 
The objective of this research is to evaluate the relative performance efficiency and determine factors affecting the 
efficiency of 11 police stations in the Metropolitan Police Division 3. The first stage is to analyze the efficiency of 
the police station by Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) that measures the variable return to scale (VRS) and 
considering output-orientation. Input variable is the number of police officers. Output variables are the percentage of 
arrests with remand in custody, the percentage of arrests with remand in traffic offences, average score of people’s 
satisfaction on facilities of the police station, operational processes and service of staffs. For the second stage, 
factors affecting the performance efficiency of the police station are analyzed using multiple regression analysis. 
Efficient score calculated in the first stage is defined as the dependent variable. The results show that 4 police 
stations are technically efficient and there is only one police station with scale efficiency. In addition, the population 
density within the area responsible for the police station has affected the pure technical efficiency of the police 
station. The number of community resources within the area responsible for the police station has an effect on the 
scale efficiency of the police station.

1. Introduction
The police station is an important operational unit of the Royal Thai Police (RTP) known as the national police
of Thailand. Each police station has responsibility of an area and aims to keep the community in that area safe, 
prevent crimes, and facilitate in traffic control. Therefore, inefficient performance in the police station leads to social 
problem. There have attempted to improve the process of services to people who have suffered from crime and 
violence and require justice or fairness in term of one stop service to make satisfaction (Police department, 1998).  
Neely (2004) stated that the appropriate performance measure indicates a well-defined structure of facilities for 
moving towards achieving an organization’s goals and targets. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been used for 
evaluating efficiency of various types of the firms or entities called “Decision Making Units (DMU’s)” based on the 
multiple inputs and the multiple outputs. The term DMU is used to wide variety of activities, including 
governmental, not-for-profit and business units and sub-units (Songsrirote and Singhapreecha, 2006). 
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand and also the center of the administrative, political, and economic systems of 
the country. The police stations in Bangkok are the significant roles in the improvement of infrastructure in the 
nation and show performance which have affected on people’s confidence in security and make investor’s 
confidence in life, property, and business (Royal Thai Police, 2018). According to the organizational chart of the 
RTP, the metropolitan police bureau is the law enforcement agency for the police stations serving in Bangkok. 
Since there are no scientific standard measures of evaluating police station’s performance efficiency, this paper 
aims to measure the efficiency of a police station of the Metropolitan Police Division 3 consisting of 11 stations 
using DEA model. .In addition, the environmental variables are analyzed to explain the effect level on the efficiency 
of the police station using the multiple regression analysis. The second section shows the DEA model and efficiency

inputs. It is not economical to expand the number of police officers. Furthermore, 7 police stations are not 
technically efficient. Namely, the increase of the percentage of cleared up criminal cases and traffic offences should 
be in line with the number of police officers working in each police station. 
 
Step 2:  Stepwise method is applied to select the variables. It reveals that the external factors affecting the pure 
technical performance of the police station is the population density within the responsible area of the police station. 
It can see the negative coefficients of the variables. It can explain that the pure technical efficiency of the police 
station decreases when the density of population within the area responsible for the police station increases. The 
coefficient of determinant (R2) is 35.81%. The pure technical efficiency can be predicted in Equation (10). 
Y1 = 0.9923 – 0.000024 × (X1) 
(10) 
 
The external factors affecting the scale efficiency of the police station is the number of communities within the 
area responsible for the police station. The coefficients of the variables were negative that is the scale efficiency of 
the police station decreasing as the number of community resources within the police station area increasing. The 
coefficient of determinant (R2) is 29.85%. The prediction equation is shown in Equation (11). 
Y2 = 0.7173 - 0.00687 × (X2) 
(11) 
 
5. Discussion 
 
This study aims to measure the relative efficiency of the police stations under Metropolitan Police Division 3 using 
DEA technique. 
1) The results of comparative studies of efficiency’s eleven police stations are summarized as follows. Based on 
CCR and BCC efficient scores, only one police station: Lamhin Police Station is efficiency in both two models, 
including the scale efficiency. Ten police stations have decreasing return on size. In practice, the inefficient 
police station should increase outputs. Namely, there is increasing the cleared-up arrest rate of crimes and traffic 
offences. On the other hands, there is reducing the number of crimes and traffic offences. 
2) Environment factors affecting the pure technical efficiency of the police station include are the population 
density within the responsible area of the police station. Whereas the environment factors affecting the scale 
efficiency of the police station are the number of communities within the area responsible of the police station. 
The coefficients of both variables are negative. It can say that the efficiency of the police station decreases 
when the value of both variable increases.

Abstract 
The fourth industrial revolution is being fostered in many countries to make more efficient and flexible plants. 
Industry 4.0 target is to get a more competitive industry. Under this framework, improvement of mineral processing 
requires knowledge of previous methods and current technology in order to develop new techniques and 
approaches. As phosphate deposition decreases, the need for new recovery methods keeps growing. From this 
perspective, the need for control and optimization of existing processes becomes a necessity. It also includes the 
development of equipment with more advanced digitized components. The objective of our work is to develop a 
model of a process plant using SysML. In this paper, we adopted a system engineering-based approach, which 
consists on modeling and formalizing knowledge collected in the field. A well understanding of phosphate value 
chain allows both driving and optimizing current processes. In addition, we used this approach to model 
information flows in which we integrated a specific equipment in the overall process. This model will follow a 
systems engineering approach. In this paper we present the development of the SysML model of a process plant 
(Wash plant of phosphate). The model includes the requirements as well as the structure, behaviour and activity

The preparation of the Excel material balance was made from the particle size distribution obtained at the 
laboratory scale. The results found make it possible to calculate the mass flow rate of solid (ton/h), the water flow 
(m3/h), the solid rate (%), the density (ton/m3) and the volume flow rate of the pulp (m3 / h) at the output of each 
equipment. (Figure 4) 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
Model-Based Engineering is necessary for the engineering of the industry 4.0 systems. In this paper we have 
developed a SysML model of a process Wash Plant of phosphates. This model can be used for the design of the 
plant and for all the engineering activities through the plant life cycle. Our adopted approach summarizes various 
modeling tools working with a well-known industrial partner in Phosphate valorization. Using these approaches, 
we will guarantee efficient beneficiation processes by optimizing their operating parameters. Simulation through 
Excel allows the analysis of properties and performance of each equipment. 
In future works, we will investigate the possibility to generate Excel simulation from any SysML model by 
defining a map from SysML to Excel elements.

Abstract 
TAM is the largest maintenance activities for any a processing plant run continuously under harsh operating 
conditions. TAM event is usually a costly in term of time and cost due to plant downtime to execute their activities. 
The present study aimed at presenting a framework to prolong interval of TAM. The proposed framework in this study 
included three stages: Applying Risk-based Inspection (RBI) to select the most critical drums that constituted the 
highest risk on the plant performance, applying Failure Distributions (FDs) of the most critical drums and comparing 
an Estimated Risk (ER) with a Tolerable Risk (TR) to determine an optimum interval of TAM. This framework is 
characterized with the application of methods and techniques to reduce cost of TAM and production losses, and to 
improve all aspects associated with in reliability and availability of a plant to eliminate potential failures and prolong 
equipment life. The results of application of the framework proven its ability in the increase of interval of TAM of the 
processing plant without any threat to operational performance of plants. The improvement of TAM interval also 
revealed further in the reduction of TAM costs and production losses and the consequent income of millions of dollars.

1. Introduction
Processing plants consist of thousands pieces of equipment that operated continuously under harsh operating 
conditions resulting from overpressures and fluctuated temperatures. Some pieces of equipment usually subject to 
various maintenance strategies during the normal operation of plant. However, there are critical pieces of equipment 
that can't be inspected and maintained during the regular operation of plant unless plant facilities are totally shut 
downed in order to execute TAM event. In general, TAM activities of some oil and gas companies is based on 
recommended periods of the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). However, this suggestion is not the most 
optimum strategy in the long-term due to operating conditions and economic conditions that vary significantly from 
company to another [1]. Lawrence [2] reported that oil and gas plant facilities that operated continuously under 
overpressures and fluctuated temperatures must be shut downed operations to subject essential maintenance, 
modification and inspection work every few years to avoid any extreme consequences may impact production and 
production units. Therefore, TAM is one of major activities to oil and gas companies to avoid any a decrease in the 
availability of operating facilities and to lose in the profitability [3] due to a rise in the cost of the TAM event and a 
decline in the revenue which may be amounting to millions of dollars. Duffua and Daya [4] reported that TAM is a 
periodic maintenance during a certain period to perform inspections, repairs, replacements and modifications that can 
be executed only when the entire plant facilities are shutdown.  If plant shutdown interval between TAM cycle is too 
long. This will result a decrease in the production loss and a decrease in the inspection and maintenance cost. However, 
the expected risk will be high. Therefore, this work presents a framework to determine an optimal interval of TAM 
for processing plants based on the pressure drums to increase reliability and availability of plants. 
2. State-of-the-art on the TAM scheduling
In this study, a framework can be classified into three main stages, as shown in Fig 1:

                      ER D704 (S) = 0.560 x $65,468,767 = 499.57 $/hr. 
 
Therefore, the estimated risk of a plant is 499.57 $/hr. This means that ER is acceptable when compare with an 
assumed TR. Consequently, 73500 hrs is the actual hour to commence in the TAM event based on D-704, included 
inspection, repairs, modifications and improvement of a plant facilities, which cannot be inspected or maintained 
during the normal operation of plant and to avoid unexpected risks, which may occur on the plant assets, environment 
damage and production losses resulting from melting trays and caps, and disappearing bolts due to overpressure and 
increase feed temperatures. However, implementation of TAM event is a feasible means to avoid these consequences, 
which justifies the widespread adoption of TAM in real maintenance of drums. This means that, it is prudent to make 
total shutdown of the plant every 73500 hrs based on the most critical drums. 
4. Conclusions  
The purpose of the work was to present a framework to prolong the interval between TAMs of processing plants that 
operate continuously under harsh conditions. This framework is divided into three stages; RBI of heat exchangers, 
failure distributions, comparison of ER with TR to identify the most critical drums at processing industries. Results 
showed that two of thirty two pieces of drums were identified to determine the optimum interval of TAMs at 73500 
hrs every cycle TAMs based on production losses, damage of company assets and environmental issues resulting from 
corrosion effect in the pressure drums. An increase of interval between TAMs contributes in an improvement of 
reliability and availability of a processing plant.  
The proposed framework in this work can be implemented to any processing plant operated continuously under harsh 
conditions, however, proper attention must be identified according to the most critical pieces of equipment which 
cannot be inspected or maintained during the normal operation of a processing plant.

Abstract 
Augmented Reality is a promising technology for providing technical product information and might therefore be part 
of the digitalization strategy of industrial companies on their way to Industry 4.0.  
Especially in manufacturing, training and service the Augmented Reality technology can help to augment the reality 
of a user (e.g. maintenance personnel with a specific task related to a machine) with linguistic, numerical and visual 
Intelligent information and lead to a context-sensitive, modern way of user instruction.   
There are results from experimental approaches that apply Augmented Reality for Technical Documentation that point 
to a high potential of Augmented Reality regarding time savings and safety improvements.  
For an industrial company though the implementation of Augmented Reality for Technical Documentation might be 
a challenge and many questions still remain. How can you best profit from using Augmented Reality for industrial 
use cases? Can and should existing content be taken over from editorial systems or do the special features of 
Augmented Reality require a specific new concept of presenting information and could mean a shift towards more 
visual communication patterns? What could the future authoring process look like? 
This contribution discusses these questions and presents preliminary approaches to tackle the challenges for industry 
companies.

Advantages and Requirements for a Successful Introduction 
of an Industrial Tele Maintenance System

Abstract 
In the projects MainTelRob and BayernDigital, it was clearly shown that there is an huge need for tele 
maintenance systems in the industrial context. While most systems focus on remote access on machines, in 
many cases it is way more important that remote experts and local technicians can communicate and work 
in a tight collaboration to get tasks like commissioning, repair and optimization done. Not only for a better 
situation awareness, but also for security it is also important to have multiple cameras to get different 
perspectives simultaneously. This needs to work not only within a site, but also worldwide in case of 
medium to big enterprises. In such cases it is crucial that the tele maintenance system is flexible and efficient 
at a wide range of available bandwidth and line characteristics. Also security needs to be an integral part of 
such systems. The Zentrum für Telematik has invented and demonstrated such a system. 
But there are also many requirements which need to be fulfilled for a successful introduction of such 
systems. In major enterprises only approved devices are allowed to be used, especially on the job floor to 
minimize security risks. In many cases, the network infrastructure, firewalls and access control systems 
aren’t designed for such usages. This holds for local WLAN coverage (which, if rolled out, is primarily 
used for time uncritical systems with low traffic demands), for access to internal machine networks (even 
if the connections do exist physically), the firewall between office and job floor (in most cases it is either 
not possible to connect from the office floor to the job floor, there is no firewall and hence a high risk, or 
the firewall is very static), the site network (e.g. not sufficient performance on the plant’s backbone) and 
the connection between the sites. 
Additionally, many internal processes like escalation plans and documentation need to be adapted. Ways 
of getting the cost-value ratio for different usage scenarios of such systems are very important for many 
deciders. This is also true for additional changes like the introduction of call centers. Also there need to 
exist clear arrangements of responsibilities between the remote and the local individuals. One big obstacle 
are often the privacy laws – theoretically such systems do enable both video supervision and an accurate 
rating of single employees. 
This paper gives an insight about these challenges and provides approaches to cope with them. The Zentrum 
für Telematik has gained much experience during introducing and evaluating its system in several little and 
major companies.

Abstract 
Currently the methodologies of continuous improvement, based on the vast majority of the Toyota TPS Production 
System, describe implementation route maps, success stories within companies with quantitative and qualitative 
results, and application of improvement tools applied in a specific random manner; However, they do not show the 
way to follow to reach these goals or results. The value expectations of the parties involved, who will be called 
stakeholders, are not considered bilaterally, so this paper seeks to provide a comprehensive model design Lean Six 
Sigma intervention that takes the best practices of proven methodologies of the Institute Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, the Lean Enterprise and Six Sigma Institute and Operational Excellence at Arizona State University, 
combined with proven systemic simple steps that will help all people to develop and implement projects with 
significant quantitative and qualitative improvement results that impact the company, institution or organization 
where said model is applied. The Model was applied to 61 projects in which 192 people without previous knowledge 
of Lean participated, in a lapse of 3 years, obtaining excellent results that will be shown.

Abstract 
The aim of the present paper is to examine the role of personal resources on employees’ job performance 
and the mediating role of affective commitment. There are three antecedents of affective commitment 
including self-efficacy, organizational-based self-esteem, and optimism. The antecedents and affective 
commitment were proposed to enhance employees’ job performance. The data of this study have been 
collected from a group of employees of Somaliland telecommunication sector through questionnaire 
survey. The data were analysed using SmartPLS. The findings revealed that both personal resources (self-
efficacy, organizational-based self-esteem, and optimism), its second order construct and affective 
commitment have significant impact on employees’ job performance. To close, affective commitment 
partially mediated the relationship between personal resources and employees’ job performance.

1. Introduction
In the field of work and organizational psychology, the concept of personal resources has emerged as of central 
importance to job performance in general (e.g., Rich, Lepine, & Crawford, 2010). Personal resources refer to the 
ability of a person to control the environment successfully because of resiliency and the individual’s adaptability 
(Hobfoll et al., 2003; Bakker, Schaufeli, Leiter, & Taris, 2008; Schaufeli, Salanova, Gonzalez-Roma, & Bakker, 
2002). Xanthopoulou et al., (2009) highlighted that personal resources act in a similar way as job performance. As 
do job performance, personal resources secure the employee from hectic situations and its costs; furthermore, such 
resources support in goal achievement contributing to growth and improvement. These resources also act as a 
proximal predictor of work engagement (Xanthopoulou et al., 2009), which helps in understanding the relationship 
among dedication, absorption and vigor (Bakker and Xanthopoulou, 2013). In the context of telecommunication, 
quality care services can be provided to employees by the good performance of employees in the telecommunication 
industry. Thus, job performance is basically the effectiveness of employees in completing their assigned tasks on the 
care of their tasks (Xanthopoulou et al., 2009). According to Schaufeli, Bakker, and Salanova (2006), employees 
with strong personal resources have an energetic and effective connection with work, and feel able to cope with 
demands at work, in contrast to employees with weak personal resources (Lepine, & Crawford, 2010). Motivating 
characteristics of the job (job resources), together with aspects of the self-related to resilience (personal resources), 
have been found to be important for the development of job performance (Bakker & Demerouti, 2008). Interestingly 
reciprocal relations have also been found, such that the presence of particularly job resources but also personal 
resources leads to job performance, which in turn leads to more resources (Demerouti, & Schaufeli, 2009). The

The mediating effect off affective commitment was tested between personal resources (PR), and 
employees’ job performance (JP). The results showed that the direct effect of the relationship 
between PR, and JP without the presence of affective commitment is positive and significant, for 
example (β= .622, t-value 9.227). In addition, the indirect effect is the product of the direct effect 
between PR and affective commitment, as well as between affective commitment and job 
performance, and the results revealed that the indirect effect of PR, via the affective commitment 
mediator construct, on job performance is significant for example (β= .651, t-value 7.324). To 
test the strength of the mediating effect, variance accounted for (VAF) value was calculated and 
showed a value of 30.82%, which indicated that about 30.82% of the total effect of PR onto JP is 
explained by the indirect effect. In other words, Affective commitment partially mediated the 
relationship between PR and JP. 
 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
Personal resources reflect positive psychological state development of an individual. The results found support for 
the proposed conceptual claim and confirm that affective commitment mediates the relationship between personal 
resources and with multidimensional construct of job performance. Hence, the findings of this research contribute by 
helping the Somaliland Telecommunication industry in the development of employees’ psychological state. As 
personal resources have direct effects on job performance of employees and are indirectly affected through job 
commitment, the findings of the present study offer information regarding factors affecting job performance and 
affective commitment of employees. Future researchers should test this framework in other settings in order to 
further generalize the findings. Furthermore, future researchers should examine the effects of other personal factors, 
such as, locus of control and work engagement in order to further extend the boundaries of knowledge.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to determine the magnitude of the effect of price satisfaction on financial and 
non-financial performance; weather price satisfaction practices have direct effect on the non-financial and 
financial performance of dairy cooperative or non-financial performance positively mediating or 
moderating the relationship between price satisfaction and financial performance of dairy cooperatives. The 
samples of research is 70 farmers and several dairy cooperative where the farmer is a member located at 
Pasuruan and Malang. Using Partial Least Square (PLS) with the aid of the SmartPLS software program, 
the result of hypothesis indicated that price satisfaction has significant positive effect on non-financial and 
financial performance. In this case, rather than have direct relationship, price satisfaction have positive 
significant effect on financial performance through non-financial performance. This research fail to prove 
that non-financial performance is moderating significantly the relationship between price satisfaction and 
financial performance.

1. Introduction
One of important factor for improving the performance of dairy supply chain in Indonesia is the good 
relationship between dairy cooperatives and dairy farmers. The dairy farmers are members of local dairy 
cooperatives. In this case, the farmers can use dairy cooperatives as a tool to improve their welfare 
(Sebayang, 2013), as the dairy cooperatives give several support to dairy farmers. Including in this support 
is collecting the milk from dairy farmers, helping dairy farmers to sell their milk to the industrial milk 
processing, providing feeds and credit for dairy farmers, and also some services (such as animal health 
advice and artificial insemination services, cooling facilities at collection centres and collection points) 
(Morey, 2011; Wright and Meylinah, 2014; Susanty et al, 2018). 
As many other exchange relationship between two parties, the relationship between dairy farmers and 
cooperative also deals with the principal-agent problems. This problems are likely to give rise to member 
dissatisfaction because the purposes of the agent are usually different as those of the principal, and thus the 
agent may not always best represent the interests of the principal (Alchian and Demsetz, 1972; Royer, 1999; 
Sykuta and Chaddad, 1999).). The principal-agent problem becomes even more crucial in the dairy 
cooperative in Indonesia because, usually, there is no formal contract arrangement between dairy 
cooperatives and dairy farmers to prevent the dairy farmers or dairy cooperative from acting in their own 
interest or to prevent the opportunistic behaviours of dairy farmers and dairy cooperatives in a transaction. 
One of factor that has been considered to satisfy the parties involved in many exchange relationships is 
price.

The result of hypothesis testing can be seen in Table 4. The relationship between independent variable and 
dependent variable is significant if its relationship has p-value less than 0.01 
• 
Price satisfaction had a significant positive effect on financial performance (PSFP; LF=0.188, p-
value<0.01). So, hypothesis 1 was supported  
• 
Price satisfaction had a significant positive effect on non-financial performance (PSNF; LF=0.682, 
p-value<0.01). So, hypothesis 2 was supported  
• 
Non-financial performance had a significant positive effect as mediating variable between price 
satisfaction and financial performance (PSNFFP; LF=0.553, p-value<0.01). So, hypothesis 3 was 
supported. In this case, the direct relationship between price satisfaction and financial performance is 
smaller (LD=0.188) than the indirect relationship between price satisfaction and financial performance 
(LD=0.533).  Moreover, the result of calculation also indicated a significant positive effect of non-
financial performance to financial performance (NFFP; LF=0.810; p-value<0.01)  
• 
Non-financial performance had positive effect as moderating variable between price satisfaction and 
financial performance but not significant (LF=0.011, p-value > 0.01). So, hypothesis 4 was rejected.

5. Conclusion 
 
This research try to explore the role of price satisfaction on non-financial and financial performance. Using 
sample of 70 farmers and several dairy cooperative where the farmer is a member located at Pasuruan and 
Malang, this research can prove the significant positive effect of price satisfaction on non-financial and 
financial performance. In this case, rather than have direct relationship, price satisfaction have positive 
significant effect on financial performance through non-financial performance. The positive significant 
effect of price satisfaction on performance is supported by the other researchers, such as Schulze et al 
(2006), Gyau   et al (2011), and Boniface et al (2012), and Viergutz and Schulze (2018).  
 
The limitation of this research related with the number of sample. The sample of this research only dairy 
farmers from specific region. This condition make the result of this research may be cannot generalize to 
the other region or maybe to the other industries. So, in a future, research can be done in the other region 
or in the other industries in agribusiness sector, such as beef, sugar, or livestock industry that generally r 
farmer as a producer for raw material.

Abstract 
Competition in the manufacturing industry is growing at an accelerated rate due to globalization 
trend. This global competition urges manufacturing organizations to review and improve their 
processes in order to enhance and maintain their competitive advantage. One of those initiatives is 
the implementation of the Six Sigma methodology to analyze and reduce variation hence 
improving the processes of manufacturing organizations. This paper presents a Discrete Event 
Simulation methodology to support a Six Sigma approach for manufacturing organizations. 
Several approaches to implement Six Sigma focus on improving time management and reducing 
cycle time. However, these efforts may fail in their effective and practical implementation to 
achieve the desired results. Following the proposed methodology, a Discrete Event Simulation 
model was built to assist decision makers in understanding the behavior of the current 
manufacturing process. This approach helps to systematically define, measure and analyze the 
current state process to test different scenarios to improve performance. The paper proposes a 
systematic process improvement approach which allows for constant refinement of a process until 
a state of perfection is achieved. It applies an action research strategy to develop and validate the 
proposed modelling methodology in a British manufacturing organization competing in global 
markets.

Introduction 
According to The Engineer (2018), global manufacturing contributes to £6.7 trillion to the global 
economy. The UK automotive manufacturing industry turns over £80 billion year on year showing 
the growing competition for manufactures to implement process improvement techniques in order 
to stay competitive in local and global markets (SMMT, 2018). Initially developed as a 
methodology to measure defects and improve overall quality in manufacturing, Six Sigma in 
manufacturing seeks to reduce waste, improve quality of the product and in turn achieve more 
efficient operations. 
Six Sigma originated at Motorola, where the process was focused on reducing variability in 
product and process in order to prevent defects (Sanders & Hild, 2007). The concepts underlying

Conclusion and Future work 
This paper presents a Discrete Event Simulation methodology to support a Six Sigma approach for 
manufacturing organizations.  
 
The methodology includes the analysis and construction of a Discrete Event Simulation model to 
support decision makers, planners and managers in understanding the behavior of the current state 
of the manufacturing process under study. This will help them to be better informed to support 
their decisions in improving the manufacturing process. The DES model is constructed integrating 
the DMAIC improvement cycle, the Six Sigma technique to analyze and reduce variation, and the 
application of a Discreet Event Simulation approach. 
 
The paper proposes a systematic process improvement approach which allows for constant 
refinement of a process until a state of perfection is achieved. The paper applies action research to 
validate the proposed methodology in a British manufacturing organization competing in global 
markets. Thus, the analysis, development and validation of a Discrete Event model of an assembly 
line of a British manufacturing organization in the automotive sector is described in the paper. The 
constructed model of the assembly line highlighted the need to improve the current state process 
due to high waiting time and queue time within the existing process. 
 
This proposed systematic methodology could be implemented in manufacturing organizations to 
support the analysis and improvement of process performance and the successful implementation 
of their Six Sigma initiatives. The methodology can be improved further in the near future by 
addressing the following issues: 
 
 Further action research is needed to analyze and implement the methodology in other 
assembly lines and collecting data considering a longer period of time. 
 Combine the DES methodology with other modelling techniques (e.g. System Dynamics) 
to analyze the effect of strategic factors (internal and external) on manufacturing processes. 
 Validate the DES methodology with data collected from other assembly lines.  
 Create a detailed action plan for the implementation of improvements.

Abstract 
Various factors have been highlighted as causes of reliability deficiency of Permanent way (Perway) infrastructure, 
globally. It however was not known as to which of these factors are prevalent in the South African railway industry. 
The study develops a framework for identifying and classifying causes of reliability deficiency of Perway. The 
research followed the exploratory sequential mixed methods; the researcher conducted a qualitative research in a form 
of structured interviews and used the results thereof to build a quantitative research survey. A quantitative 
questionnaire survey was used to solicit responses from 52 respondents, comprising mainly of engineers, project 
managers, and Technicians who possess vast experience in the management of Railway infrastructure. Findings reveal 
that Poor maintenance policies, strategies and implementations is the most pervasive factor causing reliability 
deficiency of railway Track in South Africa whilst Insufficient funding and Aging rail network became the second 
and third factors, respectively. The research also concluded that; Track components used in South Africa are as good 
as those used by other major railway organizations globally. The study recommended that; South African railway 
organizations should priorities the replacement of old infrastructure and as part of continuous improvements, realign 
and modernize their maintenance strategies and implementations.

1. Introduction
Rail transportation system is a key economic enabler for South Africa, fortified by its distinguished allure
of environmental friendliness and capacity to haul large volumes of freight and passengers in an energy-
efficient manner. It is generally understood that South Africa needs a reliable railway infrastructure to
match its economic ambitions, in this increasingly competitive global economy. However, the potential for
railway system to play its role in the economic development of South Africa has been largely undermined,
owing to various factors such as reliability deficiency. According to the National Railway Policy Green
paper, compiled by the South African National Department of Transport, the network has lost both its ability
to compete with road transport in the local logistics and mobility markets, as well as its ability to support
exporters in competing effectively in the global market (Department of Transport, 2015).
According to a Masters in Engineering Management Thesis published from Stellenbosch University, South 
African Railway transport systems has been suffering from reliability challenges due to its aging 
infrastructure and high utilization of its physical assets (Jidayi, 2015). This view was also expressed on a 
continental spectrum, by the African Development Bank, which stated that Africa runs a risk of not realizing 
its full potential in exploiting its abundant natural resources and wealth due to the current conditions of 
existing railways infrastructure and rolling stock which is poor and appalling, as a result of lack of 
investment in infrastructure and the absence of a supporting institutional framework (African Development 
Bank , 2015).

6. Conclusions and Recommendations  
Railway transportation remains a very key economic enabler for South Africa. It is of paramount 
importance to ensure that the reliability of the railway infrastructure remains intact and is continuously 
improved, to enhance railway competitiveness. This study provided a focused view of factors that are of 
major impact to the reliability of railway track; this will allow railway organizations to narrow their focus 
and channel efforts into resolving factors that will yield optimum results. 
 
6.1 Conclusions  
Following the Pareto analysis, it can be concluded that; poor design of components and systems, Manufacturing 
defects and inherent flaws, Organizational rigidity and complexity, application of Excess loads, Lack of Critical 
skills, human errors and miss management of wheel/rail interaction are not major factors undermining the reliability 
of railway Track in South Africa. It can therefore be deduced that: 
 
Railway Track components used in South Africa are as good as those used in the so called developed countries  
 
Overloading of trains is well managed and is of minimal impact to the reliability of railway track 
 
The railway organizations in the country are well managed, by properly skilled and qualified professionals  
 
Even though railway is losing skilled people through retirement and other reasons, the railway organizations in 
the country seems to be compensating for such through various training and skills development programs  
 
It can also be concluded that, the deterioration of track reliability in South Africa is largely attributed to aging rail 
network, Insufficient funding as well as Poor maintenance policies, strategies and implementations. 
 
6.2 Recommendations 
Following the research findings, the following recommendations can be made; 
 
The railway organizations in the country should priorities the replacement of old infrastructure through capital 
expenditure.  
 
Adequate funding should be made available for railway construction, maintenance and rehabilitation projects 
 
As part of continuous improvements, railway organizations should realign/refocus and modernize their 
maintenance strategies and implementations 
 
6.3 Future work  
In line with the objective of this study, the thesis only compares the influence of various factors undermining the 
reliability of railway track, it does not go as further as finding solutions to quell or eradicate those factors. Future work 
is required to deal with the root causes of these factors as well as to find solutions to eradicate these factors for the 
reliability of railway track. Due to the small sample used to conduct this study, further research is highly recommended 
to provide a much broader view.

Abstract: 
 
This paper investigates the relationship between national culture and logistics performance of different countries. We 
use the logistics performance index (LPI) data to capture the logistics performance of different countries as well as 
the Hofstede national culture framework to capture the different culture dimensions’ data of the same countries. We 
tested the statistical relation and significance between the different culture dimension and LPI and proposed various 
hypothesis that describe how the logistical performance of countries is related and affected by these dimensions. The 
managerial impact of our findings suggests that logistics strategists need to consider deeper knowledge of the regional 
national culture when assessing investments locations. Also acknowledging some required behavioral and structural 
adjustment efforts in some locations to improve logistical performance is another outcome of this knowledge. These 
managerial impacts also include global supplier selection and assessment decisions. The rising importance of logistics 
contribution in today’s supply chain management needs to be further contextualized with local national culture

Abstract 
The aim of the research study is to investigate wind power as a source of renewable energy and to uncover the 
beneficial contribution and impact wind power has as an alternative source of energy and how it can be improved and 
managed for the benefit of the current and future generation. There are various natural resources in which energy can 
be generated from these include the power from natural sunlight, the wind and the constantly flowing waters of oceans 
and river throughout the world.  Out of the world’s current population the demand for energy constantly increases and 
due to the high demand. The demand for energy is also incurred by countries that have rapid growing economies such 
as China and India. These countries find it impossible to quench the demand and therefore require external assistance 
and alternative sources of energy. The services required by these countries include for example air conditioning 
services. These demands are fundamental and yet too high for the country such as India to provide utilizing its own 
resources and therefore India relies on coal for more than half its energy generation and to fuels for its factories and 
transportation. This country in a producer of coal and has 565 coal mines making it the world’s third largest producer 
of coal but it still cannot maintain its economic growth without new energy sources. Wind energy is one of the most 
useful and helpful renewable energy solutions. It is a form of solar power and has proven to be successful for decades 
since it began being used. Wind energy provides mechanical power in order to turn electrical generators by using air 
flow that goes through wind turbines. The blades of a wind turbine can be up to 40 meters long and can spin around 
more than 20 times in a minute.

Abstract 
The aim of the research study is to analyze with in depth scrutiny the concept of waste in the hospitality industry with 
particular interest in water and energy, which are natural resources. The study targets to unravel the causes of waste 
especially of water and energy in the hotels and ways in which it may be decreased for the benefit of the current and 
coming generation. Hotels are responsible for a significant amount of energy and water consumption on a daily basis 
not only in the building construction but also due to its establishments where they have installed complicated 
installations that provide the guest with good quality and high levels of multi- facetted comfort and high class 
amenities, treatment and facilities. Many services offered by hotels are resources incentive. These resources needed 
to provide most of the services hotels offer include water, energy and or raw materials and these are utilized in 
excessive amounts. The guests nowadays are extremely complicated and have high expectations on the hotel they 
lodged with, these expectations include the actual facility, the services the staff of the hotel offer, the food they provide 
and the overall experience of the guest in the hotel. These expectations causes significant pressure on the hotel 
management on what they provide in the hotel and how they continue to remain competitive in the market for their 
guests. This has a great influence on the escalation of the wastage levels in hotels especially in natural resources such 
as water and energy. Guests for example required ample amounts hot water to be available in the hotels 24 hours a 
day 7 days a week, they also expect the air condition to be working at a good temperature all day every day, guests 
also expect their food to be prepared by master chefs in front of them while they wait and in their specific preference 
and all these cause very high levels of wastage to be experienced on a daily basis. Hotels are to work out ways to 
implement day-to day methods that will supply the guests with service that is good enough and yet also ensuring that 
wastage at all departments is kept on the bear minimum, especially the natural resources (water and energy)

Abstract 
This article aims to evaluate the synergy between Lean and Green Manufacturing practices in the 
Brazilian furniture manufacturing industry. The life cycle assessment (LCA) and cleaner 
production (CP) practices were considered for the evaluation of the green manufacturing 
practices. Thus, the synergy evaluation was determined by the adherence level of Lean 
Manufacturing (LM), LCA and CP and by their correlations (Pearson coefficient). The research 
method used was the multiple case studies with 10 Brazilian furniture-manufacturing industries, 
through interviews and observations in the production units. The main results showed that the 
Brazilian furniture manufacturing industry has a low level of adherence for LM, LCA and CP 
practices. The level of compliance for LM was 28.33%; for LCA it was 21.43%, and for CP it 
was 19.05%. However, the analysis of correlations allowed identifying a strong dependence 
between LM and CP practices (Pearson coefficient of 0.8849) and the moderate dependence

5. Conclusion 
 
The study of multi-cases in the Brazilian furniture industry showed a low level of adherence of LM (28.33%), LCA 
(21.43%) and CP (19.05%). The lack of LM, LCA and CP practices is related to the low number of furniture 
factories that are ISO 9000 and / or ISO 14000 certified. Only 40% (4) of the furniture factories study to present 
some type of ISO certification. 
 
The analysis of the Pearson correlation coefficient between LM, LCA and CP practices allowed identifying a strong 
correlation (0.88) between LM and CP practices and a moderate correlation (0.58) between LM and LCA practices. 
A strong positive relationship means that the LM application eliminates LM and GM waste at one go, thus creating 
the conditions necessary for CP and LCA to be achieved, improving the company's environmental performance. It 
reinforces that LM, LCA and CP practices can be integrated. The correlation analysis also showed that ISO 9000 
and 14000 certifications positively influence the level of adherence of LM, LCA and CP practices. 
 
Finally, the method of evaluation of synergy used in the multi-case study allowed to clearly identify a group of 9 
practices that present Lean and Green synergies: LM01 (Lean Manufacturing Philosophy), LM10 (Just-in-time- JIT: 
Setup), LM15 (Autonomation- Problems Solving), LCA06 (Reuse - Packing), LCA08 (Reuse - Water consumption), 
LCA10 (Logistics - Suppliers environmental impacts), LCA14 (Responsibility - Environmental responsibility), 
CP03 (Raw Material- Change in raw material) e CP04 (Raw Material- Recycling of raw material).

Abstract 
The application of enterprise resource planning (ERP) is among the most complex transformational projects for any 
organization and is associated with high risks and cost. This study proposes a fuzzy-social network analysis approach 
for modeling and analyzing the crucial success factors of ERP implementation tasks. One benefit of the proposed 
tactic is that it permits ERP projects managers and implementors to identity the most crucial success factor for ERP 
implementation based on a classification system that classifies Critical Success Factors under four categories: 
autonomous, dependents, linkage and independent. The proposed approach is demonstrated using a case study from 
industry.

1. Introduction
The implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system undertakings is important in situations in which 
businesses have utilized them to standardize processes, improve performance, and undertake better decision making. 
With the emergence of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems since the 1990s, it has become common for many 
organizations to rely on  ERP systems to remain competitive within their markets and industries (Sayegh, 2010). 
According to Holland & Light (1999), “ERP implementation can secure enormous benefits for successful companies, 
or it can be disastrous for organizations that fail to manage the implementation process.” Enterprise resource planning 
systems or ERP can be defined as “a set of applications that automate finance and human resource departments and 
help manufacturers handle jobs such as order processing and production scheduling” (Gupta, 2000). Nah & Lau (2001) 
defined ERP as “a packaged business software system that enables a company to manage the efficient and effective use 
of resources (materials, human resources, finance, etc.) by providing a total integrated solution for the organization’s 
information-processing needs.” In the 1960s, most organizations implemented centralized computing systems to 
automate their systems for inventory control utilizing inventory control packages (IC). Subsequently, material 
requirements planning (MRP) systems were introduced in the 1970s, which entailed planning product requirements that 
were referred to a master production schedule. After that, in the 1980s, new software systems entitled manufacturing 
resources planning (MRP II) emerged to optimize manufacturing processes by linking materials with production 
requirements. Enterprise resource planning systems evolved from the MRPII system. ERP systems were introduced  in 
the late 1980s, and by the 1990s, the system was known for its enterprise-wide inter-functional integration (Rashid, 
Hossain, & Patrick, 2002).  
ERP implementation has several strategic implementation approaches, one which is the implementation of a standard 
package with few departures from the standard settings. Another approach is  to customize a system to match business 
requirements (Holland & Light, 1999). In multi-cites companies, ERP can be implemented simultaneously at all 
facilities, or it can be implemented as phases. The advantages of  the simultaneous implementations that they require 
less time for the integration of the entire system. Moreover, sequential implementation can create positive feedback

The proposed Fuzzy-SNA approach has several limitations to be overcome in future studies. First, the proposed 
approach was demonstrated using a single case study. For a better generalization of the results, several case studies 
can be conducted. Second, this study assumes that the interaction level of the vital success factors of ERP 
implementation remains constant during an ERP project life cycle. Lastly, even though fuzzy sets are applicable for 
use and accordingly may be an ideal approach for quantifying the interaction level of the ERP CSFs; some other 
approaches may be explored. A future study can explore all these limitations.

Abstract 
This research paper presents the relationship between the proactive orientation towards the market and the novelty 
degree of innovation in the internationalization of companies, measured with the export intensity. The data to test the 
hypothesis of the research were obtained from a sample of Colombian manufacturers from the Second Survey of 
Development and Technological Innovation, conducted by the National Administrative Department of Statistics 
(DANE by its abbreviation in Spanish) in Colombia. The survey seeks to establish the dynamics of technological 
development of the Colombian manufacturing company in terms of the intensity and trajectory of the innovation and 
technological development activities. From the total number of companies consulted, there were 297 in different 
sectors that responded to the survey and provided their information to be used in the study. The data were treated by 
means of a model of ordered logistic regression, whose result was the conclusion that there is a positive relationship 
between the proactive orientation towards the market and the export intensity, while it was not possible to demonstrate 
the relationship between novelty in innovation and the same export intensity.

1. Introduction
Innovation is the complex process of creating ideas and inventions with economic meaning; its positive effect on the 
economy, product of the development of competitive advantages, has motivated researchers and policy makers to 
allocate resources for understanding it, and postulating it as the central axis of entrepreneurship studies (Guzmán and 
Martínez 2008).  
Depending on what you want to evaluate, innovation contemplates a diversity of factors. Guzmán and Martínez (2008) 
classify the results of innovation into three generic categories, in consonance with the object, the strategic purpose, 
and the degree of novelty.  
According to the object, innovation is understood as the generation of new goods or services, or the improvement of 
existing ones; the adoption of new processes or adjustment of the current ones, which can be from production, 
management, organizational, or the improvement of those; the creation, expansion, or segmentation of the sales 
markets or the improvement of the supply sources of raw materials or products. That is to say, that according to the 
object of innovation, a new way of doing things is assumed (Schumpeter 1997).  
Regarding the strategy, innovation depends on the characteristics of the market and technologies, since it answers the 
question of why one should innovate (Guzmán and Martínez 2008).  
Finally, in relation to the degree of novelty, there are several studies on the subject, and although their standardization 
has changed over time, as Dahlin and Behrens (2005) described in their article, the most usual and accepted 
classification in the literature refers to the radical novelties, which are the novelties that unbalance the world market 
(Dahlin & Behrens, 2005), and incremental novelties, which correspond to the introduction of a new product or process 
for the company, but that already exists for the market (Guzmán and Martínez 2008).

6. Conclusions 
 
The main motivation of this research was to empirically prove, by means of the application of an ordered logistic 
model to 297 companies, that what is found in the literature on the support that the proactive orientation towards the 
market offers to the companies in order to have an efficient internationalization through exporting growth, is applied 
in all cases. In the same way, to confirm if an even greater effect was obtained together with the degree of novelty of 
innovation.  
 
The evidences found in the study allow to conclude that indeed there is a relationship between the proactive orientation 
towards the market, and that there is no relation with the degree of novelty of the innovation. 
In order to continue with the studies on the internationalization of companies, taking into account the proactive 
orientation towards the market as one of the main determinants, it is important to carry out the empirical analysis in 
homogeneous companies, that is to say that they must have similar characteristics in terms of size, age, type of 
innovation, among other factors, preferably in specific sectors of the industry. 
 
On the other hand, subsequent studies may inquire about other institutional conditions that contribute to the 
development of the capacities of an organization to create the conditions that favor exporting, in such a way that, in a 
synergistic manner, companies can undertake effective strategies that allow them to be included in international 
markets. 
 
7. Limitations 
 
One of the limitations of the study was the impossibility of having data from homogeneous companies in terms of 
size, the geographical location where they are located, and the type of innovation. 
 
In most of the studies where we want to make inferences about the behavior of companies, organizations are 
reclassified into micro, small, medium, and large companies, with the aim of reaching explanations or predictions, 
depending on the case, not only for the specific sample but of the population, facilitating the execution of the same 
exercises in other regions, countries, or industries. 
 
It is important to know the type of innovation since it is not the same to make a technological innovation, necessary 
to make innovation in products or processes, or an innovation of the non-technological type, such as organizational or 
administrative changes within a company. In addition, innovation can also be in scientific, financial, or commercial 
activities, among others, or a combination of some or both.

Abstract 
This paper presents solar energy relevance in South Africa's. The research first identifies the available strength of 
power generation: Concentrating Solar Power (CSP); Photo Voltaic (PV) based on the environmental conditions of 
the country.  The paper discusses the particular options of these resources in the remote and rural regions — the cost-
effective generation of electricity using solar compared to existing electricity power tariff, which is mainly based 
standard grip. The research simulates some cost benefits studies conducted on the PV based solar power and wind 
power generation and its utilization as independent power producers. A non-experimental research method, qualitative 
approach, descriptive design was used in this research. This paper justifies cost-effectiveness and feasibility of green 
energies based on factors like location, size, management, selection and the operation of plants. The research 
limitations include the sample size and the qualitative research approach. The researcher recommends continued 
support of public incentives for green energy education and technology especially by soliciting the involvement of 
nonprofit organizations.

Abstract 
Customer need is the most important factor in the formation of each market and business. It engages 
companies in order to meet their need by developing new products and services. Although it can make an 
appropriate attraction for company customers, a company needs to have a good understanding of their 
customer dynamic behavior. Based on this understanding, they can provide appropriate planning for 
customer’s retention. In banks, customers are key components of the banking business. All of their 
strategies and plans are organized to attract new customers, retain current customers, and ultimately 
enhance customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, customer churn is one of the most important problems for this 
business. It deprives a bank of various earnings and fee incomes. And more importantly, customer deposit 
is the main source of the incomes earned by a bank in the Islamic banking system. It may lead to the 
withdrawal part of a bank’s deposits. By considering the loss of these two sources of incomes, along with 
the possibility of increasing the reputational risk, can lead a bank to the brink of bankruptcy. The present 
study provides a model of customer churn prediction for retail customers of a commercial bank in Iran. 
By applying advanced data analysis techniques on transaction and operation data of the bank customers, 
appropriate classification of customers is presented in terms of the churn rate. Thus, by executing suitable 
strategies for each category, it can be developed to reduce the amount of customer churn.  In this research, 
a private bank in Iran has been used to predict the customer's bank data. The results show that the jobs 
associated with food services including restaurants and fast food retailers, as well as the technical 
services, have the highest churn rate in the bank. After them, the sports centers, as well as the household, 
are in the next ranks of churn from the bank services. In contrast to counseling centers, kindergartens, and 
governmental organizations, respectively, were the lowest risky corporate customers of the bank. Also, in 
retail customers, clients aged 30-40 years had the largest churn in the bank’s services.

1. Introduction
Customer retention is one of the major aspects of customer relationship management (CRM) and, 
it is considered as the core of CRM. Customer churn is one of the concepts associated with 
customer retention, which pays attention to the customers opting out from continuing to work 
with a company. Customer churn is an important issue for all organizations because today the 
cost of attracting new customers is much higher than the cost of maintaining existing customers.

Abstract 
 
Global warming and environmental pollution are common concerns for several agencies and society (RTVE, 2016), 
with transport being one of the sectors that contributes most to this problem (World Bank, 2014). One of the 
developments that help reduce its impact is the application of driving cycles in the design or redesign of vehicles 
adapting it to their specific needs, depending on the characteristics of the region under study and the way of driving. 
For this, it is required to have a driving cycle with representativeness of the driving patterns in a certain region or 
route. In order to obtain a representative driving cycle, a clear, justifiable and validated construction methodology 
must be available.  
 
The purpose of this study is to design a methodology to build driving cycles using statistical techniques, such as 
cluster analysis, and the construction method of driving cycles with micro-trips, which is the most commonly used 
and easy to handle method. The simultaneous application of these two techniques is the great value and the 
differentiating point with respect to the methodologies proposed until now.  
 
Finally, a validation of the proposed methodology is performed by comparing the driving cycle obtained by the 
proposed methodology and the one generated by a deterministic methodology (the MWD-CP). The comparison was 
made in three selected variables: the average speed, idle speed and SAPD (speed acceleration probability distribution). 
Being the average speed one of the most used performance measures used for the evaluation of driving cycles, results 
show that the relative difference of this variable, when we compare the average from the sample data and the average 
from the proposed driving cycle, is 1.25% while the driving cycle obtained by the MWD-CP has 15.67% relative 
difference.

Abstract 
Nowadays, the final customer requirements are more crucial and have taken a great relevance in suppliers, that 
relevance can be translate in quality, quantity and logistics efficiency. In this ambit, the logistics efficiency aims to 
load and send material to customer as soon as possible. So, the need to load and send material quickly have elevated 
in recent years. The deliver windows are getting shorter and the loading periods longer. We have identified an 
opportunity to reduce loading time of customize steel products such as profiles, sheets and coils.  
Through our methodology inspired by the Deming cycle and lean logistics, we recognized different issues around the 
loading procedure. By applying lean logistics thinking, we were able to acknowledge and reduce time in every process 
that had waste in it. This paper proposes a step-by-step process of our intervention in the loading system and 
rearrangement of the warehouse. By reducing the waste of time, space and work force, we were able to reduce the 
loading time in 15% by preparing 10% of the future shipments. The occupancy of the warehouses were almost at full 
capacity. This resulted in the shutdowns of productive lines of 3.9 days per line per month because there were out of 
space. Another effect of the poor warehouse management was the shipments to external warehouses that resulted in 
extra costs.  
By the standardization of the warehouse arrangement and process, we reduced the shutdowns of lines by 20% and the 
shipments to external warehouses by 15%.  With the previous improvements, we reduced canceled orders because of 
not on time delivery, an average of 4 per month, resulting in $315,790 dollars of extra profit annually. Finally, we 
achieved savings of $39,473 dollars annually of not sending material to external warehouses.

Abstract 
Activity Based Costing (ABC) is an accounting system that collects and analyze all costs related to activities occur in 
an organization based on their nature. ABC can overcome many of the limitations of Traditional Cost Accounting 
(TCA) methods as it helps to discover hidden or distorted cost information and remove the generalization of TCA. In 
this project, Company XYZ is suffering from a major drop in their 2017 sales compared to previous years as new 
competitors are joining the glass-bottling manufacturing industry in Kuwait. Their sales dropped significantly by 
51.35% during the last two years, thus ABC is used to investigate their costing system and try help them know the 
root causes and overcome this drop. Time and cost information about each step in Company’s XYZ Pepsi glass bottles 
production line is collected, work stations were analyzed, activities were defined, and cost information were assigned 
to them. Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is used to analyze and capture all flows of information and materials in the 
production system and identifies the value and non-value added times and activities. TCA results were compared to 
ABC and discussed, improvements and recommendations were discovered and presented.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing companies are looking for ways to help them manufacture high quality products at the lowest possible 
cost. Companies should be more productive, efficient, flexible, and have an accurate cost information to reach their 
goals. Labor, machines, and time are important factors that affect the productivity and the efficiency of any 
manufacturing company and need to be taken into consideration. Activity Based Costing, ABC, is an accounting 
method that take into consideration all types of activities in an organization and collect all related costs based on their 
nature. Even though ABC is complex and expensive to install, it’s better than Traditional Costing Methods, TCM, as 
it gives more precise information about the costs and identifies wasted costs, and unnecessary activities. Also, ABC 
discover the root causes behind any problem to solve it. Moreover, it considers the time each activity takes to improve 
any system as wasted time affect the efficiency and as a result affects the cost while TCM gives general costs 
information and don’t take into account the unexpected expenses. ABC is needed to be applied to XYZ Company to 
help them trace the root causes behind the significant drop in their sales as it seems that they cannot decide accurately 
on how much to produce and at what cost. XYZ Company is using the Exponential Smoothing forecasting technique 
which seems to be giving them higher unrealistic values; their sales continue dropping and inventory is palling up. 
2. Background
In manufacturing there are different types of direct and indirect costs, depending on what a company producing. 
However, there are mainly two conventional costing methods (Edu Pristine, 2018): 
2.1 Traditional Costing Formulation

an activity and the cost of this activity can include more than one cost category, like how the marketing and 
administration activity costs were divided into three cost categories: indirect labor, energy sources and supplies. The 
indirect labor cost for this activity was investigated by experts in business and management and got decrease by 50%. 
The indirect labor cost decrease by 0.0003 files/bottle to become 0.0003 files/bottle after it was 0.0006 files/bottle. 
That cause the total cost of the bottle to change from 0.01782 files/bottle to be 0.01189files/bottle as shown in Table 
7. A comparison between the two costing systems is shown in |Table 8, it shows the new cost breakdown after 
improving the system again.

6 Conclusion 
The sufficient cost reduction with continuous improvement is without doubt one of the companies traceable seek. 
The main problem of “XYZ glass manufacturing company that has huge drop in their sales of 2017” The main 
comparison point is comparing the two systems of As-Is system which refers to traditional technique of current system, 
and Should-Be system that refers to ABC method. Based on the result we can recommend the XYZ company to follow 
new forecasting technique rather than the incorrect result of exponential smoothing method, and invest new scenario 
of inspection machine with higher capacity, reduce the number of visual labor checking and precisely breakdown the

indirect cost and identify any hidden cost by adopting the ABC Costing method. As ABC method is a valuable tool in 
providing smoothly accurate cost information by allocating each cost to its resources and activities, as well eliminating 
or reducing the non-value added activities, so obviously  improved scenario with the ABC efficiently can lead the 
XYZ Company to support their decisions management with unrivalled insight of the production manufacturing system 
while our goal as industrial engineers always attempt to have such a significant development and enhancement to the 
optimized system with higher efficiency, less cost and less total lead cycle time.

Abstract 
In traditional business models of banking in developing economies, banks earn profit by attracting 
deposits and offering loans, facilities, and mortgages to customers. This approach has been for many 
years a predominant business model, while their key performance indicators (KPI) show lack of business 
profitability. This issue is a diversion from the primary purpose of profitability initially built in the 
business model, and is called the profitability paradox. In this research, the data of financial statements of 
a private bank in Iran between 2012 and 2016 was used to define and represent the profitability paradox 
problem. To find causes of this problem and provide effective solutions, a system dynamics methodology 
has been applied. A holistic system model of the problem is represented to depict the causal structure of 
behavior of the profitability paradox. The results show that a suitable strategy for profitability, would be a 
shift from the interest income-based structure to the service-based structure.

1. Introduction
Banking system is one of the important pillars of Iran’s financial system which has a significant impact 
on its economic growth. Iranian banks play a great role in its economy by crediting services to 
manufacturing sections. Hence, incomes obtained from granting loans to manufacturers and other 
customers is the primary way of making profits for Iranian banks. On the other hand, banks as financial 
service institutions offer their customers many services, which brings in extra incomes called mostly fee 
incomes. Due to the two types of incomes in Iran’s banking system, establishing and developing 
sustainable incomes as well as increasing the productivity are the most fundamental goals of Iranian 
banks. Regarding the current business model of commercial banks and their services in developing 
countries like Iran, banks’ incomes can be classified into two general groups: 1) interest incomes and 2) 
non-interest incomes. 
Interest income is obtained from crediting services like loans and mortgages to customers which is 
gained from contributing with individuals. The bank earns income through receiving term deposits from 
customers as resource, investing those resource in different businesses, and offering term services to 
customers. This income arises from a difference between deposit interest rates and committed services 
and also the profit of investments. This income is due to the main and vital operation of the bank, i.e. 
intermediation of funds.

Abstract  
 
This research took place of a textile company, its primary object was to design a layout for a specific area of production 
line, applying methods of plant distribution. The project began with the description of basic theories which were used 
to enable the research, continuing realizing diagnosing the production system where the flow of materials was 
examined, and the current layout was observed. Alternative solutions were created and a practicable solution for the 
layout was established by using Systematic Layout Planning; to test the solution mentioned above, the quantitative 
methods called Computer Relative Allocation of Facilities Technique and Computerized Relationship Layout 
Planning were applied. Furthermore, a final solution for the layout was proposed in which the organization of two 
working departments was designed with a production flow of the U-type.

1. Introduction 
 
The distribution in plant is the ordering logical of the industrial elements (work force, means of work, work object 
and area), so that it follows the route of the productive flow through the production line. This includes the delimitation 
of the corridors and workstations, as well as the corridors of circulation (Muther 1973). The distribution in plant 
consisted in the physical management of the factors and industrial elements that participate in the productive process 
of the company, in the distribution of the area, in the determination of the relative figures and location of the different 
departments. The main objective is that this provision of elements be efficient and carried out in such a way as to 
contribute satisfactorily to the achievement of the purposes set out in the company (De la Fuente and Quesada 2005). 
 
An analysis in the production process of the company under study, it shown that there are delays in the transport of 
the work object because the departments are not distributed sequentially. Sand identified that there are two posts 
working to perform the same tailoring operations. In addition, one of the posts works shows congestion in the hallways. 
The workspaces do not meet the dimensions established in the regulation and that presents accumulations of product 
in process (Leyva et al. 2018). By what do not meet the principles of distribution in the plant, thus having a problem 
with the organization of facilities (Lorente el al. 2018). 
 
2. Materials and Methods 
Many authors have used plant distribution methods to optimize the placement of workstations. The method is initially 
assumed Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) proposed by Muther (1973). That based on the flow of production are 
located the jobs. In addition, it is analyzed what is proposed by Van Donk and Gaalman (2004); Liu and Chen (2008); 
Wiyaratn and Watanapa (2010); Wiyaratn et al. (2013), which have applied this methodology in different companies, 
managing to optimize the distribution of the departments. In the case of Lee (1966), proposes the organization of 
workspaces through the Method Computerized Relationship Layout Planning (CORELAP), developed a program that 
establishing a criterion for the proper location of each or departments, based on the Total Closeness Rating (TCR). 
The authors Devis (1967) and Deisenroth (1971), develop the method through the sum of all numeric values assigned","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

After examining the transport costs of the work object in the current distribution and the proposed distribution, it is 
clearly shown that it is less expensive to transport the work object with the proposed plant distribution, having a 
reduction of 36.82 %. 
 
4. Conclusions 
1. A U-shaped material flow was used to optimize the space used with greater control over production processes 
and direct communication with previous and subsequent activities to the area under study. 
2. Systematic Layout Planning was applied distribution plant where a feasible distribution solution was 
generated that was obtained, after having evaluated alternatives of solution in conjunction with the owner of 
the company and the production personnel. 
3. Methods the quantitative CRAFT and CORELAP with the purpose of contrasting the solution obtained with 
the SLP method, making the three methods of distribution in plant coincide in their results. 
4. The proposal of distribution in final plant allowed to define the trajectory of the object of work of the area of 
study, distributing the spaces of work by the creation of departments clearly identified and ordered.  
5. The proposed plant distribution was evaluated in a qualitative and quantitative way, where improvements 
were visualized by reducing the cost of transport of the work object by 36.82%.

Abstract 
This paper studies the problem of programming the ships loading to the bulk, in port systems. Identical 
loaders called Shiploaders must attend bulk carriers. When programming the ships, the charterer tries to 
minimize the incurred penalization cost when the Laydays is breached. The charterer will be penalized 
based on the amount of time that passes from the ending of the Laydays until the beginning of the bulk 
carrier loading. This problem is analyzed as a Berth Allocation Problem – (BAP), which is an NP-hard 
problem. Different metaheuristics have been implemented to address this type of problems. In order to 
explore the uncertainty in the bulk carrier loading, a metaheuristic is implemented on a simulation model. 
The metaheuristic Simulated Annealing (SA) was integrated using Flexsim Software 2018 to address the 
uncertainty of the loading times in the programming of the ships. The results were compared with previous 
work where only genetic algorithms had been applied, without simulation. It was demonstrated that the 
simulation and the Simulated Annealing minimized the breach of the Laydays facing the uncertainty 
associated to the operation from the maritime port to the bulk carriers, bearing in mind more real instances.

Abstract 
 
The aims of this study were to verify the moving monitor developed for correcting Forward Head 
Posture (FHP) and to investigate the effects of a moving monitor on the FHP and neck fatigue. As 
Visual Display Terminal (VDT) work become a more popular type in office tasks, many office 
workers are experiencing VDT syndromes such as FHP, neck and shoulder discomfort and so on. 
FHP can stress on the neck and shoulders if it lasts for a long period time, in spite of that, there is 
a lack of studies with development of a device for correcting the FHP. 16 healthy males were 
participated in this study. The VDT task was performed for 50 minutes to compare the moving 
monitor with a normal conventional monitor. CVA was measured for the posture correction and 
FRR, On/Offset angle, and Subjective discomfort were also collected to evaluate the fatigue of the 
neck and shoulder. Although all participants reported fatigue after 50 minutes VDT task, they 
represented less fatigue at the moving monitor than at the conventional monitor. In addition, the 
longer time of the right head and neck postures were also observed at the moving monitor than at 
the conventional monitor. The results of this experiment showed that the moving monitor can 
reduce the fatigue of the user's neck and correct the head posture compared to the conventional 
monitor. This study is expected to contribute to the development of a moving monitor for 
correcting of head posture in the future.

Abstract 
From last few decades, sustainability becomes a key concern for the sake of society survival. Therefore; firms, 
practitioners, academicians etc. are required to respond towards ecological deprivation, exhaustion of natural 
resource and variation in climate; as these are tremendously increasing on behalf of firm’s productions and for 
satisfying households and related daily needs of human beings. Accordingly, the present study is framed by the 
authors to create alertness about exhaustion and degradation about the ecological aspects in the form of computation 
and modeling. The present research has exploded the conceptual field of DEMATEL technique to respond towards 
decision making under socially sustainable field i.e. air pollution and the respective measures. The present modeling 
is sketched into two layers to bestow an idea to the readers, learners and researcher about the basic perception about 
air pollution and decision making. In the first layer, the questionnaires are framed to identify the valuable opinion 
for structuring decision making problem surrounded by decision measures. In the second layer, the identified 
decision criterions are evaluated based on DEMATEL technique to disclose important outcomes. An attempt 
towards exploring the theoretical domain of air pollution and its issues are critically addressed in this study. 
Keywords: Decision modeling, DEMATEL, Critical Evaluation, Theoretical Dimensions, Pollution 
1. Introduction:
The study of sustainability has gained momentum thrust over the last two decades (Mani et al., 2014). 
Environmental sustainability is significant and is surrounded by varieties of measures and characterises, which 
requires proper evaluation, awareness and assessment. The same can be achieved by modelling, awareness 
programmes, technological development and automation. Modeling assists in critically reviewing the system 
characteristics (Sahu et al., 2015) and thus, modeling based on double layer features pertaining to air pollution is 
attempted by the authors in this study. A swift towards urbanization are propelling CO2 emissions a chief byproduct 
owing to developed economy (Wang and Zhao, 2018). Additionally, the improvement in life standard are gratifying 
the community towards owning distinguish varieties of private vehicle ownership, which thereby crucially 
increasing the CO2 emissions in the atmospheric zone (Wang and Zhao, 2018; Holešovský et al., 2018). Moreover; 
in long run, evident blow by the consumption of the renewable and non-renewable energy sources are increasing 
emissions (Frey and Linke, 2002; Bilgili et al., 2016). Moreover; it is found that the consumption and exploitation of 
renewable energy mechanism are relatively small as compared with non-renewable energy means.  Accordingly; 
today, there is an emergent need to explore significant literatures under the purview of pollutant, carbon emission, 
energy sources etc. for largely gratifying human needs and deeds (Cerdeira and Moutinho, 2016; Frey and Linke, 
2002).  
The presence of a mixture of solid particles, harmful matters and toxic gases in the ambient air is reviewed 
as air pollution and is generally dangerous to the human beings and other inhabitants (He et al., 2017; Gulia et al., 
2018). The aforesaid are suspended in the atmosphere in the form of emission from vehicles, factories, chemicals 
etc. Gradual and extensive encroachment of the forest area by industrialization, agricultural work, construction 
work, utilization of vehicles etc. are crushing the usual essence of  ecology by produces unwanted dust particle, 
smokes and gases (Devara et al., 2015; Commins et al., 1967; Saha and Padhy, 2011; Sahu et al., 2018a, Rajeevan et 
al., 2018). Due to urbanization people forgot to take care of their environment and spending all time in search of 
healthy environment by avoiding all the important factors, which are essential not for environment as well as for 
them also. Pollution are responsible for causing short term illness as well as long term effects on human health to all

development etc.  Accordingly, an effort towards devising novel technologies for supporting ease production 
processes is the need of present scenario, as the same can results in less emission of detrimental pollutants towards 
environment. The presented study can assists in identifying the most significant dimensions associated with the 
pollution and society. Today’s, urbanization leads towards loading a vast dimensions of inhabitants in a particular 
region and fiscal expansion are pleasing consumers with the opportunity to acquire more energy consuming stuffs 
such as vehicles, household items etc. for coziness and attractiveness. Thus, it is required to be reacted by urban 
planning and development authorities towards devising effectual policies, strategies and means for maintaining and 
reducing elevated traffic for the sake of improving air quality. Growth in population is found as the first significant 
measures in the presented work, which is followed by deforestation and agricultural expansion as the second and 
third significant measures respectively. Moreover, mining operations and activities is found as least significant 
measure in the presented decision modeling as shown in Figure 3  Accordingly, today’s; there is a need to draft 
cluster of strategies including legal and motivational to react towards the problem of population growth amongst 
others for sustainable development and healthy surroundings.

Abstract 
In today’s competitive global environment, industries manufacture different types of products to fulfill market 
demands. This results into a number of diversified processes to be performed in industries. These processes are 
performed on different machines to produce a final product. So, a need arises for proper arrangement of machines in 
the workplace. For this, plant layout is an effective tool for allocating different machines to a different location. The 
main objective of plant layout is to provide smooth workflow throughout the facility.  In this paper, a new model of 
the process type of plant layout is provided with an aim of minimizing the total material flow cost by reducing the 
unnecessary movement between the machines. The genetic algorithm is suggested to compute allocations of 
machines and estimation of cost incurred in the layout. Finally, a numerical illustration is discussed for reducing the 
material flow cost to prove the efficacy of the proposed model.

1. Introduction 
The prime objective of any manufacturing industry is to maximize profit margins and at the same time, reduce costs. 
So, the function of production plays a key role in the success of the organization. For achieving efficient production 
and service systems, along with optimal planning and policies, there is a need of a well designed plant layout. 
Optimal Design of plant layout plays an important role not only in the initial stages, but also has a great influence at 
the later stage.  It has a wide impact on productivity; work in process, manufacturing lead time, material handling 
cost and on other areas of operation Pillai et al. (2011). In general, the plant layout problem is concerned with 
reduction of material flow/handling cost. Since, material handling cost is one of the major costs incurred in 
production, which can contribute up to 20-50% of operating costs Chan et al. (2004). Material handling is a non-
value adding activity. The efficiency of a plant can be increased by reducing such non-value activities. 
 
Plant layout is a study which deals with the location and arrangement of different machines/facilities within a 
stipulated area in order to achieve greatest coordination and efficiency of 4M’s (Men, Material, Machines and 
Methods) in a plant. Layout planning is a complex activity involving optimization of positions of machines and 
workstations. The objective of a good plant layout is to minimize material handling and movement of work from one 
department to the next.   
 
There are different types of plant layout which are applicable in different industries according to their requirement. 
In this study, the problem is considered based on the process type of plant layout. The process layout can 
accommodate a variety of products. This requires a greater flexibility in production, thus allowing industries to 
fulfill a wide range of customer’s demands. In this type of layout, machines are arranged according to the nature or 
type of operations performed for manufacturing purpose. Each product has a definite sequence of operations, not

The total material handling cost is calculated based on the allocations for each of the planning period. The 
corresponding percentage reduction in the proposed layout cost compared to the initial layout cost is obtained as 
described in table 9. 
 
The result shows that for a fourth planning period, there is the maximum reduction in cost, i.e. 28.95%, whereas, the 
overall reduction in cost by considering all planning periods is achieved as 25.46%.  
 
5. Conclusion: 
In this work, a method for process type plant layout is proposed with the aim of reducing total material handling 
cost. Since material handling cost is one of the major contributors in increasing the cost of production. A robust 
layout procedure is developed for dynamic environment, where different demand scenarios are considered. Robust 
layout is fixed for different planning periods. This is being clearly shown in numerical illustration. Genetic 
algorithm (GA) solver is employed in MATLAB for optimizing the proposed process type plant layout. Further, 
result shows that the proposed method is able to reduce material handling cost significantly. This proposed method 
can further be applied to similar situations in industries with some or little modification. This work can be further 
extended by considering numerous decisive factors for the cost and constraints of floor area for similar types of 
small or large scale industries.

Abstract 
Recently, there has been an increased usage of NiTi shape memory alloys in biomedical and other industrial 
applications due to their special properties such as shape memory effect, superelasticity, and high strength to density 
characteristics etc. But, due to their poor machinability, the advanced processes are being explored for their 
successful machining i.e. better machinability. This paper reports a part of research conducted on the machining of 
Ni55.8Ti by wire electric discharge cutting (WEDC). In the Taguchi L16 orthogonal array based experimental study, 
four important WEDC parameters namely gap voltage, pulse on-time, off-time and wire feed rate have been varied 
and their effects are analyzed on micro-hardness (which is an important machinability indicator) of the shape 
memory alloy specimen. ANOVA and Taguchi based optimization of WEDC parameters has also been done to 
secure the best value of the micro-hardness.

1. Introduction and Literature Survey
Shape memory alloys are special materials possess unique properties that make them suitable for various 
precision, industrial, and biomedical applications [1]. Ni55.8Ti is a type of nickel titanium shape memory alloys and 
has biomedical use such as in orthodontics and orthopedic implants etc. This material possesses properties such as 
shape memory effects, superelasticity, and high hardness.  But, it is considered as difficult-to-machine (DTM) 
material and its machining by conventional processes is challenging that result in poor machinability, escalated cost, 
and high environmental footprints etc. It compels to explore new ways to machine these materials for improved 
machinability and sustainability. 
Wire electric discharge cutting (WEDC) also known as wire-EDM or wire spark erosion machining is an 
advanced machining process and works on the principle of thermo-electric erosion [2]. It has been used for the 
machining of difficult-to-machine materials and has good track records with improved machinability of these 
materials. An extensive literature review has been done on WEDC of various materials and discussed here as under. 
Al7075/SiC composite was machined by Rao [3] for exploring the multi-quality characteristics 
optimization using WEDM. To resolve optimization problem, numerous analysis were used such as hybrid approach 
of Taguchi, grey relational and principal component analysis. It was examined that range of process parameters was 
affected because of size and percentage of reinforcement.  Yan et al. [4] used aluminum particles for machining of 
Al6061. It has been examined that suitable choice of controlled variable is essential because aluminum composite 
wire-breakage was significant phenomenon during processing. To control the wire-breakage essential requirement 
were low wire-tension, great wire velocity and high flushing rate. Karabulut et al. [5] used mixed L18 orthogonal 
array to study AL6061/B4C composite with control variables of WEDM.  It has been examined that surface quality 
of composite is good with low value of peak current. Sharma et al. [6] treated the NiTi alloy and consider 
dimensional shift, cutting rate and surface roughness response variables to explore the optimal setting of the process 
parameters. It has been observed that un-machined area and white layer affects the shape memory effect. Magabe et

value of micro-hardness and is computed by using Table 2 and Table 5. The estimated mean of the micro-hardness 
can be investigated as: 
µHv = A1+ B1 + C4- 2 (T)    
 
 
 
 
 
(1) 
Where,T  = overall mean of microhardness = 2.163 Hv  
Mean value was computed from Table 2, and the values of A1, B1 and C4 are taken from Table 5 
A1= Mean value of microhardness at the first level of gap-voltage = 466 Hv 
B1= Mean value of microhardness at the first level of on-time =389.2Hv 
C4 = Mean value of microhardness at the forth level of off-time= 465.5Hv 
After putting values of A1, B1 and C4, equation 1 becomes, 
  
µHv 
=  466.0+389.2+465.5– 2 (496.935)   = 326.83Hv                                                
             
The interval at 95% of confidence level can be predicted and given as: 
CICE     = ± 47.46 , and CIPOP   = ± 26.19 
Therefore, range for confirmation experiments and population is given as: 
Mean µHv - CICE < µHv  < Mean µHv + CICE          i.e.           279.37 < µHv <374.29 
Mean µHv – CIPOP  < µHv < Mean µHv + CIPOP    i.e.           300.64 < µHv < 353.02 
 
Validation (confirmation) experiment has been performed to check the result regeneration at suggested optimal 
setting of process parameters. Table 6 shows the results of validation experiments. It is clear from the Table 6 that 
experimental value falls in the values predicted from confidence interval. It is to note that at optimum setting, the 
value of wire feed rate is selected at first level i.e. 3 m/min, as suggested by the S/N ratio (before pooling) plot given 
in Fig. 2.

4. Conclusions 
In the present work, Ni55.8Ti alloy is machined by WEDC at different process parameter combinations and 
various machinability indicators including micro-hardness have been investigated. Following conclusions can 
be drawn from the work reported in this paper- 
 
1. Low levels of gap-voltage and on-time and high level of off-time favour the micro-hardness and makes it 
equivalent to the hardness of base material.  
2. On-time has the maximum contribution on the microhardness followed by gap voltage and off-time. Wire 
feed rate is a non-significant parameter as compared to other input parameters. 
3. The optimal setting of process parameter is voltage: 20V; pulse-on time: 0.35µs and pulse-off time: 24µs 
for the best value i.e. 316.23 Hv of micro-hardness of Ni55.8Ti alloy.  
4. WEDC process has the potential to machine difficult-to-machine materials such as Ni55.8Ti, and can be 
explored further to investigate the other machinability indicators and other materials.

Abstract 
Stainless steel has numerous applications in medical, engineering and industrial fields. It is recognized as difficult to 
machine (DTM) material. Conventional machining is challenging and also environmentally-unfriendly. Therefore, 
in the present work, SS304 has been attempted to machine using coated carbide tools under dry environment. This 
paper reports the investigation conducted on analysis of the effects of machining parameters such as cutting speed, 
feed rate, and depth of cut on productivity (material removal rate) and surface quality (average surface roughness); 
and optimization of machining parameters for the best values of these machinability indicators. Taguchi L9 
orthogonal array based experimentation has been done. ANOVA has also been conducted to verify the statistical 
fitness and significant parameters. Grey relational technique has been used for optimization. Dry machining of 
SS304 at optimum combination of machining parameters i.e. cutting speed: 70m/min; feed: 0.1mm/rev; depth of cut: 
1mm resulted in the optimized values of machinability indicators i.e. material removal rate- 116.67 mm3/s and 
average surface roughness- 1.99 µm.

1. Introduction
Stainless steel 304 is used in various biomedical, marine, automobile, precision manufacturing and chemical 
processing applications. It possesses special properties such as excellent corrosion resistance, biocompatibility, and 
good recrystallization [1-3]. In order to manufacture parts and components to be used in the aforementioned 
applications, stainless steel has to undergo extensive machining operations. Conventional machining of stainless 
steel is challenging due to its high work-hardening, low thermal conductivity and high toughness properties [4]. It 
results in poor work surface quality, extreme tool wear, and high consumption of energy etc. These overall results in 
high consumption of cutting fluids, escalated machining cost and environmental footprints. Machining without 
coolant or lubricant i.e. dry machining which is the environmentally-benign machining technique can be a good and 
affordable substitute of the conventional wet/flood cooling based machining to enhance the machinability of 
stainless steels. Coated carbide tools can also effectively contribute in that [5]. 
Material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness are two most important machinability indicators that determine 
productivity and surface quality respectively. It is always desirable to achieve high productivity along with good 
surface quality. For that machining at optimum parameters is required to be done specifically for a particular 
material. It requires significant analysis and optimization efforts.  
There have been some past attempts made by the researchers to optimize the machining parameters and machining 
performances for various DTM materials [6-8]. But, SS304 machining requires some more exploration to find novel 
ways of machining at optimum conditions. In the present work, an attempt has been made to optimize the machining 
parameters (CS, f and DoC) according to the response variable (MRR and Ra) simultaneously using Taguchi and 
Grey relational analysis.

and Ra as the major responses. The following conclusions can be drawn from this work-

Abstract 
NiTi shape memory alloys are gaining wider importance due to their unique characteristics of super-elasticity, high 
strength, corrosion resistance, and shape recovery etc. that are very useful in various precision, scientific, and 
biomedical applications. They undergo extensive machining for production of parts to be used in the aforementioned 
applications. Conventional machining of shape memory alloys is challenging and new ways are being explored for 
enhanced machinability. In the present work, the Ni55.8Ti alloy has been machined by wire electric discharge cutting 
(WEDC) process and its machinability has been investigated. This paper mainly presents the analysis of the effect of 
WEDC parameters on recast layer thickness of the machined Ni55.8Ti alloy and optimization of process parameters 
for the minimum possible thickness of the recast layer. A total of 16 experiments have been conducted based on 
Taguchi L16 robust design of experiment technique with variation of four important WEDC parameters such as 
voltage, pulse-on time, pulse-off time, and wire feed rate at 4 levels each. ANOVA study has also been done, and 
pulse-on time has been found the most significant parameters affected recast layer thickness. The optimization of 
WEDC parameters resulted in very thin recast layer of <6 µm.

1. Introduction and Literature Survey
Nowadays, the shape memory alloys are given considerable importance to replace other materials used in
precision, scientific, and biomedical applications. Shape memory effect, pseudoelasticity, biocompatibility,
excellent corrosion resistance and high strength etc. are some of the outstanding features that make NiTi shape
memory alloys so special for the aforementioned applications [1, 2]. Ni55.8Ti is one of the Ni rich shape
memory alloys which find extensive biomedical applications [3]. A comprehensive review of literature based on
past work reveals that the conventional machining of these types of difficult-to-machine materials is extremely
challenging and to achieve good machinability, it takes high cost, energy and resource consumption and high
environmental footprints. Wire-EDM or wire electric discharge cutting (WEDC) which is an advanced
machining process and an important variant of electric discharge machining works on the principle of
thermoelectric erosion can be a good substitute of conventional machining for shape memory alloys. In WEDC,
a travelling conductive wire is used as an electrode (cathode) and material removal takes place due to the
generation of spark between wire electrode and workpiecec (anode) when it is connected to a source of voltage
under the influence of suitable dielectric fluid [4].
There have been some recent attempts on machinability enhancement of NiTi and other shape memory alloys
by WEDC type advanced process which are briefly discussed here as under.
Magabe et al. [2] investigated the consequence of input variables (servo voltage, pulse on-time, pulse off time
and wire feed rate) on MRR and surface roughness (SR) for WEDC of NiTi alloy. It was observed that
optimization is only solution to maximizing MRR and minimizing surface roughness. A detailed effect of

Optimization 
It has been observed from the response table (Table 7) that first level of gap voltage (20V), first level of on-time 
(0.35µs) and forth level of off-time (24 µs) suggests the minimum recast layer thickness value. The confidence 
interval for the confirmation experiments and population can be predicted using Table 2 and Table 7 values as: 
µRCL = A1+ B1 + C4- 2 (T)   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(1)   
Where,T  = average value of RCL as computed from Table 2 = 13.51  
The values of A1, B1 and C4 are selected from Table 7 
A1= Average value of RCL at the first level of gap-voltage = 12.190 µm 
B1= Average value of RCL at the first level of on-time =8.425 µm 
C4 = Average value of RCLat the forth level of off-time= 12.430 µm 
After putting values of A1, B1 and C4, equation 1 becomes, 
  
µRCL 
=  12.190+8.425+12.430– 2 (13.51)   =  6.025µm                                               
 
             
The interval at 95% of confidence level can be predicted and given as: 
CICE     = ± 0.902 , and CIPOP   = ± 0.559 
Therefore, range for confirmation experiments and population is given as: 
Mean µRCL - CICE < µRCL  < Mean µRCL + CICE          i.e.          5.123 < µRCL  <6.927 
Mean µRCL – CIPOP  < µRCL < Mean µRCL + CIPOP    i.e.           5.466 < µRCL < 6.584 
 
In order to verify the aforementioned, a validation experiment has been conducted. The experimental value of recast 
layer thickness obtained is quite close to its predicted value found by optimization (see Table 8). It is to note that at 
optimum setting, the value of wire feed rate is selected at third level i.e. 9 m/min, as suggested by the S/N ratio 
(before pooling) plot given in Fig. 2. Hence the optimization has been done successfully and the lowest value, as 
desired, of the recast layer thickness is 5.86 µm.

4. Conclusions 
The following conclusions can be drawn from the present work: 
  
1. Low discharge energy parameter setting decreases the recast layer thickness value. 
2. Pulse-on time has maximum influence (88.77%) on recast layer thickness followed by gap-voltage (6.97%)

Abstract 
5S is widely known to be most effective in most industries especially in manufacturing sectors. This paper reports 
on the effectiveness of implementing 4S in a machine shop. The mentioned 4S are namely; Seiri, Seiton, Seiso and 
Seiketsu. The 4S are Japanese terms which are translated in English as Sort, Set-in-order, Shine and Standardize. 
The purpose of this paper is to implement the 4S technique to standardize, improve the working conditions as 
productivity will improve. As well, to implement the 4S as a continuous improvement technique or tool to improve 
and promote the machine shop. This study evaluates the conditions of the machine shop from before and after 
implementing 4S with the use of pictorials. The use of pictorials is another new method of a research tool. Data 
collection method and the effectiveness of 4S are based on the observations made, when a person is examined 
through a time study searching for a single tool until found. These observations and times are conducted and 
recorded before and after 4S is implemented at the machine shop. Collected data on before and after 
implementation, resulted in greater space utilization, eliminated abnormalities, improved productivity, improved 
efficiency as time is saved, and pleasant working space.

1. Introduction
The 5S is a Japanese technique or rather method of creating and maintaining a well-organized, clean, effective, safe 
and efficient working environment (Michalska and Szewieczek, 2007). This paper focuses on the implementation of 
4S of the 5S as it is commonly known. The efficiency and improved working conditions of any industry and 
organization can be achieved successfully by applying the concept of 4S. The 4S is also a philosophy that focuses on 
simplification of work environment, effective workplace organization, and reduction of waste, while improving 
safety, quality, and conditions. It allows the enhancement of efficiency and productivity (Chavan et.al, 2017). The 
4S engages people through the use of standards and discipline (Maidhili and Meenambika, 2010). 4S is not just for 
housekeeping as perceived, it is more than that of following the standards and discipline to manage the organization. 
This paper explores the 4S in machine shop for the purpose of simplifying its conditions. The effectiveness of this 
4S is examined through observations of time recorded, before and after implementing 4S. The efficiency on saving 
time is the scale which the desired results are attained from. The 4S technique is a structured program used to 
systematically achieve total organization tidiness and standardization in the workplace.

5. Conclusions 
After 4S implementation, it is observed that the workshop area is clean, free from any hazards, improved 
working environment and conditions, well organized offices, efficiency has improved, and well secured locations for 
tools, materials and equipment. Moreover, increased space utilization has been achieved through proper placements. 
Efficiency to save time when searching for any tool or other item has shown significant improvement after 
implementing Seiri, Seiton, Seiso and Seiketsu (4S). Before implementation, it took approximately more than 4 
minutes to search and find a tool and just higher to 7 minutes 40 seconds until a tool is found. It was quite 
challenging to gather data before implementing 5S, because everything was unorganized. Before 5S was 
implemented it usually took 218.5 minutes (Total Time) which equals the efficiency of 76.48% in a random week, 
these results are detrimental to the efficiency of saving time. After 5S implementation, a gradual decrease to 80.78 
minutes on Total Time Observed, which equals the efficiency of 28.30% as, this is an achievement and objective 
attained. That is the difference of 137.72 minutes saved in a week. After Total Time Observed is achieved, Time 
Saving Efficiency has been achieved as anticipated from a disappointing 76.48% before to a 28.30% after 
implementation. That is a satisfying decrease of 48.18%.  
It proves the effectiveness of 4S of 5S implementation in a machine shop of mechanical workshop.

Abstract 
Shitsuke is the last S or rather last phase of the 5S. It is to maintain discipline prior to the previous Ss which are 
Seiri, Seiton, Seiso and Shitsuke. This paper reconnoiters Shitsuke for sustenance in a mechanical workshop. The 
purpose of this paper is to report on implementstion of Shitsuke for continuous improvement in the mechanical 
workshop of University of Johannesburg. The proposed strategies will be the root of sustenance so that the other 4Ss 
are well maintained, are preserved for prolonged time in years, and maintain the culture of the workshop. The aim of 
this study is to implement and use strategies to maintain Shitsuke, thereafter, maintaining discipline and culture in 
the workshop. It is through these strategies that the workshop and the 5S culture will have new perspectives. The 
newly cultured workshop shows more discipline and standardized workplace. Orderliness and suave operations are 
the greatest results by far. In a developed checklist which is a data collection technique to check and collect 
effectiveness of 5S and Shitsuke. Efficiency and effectiveness of the workshop through sustenance is the ultimate 
goal attained.

1. Introduction
The last S out of the 5S is “Shitsuke” a Japanese term meaning “Sustain”. Shitsuke stresses on making a habit of 
accurately maintaining the right procedures. Sustaining a workshop involves setting new standards as well. The 
continuous success of implementing Shitsuke starts with “self-discipline” from an individual so that it escalates to 
the workplace. Becker (2001) confirms that self-discipline has much to do with forming favorable “habits” or 
“common behaviors” and maintaining them in the long run. With Shitsuke, the actions and behaviors of employees 
towards the workshop reveal a lot about “self-discipline” and discipline towards the workshop. To instill 
organizational culture in a workshop, the employees have to be well trained, equipped and provided with full view 
training on 5S and on its Shitsuke stage. This paper brings the attention of implementing continuous strategies to 
firm sustenance. These strategies account both the employee and the workshop. Ramdass (2015) also confirms that 
commitment from everyone is crucial so that the rewards of program are gained. This paper presents Shitsuke as a 
tool and technique for quality and productivity improvement, which will also lead to increased employee 
engagement and participation, improved work environment and enhanced performance.

5. Conclusion  
 
Implementing 5S at the workshop has proved to be manageable and easy, with the help from employee participation. 
The 5S as tool is implemented for the first time at the mechanical workshop. A lot is achieved other than set 
objectives. Firstly, the workshop area is clean, free from any hazards, improved working environment and 
conditions, well organized workshop, and well secured locations for tools, materials and equipment. Moreover, 
space utilization has been achieved through proper placements. Implementing Quality Circles has shown greater 
improvements because everyone who uses the workshop is able to voice out, suggest and co-operate with fellow 
employees. The essence of implementing Quality Circles in the workplace has shown greater results in a sense that 
everyone is involved and participated. Implementation of Shitsuke for continuous improvement and to sustain with 
5S implementation has been successfully done with proper training, making cleaning schedules, effectively utilising 
tools such as Poke-Yoke, Kanban, and Quality Circles. Positive feedback from the stakeholders via checklist and in 
the form of radar chart proved the success and effectiveness of 5S implemented in mechanical workshop of 
University of Johannesburg.

Abstract 
 
The industry faces more and more the challenge of deploying and taking advantage of evidence-based 
strategic decisions to enhance profit gain. In this research, the possibility of having a fully integrated system 
composed by a simulator and an IoT platform with the capability of collecting real-time data from the shop 
floor and returning performance indicators to support decision making is evaluated. The suggested approach 
involves a Manufacturing Executing System (MES) producing a production schedule, an IoT Platform 
composed by a message broker and a real-time database, a Simulator including simulation software and a 
wrapper, and a user application serving as an interface between the user and the IoT Platform and Simulator 
integrated system. A detailed analysis of the functionalities and integration of the Simulator and the IoT 
Platform will also be explored. To evaluate the approach, one use case of a production line in the automotive 
industry is used. The application of the integrated IoT Simulation system permits its validation and 
consequent future work.

Figure 5. Simio simulation model of the use case  
IoT platform application 
Based on the architecture designed, Kafka and MongoDB were chosen to play the role of IoT Message Broker and 
IoT Event Repository, respectively. In Kafka, the connections defined in the approach were built. Because of 
confidentially policies, MongoDB, functioning as real-time event repository, were fed with fictional data. 
To ensure the communication and integration between Simio and this platform, another wrapper was created between 
Kafka and MongoDB, including Kafka and MongoDB libraries and connectors.  
The integration of Simio with Kafka and MongoDB was also implemented following the next steps: 
• 
The simulation wrapper connected to the simulation model input data and to Kafka is executed and stays 
connected; 
• 
One request of data is sent from the simulation wrapper to Kafka, specifying the topic of the message as 
Simulator-MongoDB-Request; 
• 
The wrapper connected to the IoT Event Repository handles the request from Kafka and returns a message 
containing the data with the topic MongoDB-Simulator-Response; 
• 
The simulation wrapper receives the message with the data and inserts it in the Excel file with a predefined 
structure of input data; 
• 
The simulation wrapper calls Simio model to run; 
• 
Simio opens with the input data updated and allows the user to run the model, and presents dashboards with 
the KPIs.    
 
5. Conclusions 
This research presents an integrated system composed by Industrial IoT and Simulation to support decision making in 
the industry sector. The advantage of this approach is to have a fully integrated system capable of connecting two 
worlds, the physical and the virtual one. Besides that, it also allows the automatic insertion of real-time data on 
simulation models using an IoT platform. This means that the simulation models can be fed more quickly without 
wasting human resources on data exchanges.   
The implementation to the use case was considered fundamental to check the followed approach applicability. It was 
chosen specific software, Simio to model the production line and Kafka and MongoDB to represent the IoT platform. 
To accomplish the full integration two wrappers were also defined. The success of the technical approach 
implementation permits its validation and enforces the usability of this kind of approach as the future of the industry 
companies in order to support their decisions. 
As future work, a deep analysis, containing comparison of a real use case in its “as is” state and with the proposed 
approach integrated, is considered fundamental to explore the gains in terms of key performance indicators of its 
manufacturing processes.

Abstract 
Biogas production by anaerobic digestion is matured technology. The biogas production is widely used worldwide. 
The biogas is commonly used for the direct combustion. Usage of biogas for the production of electricity is still in 
developing stage. The work is required to use the biogas technology for the power generation. In biogas plants the 
conversion of biomass to biogas depends on the number of micro organisms. The number of micro organisms 
depends on the power of hydrogen (PH) of the Slurry in the digester. The PH of the digester is monitored by 
microcomputer. The PH is regulated by adding the acidic medium or base medium to the slurry of digester. The 
biogas power generation plant the use of biogas is needed to be regulated. Therefore the   flow of biogas is 
monitored and regulated according to the load condition on the generator. The biogas flow is regulated with help of 
microcomputer.

of devices (appliances) which switch on and off independently. By a sophisticated analysis of the current and 
voltage waveforms of the total load, the NALM estimates the number and nature of the individual loads, their 
individual energy consumption, and other relevant statistics such as time-of-day variations. No access to the 
individual components is necessary for installing sensors or making measurements. This can provide a very 
convenient and effective method of gathering load data compared to traditional means of placing sensors on each of 
the individual components of the load. The aim of this project is to create a small scale prototype WiFi network 
integrated with IOT platform for NALM data gathering by developing a smart extension for load connection.

Abstract 
 
All organizational activities, especially production activities, have to be consolidated in new premises for a supply 
chain of particular products to be competitive in a globalization market.  Production Part Approval Process (PPAP) is 
a second-party approval process, as well as a part of the consolidating mechanism, conducted by a manufacturing 
company on its suppliers to ensure quality of parts from these suppliers.  On the other hand, Production Assessment 
such as Total Productivity Management (TPM) is a third-party approval process, also a part of the consolidating 
mechanism, to endorse the production and process capacity of the suppliers.  To avoid repetitive resource investment 
of the suppliers on these approval processes, this study proposes a three-phase approach called PPAP-QFD in an 
attempt to integrate requirements from both PPAP and Production Assessment, and then outline necessary 
improvement methods to meet these requirements via Quality Function Deployment (QFD).  A real-world case study 
utilizing PPAP-QFD is presented to demonstrate how this approach can continuously improve production capacity 
and ensure product quality.

1. Introduction 
 
In global competition era, product quality is a key factor for the success of a manufacturing company and its suppliers.  
Production Part Approval Process (PPAP) is an approval process conducted by a manufacturing company on its 
suppliers to ensure quality of parts from these suppliers.  Not until suppliers meet PPAP requirements can they supply 
parts to the manufacturing company.  In the meantime, with continuous improvement, suppliers may also seek external 
assessment on their production management systems.   PPAP requirements are classified by 5 levels (AIAG 2006), 
unless requested by customers, the default level is 3 for all suppliers, that is, Part Submission Warrant (PSW) with 
product samples and complete supporting data.  It is a suitable tool and have many positive side effects too from better 
documentation and communication to cooperation with suppliers in developing new product (Hermans and Liu 2013).  
Effective implementation of PPAP will help the supply chain to improve the quality of the product, reduce the cost by 
optimal use of resources and maintain on time delivery at competitive cost (Khanna 2005).  For PPAP, a process with 
inter-correlated activities, to be effective, Rewilak and Tokaj (2012) proposed four concepts based on the Taguchi loss 
function.  They suggested guidelines based on observed correlations between PPAP effectiveness indicators and 
manufacturing process performance indices should be developed.  Meanwhile, Dai and Blackhurst (2012) proposed a

4. Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
All organizational activities, especially production activities, have to be consolidated in new premises for a supply 
chain of particular products to be competitive in a globalization market.   Both PPAP and Production Assessment are 
part of the consolidating mechanism.  However, repetitive resource investment on these approval processes would 
hinder the progress of the supplier toward global competitiveness.  This study proposes a three-phase approach called 
PPAP-QFD in an attempt to integrate requirements from both PPAP and Production Assessment, and then outline 
necessary improvement methods to meet the eighteen requirements of PPAP via QFD.  A real-world case study 
utilizing PPAP-QFD is presented to demonstrate how a company can apply this approach to continuously improve 
production capacity and guarantee product quality delivered by the supplier.  It is recommended that a simplified 
version of this PPAP-QFD approach and a software program, such as the approach adopted by Moubachir and Bouami 
(2015), can be developed in the future for its more successful implementation.

Abstract  
 
Plagiarism has been a phenomenon on which various investigations have been carried out, some of them general and 
others more specific, trying to measure its existence in specific areas of knowledge. Although plagiarism is legally a 
crime, the analysis of this phenomenon must go beyond the position from the law, and necessarily transcend to the 
academic field. In this sense, the role of universities is of vital importance because it is in their bosom where the 
greatest opportunities for students not to respect copyright take place, either because they do not know the scope of 
this action or because it is the easiest and fastest way to fulfill the academic commitments of their training process. 
This research seeks, through an exploratory analysis, to establish the position of universities in Colombia, both from 
the regulatory aspect and from the implications that plagiarism has in the process of training professionals in this 
country. For this purpose, the official databases of the Ministry of National Education and the contents published by 
the institutions in their web pages were used, which, in most cases, are public access. 
  
Keywords: plagiarism, academic fraud, universities in Colombia, student regulation, university plagiarism. 
 
Introduction 
 
Plagiarism has become one of the most frequent forms of academic fraud in universities and higher education 
institutions around the world, making an even greater impact on areas other than academia, such as politics and 
economics, with resignation or dismissal of important dignitaries of different governments, in different parts of the 
world.  
 
One of the elements that best favors the commission of plagiarism is the technological development, and with it, the 
facility to access not only academic content that is available on the web, regardless of the author, the language or the 
magazine in in which it has been published, this in the case of being a scientific document.  
 
Free online translators offer the option of translating texts from one language into another, eliminating the possibility 
of detecting the highest number of cases of plagiarism, despite the existence of specialized programs that establish the 
percentage of equivalence between one text and another, or others that have been previously published.

On the other hand, it is well known that the oldest institutions consider that plagiarism is a misconduct with a high 
level of severity, above those that have less time in the market, as shown in Table 7. While the institutions with more 
than 40 years of existence consider that plagiarism is a major or very serious misconduct in 64%, this percentage 
decreases according to seniority to 42%, 34%, and 26% inasmuch as the institution has been fewer years in operation.

Similarly, Table 8 shows that the institutions with greater seniority are harder with the punishment, the percentage of 
those that consider expulsion as the appropriate punishment for plagiarism decreases considerably from 18%, passing 
to 13%, and 9%, reaching 0% in those that have been offering higher education programs for a few years.

8. Conclusions 
 
The results of this research show that plagiarism has a different treatment depending on the conditions of higher 
education institutions. There are significant differences according to the level of training they provide, the fact of 
having or not institutional accreditation of high quality, the public or private sector to which they belong to, and the 
seniority of the institution. 
 
As an important conclusion, it was found that in a high percentage, institutions have not defined the seriousness of 
plagiarism as a misconduct or the sanction that it entails. Thus, this vagueness leads to a high level of subjectivity in 
the assessment of the level of the misconduct and in the punishment to be imposed, with the aggravating circumstance

that, in the same institution, the people who judge the misconducts are not always the same because the case is judged 
by a specific faculty or program without institutional guidelines for the decision to be made. 
In their same process of maturation, which leads to more seniority, institutions change the level of training in their 
natural development, and seek for the adjustment to high quality standards, making them more demanding in the 
valuation of plagiarism as a misconduct and in the scope of the punishment, being a high percen tage those that 
contemplate the highest sanctions for the commission of plagiarism: the student's temporary suspension and the 
expulsion. 
This study deserves to continue in two stages, the following stage where one should inquire about the existence of 
plagiarism prevention plans such as awareness campaigns, outreach programs, etc., that are institutionally developed 
by the institutions that are the object of the analysis, and another stage in which the institutions establish the amount 
of plagiarism detected, the management given to it, and the sanction imposed in the case it happens.  
Similarly, the analysis of these same variables in other countries can be very important insofar as it allows to 
establish comparisons that can be analyzed in light of the social conditions of each place in which the study is 
carried out.

Abstract 
Fashion industry is highly dependent on natural resources, being of high environmental concern 
since those materials are consumed  in high frequency and disposability to produce, distribute 
and to maintain its products. The adoption of Product-Service Systems (PSS) can provide to 
industry a mechanism to increase factors such as product quality and longevity, while providing 
alternative consumption models that reduce environmental impact. In this context, the purpose of 
this paper is to identify the existing models of PSS in the literature applied on fashion industry, 
its characteristics, and sustainable potential. Content analysis of 24 articles was performed, 
which are discussed according to the feasibility of operation and its environmental impact. There 
were identified 11 types of PSS applied in fashion industry and 7 types of green practices were 
observed in the models examined.

1. Introduction
According to MGFI (2018), the fashion industry encompasses six groups consisting of clothing, footwear, 
sportswear, handbags and luggage, watches and jewellery, and other accessories. The MGFI (2018) also discusses 
the unsustainability on the mode of production and using in the segment, the growing of Asian market and 
interconnectivity worldwide. 
In 2018, the sector expects moderate growth (between 3.5-4.5%), mainly driven by emerging markets in Asia, 
Europe and Latin America and sales from fast fashion segment (growth of 20% in the last 3 years). The demand in 
this area includes products with short life cycle and intensive use of material to meet the needs of high-volume 
clients and emphasis on diversified products (Armstrong et al., 2015; MGFI, 2018). 
In addition, there is a growing consumer interest in more sustainable products as shown by 65% of emerging market 
consumers actively sought sustainable fashion in 2016 (MGFI, 2018). This concern demonstrates that environmental

Results have also shown that LCA was more cited in the UO-PSS, which it may be related to the purpose of the 
business model of total product’s usage before its disposal. Those PO-PSS have focused more on the practice of 5Rs 
and they have been more discussed with practical cases of large retailers such as H&M and Boomerang, as they may 
be more affected by regulations (such as the EU Waste program) or could be understood as a marketing activity to 
promote brand value. 
 
In summary, all these aspects indicates that companies that integrate sustainability as business value tend to be more 
concerned about the impact of clothing products. The rent business model was the one with the greatest debate about 
the acquisition of the raw material, production and commercialization of the products (Ræbild, Bang, 2017, Rexfelt, 
Ornas, 2009). After all, a return system driven by a fast-fashion company like H&M is different then a return system 
drive by a rental system committed to higher product quality, such as Vigga, even though both of them offering to 
recycle the fabrics for apparel use (Corvellec, Stål, 2017). 
 
Nevertheless, although there are already green practices in the PSS models implemented, more managerial models 
such as internal environmental management, eco design, and equipment dismantling were not mentioned. This can 
be illustrated due to the characteristics of the current models being recent and less widespread. So, it is possible that 
with the evolution PSS’s models implemented, the green practices will guarantee a greater impact on the evaluated 
businesses. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
The studies that deal with PSS in the fashion industry concentrate their analysis on issues related to the viability of 
the business in the segment (difficulties and opportunities) such as: operationalization, consumer behaviour, and 
production methods applicable to the fashion industry. In this context, this work identified and characterized the 
existing business models of PSS in the fashion industry, as well as its sustainable potential, from the green practices 
perspective. 
 
In this research, 11 PSS practices were found in the fashion industry, such as: manufacturing monitoring, laundry, 
repair and redesign, take-back, participatory customization, make it yourself, consulting, fashion result, clothing 
rental, clothing swamp, and second-hand retail. 
 
The most discussed PSS in the literature was the rent of clothes. Although indirectly discussed, the take-back model 
was also present, being considered the supplier of raw material for other types of PSS such as rent, second-hand 
retail, and repair and redesign. In addition, the literature indicates a trend towards implementation of PSS that do not 
imply greater financial risks for companies such as repair and take-back. 
 
Regarding sustainable potential, studies have shown that PSS models have emerged with a view to sustainability and 
aimed at reducing the residual effect of business impact. The most widespread green practices in the literature were 
life cycle analysis and 5R (especially material recycling). Besides, internal environmental management, eco-design, 
and disassembly of equipment were not quote at any of those publications. The product dematerialization, consumer 
education and the life cycle assessment were arguments used to justify the practical effectiveness of the models in 
relation to economic and environmental benefits. 
 
Finally, the characteristics of current models still encompass more reactive practices, such as recycling and 
remanufacturing, than activities that actually promote the reduction in the use and disposal of garments, although 
there were companies whom already concerned with the circularity of the materials inside of the productive model. 
For this reason, the possibility of new work confronting the theoretical analysis with a practical case are relevante 
and using scenario models to verify the viability and evolution of the types of PSS implemented.

Abstract 
Cooling degree days (CDD) and cooling degree hours (CDH) are the climate correlations generally used in the 
models for building cooling consumption prediction. Both are calculated from the dry bulb temperature and are 
useful in analyses where sensible heat is predominant. In hot and humid climates, the latent heat cannot be 
overlooked. This study developed a new climate indicator that considers both sensible and latent heat. The annual 
cooling demand for a building model was obtained for twenty Brazilian cities using Energyplus®. The CDH value 
for each city was calculated. The enthalpy was used to obtain a climatic indicator, the CEH (cooling enthalpy hours). 
A linear regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the relationship between these indicators values and the 
annual cooling demand. The results showed that the CEH has a stronger relationship with the annual demand of 
cooling. The standard error reduced from 12.11 to 9.50 kWh/m2.year and the coefficient of determination increased 
from 0.9428 to 0.9648. The calculations were expanded to 407 Brazilian cities confirming the good performance of 
the CEH, since the R2 value remained high (0.9459) and the standard error low (11.82 kWh/m2.year). From the 
CEH, eighteen climate zones were suggested to represent the Brazilian climate.

the subject matter has been mostly conducted in developed nations, and for large corporations but SMEs in 
developing countries has received less attention in this area. The primary purpose of this study is therefore to 
investigate most appropriate metrics for SMEs to better help these firms to measure their sustainability performance. 
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 companies’ owners/managers and 23 key stakeholders in 
Vietnam. Thematic analysis was employed to examine the perspectives of participants, highlighting similarities and 
differences, and generating unanticipated insights. This study explored the extent of the use and adoption of 
sustainability pillars (economic, social and environmental) in SMEs. Findings showed that financial interests, 
improving resource efficiency, and corporate image enhancement are key motives driving firms to implement 
sustainability performance measurement. Representatives in different firms also shared views that flexibility and 
agility are main enablers while lack of capabilities is the key inhibitor influencing the selection of appropriate 
sustainability metrics. Our findings therefore suggest that organisational changes are necessary for successful 
implementation of the sustainability measurement practices. This study contributes to the limited research focusing 
on developing metrics for measuring sustainability performance in a developing country context. The study has 
strong implications for both managers and policy makers aiming to improve SMEs’ sustainability performance.

Abstract 
“Czech companies can not sufficiently exploit the potential of the digitalization in combination with Industry 4.0. 
In this respect, foreign companies are a great inspiration because they are much more strategically and 
comprehensively involved in digitization."" This is the conclusion of a study performed by the consultancy company 
EY in a cooperation with the Czech Chamber of Commerce in the summer of 2018.  
To increase the competitiveness of companies in general, there is a need to improve their access to the digitization. 
One of the areas where an emphasis is needed to place is a knowledge management in conjunction with digitalization. 
The knowledge Management is a discipline dealing with the storage, development and transfer of knowledge, 
experiences and information among other members of company. Companies with a perfectly developed process 
of digitization and knowledge transfer have undeniable advantages over others. 
The aim of this paper is to introduce and facilitate understanding of knowledge management issues in conjunction 
with Industry 4.0. The importance of adaptation to the progress made by this concept is shown and explained not only 
by examples from the practice.

Summary 
 
As for the aspects described above related to the development of companies towards Industry 4.0, they are all 
connected with the need to educate and develop the existing competencies of employees. In this area, the state must 
play a major role in initiating education reform and starting to prepare students for a world where machines can be 
done by machines and automatically. The world will move forward and we will get used to the fully-developed 
digital automated operation of the world as well as we have become accustomed to the industrial revolution of the 
previous industrial revolution, without which we can hardly imagine life and industry today. On the foundations of 
Industry 4.0, the germs of another, much more sophisticated technology, which we cannot even imagine today, can 
arise.

Abstract 
In this study, a two-step method for the daily priority-based surgical case scheduling of elective patient of 
non-identical Operating Rooms (OR) is presented. In the first step, we present a mixed integer programming 
model to select patients from the waiting list and to assign the selected patients to the operating room. The 
objectives are to minimize the makespan, undertime and overtime costs simultaneously and maximize the 
weighted sum priority of selected surgeries. After assigning the patients to the ORs, in the second phase, 
the sequence of selected surgeries in the operating room assigned them has been determined by discrete 
event simulation by two dispatching rules including the Shortest Surgery Time based on priority (SST), and 
the Longest Surgery Time based on priority (LST).  Also, the schedules obtained by these two dispatching 
rules are compared with the head surgeon schedule. This research has been performed in one of the surgical 
departments of a public hospital located in Iran.

1. Introduction
The management of Healthcare was changed in the past decade. For example, the age of the patient population and 
their number is growing. In addition, a considerable number of patients is not able to be treated instantly or has a long 
time to wait due to technological restrictions as well as human resource limitations in hospitals. Whereas on another 
side, State Hospital suffers from many financial debts. The manager of the hospital strives to enhance healthcare 
performance and to reduce the cost of healthcare to equilibrate the finances (Wang, 2012, Hamid et al., 2018b). 
The operating room management is important due to the fact that surgeries typically generate around 67% of 
hospital revenues and at least most of the patient visit the department of surgery one time. Therefore, a good 
organization of the day surgery is necessary for the planning and scheduling of the operating room (van Essen et al., 
2012). According to the literature on operating room planning and scheduling provided by Cardoen et al. (2010), in 
the planning problem, the surgeries are firstly assigned to a day and operating room. Then, the sequence of surgeries 
is determined in the assigned day-operating room. 
The duration of surgery involves significant uncertainty. One way to tackle this challenge is the use of the 
simulation. However, simulation by itself is not able to provide many plausible solutions, simulation and optimization 
together can dominate on this constraint. In this study, a mixed method of simulation-based optimization has been 
used in two stages. In the first phase, the planning of the operating rooms is determined by using a mathematical

5.2. Scenario 
We designed three sequencing rules in an attempt to minimize the total waiting time. (Shortest Surgery Time) This 
rule ranked the surgeries in order of the priority in an ascending their duration. The patient had a higher priority (in 
our case 10) scheduled first, and then the patient had a lower priority (in our case 1) scheduled. (Longest Surgery 
Time) This heuristic rule sorted the surgeries which had the same priority in decreasing their duration. The third 
sequence was the head surgeon schedule (which was set by using LPT rule). 
 
5.3. Results 
The results for the total waiting time indicator expressed in hours for three scheduling methods (current schedule 
provided by the head surgeon scheduler and two schedules obtained by the model and SST and LST rules) is shown 
in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows that the schedule obtained by the model. SPT rule is the best, and the actual schedule 
provided by the head scheduler is the worst. The simulation results show that it is possible to reduce the total waiting 
time required to process patients by 8 % when the SST rule is used instead of the current schedule. The second 
Scenario, which is the LST rule, can improve 4% compared with the current schedule.

6. Conclusion 
In this paper, we illustrated a two-step approach to address the daily operating room scheduling problem. The first 
step consisted of assigning the surgical operation to the operating rooms. The second step consisted of sequencing 
operations, which were assigned to an operating room in the previous step. Given the assigning step have been 
presented the mixed model programming. The multi-objective functions were to minimize the makespan, idle & over 
time and to maximize the priority. The second-step considered three Heuristic sequencing rules, which were applied 
to the discrete event simulation model. The simulation model compared the total waiting time of the three heuristics. 
The results showed SST and LST rules outperformed the current schedule which is proposed by the head surgeon.

Abstract 
The selection of suitable biomass is an important stage in the generation of biofuels, which has a significant 
impact on the quality of biofuels. The selection of biomass is a strategic decision and, considering with the 
selection of the raw material for the generation of suitable biomass is influenced by various social, economic 
and environmental factors, it turns into a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. By reviewing 
the literature in this paper, we identify the important criteria of suitable seed oil which includes 16 social, 
economic and environmental criteria and three options for soybean, rapeseed (colza) and cotton for the 
generation of biomass. Then we use a hybrid approach to determine the weight of the criteria and ranking 
the alternatives so we first determine the weight of the criteria using the Best-Worst (BW) method. Then 
we rank with PROMETHEE GAIA method the alternatives and analyze the model.

1. Introduction
Over the past decades, research and development of alternative fuels, including biofuels, has been increased because
of reducing fossil fuels, energy security and the impact that fossil fuels have on the environment, such as greenhouse 
gas emissions. Biofuels are sustainable renewable energy sources that can reduce the environmental impact of fossil 
fuels. Biomass is the primary source of bioenergy and biofuels, bioethanol and biodiesel are among of most important 
biofuels. That this study focuses on biodiesel production. 
After the 1970s oil crisis, many countries started planning to use more biofuels to reduce dependence on fossil fuels 
(Timilsina and Shrestha, 2011), for example, in Iran, according to the perspective document, by the year 2025, 20 
1828","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

We want to interpret the changes by changing the weights. For example, if we increase the weight of standards such 
as food competition, technological development, and knowledge and reduce the weight of startup costs, given that 
these three criteria are in the same way as against the cost criterion. The three criteria are good compared to other 
alternatives. According to the new ranking, cotton is selected as the best alternative, the results of which are shown in 
Figure 7. 
6. Conclusion and Future Research 
In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach of MADM for the biomass selection problem. We used BWM to 
determine the importance of criteria and the PROMRTHEE-II method for ranking options. This new method decreases 
the disadvantages of using these methods, including reducing the weight of criteria in comparison with other methods 
of calculations. The advantages of using this method are the implicit rating of options and the graphical viewing of 
criteria and alternatives on the GAIA page that makes it easily for decision makers to understand the model. Also, we 
have shown in this method that by changing the weight of the criteria, the degree of importance of the alternatives 
varies easily, and it is possible to analyze the sensitivity of the model in this method. We applied this model to the 
biomass selection problem that was selected as the best biomass in early decision making of rapeseed (colza), but by 
changing the importance of cotton criteria, it was chosen as the best biomass. In addition, the proposed model can 
easily be used in other real-world. Given that deterministic numbers are used to show the performance of alternatives 
in the criteria, it is to suggest that fuzzy numbers be used to improve the method to obtain the evaluation matrix.

Abstract 
 
When it comes to Industry 4.0, Augmented Reality (AR) is regularly referenced as the up and coming interface 
innovation for communication and collaboration between humans and machines. Innovative technological advances 
have removed some of the central technological limitations in recent years and AR applications with restricted 
functionality are presently abundant and can be downloaded as applications onto most mobile devices. Although it is 
a key technology development, that promises to change many industries, their utilization is restricted generally to 
entertainment and marketing applications. The use of augmented reality in industrial applications (IAR), is simply 
beginning to wind up progressively. We can understand Augmented Reality technology as an intuitive interface that 
allows us to see through the real and the digital world. Over the direct comparison of real-world objects with virtual 
planning data, planning errors in production environments can be detected faster and more efficiently. The available 
literature of the areas above mentioned will be reviewed in this paper, in order to analyze the underlying challenges 
and the existing technologies involving IAR, in particular in assembly and picking activities.

 1. Introduction 
 
When it comes to Industry 4.0, Augmented Reality (AR) is regularly referenced as the up and coming interface 
innovation for communication and collaboration between humans and machines (Langfinger et al. 2017). Besides the 
use of Computer Aided Design (CAD), utilized to accelerate and advance the development process, virtual and mixed 
reality technologies are being added to the industries (Nolle and Klinker 2006). These technologies were additionally 
created to support human beings, since it is notable that, the significance of human beings as the most noteworthy and 
most valuable production factor is, these days, undisputable. Human beings are portrayed by flexibility, creativity and 
high problem-solving potential (Reinhart and Patron 2003).  Described as a variation of Virtual Reality (VR) 
(Pathomaree and Charoenseang 2005), AR can bolster the human visual sense (Reif and Günthner 2009). To follow 
the purpose of the user to see the virtual information/models (computer graphics, text, sound, etc.) as existing in real-
time, AR endeavors to coordinate that data into de physical environment as existing in real-time (Yuan et al. 2008). 
This combination can be multisensory and might incorporate the improvement of a picture with virtual comments, the 
detection and intensification of sounds, or the utilization of haptic feedback to build touch sensing (Reinhart and 
Patron 2003). AR has numerous conceivable fields of application in industrial environments. Some investigation 
projects use AR applications for development, production and service.  Assembly, maintenance and production 
planning are additionally frequently referenced (Reif et al. 2010). The available literature of the areas above mentioned 
will be reviewed in this paper, in order to analyze the underlying challenges and the existing technologies involving 
IAR. 
 
2. Augmented Reality and Industry 4.0 
 
Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, we can state that industrial productivity has faced dramatic 
increments due to technological advances. As in the present day, we are amidst a change that is fueled by nine primary 
technology advances (Autonomous Robots, Simulation, Horizontal and Vertical System Integration, the Industrial

6. Summary 
 
Developments in the innovative territory of AR are uncommon. From one perspective, innovative work is still in its 
initial days. Then again, the academic and industry accomplices concur that there is colossal potential for the technology 
in a wide assortment of applications. Thus, different endeavors to bring innovative work and research and development 
of AR together have been made and AR is still at the highest priority on the rundown for potential developments. 
 
Broad research has been done worldwide in addressing some of the critical issues in AR technology. Real-time tracking 
and computation are crucial since synchronization between the real and the virtual worlds must be accomplished in the 
briefest conceivable time interim.  
 
AR applications are both hardware and software intensive. Exceptional gear, for example, HMD and accurate trackers 
are required. In spite of the fact that AR has discovered a decent number of uses in design and manufacturing, there are 
few in-depth studies that assess and evaluate human factors and interaction in AR system. The restricted comprehension 
of human factor issues is probably going to hinder widespread adaptation of AR systems beyond laboratory prototypes. 
 
The future of IAR researches should focus on how to technically enhance the modern shop-floor and provide the 
operators with better instruments so as to help them to work optimally and settling on the correct choices.

Abstract 
The current value of the oil price per barrel has severely impacted the oil and gas industry around the world. Apart 
from oil price fluctuation, there are multiple external factors that affect this industry such as oil resources availability, 
high transportation cost, as well as exposure to high uncertainties. In dealing with these external factors, it is crucial 
for the oil and gas practitioner to shift their focus into managing resources and capabilities. This can be conducted 
through performance management. As this industry relies mostly on the supply chain to deliver their services and 
products, it is important to understand the challenges faced by the oil and gas practitioners in managing their supply 
chain. Therefore, this study will explore the challenges in managing supply chain performance in the oil and gas 
industry. Exploratory interviews were conducted with five supply chain experts in the industry. This study has 
identified five main challenges in managing supply chain performance. 
Keywords: Supply chain management, performance management, oil and gas industry, challenges 
1. Introduction
Most industries are now relying on the third party provider to deliver the product and services. The oil and gas industry 
has no exceptions. The oil and gas organisations normally outsource part of their functions to subsectors to minimise 
their operation cost, to overcome the limitation of expertise as well as to pass some of the supply chain risks to another 
party (Ernst and Young 2014) In fact, research suggested that around 40% of oil and gas activities are outsourced to 
accomplish the project (Yusuf et al., 2014; Pillai et al. 2010). The dependency on outsourcing activities makes the 
company focuses more on managing supply chain performance to achieve competitive advantage (Kumar and 
Markeset, 2007; Cai et al., 2009). Despite the considerable amount of research been published on supply chain 
performance management, most of the early study focuses predominantly on the industry that manufacturing discrete 
products (Vonderembse et al., 2006; Ruzita, 2010; Khani and Ahmadi, 2012; Oyedijo and Akewusola, 2012) In fact, 
in one of the review of the literature on supply chain performance from 1999 to 2009, around 80% of the case based 
research focusing on manufacturing industry (Arzu Akyuz and Erman Erkan, 2010). The insights of supply chain 
performance on other industry is worth to be explored (Gunasekaran et al., 2004; Shepherd and Günter, 2006; 
Gunasekaran and Kobu, 2007; Taticchi et al., 2013). The existing research on the oil and gas supply chain largely 
focuses on the downstream oil and gas sector (Varma, Wadhwa and Deshmukh, 2008; Lima, Relvas and Barbosa-
Póvoa, 2016). Even recent research by Abubakar et al. (2016) examined only the financial performance of the 
upstream sector. Moreover, the majority of the research concentrated on designing supply chain performance measures 
(Gunasekaran, Patel and McGaughey, 2004; Varma, Wadhwa and Deshmukh, 2008) and the effectiveness of supply 
chain performance measures (Lucato et al., 2014). Other areas of supply chain performance management are still

Abstract 
The article considers of a single-vendor single-buyer joint pricing and lot size model in which the vendor’s 
production process is imperfect. The market demand is a function of the buyer’s selling price. The vendor’s unit 
production cost is assumed to be a function of lot size of each shipment to the buyer. This paper simultaneously 
determines shipment size, unit selling price of the buyer, vendor’s set-up cost, reliability of the production process 
and total number of shipments per lot from the vendor to the buyer. The expected annual total profit function is 
derived and signomial geometric programming technique is used to find the optimal solutions for different 
preferences of objective functions. The solution procedure is illustrated by a numerical example.

1. Introduction
With the growing focus on supply chain management, company managers today increasingly realize that the greater 
cooperation and better coordination among all the members of a supply chain is more beneficial than those policies 
obtained separately from each member's perspective. Owing to globalization and competitiveness in the market, all 
manufacturing sectors want to produce perfect quality items. This is almost impossible due to several factors such as 
quality of raw materials, efficiency of workers, labor problems, machine breakdowns, etc. Even in stable condition, 
the manufacturing system may produce defective items together with non-defective ones. These defective items may 
be rejected, repaired/reworked or vended at lower price. In this paper, we develop a vendor-buyer integrated supply 
chain model consisting of a vendor and a buyer where the defective items in each lot are rejected at the end of 
buyer's 100% screening process. The demand rate at the buyer side is dependent on the selling price. We consider a 
simple practical situation where the delivery quantity to the buyer at each replenishment is identical. Unit production 
cost is not fixed but discounted with the increase in lot size, which is more realistic in the market. The main 
objectives of this study are to find the answers of the following questions: 
What would be the optimal selling price at the buyer side? What would be the discount price of each defective item 
from the vendor's side? How much quantity would receive by the buyer from the vendor in each replenishment? 
How many shipments are made by the vendor to fulfill the buyer’s demand? 
We organize the paper as follows: Section 2 presents notations and assumptions of the proposed model. Section 3 
deals with literature review. Section 4 formulates the mathematical model. Solution methodology for the developed 
model is discussed in Section 5. Numerical examples are provided in Section 6. The computational results are 
compared with those of Huang's (2004) model in this section. Section 7 summarizes the paper and suggests future 
scopes of research.

From Table 1, we can conclude that customers’ demand and lot size in each replenishment are proportional whereas 
lot size and selling price are complementary; if customers’ demand is high then the buyer’s selling price is low and 
vice-versa. 
 
6.3 Comparison of the optimal results with those of Huang’s (2004) model 
 
To compare the optimal results with those of Huang’s (2004) model, we take α = 0, k = 50000, l = 0, x = 0, y = 0. 
Huang considered the expected number of defective items as 0.02 and hence we consider R = 0.98. We further 
consider Sb = 100, Sv = 300, w = 30. All the remaining parameters P, hv, hb, F, z (it is x in Huang’s model), and d are 
kept unchanged to match with Huang’s model. Comparing these two models, we have the following results: 
For given n, the average total cost of the integrated system is a function of Q only and this function is a convex 
function in Q > 0. We determine the unique value of Q as

With the chosen data set, the optimal results are obtained as n*=7 and Q*=780.21 and the corresponding average 
total cost of the supply chain is 66865.60. Huang (2004) obtained this cost as 67082.60. Hence our model 
outperforms Huang’s (2004) model in terms of average total cost of the whole supply chain. 
 
Now, we consider the model from buyer’s perspective. The buyer’s annual cost is given by

which can be shown to be a convex function in Q(>0). Therefore, there exists a unique value

With the chosen data set, the optimal value of Q is obtained as Q** = 1603.90. Substituting Q** = 1603.90 and n = 1 
into the buyer’s annual cost and the vendor’s annual cost yield the values 33462.7 and 40666.8, respectively (Huang 
obtained these values as 33467.17 and 40881.64, respectively). Hence, there is a cost reduction of (33462.7 + 
40666.8 − 66865.6) =197263 .9 (in Huang’s model, this reduction is 7265 .21) in the integrated approach, which is 
as impressive as Huang’s model. 
 
 
7. Conclusions and Future Research Directions 
 
In this paper, we consider a supply chain model with a single-vendor and a single-buyer where the market demand 
depends on selling price of the product. All items produced by the vendor may not be perfect. The buyer screens all 
the products collected by him/her from the vendor. We optimize the profit of the supply chain with respect to the 
number of shipments, shipment size, buyer’s selling price, the vendor’s setup cost and the discount cost of the 
defective products. We apply signomial Geometrical Programming technique to optimize the profit. We analyze the 
impacts of sales revenue, different costs and profits of the vendor, the buyer and the whole supply chain on the price 
elasticity to demand, lot size elasticity to unit production cost, unit screening cost, scaling constant for demand, 
scaling constant for unit production cost and reliability of the product. 
 
From the numerical study, we observe that lot size dependent unit production cost is more sensitive than constant 
unit production cost. If lot size increases then unit production cost decreases, and hence profit of the vendor 
increases. In real situations, it is impossible to produce all perfect items. The profits of the vendor, the buyer and the 
whole supply chain increase if the vendor produce more reliable items. Also, we investigate that it is necessary for 
the vendor to produce items not more than certain percentage (in our numerical example, 14%) of defective items.

The scaling constant for the demand also acts an important role to increase the profit of the buyer, the vendor and 
the whole supply chain. The price elasticity to demand must maintain the interval which lies between 1 and 3. 
We construct our model similar to any other model, based on a set of assumptions. We have assumed market 
demand as deterministic, which has limited applications in the real world. So, one can consider stochastic demand 
instead of deterministic demand to extend this model for further research. We have assumed two-layer supply chain 
model with a single vendor and a single buyer. Further research can extend the model by considering multi-layer, 
multi-buyer and/or multi-vendor supply chain. The vendor may impose ‘terms and conditions’ when selling the 
defective items with discount price.

Abstract 
 
Additive Manufacturing (AM) is one of the most trending production technologies, with a growing number of 
companies looking forward to implementing it in their processes. Producing through AM not only means that there 
are no supplier lead times needed to account for, but also enables production closer to the end customer, reducing then 
the delivery time. This is especially true for companies with a wide range of low and variable demand products. This 
paper proposes a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the optimal design of supply chains facing the 
introduction of AM processes. In the addressed problem, the 3D printers allocation to distribution centers (DC), that 
will make or customize parts, and the Suppliers- DC-Customers connections for each product need to be defined. The 
model aims at minimizing the supply chain costs, exploring the trade-offs between safety stock and stockout costs, 
and between buying and 3D printing a part. The main relevant characteristics of this model are the introduction of 
stock service levels as decision variables and the use of a linearization of the cumulative distribution function to 
account for demand uncertainty. A real-world problem from a maintenance provider is solved, showing the 
applicability of the model.

6. Conclusions and Future Work 
 
This paper presented a novel mathematical model for the optimization of SCND integrated with inventory 
management, in an AM context. The model was used to address specific problems on the elevator maintenance 
business, but it can be adapted to supply chains on other areas that use AM.  
The proposed model was able to find optimal solutions for the problems addressed in an acceptable time interval. 
Nevertheless, the problem size grows exponentially with the increase of the number of distribution centers (remote 
stations), which makes the optimization problem difficult to solve to optimality. The usage of the set of possible supply 
chain configurations is one the main causes for the high number of constraints. This set is needed in order to make the 
model able to consider the correct values for the standard deviation of the demand in each remote station, which are 
used to determine the safety stock level. 
Although in a first phase, the supply chain dimension is the one presented in the experimental results, and the proposed 
model delivers an effective solution, with the growth of AM supply chain an effort has to be made in future work to 
assure a solution method capable of handling larger problems, with more parts and more remote stations. 
In this sense, two main research branches will be explored following this work. On the one hand, creating a version 
of the model for a supply chain in a “make-to-order” logic. In this kind of supply chain, safety stocks are not kept, 
which will eliminate the need for usage of the set of possible supply chain configurations in the model’s constraints 
and able it to be used on larger supply chains. On the other hand, solution methods able to tackle the original problem 
described in the paper on larger instances must be researched, may they be simpler mathematical models or 
approximate solution methods, such as heuristics and/or metaheuristics.

Abstract 
United Nations agencies had exerted significant efforts, costs and time in converting their accounting 
system from UNSAS to IPSAS compliant. This research aims to conduct a thorough analysis of the IPSAS 
implementation impact on the financial reporting and internal control system in the UN agencies Significant 
cost and time exerted to complete such conversion and implementation is a key issue to the executive 
management of the United Nations agencies, their governing bodies, and their member states. the research 
provided an independent evaluation of the implementation process and results achieved in each agency. 
Likert scale survey was used in this study to measure the benefits derived by IPSAS according to the 
respondent's point of view. the analysis of the responses of the participants showed that IPSAS 
implementation improved the financial reporting of the UN agencies and brought them in line with globally 
recognized standards and made their financial statements understandable by all stakeholders and 
comparable among each other. In addition, the implementation of IPSAS led to a better internal control 
system for the UN agencies.

1. Introduction
The United Nations decision to move from United Nations System Accounting Standards (UNSAS) to International 
Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) had raised many questions and remained controversial matter for long 
time. Several in-depth reviews and analytical studies tried to answer the question if moving to IPSAS was justifiable 
and successful, meaning the change had achieved its stated objectives of improving the financial reporting and internal 
control systems. This study aimed to respond to this controversial matter. 
1.1 Importance of the Research  
In 1991, the United Nations (UN) agencies adopted a unique accounting standard called United Nations System 
Accounting Standards (UNSAS) that aimed to meet the accounting and reporting needs of the United Nations 
agencies. However, this unique set of accounting standards negatively affects the understandability and acceptability 
of the UN financial reports. In 2006, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution to adopt International Public 
Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) by all UN agencies. This decision came after major scandals accusing the UN 
agencies of inaccurate and incomplete reporting of their activities. The first agency to implement IPSAS was World

4. Discussion and Conclusion  
This study examined the benefits and challenges of adopting the IPSAS in the United Nation agencies. The study 
examined the benefits of adopting the system. From the findings of the study, it was observed that the adoption of 
IPSAS increased the level of accountability and transparency in the United Nation agencies. It was found that the 
adoption of IPSAS enhanced comparability. Also, it was indicated that adoption of IPSAS based standards will 
enable the provision of more meaningful information for decision makers and improve the quality of financial 
reporting and internal control system in the United Nation agencies.   
 All UN agencies had declared the successful implementation of IPSAS and converted their accounting standards 
from UNSAS to IPSAS. However, there is a deep internal discussion in the United Nations agencies and the donor 
community of the real impact of the IPSAS implementation and if the sought target had been achieved. the research 
aimed to conduct a thorough analysis of the impact of IPSAS implementation on the financial reporting and internal 
control system in the United Nations agencies. The research provided an independent evaluation of the 
implementation process and results achieved in each concerned agency. The research also provided an overall view 
of the first-ever UN-wide project, however, implemented individually by each United Nations agency separately 
using its own financial resources. A survey was used to collect information from a sample United Nation employee, 
the analysis of the responses of the participants showed that IPSAS implementation had improved the financial 
reporting of the UN agencies and brought them in line with globally recognized standards and made their financial 
statement understandable by all stakeholders and comparable among each other. In addition, the implementation of 
IPSAS had led to a better internal control system for the United Nations agencies. In fact, strengthening the internal 
control system covers all aspects of the internal control system. The main benefits derived from the implementation 
of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards include enhanced transparency, improved consistency and 
comparability of financial information, enhanced decision making, reduced and better management of expenditure 
as well as improved asset and liabilities management.  
On the other hand, the survey respondents believed that there are many challenges facing IPSAS implementation 
that should be taken into consideration, the costs and risks associated with the implementation and adoption of 
IPSAS should not be underrated, there are some challenges facing the implementation of IPSAS such as the cost of 
introduction and Implementation of IPSAS, availability of qualified accountants, obvious complexities, incompetent 
accounting systems and resistance to change. Hence, we conclude that the adoption of IPSAS in the United Nation 
agencies improved the financial reporting and internal control system.

Abstract 
The main purpose of this research was to use sunlight as a light source in order to reduce the power consumption 
of illumination inside buildings while enhancing aesthetics. Translucent concrete is a concrete based material with 
light-transmissive properties, obtained by embedding light optical elements like optical fibres in it and glass liquor 
bottles. Light is then conducted through the stone from one end to the other. Light transmitting concrete, also 
known as translucent concrete and is made by switching the ingredients of traditional concrete with transparent 
ones or embedding fibre optics. In this paper optical fibres were used to transmit light through fibre. This smart 
translucent concrete can be used as a green energy saving construction material. It is a promising technology for 
field applications in civil engineering. 
Keywords 
Reinforced concrete, concrete strength, fibre glass 
1. Introduction
The world is moving towards much more utilisation of renewable energy sources and Zimbabwe has problem of 
producing enough power required in the country. Therefore, it is necessary to design buildings that will require 
less and less of the power coming from the grids by utilising natural light, a non-depletable source. This research 
is promoting improved lighting using natural light, thereby reducing the use of light from non-renewable sources 
during the day. This is a plus in the tobacco selling industry where they use the natural sunlight to see the condition 
of the tobacco brought in by farmers. This will assist with the utilisation of alcohol glass bottles that are ordinarily 
not recycled. These bottles can be embedded in concrete to produce a wall which will allow light to pass through 
the walls. Reinforcing concrete with glass fibre increases the tensile strength of the concrete. The embedded glass 
fibre is usually alkaline and hence resistant to wear due to acid rain and other acidic materials. Added to these 
advantages glass reinforced concrete is also fire resistant, weather resistant, low thermal conductivity and long 
lasting (White, 2007). It also offers a variety of shapes for exterior surfaces or interior surfaces as partition walls.

                                         = $1.58 
Using light transmitting concrete for our walls will thus save us about 14 kWh a month which is about $1.60 of 
money a month which is about $13 a year. 
In 15 years, price of GFRC wall on the same room remains the same but for an ordinary brick wall which uses a 
60Watt bulb during daylight hours the cost as a result of bulb use increases by: [82.50+(13*15)]  
     =$277.5 
This is $112.5 more than for a GFRC wall which will be using natural light and increases daily. 
 
5. Conclusion and Recommendations 
5.1 Conclusions  
 
The glass reinforced concrete block minimum flexural strength was defined through calculations and literature 
review of existing designs. Light transmittance in optic fibres was found to be greater than the transmittance 
through the glass liquor bottles by comparing light passing through a sample with glass or optic fibre to a sample 
without the glass or glass fibre. Finite element analysis proved that adding 2-3% of optic fibre without affecting 
the strength of concrete and maintaining the concrete strength within the standard M₂₀ concrete grade. The same 
percentage of optic fibre in combination with glass a liquor bottle (cylindrical mould) improves light penetration 
through concrete walls. Also, the light passing through the glass was found to be dimmer than the light passing 
through the optic fibres. The only setback with using glass fibre to reinforce concrete is its cost but that is arguably 
outweighed by the improved aesthetics it gives to walls as well as the ability to save energy using sunlight, a 
renewable resource for lighting. 
5.2 Recommendations 
 
 However, improvements can be made to the light transmitting concrete to archive better results in line with 
objectives. Melting the glass liquor bottles and molding them into glass rods will improve both compressive 
strength and light transmittance of concrete. To obtain transparency in concrete walls the optic fibre can be 
arranged in a mesh.

Abstract 
Mobility and compactness are two of the main criteria for a tangible Product Design Process(PDP) nowadays. This 
paper deals with the execution of modern engineering concepts while designing a workstation consisting of a desk, 
chair and personalized storage with modular and portable Scheme. Primarily, results from customer survey are used 
as Voice of Customer(VOC) and expert opinion as design requirements to propose a House of Quality(HOQ), part of 
Quality Function Deployment(QFD). Additionally, to easily understand the functionality of the workstation 
Functional Decomposition has been performed. Finally, designs are developed in SolidWorks and the outcomes of the 
stress analysis are implemented for design improvisation which results in reduced material and space consumption.

1. Introduction
Product Development Process(PDP) includes the design of the product as well as the material selection, appearance, 
standardization, and many more aspects. There is a continuous need for new, innovative and economic product from 
the consumers. Customer judge a product by its function, appearance, quality, and many more features. Decisions 
made at the design process has a huge impact on the final cost of the product. If the design is changed after product 
launching, the costing ends up higher. So, to make a sustainable product, it is important to nurture the product from 
the design phase. According to ( Ljungberg, 2007), a sustainable product is a product, which will give as little impact 
on the environment as possible during its life cycle. The life cycle in this simple definition includes the extraction of 
raw material, production, use, and final recycling.   
To make a product sustainable, primary phase is to reduce material consumption. Conventional desk and chair need 
plenty of raw material as well as space. Nowadays, mass customization is a strategy of producing standardized goods 
or services but incorporating some degree of customization. One of the ways to make a product of mass customization 
is a modular design. Modular design is a form of standardization in which component parts are subdivided into 
modules that are easily replaced or interchanged  
The aim of this research is to apply PDP to introduce a personalized workstation design which can be used with lesser 
space and moved with ease. The workstation is designed to part by part, so the parts can be interchanged or replaced

5. Conclusion 
In recent times emphasize must be given towards smart design which is more personalized and multifunctional. Most 
importantly to keep pace with the first moving world, product design and development should be happening according 
to the choice of customers. The aim of our paper to reflect both customers’ desires while developing a product and 
reduce material and space consumption. The design parameters were selected from the views of customers which 
makes the product more acceptable for the customers. This design can further be modified by applying ergonomic 
analysis on the workstation and by adding more feature to improvise its usability and functionality.

Abstract 
Development of an efficient workspace scheduling algorithm for shipyard manufacturing has become more 
crucial as the modern smart factory technologies burgeon. Because the shipyard manufacturing is greatly 
sizable, a decision making on workspace scheduling is not a trivial mission. In particular, there are several 
considerations to schedule the block processing on the workspaces such as due date or resource limitation 
in the workspaces. In a practical sense for workspace scheduling, it is commonly used strategy to input 
additional resources into a workspace to shorten the total production time because a little curtailment of the 
total production time can provide a huge revenue in shipyard manufacturing. In this study, we tackle the 
workspace scheduling in shipyard manufacturing considering the additional resource input strategy. This 
problem can be considered as a class of the parallel machine scheduling problem. We introduce a mixed 
integer programming model for the addressed problem, and develop an efficient meta-heuristic algorithm. 
The proposed algorithm is composed of two stages: (i) a genetic algorithm enhanced by an ordering-based 
heuristic scheduling and (ii) a tabu-search algorithm for local search with considering additional resources 
input. The comprehensive computational study shows the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.

Abstract 
Switch mode power supplies play a vital role in the applications of computers, telecommunications and mobile 
chargers due to their fast-dynamic response and less power consumption. These power supplies require sophisticated 
and powerful solid state devices to withstand greater variations of input line voltage and load. The performance 
analysis of buck converter against these changes is presented in this research work. These changes are controlled with 
single and cascaded control schemes. Initially, the buck converter is implemented with a single output voltage loop 
and then a cascade control scheme. Both control schemes are designed with Proportional, Integral and derivative (PID) 
controllers. The cascade control scheme consists of two loops that are current and voltage loops. The buck converter 
is decomposed into two first-order systems and its dynamics are controlled with a cascade control scheme. These 
control schemes are developed and simulated in Simulink toolbox of MATLAB software. The simulated results of the 
buck converter with a single loop are compared to the cascaded loop. The analysis shows that with the addition of an 
inner current loop in cascade control scheme, the inductor current of buck converter is reduced.

1. Introduction
The new development of semiconductor devices and converters increases the use of power electronics in various 
industrial applications. These converters have high efficiency, fast response to certain changes and low cost. Among 
these converters, DC converters are very popular due to their high efficiency, fast dynamic response and compactness. 
Buck converters are non-isolated DC converters.  They are most commonly used in battery and renewable energy 
powered applications due to attractive features like fast switching actions, high efficiency and compact size (Shenoy et 
al. 2016), (Ge et al. 2018), (Mirzaei and Afzalian 2009), (Abro et al. 2009) and (Mahar et al. 2009). Buck converters 
are inherently non-linear due to their switching operation that produces switching transients, oscillations in output 
voltage and generation of harmonics when they are connected to the power system. To handle these disturbances of 
buck converter, various researchers (Abro et al. 2009) and (Mahar et al. 2009), (Tsang and Chan 2005), (Diaz and 
Soriano 2007), (Suntio et al. 2007), (Silva et al. 2015) (Kumar et al. 2008), (Ling et al. 2016) and (Wang et al. 2019) 
have also workout with different controller techniques.  In this research paper, the buck converter is initially simulated 
with a single voltage loop controller. This voltage loop is designed with PID controller. Then, the cascade controller is 
used to control the dynamics of the buck converter. To design the cascade controller, the converter is decomposed into 
two systems of first-order (Abro et al. 2009) and (Mahar et al. 2009). The Cascade controller has two loops which are 
current loop and voltage loop. Both loops are designed with PI controllers. Finally, the results of both control schemes 
are compared.

6. 
Conclusion  
In this research work, the performance of the buck converter is simulated with single voltage loop and cascade control 
loop schemes. Simulation results confirm that the inductor current of buck converter has been reduced five times due 
to addition of inner current loop in cascade controller. Moreover, it is also clear from results of cascade control scheme 
that this reduced overshoot comes to normal current with larger settling time compared to single loop. The oscillations 
in output voltage of buck converter with cascaded controller is increased during line and load variations.

Abstract 
Environment-friendly electric vehicles have gained popularity and increased attention in recent years. Electric vehicles 
must be accompanied by a charging station that can charge electricity. In other word, the deployment of a network of 
recharging stations is essential due to their limited travel range. This paper considers the problem of locating battery 
swapping stations among bus stops for electric vehicles on a traffic network with flow-based demand, based on the 
location routing problem. From these three different mathematical models and compare their performance with real-
world data of Seoul metropolitan area in South Korea. The contribution of our study is to suggest several mathematical 
programming models on locating charging machine problem, which is kind of location routing problem. Through 
solving a problem in several ways, we can compare the advantages and disadvantages of each model in this problem. 
In practical aspects, we have studied and proposed solutions about one of the worries, that can arise in preparation for 
the introduction of electric buses in the near future.

Abstract 
Bearings are an important element to many machines, as they reduce friction between two objects, allowing moving 
parts to move more smoothly. Life Cycle Assessment is a useful engine of sustainability manufacturing and gives 
details of environment impact, created by human  activity or product. Today’s society is very concern about 
environment and they put pressure on manufacturing plants, to produce less environment damaging product. This 
paper aims to measure the effect on the environment created due to cage production of Needle Roller Bearing. This 
will be achieved through Life Cycle Assessment. It is performed from gate to gate i.e. only for production phase on 
GaBi software (version 8.7).  
Keywords 
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Bearing, Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) and GaBi. 
1. Introduction
In recent year, LCA has become very helpful tools in evaluating the impacts on the environment caused by the 
product. LCA has performed for any product from cradle to grave i.e raw material acquisition to wastage disposal 
phase. LCA is interdisciplinary. It’s copes with technical, social and natural systems and the relationship among 
them (Ekdahl 2000).  
LCA has been used in many studies as a basic structure to create life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) to join 
the social, economic and environmental aspects of sustainability (Finkbeiner et al.2010, Halog et al. 2011, 
Hoogmartens et al. 2014, Jorgensen et al. and Weidema 2006). In this LCSA, the life cycle access use to detect the 
relying on of sustainable components in order stay away from the problem and load of shifting from one part of 
system to the other (Sala et al. 2013).  
At present, the industry experienced the less environmental damaging product principle for producing consumer 
goods but they continuously pressuring their supplier. Now, the question regarding environment management 
system is slightly changed to more products related. Product related enhances the LCA tool work and LCA become 
very popular. LCA is defined as ‘‘a method of determining the total environment impact of a product during its 
entire life cycle i.e. extraction of raw materials, production, transportation, construction, demolitation and waste 
disposal and  involves a board examination of the service life of the product-a holistic approach’’ (Consoli 1993). 
LCA envisage a way which has futuristic outlook. Its objective is to look after the environment factors considering 
the manufacturing of products, operation of processes and the management of facilities in order to reduce its impact.  
According to the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO), LCA consist of four different stages(ISO, 
2000):

4. Conclusion 
  
This research work presents a complete LCA of cage production, using GaBi 8.7 LCA tool software. The results 
show various environmental impact factors. The major roll for negative impact on environment is sodium hydroxide, 
which is directly discharge into fresh water. Washing and tumbling process is the main responsible process that 
contain major portion of sodium hydroxide, after coming out form these two process the solution of sodium 
hydroxide must go in waste water treatment plant before discharging into fresh water.

Introduction
Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) are conducted according to LCA standards 14040 and 14044 published by the 
International Organization for Standardization. The framework of LCA has four phases (Fig. 1): 1) Goal and Scope 
Definition, 2) Inventory Analysis, 3) Impact Assessment and 4) Interpretation.( ISO. International standard 14040.This 
research based on above four phases of the corrugated industry, in this Life cycle assessment (LCA) is one eﬀective 
approach for evaluating the environmental impacts of a product by quantifying the impacts of all inputs and outputs 
associated with the investigated system (ISO, International Organization for Standardization, 14040, 2006). Such a 
method has been extensively applied for evaluating environmental burdens generated from fertilizer industry. (Wei chen 
et al 2018).LCA is extensively applied for evaluating the environmental impacts generated from the industry.(Hong et 
al,2012). The environmental impact was evaluated by LCA software Ganzheitlichen Bilanzierung International 
reference Life Cycle Database (GaBi ILCD). The ﬁndings can help determine the most important environmental 
impacts and provide guidance of the full utilization of corrugated product the future. (Zuodong Qina et al 2018). The
most paper waste is currently disposed with other municipal waste management require a large amount of space, and 
has been identified as one of the major source of NH3 emission contributing to climate change ( Sunil kumar et al 
2014). Incineration reduces the need for land disposal and can recover energy from combustion of waste. (Ping et al. 
2018) 
Corrugated box and paperboard plays an important role in packing industry. This product has cheap price, and strength 
flexible properties. Increasing trend of paperboard consumption in India and environmental awareness, many people or 
organizations have close look of the environmental properties. The main purpose of this research is finding the 
environmental impacts analysis by throughout the life cycle assessment of the corrugated box producing, used, disposal 
in India and further we are trying to improvement options to reducing the environmental impacts by using life cycle 
assessment (LCA).

5. Conclusions  
The LCA technology is important to appraise environmental impacts and defense of the production phase. In this 
research the life cycle of corrugated box having of many processes. The major source of environmental impacts is land 
filling, and electricity consuming of the corrugated box manufacturing. If the degree of land filling is more than 60%, it 
is most responsible for environmental impacts. And it is also responsible for main contributions to global warming and 
acidification, if the recycling phase is used for whole product that it is safe for environment.

Abstract 
 
Blockchain has got numerous applications in various fields and one of the promising one is agriculture. The 
blockchain application in agriculture includes food safety through traceability of provenance, information system, 
agro-trade, finance, crop certification and insurance etc. Thus this paper aims to review the applications of 
blockchain in agriculture field from all major databases ranging from Web of Science to Scopus. The study shows 
that though there exist many blockchain based application in agriculture but only few countries are able to grasp it 
where China is leader followed by USA, Italy, India and Spain. This paper also reviews the recent trends about 
blockchain research in agriculture and subsequently provides future research directions.

1. Introduction 
Blockchain is the most buzz world in today’s world and often considered as most destructive technologies till now. 
Blockchain is shared, cryptographically unaltered distributed ledger for recording the history of a digital transaction 
(IBM, Hyperledger). Each member (stakeholder) on blockchain system stores copy of all previous transaction ever 
executed through the given system. But no single party/node is owner which shows that it is not a centralized 
system. Since each activity in the system is visible and auditable by all members, thus this type of decentralized 
system creates the foundation of trust. For any transaction to happen, a consensus algorithm is followed means 
consensus of nodes that agree upon the issue is required which ensure its validation and authorization. Also 
blockchain based system doesn’t require a mediator or third party for transaction leading to lowering transactional 
cost. These transaction are also irreversible and need of any public and private institution mediator is avoided which 
makes the system more efficient. The member involved need not to trust each other than system and code which are 
full proof. Three definitions are blockchain are very predominant as follows: 
 Technically, it is a back-end database which maintains a distributed ledger and has the facility of being 
inspected openly.  
 Business-wise, it is an exchange network for moving value, assets, transactions between peers, without any 
need of intermediaries. 
 Legally speaking, it validates transactions history, replacing previously trusted entities. 
In simple terms, consider a village having finite number of people where transaction is to be done between two 
people or parties. For this transaction to happen everybody in the village comes to a common platform and 
transaction happens in front of everyone. For record purpose, everyone take a note of this transaction in their 
notebook. Now in future or anytime, if any of two concerned parties between whom this transaction has taken place 
can’t claim any wrong information or deny the transaction because everyone in the village has the original note 
about the transaction. Also to forge the information, the fraudulent has to change the note of everyone’s copy in the 
village which is not possible in practical circumstance. In similar fashion, suppose these transactions happen through 
computers and all the villagers are different computers where the record is stored. Also these transactions are 
cryptographically secured, authenticated and verified by anonymous approvers (also called as miners). This is what 
happens in actual blockchain environment where each information/records are stored in blocks and everybody 
connected to the network has this copy. Any further transactions is added in the new block and linked with previous 
blocks. Since it is cryptographically secured and thus can’t be mutable by any fraudulent. The detail working of 
blockchain based system is shown in figure 1 and could be explained in six easy steps. In step one, transaction is 
requested and it get broadcasted to the all connected networks in step two. When consensus about this requested

was found that China is leading this area of research with maximum number of publications followed by USA, Italy, 
India and Spain. It was also observed that the research on blockchain is limited to only few countries and most the 
publications occurred as proposal in conference rather than journal and book chapters. There were only few articles 
which actually focus on implementation aspect of the blockchain based system. The literature was also analysed 
under four heads of research dimensions namely traceability, architecture and security, information systems and 
other applications in agriculture field. It was observed that blockchain based research in agriculture is mainly 
focused on traceability and specific research whereas notable research also exist for blockchain architecture and 
security design and blockchain as information system. However few important issues related to blockchain 
implementation exists like scalability, interoperability, application of blockchain for precision agriculture and food 
supply chain network design etc. which are emerging areas for further studies. We hope this review inspire 
researchers to take this call to solve some of the socio-economic issues comprising blockchain for benefitting 
society.

Abstract 
To Minimize Marketing Challenges in the organization, Knowledge Management plays a vital role. Various 
challenges are there which have to be minimized to survive an organization in the market among its competitors. 
Hence it is felt by organizations that there is a need for a strong tool by which these challenges can be minimized, 
although complete elimination of these challenges is not possible. In this article, authors have identified some 
important challenges and focused on minimizing the same. This article provides a deep synthesis of related available 
literature and the gist a brainstorming session which was arranged to focus to identify vital challenges. Some vital 
Challenges are enlisted as stagnant productivity, low educational standards, limited competitiveness, corruption, 
state interventionism, increasing consumer debt. This study involves the questionnaire survey in which, 545 
respondents were involved. 263 valid responses have been considered for this study, hence overall response was 
48.256% for this study. Then a decision modeling tool DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and Evaluation 
Laboratory Model) has been applied to prioritize the challenges and to show interrelationship among them. This 
article elucidates the idea about the marketing challenges and demonstrates the priority of identified challenges 
which has to be minimized. By this research article a researcher, businessperson and strategy makers might be 
benefited for the identification of the challenges as well as the priority ranking of the challenges for better strategic 
planning. 
Keywords 
Knowledge Management, Marketing Challenges, Strategic Management, DEMATEL. 
1. Introduction
Marketing challenges and problems can be annoying and can seriously derail the marketing efforts. To minimize 
marketing challenges and problems the company needs to adopt knowledge management (KM) strategic tool for 
better performance. Some of the company adopt management of knowledge by formal KM initiatives while some of 
the company manage knowledge informally like their regular activity. Basically, KM involves the four steps 
knowledge generation, knowledge sharing, knowledge storage, and knowledge application. Bharati et al. 2015  
explored social media’s influence on organizational knowledge excellencyover the hypothetical social resource and 
capital interchange(Bharati et al. 2015). Some of the marketing challenges as stationary output, low educational 
standards, narrow competitiveness, underprivileged logistics, revenue inequality, dishonesty, state interventionism, 
accumulative customer dues (Gouvea et al. 2018). According to a well-determined allocation of perception and 
demand-side circumstances, to exhibit the potential success factors for emergingsocial tourism and accomplishment 
from a marketing perception(Hausmann 2007). Wood and Darling 1993 focused highly competitive Eastern and 
Central European republics on the entry of global markets. Results indicated that marketing challenges were 
prejudiced most by “central product attributes” and “marketing practices satisfiers”(Wood and Darling 1993). 
2. Literature Survey
Many articles dealt with the marketing challenges in different ways and for different sectors but according to 
Grönroos many existing attitudes, behaviors, and structures were the main challenges (Grönroos 1999). Spalding

four quadrants. According to the analysis of the figure 1 state interventionism possess the high value of prominence 
and relation in I quadrants. The IV quadrant possess high prominence value but low relation value; the marketing 
challenges comes under this quadrant is underprivileged logistics, which means this challenge has the essential items 
impacted by other challenges. Other challenges are situated in II quadrant, with low prominence but high relation; 
they are stagnant productivity, limited competitiveness, and increasing consumer debt. Due to prominence being 
lower than the mean, 21.714, and the relation being near the mean, 0, it means that these challenges impact other 
challenges; III quadrant has low prominence and relation; they are; low educational standards and corruption. It can 
be seen from the causal diagram; state interventionism is the key impact challenge which affect the market the most. 
7. Conclusion 
This study uses the DEMATEL technique for the evaluation of current challenges in marketing industries. The result 
of the study hopefully forecasts to understand the marketing challenges. Authors have done the prioritization of the 
marketing challenges by which a businessperson, a researcher, a practitioner may get benefited. Table 2 shows the 
value of the prominence and relation. Figure 1 shows the interrelationship among different marketing challenges. It 
is easy to locate, which challenge is more important and which is not for a company. The figure will also helpful for 
the decision maker to take the decision regarding the challenges. It eases to find out the most prior challenge which 
affects the market most. In this research, authors have found that state interventionism is the most effective 
challenge in marketing and low educational standards as the least effective challenge. To overcome state 
interventionism, a company need to adopt knowledge management strategy as a tool.The study also shows that a 
businessperson has to manage and fight against state interventionism challenge.

Abstract 
Earned value management (EVM) is a project control system that considers technical performance, 
schedule and budget. It offers an early warning method to find out gaps between the planning and the real 
performance. It is a cost-based method but it currently includes the schedule performance. 
However, it has a deterministic approach to identify gaps, this means that any variation from the plan 
triggers a decision. The purpose of this research was to propose a method based on EVM to control projects 
considering risks. Considering normal variations in performance allows the project manager to make 
decisions when the project is really out of control. This means that may be found performance measurement 
under the planned value that may not be considered a problem that needs a decision. 
The proposal is based on four phases: identification of potential risks, identification of critical risks, 
identification of critical project activities and building control limits. The first step is conducted through a 
literature review to build a general risk list from researches on construction projects in developing countries. 
Critical risks are identified through a Modal Analysis of Effects and Failures (MAEF). Critical activities 
are identified by establishing the relationship or influence among critical risks, already identified, and every 
activity of the project. Finally, the control limits are built. The risk profile for every activity and the 
desirable control level are the inputs for a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) conducted for every control 
moment decided for the project.  
The proposed method was applied in a building construction project. A preliminary list of 519 risks from 
the literature was reduced to 106 risks by identifying duplicated and some included in others. It was later 
reduced to 53 through an expert panel analysis and finally reduced to 18 risks when the MAEF analysis 
was conducted. From the activity list of the project, were identified preliminaries, excavation, foundation, 
and slabs as the critical activities. For the risk profile of critical activities, it was supposed a normal

Abstract 
The insurance industry is considered as one of the influential financial institutions that have an effective role in 
reducing the risk in various economic dimensions of society. Hence, insurance companies, by accepting the risks 
associated with the lives, property, and responsibilities of the community and economic activists, are the basis for the 
security of investment in society. Therefore, since the main field of activity of insurance companies is risk-taking, it 
is necessary for them to have access to powerful risk analysis tools to take effective risk management. Therefore, 
insurance companies have a significant interest in TRUST indicators for long-term communication with customers 
and the provision of the loyalty factor as a competitive advantage. This study seeks to find an optimal mix of 
demographic characteristics of the insurers who have the most confidence in insurance companies. For this purpose, 
a data envelopment analysis has been used with real data from three insurance companies in Tehran.

Introduction
Trust is a person’s level of confidence in his relationship with someone (Nyhan, 2000). It presents a fair, ethical and 
predictable behavior, according to it. The factor of trust can be divided into the following types. Personal trust, group 
trust, and organizational trust. These three types are closely interrelated. Organizational trust can be influenced by the 
trust placed in an individual or several individuals working at an organization. It is usually a vital factor in risk-taking 
organizations such as insurance brokers that need a high trust level to retain their customers. In any country, the 
insurance industry is considered to be an influential financial entity with an effective role in decreasing risk in various 
economic dimensions of society. Hence, insurance companies accept risks related to life, property and accept 
responsibility for the people and economic activists to provide mental peace and investment security in society. 
Therefore, because the main activity of insurance companies is to buy risks, they must have access to powerful risk 
analysis tools to be able to effectively manage risks. Customer trust in insurance companies consists of individuals’ 
belief in the long-term advantages of these companies, the quality of insurance services provided and also the 
continuity of these services offered by the insurance companies. In the insurance industry, insurers consider these 
elements to be very important. This is because insurance is a service that shows its effects on the lives of customers 
in the long run. Moreover, insurers consider the continuity of insurance services to be essential. Accordingly, insurance 
companies pay special attention to trust indexes. They do this to maintain long-term relationships with customers and 
acquire the factor of loyalty as a competitive advantage. In the following, some important trust indices studied in the 
literature are explained.

Abstract 
When transporting logistics using electric trucks (eTruck), one of concerns is the limitation of the travel distance due 
to the limit of battery capacity. This travel distance constraint of an eTruck can be relieved through battery charging, 
exchange or recovery techniques. Among them, the battery recuperation is a technique of converting the position 
energy of the eTruck into the electric energy of the battery using the difference of the altitude of the electric truck and 
the regenerative braking system (RBS). In this study, we study routing problem of eTruck in the presence of a battery 
swapping station. The difference from previous eTruck routing studies in literature is that battery recuperation 
technology is taken into account when eTrucks are operated. This problem can be solved by replacing it with 
asymmetric TSP (ATSP) and we propose such the network as energy TSP graph. The problem of interest can be 
modeled by using an stochastic dynamic programming (DP). However, since the computational complexity increases 
rapidly as the number of nodes increases, it is difficult to derive a meaningful solution within polynomial time. Thus, 
we propose a methodology to derive the good suboptimal solution through heuristic algorithm.

Abstract (12 font) 
 
Workplaces are an integration of numerous subunits working in tandem to ensure that the business of the 
organization runs smoothly. Every sector has to rely on the subunits and will not deliver at its full 
potential without the rest putting in their best as well.  
Highly effective organizations exhibit strengths across five areas: leadership, decision making and 
structure, people, work processes, systems, and culture. For an organization to achieve and sustain success, 
degree of congruence between organizational goals and some observed outcome. needs to adapted to its 
dynamic environment. One of the reasons companies end up compromising their profits is due to the 
inefficient use of the available resources at hand.  
It is often observed that organizations take a considerable period of time to develop their capabilities to 
utilize the acquired technology, which leads to the scenario when technology becomes obsolete and the 
organization lags to leverage it in an effective manner. 
Technical institutions are aspiring to provide state of the art education to their stakeholders by acquiring 
latest technologies. It is indeed a truth that these organizations have not yet developed or in a state of 
developing physical facilities as well as intellectual skills to fully utilize the technology and make it a 
catalyst which can drive the curricula.

Abstract 
Sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) can play a significant role in improving company sustainability 
performance by addressing the social, environmental and economic issues in the supply chain, including suppliers, in-
house operations, distributors and customers. Achieving sustainability through SSCM is a challenge that requires 
understanding the complexity of developing efficient and effective SSCM. Limited empirical research has investigated 
that complexity in detail, especially in developing countries. The purpose of this study is to identify and discuss, in 
the context of certain Saudi manufacturing industries, the relevance of key motives, barriers and enabling factors, and 
their influence on the adoption of SSCM practices. Also, this study leads to the development of a roadmap for 
maintaining the key enabling factors and mitigating the main barriers to successful implementation of SSCM.  
This research follows a case-study design, with in-depth analysis of six large companies working in different Saudi 
manufacturing sectors, as well as an expert focus group. Data-collection methods included in-depth interviews with 
top-level managers and documents obtained from company websites. In total, primary data was collected from ten 
managers and eight experts, and data from 224 secondary sources were analysed. A thematic-analysis approach was 
adopted to examine the data, and a template was developed to explore the overall view of the SSCM implementation 
process and show the differences and similarities among Saudi manufacturing companies and the focus group, with 
respect to the key motives, enablers and barriers.  
The results reveal that large manufacturing companies acknowledge the importance of adopting sustainability in the 
supply chain to improve company sustainability performance. Two related motivators drive that adoption, namely, 
achieving benefits and responding to stakeholder pressures such as regulation, competition and corporate social 
responsibility (i.e. taking responsibility toward others, such as local community and employees). This study finds that 
external stakeholder barriers inhibit the development of SSCM more than internal barriers. Those external barriers 
include governments, suppliers, customers, and investors and cause negative economic, environmental and social 
impacts on company development of SSCM practices. Perhaps the most significant finding to emerge from the analysis 
is that stakeholder engagement plays critical roles in mitigating those barriers and advancing the adoption of SSCM. 
This study found that corporate understanding of engaging, developing and managing the positive contributions of 
external stakeholders and, more importantly, of internal stakeholders, is an essential enabling factor in the 
development of SSCM. Other significant enabling factors include the availability of technology, performance 
measurement, a sustainability culture and sustainability strategy. The study template can help Saudi manufacturers to 
follow guidelines that effectively enhance SSCM implementation.

Abstract  
The study investigated the green supply chain management’s impact (GSCM) on organisational performance. A case 
of Johannesburg based corporates. The study used a qualitative approach in which 12 participants took part in semi- 
structure interviews. The study aimed to explore how GSCM was related to organisational performance. The green 
supply chain management practices which were used for examining their impact of performance include; green 
procurement; green designs; environmental preservation collaborations and; reverse logistics. These were to be 
measured on the key dimensions of performance which include operational, social and economic performance. The 
aim of a qualitative study is to gain in depth understanding of the green supply chain management issues confronting 
organisations.  The study produced mixed results. Some GSCM practices had an effect on organisational performance 
whilst others were not. Eco- design had no impact on any of the performance dimensions stated namely; operational, 
economic or social dimensions. It was found out that environmental cooperation had a positive influence on 
operational performance without any influence on other performance dimensions. Reverse logistics impacted 
positively on social performance and GSCM had an impact on both economic and social performance of an 
organisation.  
Key words: Green supply chain management, organisational performance 
1. Introduction  
The link between organisational performance and environmental issues have been the subject of interest among the 
research community of late. Due to the advent of climate change issues which have led to the subsequent degradation 
of the environment coupled with the depletion of the ozone layer there have been global calls for organisations to go 
green and not just organisations only but also whole supply chains (Lee et al,. 2012). Organisations have thus to be 
compliant to legislative requirements and also be able to remain focused on achieving their objectives. Consequently, 
it is of great value to investigate how organisations can be compliant to these global demands while also be able to 
satisfy their stakeholder’s needs (Ayuso et al., 2014; Freeman, 2013; Russo & Foutus, 2015).   
2. Literature Review  
 
2.1- GSCM and Corporate Performance: Positive Relationship  
Porter (1991), views green supply chain management as having a positive relationship with organisational 
performance. Porter’s views are ably supported by extensive researches carried out in several industries which indicate 
that GSCM impacts positively on different dimensions of performance. A study by Diabat et al. (2013) made use of a 
survey in an exploratory design to investigate the link between sustainable supply chain policies and performance. 
The study found out that environmental cooperation, eco-design and reverse logistics have a positive impact on 
performance. The concept of Eco-design emphasises on the utility of considering negative impacts on the environment 
during manufacturing process such as energy consumption, carbon emissions, and water proof print among others. 
Figure 1 below indicates that each step of the business process follows ethical guidance from the nature of the raw 
materials to the end customer through manufacturing of eco-friendly products as highlighted by Clarion (2019).

to give an example of his work context by stating that during the production of bricks, the dust is recycled back into 
the process. This however is not an easy feat to accomplish as it requires careful implementation and control which 
most organisations fail to do. The research findings closely mirror the ideas of the institutional theory. The study found 
out that reverse logistics had an effect on the social performance of an organisation. It ranked second among supply 
chain management practices commonly implemented in South Africa behind eco- design.  This is in agreement with 
the findings of a study by Mitra and Datta (2014). In their study they found out that companies that have initiatives in 
place to recover the packages of their products have a positive public image. Based on the institutional theory it can 
therefore be claimed that the improved social performance of these organisations is due to its positive image in the 
eyes of the public and not due to adherence to legislation as noted in other studies. Improved social performance of 
organisations is due to practicing internal reverse logistics which is also confirmed by Lin and Sheu (2012) who 
concluded that GSCM practices enhance social performance.  
5. Conclusions   
In conclusion the study has revealed mixed results, some green practices impact on performance while others do not, 
eco- design for example has no impact on performance. However other practices like environmental cooperation have 
relative impact on operational performance but no impact on social performance. Reverse logistics positively impacts 
on social performance while green purchasing impacts on both economic and operational performance.  
The study however could not separate between organisations who adopted GSCM earlier and those who adopted it at 
a later stage because it was of a much-limited scope. It might be imperative for future studies to carry out research on 
how GSCM practices impact on performance over time.  
6. Recommendations  
Based on the above conclusions, the following recommendations are therefore made: 
• 
For organisations to fully benefit from GSCM the leadership must be fully committed to the practices 
and fully back it financially.  
• 
It might be worthwhile to have a fully-fledged department within an organisation with a full complement 
of staff assigned to take charge of environmental issues in their organisation. 
• 
There is need to put in place proper implementation and GSCM monitoring mechanisms 
• 
Organisations should also strive to ensure that green supply chain management rules are strictly 
followed.

Abstract 
An innovative environment boosts technological innovativeness through the implementation of new technologies. 
At the same time, an innovative environment draws from technological innovation knowledge, which stimulates 
its development. The most innovative economies exemplify the strong link between economy and science. The 
leading role of start-ups in EU economy is determined by a range of advantages originating from dynamic process 
of formation thereof, namely producing large number of new ideas, innovative projects diversification, creation 
of new jobs. Innovation takes place within an ecosystem of multiple factors. Any factor missing from the 
innovation ecosystem hinders new ideas from being generated or evolving into viable commercial products. At 
the same time, it should be noted that a key indicator of EU innovation leaders is the effective commercialization 
of their technological innovations. The purpose of this paper is to analyse a set of factors and conditions conducive 
to the successful development of innovative entrepreneurship environment and technology start-ups in Latvia.  
Results of researches show that the main drivers behind a successful innovation ecosystem are favourable 
administrative requirements, government incentives, available financial resources, academic-industry 
collaborations, research and development, commercialization, market dynamics, entrepreneurial culture.  
Keywords 
Commercialization of technologies, innovation, innovation ecosystem, start-up. 
1. Introduction
Latvian science, research and innovation policy (R&I) aims at launching new strategic path for the country 
towards the next level of ambition needed to tackle modern issue in finding Latvia’s “specialization” niche in 
global and European competitiveness (Eteris, 2018). Technology and knowledge, developed at universities and 
other research organizations, play essential role in the growth of the economy due to business activities of startups, 
entities, which commercialize technology and knowledge in the form of new products and services (Balkin, 
Gianiodis, Markman, 2005). A startup innovation ecosystem is defined as a set of regional or national structures 
in which start-ups, SMEs, large sized enterprises, universities, and public organizations interact on a 
technological, social, legal and commercial basis in order to produce knowledge, develop new technologies and 
new business opportunities. These interactions aim at developing and protecting new technologies, and financing 
and regulating new projects (Metcalfe, 2008). Investment and financial support in the knowledge-based sectors 
improving innovation capacity and innovation is now seen as a key approach to drive competitive advantage and 
improve performance of the economy of EU countries. According to the Global Startup ecosystem report 2018, 
the global start-up revolution continues to grow. Global venture capital investments in start-ups hit a decade high 
in 2017, with over $140 billion invested. Total value creation of the global start-up economy from 2015 to 2017 
reached $2.3 trillion, a 25.6% increase from the 2014 to 2016 period. Underneath this continued growth, 
fundamental shifts are occurring. The shifts in the start-up map, both geographic and economic, according to the

Only four factors out of seven are represented in figure 3. The most important factor, according to the CEOs, is 
mentoring. 56% of respondents indicated that this factor has a significant impact on future business success. 
 
 
Fig. 3. Single most important factor for start-up, after money 
It is necessary to continue a detailed and structured study of each of the factors indicated in the figure and to 
identify the weaknesses of the existing business environment, significant and specific components of the model, 
which could be deemed essential/key to Latvian startups ecosystem. Further research is also needed because 
technology start-ups, and all start-ups in general, are by themselves a factor of the business ecosystem. They have 
an impact on the innovative development of industrial sectors, businesses, and also launch processes at the level 
of government and education that contribute to building an economy based on knowledge. It is important to 
understand how the factors of entrepreneurship environment, which form the ecosystem of business environment, 
affect the quality of process at each stage of transfer and commercialization of technology. Moreover, a society 
needs entrepreneurs, who are growth-oriented, innovative, globally competitive, and or working in added-value 
industries. It is not enough to evaluate the effect of the external context solely on the performance of the startup. 
The relationship between the environment and entrepreneurship is complex, and this will provide further 
opportunities for research. When their companies succeed, investors get paid, economies grow, jobs are created, 
and communities evolve socially. Therefore, ecosystems are created where various players seek to collaborate 
with entrepreneurs and make them successful. 
Conclusions 
Based on the statistical analysis authors defined most important factors of the entrepreneurship innovation 
ecosystem that influence the development of the deep tech startups in Latvia. The survey of the CEOs of 20 high-
tech startups defined factors such as entrepreneurial finance, government policies support and relevance; R&D 
transfer; cultural and social norms as more important for deep tech startups. 
It is clear that most innovative economies exemplify the strong link between economy and science. A key indicator 
of EU innovation leaders is also the effective commercialization of their technology innovations. 
It is important to understand how the environment influences the quality of entrepreneurship. Ideally, the mix of 
entrepreneurs in a society should include individuals who are growth-oriented, innovative, globally competitive, 
and/or operating in advanced sectors. 
The relationship between the environment and entrepreneurship is  complex, and one that will yield promising 
research opportunities for years to come.  
The impact of an innovation startup ecosystem is manifold.  A strong innovation ecosystem allows local 
economies to retain top talent in their countries. International Corporations call a successful startup ecosystem a 
good investment. This leads to the creation of more jobs and services and boosts local economy.

Abstract 
Promoting the correct implementation of organizational management and effective supply chains in the regions of 
Colombia affected by the armed conflict is complex and difficult, therefore, the research shows a way to integrate tour 
operators of the populations of Mesetas, Uribe, and Lejanias for the economic development of the country actively, 
for it, the categories to be studied were looked for and of them six instruments were designed that allow to diagnose 
the tourist operation, with which, the shortcomings in administrative management, marketing, financial and supply 
chain. With which, protocols and guides for easy-to-use web applications were designed and delivered a technological 
tool that helps improve the income and logistics and business management of these tour companies.

Introduction 
This research consists of an exploratory study of organizational management (Arellano, 2013) to learn how the tourism 
sectors in the Meta department have evolved, focused on the municipalities of Lejanías, Uribe, and Mesetas, 
diagnosing how their organizational structure and chains are of supply to have a point of reference of how it is 
implemented in large hotel industries. With the support of the Ministry of Tourism and Commerce that promoted 
visiting all the operators that are located in the populations under study; In this way, the organizational management 
models and models will be identified, the technical norms that are currently being implemented in the tourism sector 
will be determined, and if they are being applied to promote ecotourism so far. 
To analyze the organizational aspects that implement its business model with the collaboration of the Noesis strategic 
and Induspymes research groups of the Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia and the Sennova group of the National 
Apprenticeship Service (SENA), it begins with a systematic literature review from secondary sources where factors 
such as the environment, safety, ecotourism, the quality of tourism are chosen. And from these factors several

With the recognition that the Santos administration made of the existence of the internal conflict, it opened the need 
to inquire about the historical roots of it. This search in time, despite the restriction suggested by thinking about the 
Colombian conflict in FARC terms against the State, has allowed a revision of the constitution and evolution of the 
political, economic and socio-cultural structures that have fueled the conflict for decades. ; Due to the above, the 
points of final agreement that are shown in figure 5 were reached. Where, points 1 and 5 are related to the areas in 
conflict and the protected areas and this is where a socio-ecological project takes great relevance and relevance. 
 
 
Figure 5. Points of final agreement (Barreto, 2014) 
 
Finally, post-conflict is understood as ""a situation of exit or overcoming the war that proposes the establishment of 
concertation and negotiation processes in which, directly or indirectly, the different armed and social actors that are 
part of the conflict participate."" (Pérez, 2011). For Cárdenas Rivera (2003) the ideal in the Colombian case is to speak 
of an armed post-conflict; that is to say ""the period that begins from the moment in which the dialogues of agreement 
and negotiation of the internal armed conflict acquire a character of inalterability, even when elections are held subject 
to the different agreements and conditions agreed upon in the negotiation. In this way, the institutional recognition of 
irregular armed actors arises, and the government promotes the design and execution of public policies aimed at the 
reconciliation of the whole society. ""It is important to remember that the decision of the actors in the negotiation is to 
build the overcoming of the war, in the middle of the military confrontation. The questions that arise in this point are: 
to overcome the war for what? What is the project of environmental preservation that Colombia hoists after the signing 
of the agreements? How will the victims and demobilized be protected so that they have a better quality of life? Are 
we talking about a post-conflict or a few post agreements? 
 
3. Results 
An analysis of the Likert type was carried out which resulted in tourism managers having no knowledge of 
administrative processes, customer service management, with respect to tourism agents, accommodation. Based on 
these findings it is intended to establish an administrative management model in the three study areas where training 
is offered to tourism managers based on the technical standard of the Colombian sector NTS-ST 002 to be the 
differentiating factor in these municipalities. 
 
According to the results issued by the Likert scale focused on Marketing, we analyzed the demand of the areas of 
attraction, where there are clearly deficiencies in the frequency of visits to these places, which are only visited on 
Sundays and holidays, during the year, and customers have a potential attraction at the national level, one of the 
possible causes is the lack of a marketing strategy for customer loyalty. 
 
Additionally, it can be analyzed that the information of the tourist managers before being visited was through ""word 
of mouth"" and some through Internet; therefore, there are no disclosure strategies to publicize the services offered by 
each manager. 
 
4. Conclusions 
Therefore, a customer service protocol is created that facilitates the improvement of the quality of the service taken 
from the administrative focus where the following actions should be known and implemented. 
 
Consider the personal image as part of the service: The personnel must present themselves to their neat workplace and 
with a uniform in perfect condition, showing an image of professionalism, order and neatness in the service. The 
1022","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

proper presentation of men is to be well shaved and combed and women without excess jewellery, perfume or makeup; 
show availability by serving and helping customers; Turn complaints into opportunities to improve 
 
Once detected the shortcomings of promotion and disclosure of the managers we can propose as strategies of 
disclosure of tourism managers in interactive sites as follows, the first thing we must establish is the image and tourism 
vocation of the municipalities, and how they should highlight on the other aspects that highlights the territory, in this 
case we will focus on ecotourism. 
 
 
Our strategies to contribute to the development and strengthening of tourist gestures are the following. For example, 
validating one of the most recurrent WEB applications to acquire tour packages is “Despegar”, where it is evident that 
these places do not have agreements to be known and customers access the services they provide; In this way we can 
start creating agreements or alliances so that the managers register in them, not only as accommodations but also as 
activities

Abstract  
 
Prospective study for the construction of the ecological strategies that the improvement of the ecological management 
and the tourist service of the companies that are related in Colombia; The objective of the country is to develop a 
tourism that is sustainable and that contributes both to the protection of the environment and to the development of 
the communities of the tourist areas, especially the protected areas through ecotourism. However, although there are 
ecotourism organizations, according to the results of the exploratory study of 2015, in the context of ecological 
development in the country there is no economic growth and less sustainment of the service and the environmental 
environment; In addition, the management level of the organizations and the administrative, logistic and financial 
services are very low, due to the low training of the people in charge of the business, real disinterest of the state, which 
causes a low development of the organizations, environmental deterioration , little growth in the quality of life of the 
communities and, therefore, the social and economic possibilities of the Colombian rural areas that require growth 
strategies in the post-conflict, which this study shows through the prospective tools visibility mechanisms, social 
integration and associative models for a real development and sustainability of the communities.

Introduction 
 
Since the nineteenth century Colombia has lived in an internal armed conflict that has left millions of innocent and 
sometimes fatal victims, causing the population to move to different places in their region of origin as a measure of 
protection against the war. part of Colombians lost their property, homes and belongings, leaving the country as one 
of the most violent and with high levels of crime in Latin America, for 2016 international newspapers categorized 
Colombia as one of the countries with the highest crime rates assigned to this the twelfth place according to a study 
conducted by the BBC (2016), CNN mentions that according to the analysis of violence rates the country ranks 146th 
in South America, even higher than Venezuela and other Latin countries (2015).

Conclusions 
 
Ecotourism is not only a fundamental tool that contributes and contributes to the local and regional economic 
development of the country, but it is a source of resources for the communities in the areas where it is carried out. At 
the same time it is a great strategy used to conserve the ecotourism heritage in Colombia, given the use of the resources 
which serve to create awareness for the conservation of the eco-tourist environment and to diminish the negative 
impacts that the visitors of each one of them can leave. the eco tourist places. 
 
In Colombia ecotourism is not developed as such because companies are more interested in generating profit and 
emerge, and do not focus on helping the communities and areas where they are located, therefore the concept of 
ecotourism, it should be taken into account that there is an interest in ecotourism due to the positive factors that this 
brings, since it generates a source of resources for conservation, special care of biodiversity, cultural heritage and 
socioeconomic development. 
 
Companies play an important role because through them the concept of ecotourism and its components is promoted 
and disseminated, applying them properly is a healthy habit because it generates a favorable social culture, at the same 
time it contributes to sustainability and economic development that a community can have with ecotourism activities. 
Lack of economic benefits to the local community, most of the rewards remain in the tour operators and little is 
extended to the preservation of the place, the community and the population. 
 
Recommendations 
 
• 
Taking advantage of the fact that ecotourism is growing globally in a greater proportion than traditional 
tourism, the State must propose a strategic economic development initiative for the country based on 
ecotourism and must appoint the government institutions that ensure to control this activity in the country. . 
• 
Promote the development of ecotourism in certain regions of the country where parks and natural reserves 
already exist for the generation of new direct jobs in nearby communities. 
• 
Strengthen transport, communications and sanitation infrastructure in all regions of the country, especially 
in the most remote areas where the vast majority of natural reserves are located, such as the new road 
concessions of the ANI on 4G roads with the environmental component implemented. 
• 
Promote community projects based on values such as solidarity and joint work to implement ecotourism 
programs mainly in regions where indigenous and peasant communities live together.

• 
Generate initiatives that seek competitiveness and productivity through regional business unions that can 
attract the capture of external resources and generate support and rapid growth of ecotourism in the country. 
• 
Colombian indigenous communities should be involved in order to make them aware of the good 
management of their customs and turn them into benefits for the community itself. 
• 
Create foundations and institutes that focus on the theme of ecotourism in our country, promoting studies of 
our natural resources and transform them into benefits for all our communities.

Abstract 
A successful implementation of Lean Management requires specialists who understand the methods and techniques 
used in a company and know how to use them in a highly efficient way to optimize processes under review. Copying 
existing approaches is not sufficient. It is crucial to understand the concept of Lean Management. Institutions of higher 
education play an important role in teaching Lean Management to students. Additionally, higher education institutes 
(HEI) can contribute by offering executive education to non-students and other interested parties. The purpose of this 
study is to determine the degree of dispersion of teaching Lean Management in higher education and to analyze if the 
type of HEI affects prevalence. For the realization of the research objective, the cross-sectional study has been selected 
as an empirical approach. Based on a structured document analyze, course-relevant and legally binding documents of 
all departments were searched for Lean Management. Results indicated that there is no difference in teaching Lean 
between Hochschulen and universities. Offers in executive education are more common at universities, though. 
Additionally, the prevalence of Lean Management is higher for institutions of higher education that lie there focus on 
technical aspects.

can be a basis to investigate correlations of teaching Lean Management in academic education with successful Lean 
implementation within a geographical region. The influence of academic education on successful Lean 
implementations should be further investigated in the future.

Abstract 
In Colombia the 15 % of sale prices of the product is related with the logistic cost and the 35.2%  (Amparo 
Alonso Másmela et al., n.d.) Is for cost of transport. The principal cause of that is that in Colombia the 
transport is making for trucks because the other alternatives like train transport and fluvial transport is not 
available for use. In this way the government of Colombia have different strategies like  the  reactivation 
of  the national net of train (“Este año comienza la reactivación de la red férrea nacional | Infraestructura | 
Economía | Portafolio,” n.d.)  for the reactivation of the intermodal transport, but in some cases the industry 
don’t use that because they haven’t  information about the process of engagement of this kind of transport. 
For that reason, we propose the use of a web application where the different actor of the industry could find 
the information about the process of engagement of transport in the routes and share information as a 
mechanism for engage of intermodal transport and generate mechanism of collaborative economy, for 
improve the competitive skills in logistic.

Abstract 
The computer vision is the object of growing interest, in all areas of knowledge, in the analysis of information extracted 
from a scene. In this work, we present a robust system of real-time image recognition using Angle Histogram. Will be 
demonstrated in this paper the use of histogram of angles, integrated to the fuzzy clustering method to make the 
computer vision system insensitive to rotation and translation of the object under analysis, making it faster and 
effective treatment and through image analysis. 
Finally, will be presented that the recognition model used is sufficiently robust to generate control signal and determine 
the action to be realized in applications in the most several areas and domains.

1. Introduction
The Computer Vision Systems technology is increasingly becoming more important. Its applications may be found in 
several areas, such as in industries, in medicine, in robots, etc. In the case of robots, the vision is indispensable. The 
vision systems for use with robots should be designed following to basic criterion (Groover et al., 1989):  
1st  - Relatively Low Cost; 
2nd  - Relatively Fast Response Time. 
In this work we use the first criterion. For this, we used a controlled working environment, to get sharp, clear images 
and with low-noise level. 
To construct the model presented here, angle histogram is used integrated with angles fuzzy clustering method 
proposed by (Bezdek et al., 1999; Klir and Yuan, 1997) adapted. 
To construct the architecture presented here is used modifications the fuzzy clustering method (Bezdek et al., 1999; 
Ross, 2016; Rosenfeld and Pal, 1988) integrated with angle histogram. This results in the faster than the original 
segmentation providing the recognition of moving images in real time. 
2. Computer Vision System Structure for Fuzzy Image Processing
The fuzzy processing of real time images used has three steps (Figure 1): fuzzification, operations in the plane of 
pertinence and defuzzification. 
The computer vision fuzzy system implemented in this work, was designed using an object-oriented structure. The 
various stages of image recognition process such as acquisition / scanning, segmentation, feature extraction and 
recognition, matching the structure of an artificial vision system are considered objects. 
As result of the implementation displays the following properties: a) Sensitivity - a change in the environment results 
in adjustments or minor changes in the software; b) Robustness - due to the high level of design and the relationship 
between modules remain constant even that requirements vary; c) Naturalness - the system modules correspond to the

Table 2. Characters of classification of results in % (*Character not recognized - Rejected) 
This list can be used, in case of not recognizing the object (character), through a grammatical context to recognize 
words, which in the case of letter recognition, is the next level in the recognition scale. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
The get results demonstrate that the method used is effective for controlled environments (brightness, background of 
very dark images). The was presented model in Figure 2, had correctly recognizing the objects, without the aid and in 
real time, in approximately 96% of the time. In 97.2% of the time it was recognized on the first try. And in 98% of 
the time the object was on the list of probable recognized objects (Figure 7). 
 
It was also observed that the system is quite robust, being able to recognize different geometric shapes (including 
characters), it this will be make possible the description of several standards in different knowledge areas. We was 
also demonstrate that with the inclusion of context information the system will can recognize also words and frases.

Abstract 
The capabilities of project managers determine the success of the projects. Nowadays, the standards of project 
management competence in the most advanced societies in the world are widely accepted. Several published articles 
and books in this area, and the increasing attention of organizations to the desirability of project management, also 
indicate its increasing importance. Developing a model for assessing the identification of project management based 
on the behavioral and professional principles in order to select, evaluate and enhance the human resources of the 
project will have a significant impact on the professional development and professional excellence of this specialized 
field in project-based organizations (PBOs). Over the years, knowledge of skills and knowledge for project success 
has been one of the most fundamental issues. In this study, the interpretive structural modeling (ISM) method is used, 
and then the competencies are ranked according to the given privileges. The findings of this study indicate that all of 
the competencies of a project manager are significantly related to achieving project performance in terms of leadership, 
organization, production management, technicality, and so on. Knowledge and experience of project management, 
leadership, knowledge and practical experience, industry knowledge and experience, and cognitive and individual 
effectiveness are among the most influential factors that have a significant impact on competency.

1. Introduction 
The competency of doing a job is far beyond being able to do it. Competency is a term beneficial, but for different 
people, it induces different concepts. Competence includes knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors that are related 
to better job performance (Bundy, 2004). A project manager would not be worthy of knowing the project management 
knowledge but rather being able to use it in addition to knowledge and also be able to handle the issues of human, 
social and behavioral issues. In most definitions of competency, all of these dimensions exist, and the only significant 
difference is in the type of vocabulary used. By definition, competency is a set of knowledge, encountering practices, 
skills, and other personal characteristics that affects a significant portion of a person’s job (for example, one or more 
responsibilities), is associated with performance in that job, can be measured according to entirely accepted standards, 
can develop and improve through education, and it can be broken into competency dimensions (Nicholas and Steyn, 
2017). 
The use of knowledge correctly results in proper performance, which is different from the experience, because 
someone may have done something wrong over the years. The ability to select the most suitable project manager 
shows organizational maturity in project management and is still a challenge for organizations (Kerzner and Kerzner, 
2017). Since the projects are undertaken as a tool for achieving the strategic goals of organizations, project managers

Abstract 
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are modular software that enable the integration of business processes 
in an organization with a central database. Users can reach to real time, accurate, one-source, and on-line 
information. SAP is the pioneer ERP vendor in the world with annual revenue of € 23.46 billion in 2017. This paper 
presents the implementation of SAP system at a public institution in Turkey. Reasons behind ERP implementation, 
vendor selection process, consultant selection process, and transition process are explained, and the methods used 
are described. The adaption of the institution to ERP system is summarized.

1. Introduction
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems are business-oriented data and business software packages that enable 
the integration of business processes in an organization (Markus and Tanis, 2000). Generally, ERP systems provide 
cross-organization integration of transaction-based data via business processes. These systems are modular for 
different functions of organizations like human resources, sales, finance, and operations. These software packages 
can be adapted to the specific needs of each organization adequate to determined limits (Esteves and Pastor, 1999). 
By providing universal, real-time access to operating and financial data, the systems allow companies to streamline 
their management structures, creating flatter, more flexible, and more democratic organizations (Davenport, 1998). 
ERP has become one of the largest, most important, and impactful IT investments and developments since 1990s 
(Al-Mashari, 2003; Kilic et al., 2014).   
It is expected that ERP systems support organization's founding activities and present its various management levels 
in a highly integrated manner. When integrated with business partners' systems beyond the limits of the individual 
business, such extended ERP systems, create value that goes beyond organizational boundaries. ERP can be an 
essential platform for an enterprise's information infrastructure. See Figure 1.  
Today, new term ERP II have been proposed by the Gartner Group as a business strategy and a set of collaborative 
operational and financial processes internally and beyond the enterprise. It is expected enterprises' requirements to 
publish critical information for collaborative commerce processes within communities of interest to cause ERP II to 
supplant ERP as the primary enabler of internal and interenterprise process efficiency (gartner.com). 
SAP is the pioneer ERP vendor in the world. It was started up in 1972 by five engineers in Mannheim, Germany. 
Today SAP is the world leader in enterprise applications in terms of software and software-related service revenue 
with annual revenue of € 24.74 billion in 2018. With years of history of innovation and growth as a true industry 
leader, SAP has more than 425000 customers in more than 180 countries, more than 96000 employees and locations 
in more than 130 countries, and more than 18000 partner companies (sap.com). This paper presents the 
implementation of SAP system at a public institution in Turkey in 2015 with the details of the project phases.

End-user training was part of this stage. It was necessary to minimize the inconveniences and difficulties that could 
be experienced after go-live. There were key users, but all the staff should have learned to use the system and they 
should have been informed.  
 
(5) Go-live 
Here, the new system was started to be used with all modules. 
 
5. Conclusions 
 
In this study, SAP transformation process of a public institution that conducts R&D work in Turkey were examined. 
The process of granting the decision to implement SAP system and all the events that took place during the project 
were discussed.  
 
Participation and support of management and users helped the SAP implementation project. The support of the ERP 
consulter, which provides installation, support and training services, also had a major effect on project success. With 
a single integrated ERP system, management started to run the institution more effectively and efficiently. The 
processes were revised and improved during the project. Effective reports were started to be prepared. User friendly 
screens were designed.  
 
The training program was an important issue that must be settled on the business processes of the enterprises. 
Training for all modules were organized. Training was necessary for effective use of the system and employees were 
trained throughout the installation process. Some of the personnel accustomed to using old systems were resisted the 
new system having new interface and function. They resisted to participate in trainings.  
 
During the testing stage, the requests from the units and the redirection of key users were very important. At this 
stage, staff change became more frequent, and key users were constantly changing. It caused some important points 
to be missed during the test and analysis stage. 
 
Management should take the ERP implementing decision after a detailed study. ERP projects extends frequently 
arranged time and spending plan. Some fail to deliver many of the promised benefits. Companies can overcome it by 
understanding the reasons behind. A significant number of the issues are not about technology but rather 
progressively about the project management issues. These projects need a serious change management as the 
organizations change the way of doing business. Lack of organizational change management experience may cause 
problem.

Abstract  
 
The research aims to apply Six Sigma to solve the quality problem of the collection center. It does not meet the final 
recycler's specification for 3% +/- 0.15% impurities in the delivered post-consumer polymer bales. By applying the 
first two phases of DMAIC a Cp = 0.26 and Cpk = - 4.9 was determined. After applying the last three phases, the 
improved indices are Cp = 1.8 and Cpk = 1.78. Therefore, it can be concluded that the post-consumer polymer 
collection center has an adequate and satisfactory process. With an average of 3% +/- 0.022% so it meets the 
impurity specifications of the final recycler.

1. Introduction 
 
Over the past eight years in Ecuador, the collection of post-consumer polymers by the Collection Centers (CC) has 
increased. This is due to the implementation of the ""Law of Environmental Promotion and Optimization of State 
Revenues"", published in the Supplement to the Official Gazette No. 583 of November 24, 2011. This is a green 
policy, where the Servicios de Rentas Internas del Ecuador (SRI) pays two US cents for each non-returnable plastic 
bottle collected by CC (Ministerio del Ambiente 2015). It is understood as a green policy to transfer the cost of 
environmental impact to the actors that originate it, in other words under the polluter pays principle (Perez 2016).  
 
The definition of collection centers is the intermediation of the volume of solid waste provided by the primary 
recyclers to the final recyclers. The primary recyclers are responsible for collecting and prequalifying solid waste in 
small volumes (Albán 2019).  This volume is collected in the collection center where the primary transformation of 
selection and compaction produce bales or bulk material of: post-consumer polymers, paper, cardboard, scrap metal 
among others (Organización Internacional del Trabajo 2013).  While the final recyclers receive the recycled material 
in bales or bulk to transform into raw material conditioned for industries (Cruz 2016; Herrera et al. 2019).  
 
The collection centers in Ecuador for their idiosyncrasy and little formal instruction from their owners. There is no 
development in the quality of post-consumer polymers and other materials that are sold to the final recycler. Such is 
the case of a collection center that has a cumulative average of 6% of impurities. The same impurities were 
determined by the final recycler when the bales were delivered to his facilities. This value does not comply with the 
impurity specification of 3 +/- 0.15% required by the final recycler. This leads to economic losses to the collection 
center, since the difference is not within specifications. It is discounted in the total weight of reception of the final 
recycler.  
 
From this problem, the present research is born in order to comply with the specification of 3% + / - 0.15% impurity 
of the final recycler. In each delivery of post-consumer polymers from the collection center. For which the Six 
Sigma - DMAIC methodology will be applied to solve the problem. Therefore, the collection center will no longer 
have economic losses due to impurity discounts.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

variability in the production process. They indicate the priority we must give to personnel management, the 
technology involved in the transformation and the timely evaluation of the results generated. 
e. Control of improvements in the collection center. 
 
Figure 7 shows the monitoring of impurities detected by the final recycler. These data are visualized in a graph of 
individual variable control, which is intended to track the results obtained to maintain them over time. 
 
 
Figure 7. Monitoring of impurities found by the final recycler. 
 
Figure 7 shows that the results are within the specification of the final recycler, so the working group was 
recognized at the weekly meeting. In case the impurities detected by the final recycler are out of specification. The 
post-consumer polymer collection center working group will define, measure, analyses and implement action plans 
to keep the results within the client's specifications. This initiates a cycle of continuous improvement in the process 
of selection and compaction of post-consumer polymers, in order to maintain the results. 
 
In the stages of defining, measuring and analyzing the DMAIC methodology, the diagnosis of the Post-Consumer 
Polymer Collection Center was determined. In which it was identified that: a) They do not meet the specifications of 
the final recycler with a Cp < 0.67 and Cpk < Cp, b) There is no investment in technological resources to improve 
the condition of the process and c) Lack of training for operational personnel to improve product quality. All this is 
due to the cultural idiosyncrasy of the guild and the lack of formal studies that facilitate its development.  
 
During the implementation stage, three activities were defined: 1) purchase of machinery (manual selection band) to 
improve the operating condition of the process, 2) elaboration and implementation of a training program to improve 
the elimination of impurities. From this data was obtained within the range of specifications: impurities of 3% with a 
standard deviation of 0.022%, Cp > 1.78 and Cpk > 1.25 which means that the capacity of the process is adequate 
and satisfactory. Validation of the Cp versus Cpk capability indices implies that the mean is practically at the center 
of the final recycler specification. All this shows that the quality capacity of post-consumer polymer bales has been 
improved through the application of DMAIC methodology.   
 
Finally, in order to maintain and control the results obtained, the discipline of weekly meetings of the working group 
was considered. Where the results will be updated and reviewed within a control chart, to find opportunities for 
improvement. This activity will allow communication within the Collection Centers, as well as the interaction 
between: final recycler, administration of the collection center and operation of the process. This will guarantee 
results and promote a culture of continuous improvement in the workers. 
 
4. Conclusions 
In the Defining phase of the DMAIC methodology, the problem of the final recycler was determined using the VOC 
tool. This refers to a 6% average accretion of impurities in the delivery of post-consumer polymers by the CC. This","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

is composed of: 3% for mixing colors, 2% for mixing polymers and 1% of other materials. Therefore, it is concluded 
that the final recycler requires the CC to enter the 3% +/- 0.15% impurity specification. 
 
In the measuring phase, the process capacity indicators Cp = 0.26 and Cpk =-4.94 were determined. The Cp > 0,67 
and Cpk < 0, determines that the capacity of the post-consumer polymer conditioning process in the A.C. is not 
adequate and is out of specification. The Cpk < Cp determines that the capacity of the conditioning process is out of 
specification. Therefore, it is concluded that the CC needs deep improvements to enter the specification of 3% +/- 
0.15% impurity. 
 
In the phase to analyze and improve the root causes that generate the variation and action plans for the adjustment of 
the process were determined. It is determined that the source of variability is the lack of training and machinery for 
the operation of the process. Through the implementation of training and selection band the process was adjusted. 
This generated an improvement in the capacity indexes of Cp = 1.8 and Cpk = 1.79. Therefore, it is concluded that 
the post-consumer polymer conditioning process is within the specification of 3% +/- 0.15%. 
 
In order to finish in the stage to control in the CC graphs of impurity control and discipline of weekly meetings of 
follow-up were determined. With which the long-term sustainability of the desired results was achieved. With which 
it is concluded that a space is provided to elaborate new cycles of improvement DMAIC in the processes of the CC.

Abstract 
The general objective of the project consisted in the design of mobile robotic platform that allows to perform 2d 
SLAM experiments with range sensors, for this purpose a probabilistic approach was used with estimation techniques 
and Bayesian filters. On the other hand, we also investigated the elements (hardware) that allow to develop this project. 
Using a range sensing sensor in conjunction with a Raspberry Pi 3 as a robot brain and a modified commercial robotic 
platform as a base structure, RasPi_mBot was developed and through packages in the robotic operating system called 
Hector_Slam and Gmapping_slam were run simultaneous localization and mapping experiments in controlled 
environments.

1. Introduction
The guidance and purpose pursued by robotics and Artificial intelligence lies in expanding the range of applications 
of robots, however, this is possible only if we endow them. With higher degrees of autonomy, that is why mobile 
robots require Get data from your environment and process them quickly to make effective decisions with minimal 
intervention from a human operator. In this context, one of the biggest problems facing this type of robots is the 
localization and mapping of environments. At present, different techniques have been developed to solve this problem. 
In recent years, mobile robots have been the subject of preferred research in many laboratories and universities. This 
is because they are excellent teaching platforms and application of theories and techniques, also having applications 
in many fields of industry, militia, and even home. 
In Ecuador, institutions of higher education, where technical careers related to robotics are offered are insufficient and 
do not have specific equipment for the realization of practices. Most of these are only made up of industrial robots, 
consisting of articulated arms that are subject to a base. According to the above, the research carried out in the country's 
universities is also scarce. Proof of this, there are few antecedents related to research within the field of autonomous 
robots discussed below: In the PUCESA has implemented a multipurpose platform based on a robot explorer as 
didactic material for School of Systems (Hernández, 2015); The University of Azuay has developed a robot for 
mapping and exploration of underground mines (Cabrera & Delgado, 2014); And in the ESPOL was designed and 
implemented a team of autonomous robots that plot decisions in real time applied to robotic soccer (Villarroel, 2015). 
This project implements a mobile robotic platform based on range sensors, to be used as a useful tool for testing

4. Conclusions 
 
• 
Through bibliographic research, it is determined that the methods currently used for localization and 
instantaneous mapping in autonomous mobile robots have two approaches, the bio-inspired and the 
probabilistic. Of which, those based on probability estimation techniques are the most developed to date. It 
is important to emphasize that, thanks to the existence of ROS, many of these techniques have been able to 
translate into algorithms computations that are distributed in the form of open source license packages. 
Between the SLAM packages of ROS the 'gmapping' and 'hector_slam' stand out. 
 
• 
To determine the hardware and software requirements of the mobile robotic platform, some criteria were 
established, of which the robustness, scalability and price were the most imposing. As a base structure, an 
educational platform was used for its expansion capacity and the inclusion of dc motors; As a computer on 
board, the well-known Raspberry Pi in its version 3 model B was chosen for its ROS support and its wireless 
communication capabilities; and as a main sensor element, a Lidar sensor for its ROS support and its 360 ° 
scan capability. 
 
• 
In the assembly of the mobile robotic platform, the main challenge was the provision of hardware 
components, so it was necessary to make adaptations of the commercial platform, mainly adding support for 
the Lidar sensor and for the onboard computer. 
 
• 
Finally, to evaluate the operation of the mobile robotic platform, a test protocol was established, which 
consisted of individual test of components and an integral test, in which ROS SLAM packages were executed 
in different controlled environments with good results.

Abstract 
To be competitive, companies must constantly innovate, and having efficient and well-managed supply chains is 
undoubtedly an important success factor. In the case of spare parts manufacturing, supply chain management is a 
very complex and arduous task. Quite often, spare parts have to be produced for products that have been on the 
market for very long, with the need to keep a large and varied stocks to ensure supply service level. With an 
increasing investment in the development and applications, the Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology can yield 
significant benefits to spare parts manufacturing. AM allows the production of parts with a high level of 
customization, without the need for setups, and helps to decrease costs, inventory levels and lead time. This new 
reality creates numerous challenges, forcing the design reformulation of traditional supply chains, and leading to an 
allocation of the production of certain types of parts downstream. This paper proposes a simulation model to address 
the use of the 3D printing technology on the supply chain of an elevator maintenance service provider. The 
simulation model allows the assessment of new supply chain designs, measuring their performance, thus avoiding 
the need of experimenting new solutions in the real system.

As shown in Table 1 and Table 2, the theoretical and the simulation results are slightly different. This difference 
reflects the stochastic component of the simulation. The simulation results have a more realistic behaviour, as the 
model takes into account some unexpected events, such as stock outs. From the theoretical results, this could not be 
predicted as these results were generated using static input parameters, while the simulation used probability 
distributions to simulate the demand for spare parts and transportation times.  
 
The differences between the theoretical and simulation results are small, and the logic and the behaviour of the 
experimental case simulation model worked as expected. Considering the experimental case results and given that 
the classes developed have been validated, it is possible to build new simulation models for supply chain designs, as 
expected.  
 
6. Conclusion 
 
The main objective of this work was to develop a simulation model capable of measuring the impact of using the 
additive manufacturing technology (3D printing) in a supply chain. After defining the main features and 
requirements of the system, classes representing the supply chain entities were created to model their logic and 
behaviour. Then, a simulation model of the company’s supply chain was built. A series of dashboards was produced 
to visualize the KPIs and cost breakdown of the system, and to support the analysis of the results generated by the 
model. 
 
The developed model allows the end user to test the installation of additive manufacturing cells (with different 
production capacities) in any of the internal facilities of the simulated supply chain, and measures the impact of 
these changes with KPIs and cost breakdown dashboards when the model runs. Since the classes represent different 
entities of the supply chain, they provide the model with some flexibility to add or remove entities. With this feature, 
the model is able not only to test the impact of additive manufacturing, but also the impact of removing or adding a 
new internal facility or external supplier, and/or products to the supply chain. 
 
In the work described in this paper, the simulation model was applied for a specific case study, but the model is 
more general, encompassing other characteristics that can be very interesting in practice. The model was tested and 
validated using an illustrative instance of a supply chain that was designed specifically for that purpose.  
Nevertheless, this model can be applied not only to other supply chains that want to evaluate the use of additive 
manufacturing in their chains, but also to supply chains of other industrial sectors that want to try some changes in 
their processes, without compromising the real systems. The model developed in this work could also become a 
powerful to support the supply chain managers in decision making processes and in getting insights about the cost 
breakdown and KPIs of their company’s supply chains.

Abstract 
Let us that ethics is a branch of philosophy that includes the study of morality, virtue, duty, happiness and 
good living. Assesses human actions and reflect about how to deal with the responsibilities and rights that 
we professionally speaking. With this background the ethical is not very different in the area of computer 
science because it involves privacy issues, authorship, theft and abuse, to name a few. It is essential to 
establish a set of rules governing professional conduct for computer professionals. Computing raises new 
situations, problems and challenges where much of these new situations and problems are of an ethical 
nature; obviously there are attempts to solve these problems by applying the current rules and general ethical 
solutions, so it is important to take the view past for best traditional ethical values. ICT's (Information 
Technology and Communications) are rapidly changing the world we know today, and from an ethical point 
of view, the most important and obvious is the need for a new ethic. This new ethic is the ethic of 
Engineering and Software Development.

Abstract 
The deterioration of the natural environment is one of the most demanding challenges in the twenty-first century and 
governmental authorities and scientific community seems to agree that emissions caused by transport are one of the 
major causes for the current climate change and pollution problems around the globe. To attenuate these detrimental 
effects, eco-driving has been proposed as a measure to reduce fuel consumption and pollution and to increase road 
safety and the welfare of drivers. Eco-driving is known as a series of driving practices that are being promoted because 
of its positive cost-benefit balance, although its short-term effects have also been proven.  
This study aims to add to the knowledge gap regarding our understanding of eco-driving by analyzing the motivations 
drivers have for a more eco-driving behavior. A survey was applied to professional drivers from a bus company 
operating in the Northern Mexico, with a fleet of more than 700 buses, 260 routes, and 2,000 daily departures. 
Questionnaire includes five sections: knowledge on eco-driving, intention of adoption and motivations for driving 
eco-friendly; and social norms, barriers and incentives in the adoption of eco-driving company initiatives.  This work 
shows the results obtained and how they can help guide the company to develop the corporate reinforcement –both 
positive and negative– strategies for its drivers.

Abstract 
The interest in the cluster approach as a strategy for achieving regional competitiveness has 
become relevant nowadays. Organizations in common industries with similar operations are 
creating synergies to get access for services and customers that are more sophisticated. 
Agglomeration among companies of logistics service activities is a phenomenon becoming more 
evident in the current regional economies. 
To reduce logistics costs, increase regional prosperity and create integrated strategies for a specific 
geographical region to compete in a changing environment is imminent. The purpose of this 
research is to identify the influence of agglomeration and the readiness to create synergies in some 
of logistics activities such as transportation services.  
Since the Northeastern region in Mexico is very active on international trade operations, and a 
critical mass of transportation services is intensive, the region is the focus of this study. The data 
gathered was from transportation firms’ executives and secondary data sources. The first part of 
the study is a comparison of the evolution in different regions where these groups of firms have 
been stablished and their impact in competitiveness according to the occupied personnel, wages 
and total investment. 
On the second part of the research, the data analysis technique applied as part of the methodology 
was multivariate linear regression, to test the impact of the agglomeration and synergies in the 
specified region to affect competitiveness.  
As a result, the statistical significance of geographical allocation of the agglomeration and their 
intent to create synergies was display to contrast the hypothesis associated to the capabilities of 
the transportation logistics firms to become a cluster in the selected region, and their implications 
on supply chains.

Abstract (12 font) 
In this paper, we consider a retailer adopting the “omnichannel” sales policy that offers customers a more 
convenient option for shopping and buying. The retailer operates both a physical and a web-based online 
store. The web-based channel provides customers better shopping conveniences and detailed product 
information through websites and mobile apps; whereas physical store allows customers to physically 
inspect or even experience the product in the store the product before making a purchase decision. Due to 
the uncertainty in product valuation, customers may end up returning the product purchased for a full or 
partial refund. Hence, we develop a stylized game theoretic model to study the impact of consumer return 
strategies on retail sales and profitability. We show that product value and refund policy determine the 
online customer's choice of returning products through “online”, or at “store”. Our analysis identifies the 
ideal conditions under which each return policy is beneficial to the retailer. Further, we find that under full 
refund policy, the price of the product increases.

Abstract 
Effects of different shading regimes (dense, moderate, and no shade) on the fruiting pattern of 2-3 years old cacao was 
investigated at the Teaching and Research Farm of the Federal University of Technology Akure, Nigeria between 
October 2014 to April 2015 which marks the first production season of the cacao plants. Plantain shade and no shade 
treatments that have been imposed on the cacao from establishment were studied to determine its effect on the fruiting 
pattern and yield. The treatments were dense shade, moderate shade and no shade which were arranged in a completely 
randomized design. No shade treatments significantly influenced pod production compared to dense and moderate 
shade at every period of data collection. More so, no significant difference was observed in the number of pods produced 
between moderately shaded plots and the densely shaded plots. No significant difference was observed among the 
treatments in weight of one pod, but the total pod weight was significantly higher under no shade compared with dense 
and moderately shaded plots. A number of beans per pod were not different significantly among the three-shade 
treatments. However fresh weight of bean per pod was significantly higher under no shade over other shade treatment. 
The total bean weight per treatment was significantly higher in no shade treatment compared to dense and moderately 
shaded plots. It was generally observed that pod production pattern in 2-3-year-old cacao production was positively 
influenced under no shade compared with dense and moderately shaded cacao.

Introduction 
Cacao is a tropical green tree which was originated from American and later adopted and now been cultivated by most 
West Africans countries(Heiser, 2016). Cacao has been identified as a valuable cash crop in Nigeria, it looks like a 
bean in form of seeds in which likes of cocoa and cocoa butter were extracted. It is grown mainly by about 80% of 
the small-scale farmers of west African region. Cacao has contributed immensely in boosting economic growth of 
Nigeria and has facilitated a substantial increase in the employment rate of the country(Lasisi, Olayinka, 2017).  
Cacao which is the main producer of cocoa is of great economic importance to foreign exchange earnings, production 
of beverages and chocolate, cocoa juice, cream, organic nutrient sources, employment generation, ornamental, among 
others has drastically enhanced income generation and has a positive impact on Nigeria economy(Uzochukwu, 2017,

Arowolo et al., 2016, Noble, 2017). 
Cocoa which is a product of cacao was primarily consumed by the people of mo kaya, an ethnic group in the southern 
part of Mexico. Spaniards were the ones who introduced cocoa consumption to the European community, during this 
period, it was mainly consumed by the royal families owing to its cost before it later became a popular beverage in

4.0  Conclusion and Recommendation 
Cocoa should be grown under no shade condition provided there is adequate provision for irrigation during the dry 
season and this will improve bean yield and quality in terms of average bean weight. It was also concluded that dense 
shade reduces pod formation in cacao. Pruning and dry season irrigation are recommended for cacao production.

Abstract 
The automatic Beerkan Assessment of soil Transfer Parameter procedure of soil hydraulic classification was 
adopted to evaluate in-situ saturated hydraulic conductivity of a sandy loam alfisol, also known as fertile soil. The 
study adopted an experimental site of about 22m long and 20m wide with 2m by 2m grid points staked out. The 
required infiltration tests were carried at 25 randomly selected grid points at 20cm depth interval to 100cm depth 
except where limiting dense concentration sublayer was encountered. The infiltrometer was a 2.3mm thick steel ring 
of 8.4cm internal diameter and height 8cm driven to a depth of 3cm. The tests lasted until steady state rate was 
achieved. Bulk soil samples were obtained from each test point for the determination of initial gravimetric 
content, a hydrometer experimental method was used to obtain the particle size distribution and core samples 
where used for the determination of post infiltration of the soil water content and the respective bulk density of the 
initial gravimetric soil moisture content were determined at different ranges.

Introduction
Understanding the dynamics wilderness of soil hydraulic features is very crucial for the simulation of water movement in 
the soil, which is useful in understanding fluid flow and transport processes and design of irrigation systems. The act 
of water moving in the soil transpire under some conditions which might be either under saturated or unsaturated situation 
because of the pores which are existing in the soil mass. Soil hydraulic characteristics can be attained via laboratory and 
field quantification. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is dependent on soil property, it is sensitive to the soil sample. 
Among the important soil hydraulic properties is the soil hydraulic conductivity which can be determined in the 
laboratory or on the field. The laboratory determination of hydraulic conductivity rarely represents the field condition 
because it is usually carried out on a disturbed soil core obtained from the field. There has been extensive field 
determination of   hydraulic conductivity but very of such relates to local soils especially in the case of Nigeria. 
Beerkan method of determining saturated hydraulic conductivity has been used in many studies of infiltration 
variability(Braud et al., 2005, Di Prima et al., 2018, Bagarello et al., 2014). The Beerkan method is more attractive and 
economically suitable in the characterization of the hydraulic features of loamy soil than other traditional hydraulic 
characterization methods which are technically and are very expensive(Aiello et al., 2014). 
Lassabatere et al. (Lassabatere et al., 2006) illustrated the Beerkan approach which was targeted at estimating 
the features of soil transfer parameters named as BEST, the approach was established to deduce the water preservation 
curve as well as the hydraulic conductivity curve as described by their shape and scale restrictions. The Beerkan approach 
appraises the shape parameters through the analysis obtained though the particle size distribution investigation as well 
as the scale parameters deduced from the infiltration experimentations which was at insignificant pressure head. Based 
on several studies which has been carried out using the BEST approach, it seems the BEST method is found suitable 
and easy to use and as well its affordable in terms of cost in carrying out characterization of hydraulic features of soil. 
In this procedure, an easy field infiltration test is required using a ring at the soil surface to evaluate both the saturated

From the result in table 4, it indicated that the value of bulk density for most of the test point increased with depth, 
while the saturated hydraulic conductivity reduced with increase in bulk density. 
5. Conclusions and Recommendations 
In this research, Beerkan Assessment of soil Transfer Parameter procedure of soil hydraulic classification was adopted 
to evaluate in-situ saturated hydraulic conductivity of a sandy loam alfisol, also known as fertile soil. Following the aim 
of the research, an evaluation between the anticipated data as well as the field measured data was determined. From the 
results obtained, it was observed that the bulk density at the surface ranged from 1.254g/cm3 to 1.438g/cm3 and averaged 
1.352g/cm3, bulk density at 20cm depth ranged from 1.356g/cm3 to 1.469g/cm3 and averaged 1.38g/cm3, bulk density at 
40cm depth ranged from 1.362g/cm3 to 1.701g/cm3 and averaged 1.476g/cm3, bulk density at 60cm depth ranged from

1.402g/cm3 to 1.674g/cm3 and averaged 1.551g/cm3, bulk density at 80cm depth ranged from 1.449.g/cm3 to 1 823g/cm3 
and averaged 1.666g/cm3, bulk density at 100cm depth ranged from 1.601g/cm3 to 1.74g/cm3 and averaged 1.680g/cm3. 
The Beerkan Estimation of soil Transfer analysis estimated the slope, intercept, sorptivity, saturated hydraulic 
conductivity and we observed that the Sorptivity at the surface ranged from 0.159 (mms-0.5) to 0.299 (mms-0.5), Sorptivity 
at 20cm depth ranged from 0.12 (mms-0.5) to 0.031 (mms-0.5), Sorptivity at 40cm depth ranged from 0.131 (mms-0.5) to 
0.26 (mms-0.5), Sorptivity at 60cm depth ranged from 0.029 (mms-0.5) to 0.17 (mms-0.5), Sorptivity at 80cm depth ranged 
from 0.07 (mms-0.5) to 0.18(mms-0.5), Sorptivity at 100 cm ranged depth from 0.017(mms-0.5) to 0.14(mms-0.5), 
Saturated hydraulic conductivity at surface ranged from 0.0028, Saturated hydraulic conductivity at 20cm depth ranged 
from 0.0019, Saturated hydraulic conductivity at 40cm depth ranged from 0.0019, Saturated hydraulic conductivity at 
60cm depth ranged from 0.029(mms-1) to 0.17(mms-1), Saturated hydraulic conductivity at 80cm depth ranged from 
0.07(mms-1) to 0.18(mms- 1), Saturated Hydraulic conductivity at 100cm depth ranged from 0.017(mms-1) to 0.14(mms-
1). 
Conclusively, Beerkan Assessment of soil Transfer is an auspicious methodology suitable in classifying a soil, though 
needs to be modified to suit this specific situation which is presently been considered. It is recommended that geostatistical 
method should be used as a framework for the study of spatial variability of the measured soil properties from this study. 
The study should also be repeated on different soil type.

Abstract 
Inspection lines are a heavy duty yet expensive part in many industries such as wireless 
communication industry, auto industry. While inspection is always a necessary evil in a very 
complicated and competitive industry, there is a strong need to reduce the unnecessary inspection 
processes and resources to improve the competitiveness. This work develops a framework to 
apply big data analytics to improve the inspection processes based on case study method. A 
world class case company is selected and the data-warehouse is established for a specific lot of 
products. After the data pre-processing work, the relationships among the detection stations and 
the detection results could be found. Various meta-models are used, which including association 
rule method to find the correlation between different test items and to reduce the number of 
required tests.  Decision tree is also applied to find the optimal controllable factor. Finally, the 
developed rules are further verified by empirical data. Based on the empirical results, the number 
of detection items could be reduced by around 16.2% - a huge cost saving. It is also found out 
that the critical control factors, recommended by the decision tree, are temperature and humidity, 
which is a way to improve its quality without extra cost. The proposed big data application 
framework is therefore feasible in this case and machine learning or other models could be 
further extended, which is the future research direction.

1. Introduction 
Inspection is a very complicated process for the information and communication industry (ICT), 
auto industry, airline industry, and many consumers-oriented industries.  To main the quality, 
there are many specifications and standards are proposed and the companies have to spend many 
resources to verify the quality of the products. Many managers therefore argue that the 
manufacturing cost of each equipment could be dramatically reduced should some of the 
inspection process and/or related resources could be simplified. In practices, the settings of 
process parameters and the complexity of process combinations are difficult to predict and could 
simply by the experience of process engineers (Kudyba, 2014). In the modern era, Sarkar (2017) 
pointed out the potential of using big data, while Acharjya and Ahmed (2016) stated that there is 
currently no standard architecture that can solve all big data problems. This work proposes a big 
data analysis framework, considering the complex characteristics of manufacturing processes, 
and select a representative company in the WLAN industry to illustrate the feasibility of this 
framework.

(6). Interpretation and verification of results  
The association rule results of the first part are provided to the domain experts to justify the 
validity of the rules. A total of 10 rules were extracted and verified by another empirical data. 
Comparison is shown in Table 5. The reliability is used as the verification standard. The error of 
rule 4 is 0, which means the reliability is consistent. It can be verified that proposed new rules 
can reduce the number of detections by around 16.2%. 
 
After the above analysis is completed, the decision tree analysis, the decision tree model is put 
into the test data for verification, and to identify further operation parameters details. The output 
correctness rate of the binary confusion matrix is 0.95 (see Table 6) which is quite good.

Abstract 
 
For a company in the traditional manufacturing environment, such as a machine tool industry, 
how to adjust the workforce assignment during adopting lean production is a key issue. 
Consiering the complexity in manufacutirng various machine types, each requires a combination 
of the expertise in multiple techniques for one specific technician, arrange appropriate workforce 
is therefore not an easy job for the shop floor manager. This work proposes a systematic method, 
based on the mathematical programming, to resolve the issue of workforce assignment when 
receiving small-volume, large-variety orders in the machine tool industry. A case company is 
used to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this method. The proposed method starts 
with the drawing of Value Stream Mapping (VSM) and applies the seven principles of lean to 
design the to-be production system. An interger programming (IP) model is formed to find the 
optimal workforce assignment in re-designing the manufacturing process when various orders 
are received for the future VSM. Simulation results illustrate the potential performance of the 
model. A typical company which was quite representive in the machine tool industry was 
selected and its shop floor information was collected. For the case company, it was found out 
that the makespan could be reduced from 28.03 days to 12.5 days without additional manpower 
for a series of five orders with four machine types. The emprical results clearly demonstate that 
the proposed method is feasible and could be extended to other companies.

1. Introduction 
A machine tool is, in usual, heavy, large and difficult to move. It is assembled at a fixed position 
and the technicians work in turn according to their specific techniques such as scarping, accurate 
calibration, and laser calibration. It takes a while for a novice engineer to learn and practice the 
skills and act like an experienced worker. There are huge differences on the performance of 
workforces based on their experiences. Since the machine tool industry has the characteristics of 
multi-specification, small batch production model, and make to order, automation is therefore 
very difficult. On the other hand, lean production is a common practices in this type of the 
industry. Considering a company that is transforming toward lean manufacturing, this work 
proposes a systematic method, based on the integer programming model and lean thinking, to 
resolve the issue of workforce assignment in the machine tool industry. 
 
Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a tool that assists managers to understand the situation of the 
production line. The VSM can be used to improve the flow of information and materials thereby

The simulation results of future VSM showed that should the workforce assignment were 
arranged as planned, the employee utilization rate could be improved from 41.4% to 91.6% and 
the make-span could be reduced from 28.03 to 12.5 days. This demonstrates the importance to 
apply the IP model in making lean production practical in the machine tool industry.

Abstract 
As our technology evolves to be more patient oriented there is a bit of uncertainty about how the e-Health works 
from process view. While there are many security questions that needs to be solved before using an e-Health as a tool 
for a wide range of people, there is also a one about e-health itself. Field of e-Health is gaining more and more attention 
considering we are going through industry revolution 4.0. Our research provides process perspective on this issue 
including a risk analysis together with structured process map from patient/user to his social worker either doctor, 
nurse or other medical personnel. This model should serve as a basic template for better understanding and easier 
implementing an e-health almost anywhere.

Abstract 
Currently, the axes research majority aims to improve continually the quality of continuously cast products. Moreover, to 
guarantee this quality it is necessary to master operating parameters of casting machine, in particular, the primary cooling 
phase that takes place at level of ingot mold. The latter animated by an oscillatory movement, generally induces marks and 
defects on slab surface. Indeed, during descent, the solidified crust is in compression, thus creating a negative sliding, this 
sliding time will help reduce the sticking risk, to close the rips of solid skin   and to reduce the depth of oscillation marks. 
In addition, this time depends on casting speed and oscillation parameters of ingot mold (amplitude and frequency). The 
aim of this work is to optimize the operating parameters of ingot mold in this case the casting speed ""v"" and oscillations 
(amplitude ""a"", frequency ""f"") at  means of Box-Behnken’s experimental design thus makes it possible to predict the healing 
rate ""τ"" which represents the ratio of sliding time and  total cycle time. Mathematical model have been obtained and the 
results show that for the case of carbon steel slab, strong sheet with a thickness of 250mm, it is recommended to use low 
speeds (v = 0.6m.mm-1) and large frequencies (n = 200cpm) associated with average amplitudes (a = 10mm) to achieve a 
value of τmax = 0.470 ± 0.048. 
Keywords 
 Healing rate, optimization, experimental design, continuous casting, and primary cooling. 
1. Introduction
 In steel industry, continuous casting of slabs and billets is a steelmaking process strong widespread (Henri 2009), it is 
now widely used for mass production of various billets, slabs and sheet thin. This process occupies an important place in 
production spinneret because of low cost, higher production rates, energy saving and reduce manpower as well as 
improvement of product quality ( Bensouici 2007). Today the tendency of studies is towards a generalized process 
modeling (Fréderic 2004) (Qin Qin 2017) (Bellaouar 2007). During continuous steel casting, the primary cooling phase 
is an important step that directly affects the product quality (Heinrich 2003) (Akni.2011) (Cerrit  2007). Indeed, this 
cooling process takes place in a bottomless ingot mold, in which the liquid steel is poured continuously and is energetically 
cooled. The main function of ingot mold is to form a solid crust of sufficient thickness to eliminate the risk of breakthrough 
( Fei He 2018) (Xu Zening  2010) and minimize appearance of surface defects ( Wentao 2010) (Dukman 2009). However, 
the control of certain parameters affecting primary cooling mechanism such as heat transfer, lubrication and oscillation 
of ingot mold is essential in this process to achieve the desired quality product. As a result, the oscillatory movement 
contributes to reducing risk of bonding metal to walls, and ensures extraction without incident. (Farhi 2010). This practice 
is deemed to give a better surface quality and less pronounced oscillation marks. The interest of this work is to optimize 
the parameters that directly influence mechanism of operation of ingot mold in this case: the amplitude (a), frequency (n) 
and casting speed (v) to minimize the risk of breakthrough and improve the product quality. Box Behnken's experimental 
designs at three factors and three levels (-1, 0, +1) were adopted for Simulation, resulting in mathematical models for 
each case studied.

5. Conclusion 
The process of continuous steel casting is very complex and difficult to manage by fact that many phenomena interact 
at same time, master the parameters that govern it to improve productivity and product quality is the goal of all 
industrialists. In addition, the primary cooling in ingot mold is an essential step in this process, during this phase is forming 
a sufficiently strong skin to contain the liquid steel. Therefore, the adoption of parameters of machine (amplitude, 
frequency and speed) adequate will prevent the phenomenon of sticking and rips that may occur during exit of slab of the 
ingot mold. Furthermore, Box Behnken experimental designs can be a powerful tool for predicting most appropriate 
regime, which offers the best healing rate to allow consolidation of formed skin. Therefore, as a result of this simulation, 
mathematical model offer the advantage of predicting healing rate as a function of parameters (a, n and v) making it 
possible to optimization of this later contributes to clogging breaches of collage, to reduce  marks of oscillations  and 
mitigate  risk of breakthrough. Thus, for  case studied, low speeds respectively (v = 0.6m.mm-1) and  high frequencies (n 
= 200cpm) as well as  average amplitudes (a = 10mm) are  most interesting parameters to improve the healing rate thus 
minimizing surface defects, thereby improving cast product quality.

Abstract 
With growing concerns on pollutant emissions from manufacturing processes, emission taxation is 
becoming increasingly popular by many governments, aiming to incentivize firms’ emission reduction 
efforts. In some industries, however, the amount of pollutant emissions largely depends on the quality of 
the raw materials provided by suppliers, in which case motivating the suppliers’ environmental innovation 
efforts could be crucial for an effective regulatory control of pollutant emissions. Nevertheless, many 
governments adopt the “polluter pays” principle and impose the emission taxes on the manufacturers. 
Hence, a key question for the regulator in this context is whether such a tax burden on the manufacturers 
can effectively incentivize the suppliers’ environmental innovation through the supply chain contracts 
chosen by the profit maximizing manufacturers. Thus motivated, this paper studies the impact of supply 
chain contracts in the presence of emission taxation on supplier’s environmental innovation by analyzing a 
monopoly model where the manufacturer sources raw material from a single supplier. We consider three 
contracts commonly observed in practice in this type of settings: i) wholesale price contract; ii) quality 
requirement contract; and iii) cost sharing contract. We find that the impact of each contract is quite 
different and show why increasing tax pressure may not necessarily enhance the supplier’s innovation 
effort. More importantly, our result shows that a very mild tax intensity can be most effective in maximizing 
the supplier’s environmental innovation investment. This result alleviates the widely agreed concern that 
emission taxation may negatively impact the end product market and hurt welfare. In addition, we show 
that it does not matter to whom the environmental tax is charged, and accordingly, double counting of 
emissions, i.e., charging the emission tax on the supplier as well, may discourage the supplier’s 
environmental innovation for all contracts we consider. Our results highlight the importance of 
understanding the impacts of the supply chain contracts for the regulator to effectively motivate firm’s 
environmental innovation via emission taxation without severely choking the business.

Abstract  
 
The increasing emphasis on overall power system efficiency has resulted in continued growth in the application of 
devices such as high-efficiency, adjustable-speed motor drives and shunt capacitors for power factor correction to 
reduce losses. This is resulting in increasing harmonic levels on power systems and has many people concerned 
about the future impact on system capabilities. 
 
Newer-generation load equipment, with microprocessor-based controls and power electronic devices, is more 
sensitive to power quality variations than was equipment used in the past. Both electric utilities and end users of 
electric power are becoming increasingly concerned about the quality of electric power. End users have an increased 
awareness of power quality issues. Utility customers are becoming better informed about such issues as 
interruptions, sags, and switching transients and are challenging the utilities to improve the quality of power 
delivered. 
 
The modern electric power systems that include non-linear loads may experience power quality problem such as 
harmonic distortion. Non-linear loads draw current that passes through all the impedances between the loads and the 
system sources. The current causes power quality problems. 
The harmonic problems are mainly due to substantial increase of non-linear loads such as the SMPS, UPS, VSD 
using power electronic devices or microprocessor and power electronic controllers in AC/DC Transmission links. 
 
Simulation studies and tests will be carried out on rectifiers and inverters in VSD applications and results analyzed 
to study their impact on the system and suggest methods to improve power quality by reducing harmonic levels.The 
harmonic analysis would be performed and their effects on the motors and transformers studied. The variable speed

Abstract 
The way Filipinos dress has been evolving over the years; thus, the rental business is rapidly emerging in the fashion 
industry. As the population grows, fashion business needs to arise to cope with the demand in the society. LMFH 
Company, as the market leader and supplier in the industry for more than fifty years of existence, has to integrate 
approaches to keep their proven track record of quality service. However, the company is currently experiencing 
performance issues due to the ineffective outfit rental payment system that is affecting the whole operation. 
The study aims to reinforce the goal of the company towards quality service by addressing the performance issues and 
improving the capability, capacity and competency of outfit rental fee processing system.  The study made use of 
interview, questionnaire, observation and document analysis to acquire data. Queuing analysis, PIECES framework, 
data flow diagram are employed to analyze the data.  
The results showed miscalculation of amounts payable, lack of document control, and double booking of rented items. 
Installation of rental payment software with data visualization, integration of barcode system, and worker levelling 
are then proposed.

Abstract 
In this study, we explored the characteristics profile of traditional fishing boats in the three regencies of East Java, 
Indonesia, namely: Lamongan, Probolinggo, and Pasuruan. We presented the characteristics profiles of traditional 
fishing boats by using indicators and dimensions of product quality. We found the differences of traditional boats 
among these three regencies such as the GT size and the hull construction shape. The results showed that the GT size 
in Lamongan is from 24 to 50 GT sizes on average, whereas in Probolinggo and Pasuruan is below 30 GT ones. The 
hull shape in Lamongan is uniform with U-shape. Meanwhile, the hull shape in Probolinggo and Pasuruan is varies 
with U-shape and V-shape. The similarities among these 3 regencies are in the type of fish catching tools, machinery, 
and equipment. The majority fishermen used trawl automatically for larger than 13 GT sizes and net for below 10 GT 
sizes. In machinery, inboard system is used by vessels for larger than 13 GT. Meanwhile, the equipment used is 
standard, such as: lamp, compass, and audio. By studying the characteristics profile in the 3 regencies helps the 
standardization of traditional fishing boats in Indonesia.

1. Introduction
Most fishermen used traditional boats in East Java, Indonesia. Traditional boats are made from wood. There are some 
places in East Java that still produce these traditional vessels, such as: Lamongan, Probolinggo, and Pasuruan 
regencies. Each regency has their own uniqueness in building boats. We aim to compare the uniqueness among these 
three regencies.  
There are several limited studies of traditional boats. Son and Kim (2014) discussed about job assignment in ship hull 
construction. The results showed that the assignment of hull blocks to design engineer were done efficiently in 
business process management system. Liu et al. (2018) designed bilge keel for traditional boats in Indonesia. The 
results show that the installation of bilge keels increased operational efficiency, reduced fuel costs and fuel emissions. 
Praharsi et al. (2018) studied about product quality characteristic of traditional boats. They provided the lines plan in 
order to re-build the traditional boat at the same size.   
In this study, we aim to compare the characteristics profile of traditional boat products quality among three regencies 
in East Java, i.e.: Lamongan, Probolinggo, and Pasuruan. For comparison study, we follow the dimensions of products

3.4 The Similarities and differences of traditional boats in Lamongan, Probolinggo, and Pasuruan 
The similarities of traditional boats among Lamongan, Probolinggo, and Pasuruan are in the machinery, fish catching 
tools, and equipment. In machinery, inboard system will be used for   larger than 13 GT sizes. The driving machine 
brand used are varies such as Mitsubishi, Yanmar, Fusso, Hyundai, and Kubota. The vessel average speed is 7 miles 
per hour. Fish catching tools used is trawl automatically for larger than 13 GT sizes. Otherwise, they will use net for 
less than 10 GT sizes. Overall, the equipment used is lamp, compass, TV and its sound system.   
 
The differences of traditional boats among Lamongan, Probolinggo, and Pasuruan are in the hull construction and the 
GT sizes. The majority of hull construction in Lamongan has U-shape. Meanwhile, the majority of hull constructions 
in Probolinggo and Pasuruan have U and V-shapes. The majority of GT sizes in Lamongan is varies from 24 to 50 GT 
sizes, meanwhile the majority ones in Probolinggo and Pasuruan is below 30 GT sizes.  
4. Conclusion and future research  
We have presented the characteristics profile of traditional boats in Lamongan, Probolinggo, and Pasuruan by using 
indicators of product quality. The results show that the GT sizes in Lamongan is larger than Probolinggo and Pasuruan. 
The hull shape in Lamongan is uniform with U-shape. Meanwhile, the hull shape in Probolinggo and Pasuruan is 
varies with U-shape and V-shape. The majority type of fish catching tools in Lamongan is using trawl automatically, 
whereas the majority ones in Probolinggo and Pasuruan are using trawl and net. The same characteristics for fish 
catching tools among these 3 regencies are trawl used when the GT size is larger than 13 GT and net used when the 
GT size is lower than 10 GT. By studying the characteristics profile of traditional boats in 3 regencies helps the 
standardization of traditional boats in Indonesia. The future research could be carried by simulating and creating 
prototype of standardized traditional vessel according to those three regencies for the optimization of propulsion 
system. Another future research is supply chain management for standardized traditional fishing vessels.

Abstract 
Ports are important elements in the maritime transport system and thereby contribute in the development of the world’s 
economy. They can be poles of growth if they are well managed and supervised. Their performance management 
approach can affect significantly their competitiveness. This paper tries to enlighten on the complexity of the port 
system and the difficulty to set a single performance management model.  It presents port’s definitions and 
classifications, discusses a selection of port performance approaches and their limits, and highlight the necessity to 
use full potential of advanced analytics for a better definition of port performance evaluation program.

1. Introduction
Today, interdependency between the maritime transport and the world economy is apparent, the large volume of the 
international trade (more than 80%) performed by sea being its most obvious illustration.  Evidently, understanding 
and improving the maritime transport network will allow a better assessment of the world’s economic situation. 
One of the core elements in maritime transport system are ports. They are focal points handling intermodal transport 
connections, traditionally defined as sub-systems of the maritime industry or linking nodes in the sea network (Bichou 
(2014), Talley (2009)). However, the complexity of ports, which is a result of their several components and their 
interactions, can turn them into bottlenecks. In order to support a port in its mission to ensure social and economic 
growth, its performance strategy has to be carefully defined. Actually, port performance management is a challenge 
for its managers as well as a Government concern as efficient ports are key to economic development (Brooks 2006). 
Ports are facing many challenges whether associated to their complex structure or to the increasing traffic. According 
to the projections of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD/RMT/2018), world 
seaborne trade will expand at a compound annual growth of 3.8 per cent during the period 2018-2023, making ports 
more and more sophisticated.  
There are many approaches to ports classification (Bichou 2014) and definition, consequently the literature on port 
performance management offers several diverging approaches and models, and presents a range of tools and methods 
(Bichou 2006). Brooks and Pallis (2008) reported that the performance of ports has been extensively evaluated using 
efficiency criteria with an increasing employment of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) in ports production analysis, 
also a particular focus is on studying container ports efficiency (Brooks 2006). Furthermore, benchmarking of ports 
performance should consider groups of similar ports (Brooks 2006).  However, there is an issue to determine the 
benchmark elements in a convoluted port system, that is the reason behind addressing ports similarities from a 
geographical point of view only (Bichou 2006), which is an elementary dimension.  
Despite the variety of port performance measurement models, many gaps have been detected providing some scopes 
for more development. The widely used approach to port performance assessment, i.e. internal and external 
performance evaluation mostly defined as efficiency and effectiveness, has to be revisited with more contribution in 
quality measurement. Also, the scope of studies should consider different classification facets of ports (e.g. bulk 
private port, liquid landlord port) instead of limiting the scale to the type of cargos handled by the port (or ports) of 
interest (e.g. container, bulk). Another point is that the performance assessment approach for a port should reflect its

performance management model. However, further work in this area is still necessary to try to solve some difficulties 
faced by the port system.

Abstract 
This paper is an outcome of a student request to create a highly technical CAD (Computer Aided Design) portfolio to 
present during a co-op job interview for a CAD designer position. Co-op is mandatory at Northeastern University 
(NU). NU is located in Boston,MA and has the largest co-op education program in the U.S. The paper discusses the 
important elements of compiling a student portfolio. In the field of engineering, there is often a wide gap between 
students’ technical knowledge and their communication skills. The paper discusses portfolio concepts in general, then 
applies them to CAD.  It provides a sample CAD portfolio. It finally closes with a conclusion.

Abstract 
Metal materials used in industrial applications deteriorate under the effect mechanical and chemical phenomena 
occurring under operating conditions, such as pipes carrying gas or fluid that are subject to internal wall wear. From 
where an experimental study was conducted through friction tests on supermartensitic stainless steel Cr13Ni5Mo2, in 
order to estimate the effect of test parameters on friction coefficient and wear behavior of this steel by adopting the 
factorial plans 22 methodology at two factors (Load ""P"" and linear sliding ""V""), each at two levels (-1, +1). The 
results have been demonstrated using a mathematical model predicting the coefficient of friction ""f"" in every point of 
the study field. The factorial plans make it possible to establish a modeling of the studied phenomenon with a 
maximum of efficiency and a minimum of experiences. The experimental results showed that the friction coefficient 
""f"" reaches a max value for an applied load P=10N combined with a linear speed V=5cm/s. In addition, the wear 
morphology of surfaces after the friction test indicates that for 2N and at all speeds, friction is dominated by an 
abrasive wear mechanism. However, for 10N, it is observed the predominance of adhesive wear with a higher wear 
rate.

1. Introduction 
The concept of supermartensitic stainless steels (SMSS) was introduced in the late 1950s. Since the early 1990s, the 
petroleum industry has been promoting the development of corrosion and wear-resistant alloys for pipeline 
applications [Zepon and al. (2013)]. Low carbon martensitic stainless steel called super martensitic stainless steel 
(SMSS) has a unique combination of good mechanical properties, corrosion resistance and low production cost, 
improved weldability and ease of heat treatment, have promoted their uses in the manufacture of tubular products 
for oil wells, including special seamless tubes for drilling, tubes for oil and gas wells [Anselmo and al. (2006)]-[Da-
kun and al. (2014)]. Recently, a number of new martensitic grades called ""Super 13Cr"", SMSS has been developed 
and specially applied to pipes in wells at treatment plants, carrying untreated fluid (crude oil or gas) at very high 
pressure and temperature [Singh and al. (2013)], [Ma and al. (2012)], [Zou and al. (2014)], [Ma and al. (2011)]. 
However, in the case of strict tribological requirements, their low hardness and poor wear resistance limit their 
industrial applications where resistance to wear and corrosion is often required [Dalmau and al. (2014)]-[Xi and al. 
(2008)]. In general, metallic materials used in industrial applications deteriorate under the effect of mechanical 
and/or chemical phenomena occurring in their operating conditions [Dalmau and al. (2014)]. During the transport of 
the gas or fluid, the pipes undergo internal wear of the walls. This work fits into this context and aims to estimate the 
coefficient of friction and to evaluate the wear resistance of a supermartensitic stainless steel Cr13Ni5Mo2. The 
objective of this work is to present the type 22factor design methodology in order to predict the coefficient friction 
(f) by means of a mathematical model, which makes it possible to estimate the variation of (f) according to the 
parameters of friction tests (P, V).

4. Conclusion 
 
The coefficient of friction as well as the rate of wear is essential parameters which characterizes the lifetime of the 
materials. The experimental results obtained from friction tests using the methodology of factorial plans 22 
contribute to quantitatively evaluating the effects of test parameters on the friction coefficient. The following 
conclusions can be drawn: 
 
- The mathematical model developed allowed to predict the coefficient friction ""f"" according to test parameters (P 
and V) in field of study. 
- The friction coefficient as well as wear rate depend on the test parameters, namely: the applied load and the linear 
sliding speed as well as the surface state of sample. 
- The isoréponses curves obtained by the model show that when the two factors (P, V) are at their lowest level, the 
coefficient of friction (f) decreases as well as the rate of wear. 
- Whatever the sliding speeds (min, max), we notice the predominance of abrasive wear for 2N load and adhesive 
wear for 10N load with a higher wear rate.

Abstract 
With the increasing frequency of disaster and their impact, the global humanitarian agencies are facing challenges in 
responding to urgent requirements on timely basis. Therefore the aim of humanitarian organizations should be to 
increase the resiliency towards disaster among the societies. This would not only help to increase their effectiveness 
and efficiency but will also help in decreasing the impact of future disasters. Hence, this paper aims to identify and 
analyse the major driving factors for resilient humanitarian supply chain. Based on the literature review and experts 
opinion, eight factors were identified, which were then ranked using the TOPSIS methodology. Government support 
and policy formulation, strategy and capacity planning; and progress assessment of project was identified as the 
major driver factors. By managing these factors, humanitarian organizations can increase the resiliency and agility in 
the supply chain.

1.0 Introduction 
Even after the massive development in the supply chain management, the humanitarian organizations are not able to 
utilize the knowledge. This has lead to indiscriminate proportion of development in the commercial and 
humanitarian supply chain. Though there may be various differences between the commercial and humanitarian 
supply chain, but the fundamental chain for both, remains the same. This similarity can be used for analyzing and 
bringing resiliency in the humanitarian supply chain. 
According to UN reports, the number of disaster and their impact has raised manifolds as compared to 1970 
(ESCAP 2015). This calls for the immediate need to stream line the humanitarian operations to make them more 
efficient, responsive and agile. Therefor the concept of resilient humanitarian supply chain seems to be the most 
feasible solution. Resiliency towards the disaster and crisis would help to achieve short term and long term 
objectives of the organizations. Therefore, this paper aims at identifying the major driving factors for the resilient 
humanitarian supply chain and then ranking them using Technique for order preferences by similarity to ideal 
solution (TOPSIS) methodology. Remaining part of this study is organised as follows: Section 2 deals with literature 
review, Section 3 deals with theresearch methodology used to analyse the factors for bringing resilience in the 
humanitarian supply chain, Section 4deals with the results and analysis and finally, Section 5 is the concluding 
remark.

It is observed that government support and Policy formulation is the most important factor. Strategy and capacity 
planning is ranked second in this study. It helps to set the targets and lay the road map to achieve the targets (Fulzele 
et al., 2016).  Progress assessment of project is ranked third, it helps to identify the areas of improvement to achieve 
the desired targets. Collaboration and coordination among the stake holders is ranked fourth for achieving resilience 
in humanitarian supply chain. Application of technology and information system has been ranked fifth, whereas 
skilled and competent manpower has been ranked sixth. Problem assessment is ranked seventh, as it is very 
important to know the actual needs of the victims (Yadav and Barve,2015). Integrated logistics management is 
ranked eighth, because logistics constitutes 80% of the cost of disaster relief operation, thus logistics is very 
important from the humanitarian supply chain point of view (John et. al., 2016). 
 
5.0 Conclusion 
Disaster and crisis situations are known to give deep scars. Weather physical or psycological to the victims. Though 
the natural disaster can not be avoided but their impact can surely be decreased by the state of the art humanitarian 
supply chain. Resilient humanitarian supply chain has been identified as the appropriate goal to reduce the impact of 
the disasters. Total of eight driving factors have been identified and ranked for the resilient humanitarian supply 
chain. Government support and policy formulation; strategy and capacity planning has been identified as the major 
driving factors for resilient humanitarian supply chain. Findings imply that government should develop effective 
strtaegies and resources to enhance capacity of  organisations engaged  in humanitarian works to meet uncertain 
circumstances. Despite significant contribution, this study has some limitations. TOPSIS methodology applied has 
considered five decision makers. Therefore chances of biaed decisions are there. Empirical study may be considered 
to validate the results for generalisation of findings..

Abstract 
 
The paper develops a mathematical model for integrated production and maintenance scheduling to optimize 
backorder quantity. It is assumed that at the end of each uptime, deterministic preventive maintenance is scheduled to 
incur backlog to reduce inventory carrying cost. The overall incurred cost of the proposed mathematical model is 
derived and used as a basis for optimal determination of backorder quantity in joint production-inventory model. The 
proposed model is extended emphasis on increase in production rate accomplished through production overtime 
period. An optimal overtime production period (𝑇𝑃′) is determined to minimize backordering cost per unit time in the 
joint production-inventory model. Wide variety of situations and effects are discussed for the extended production-
inventory model. The model is validated with illustrating numerical examples, and sensitivity analysis to show the 
effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed integrated model.

1. Introduction 
In a manufacturing environment, both raw materials stored in inventory and machines in production are subjected to 
deterioration and process failure. Continuous usage of manufacturing machines without maintenance reduces machine 
reliability which results in out-of-state quality products with an upsurge in the cost of nonconformance (Sana and 
Chaudhuri 2010; Dhouib 2012). Regular maintenance of manufacturing machines will lessen nonvalue-added process 
(Chelbi and Ait-Kadi 2004) and restore manufacturing machine to produce statistically in-control quality products 
(Dhouib 2012). 
 
Maintenance is a set of activities performed during regular production without interrupting and some maintenance 
activities performed during production downtime (Sana and Chaudhuri 2010) namely servicing (aligning and verifying 
sensor operation, replacing filters), lubricating (flushing and topping of fluids), fastening, and inspections (leaks and 
cracks). These maintenance activities are performed to reduce fatigue, corrosion, wear, and tear of manufacturing 
equipment’s to extend lifetime of manufacturing machines. Maintenance can be performed when part breakdown 
(corrective maintenance) or determined by observed condition (condition based maintenance) or component replaced 
preventively (preventive maintenance) (Poppe et al. 2017). In order to compete effectively in global market modern 
manufacturing system, optimize production inventory total cost in supply chain by coordinating (Poppe et al. 2017) 
production scheduling with maintenance planning based on several process capabilities (Chelbi and Ait-Kadi 2004) 
such as production rate, lot-sizing, mean time between failure, mean time to repair and backed with safety stock of 
finished goods to buffer against demand during maintenance period.  
 
Preventive maintenance strategies are widely used in manufacturing industries like Logging, Textile, Steel 
manufacturing, Discrete part manufacturing, Chemical processing plant and many more. This paper considers regular

Following the illustrated method from Figure 8 and considering data from Table.1 an optimal backlog value obtained 
with equation (3.19) is substituted in equation (4.17) and solving for 𝑥 yields four different values of 𝑥, 
 
𝑥= -0.0103721± 0.00071i,  0.00236952 , 0.00214975 
𝑥= -0.0103721± 0.00071i is neglected as overtime production period will be zero or positive. Substituting the value 
of 𝑥=  0.00236592 and   0.00241975 in SOC equation to determine the nature of

𝜕2𝑇𝐶
𝜕𝑥2 , 𝑥= 0.00241975 yields the optimal overtime 
production period for convexity function. An optimal overtime production of 0.00241975 per year approximately 5 
hours/production cycle with total cost of $187,286 obtained from equation (4.17).  
 
The backordering cost reduces from base model from 0.098 ($/unit) to extended overtime production of 0.079 ($/unit). 
Though the backordering and holding cost reduces, total cost increases from base model of $186,670.31 with 505.36 
(bd. Ft) backlog to $187,286 with zero backlog in overtime production period. The increase in total cost is due to 
linear overtime manufacturing cost per unit. Backordering cost and backlog quantity is a major concern to finished 
products in furniture manufacturing industry where frequent transportation in and out of inventory possibly damage 
the product. Reducing backlog with increase in overtime production period could prevent the damage to the product 
by reducing cost of rework. This model can be further extended to determine total cost for uncertain demand.    
 
5. Conclusion 
A mathematical model has been presented to find an optimal backordering quantity by formulating an economic model 
to minimize backordering cost that incorporates maintenance period in production inventory model. The proposed 
model is extended emphasis on increases in production rate accomplished through production overtime to determine 
optimal overtime production period (𝑇𝑃′) which minimize the production-inventory backordering cost per unit time. 
Numerical analysis was performed with base case example of a manufacturing cell with realistic production and cost 
parameters in furniture manufacturing industry. Sensitivity analysis based on several parameters have also been 
carried out to show the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed model.

Abstract 
The objective of this research is to analyse the deaths of people during Songkran holidays and to develop a model 
for the classification of deaths caused by road accidents. Data used in this research studies including Injuries and the 
loss of life in the accident between 2008 and 2014, a total of 2,875 people from the database of the Digital 
Government Development Office. The statistics used in the hypothesis testing are the Chi-square test statistic, 
Independent variables are behavior factors: drinking, not wearing a helmet, physical environmental factors such as 
the time when the road accident occurs, the type of road that caused the accident and the dependent variable was the 
death and injured person. The hypothesis testing at the significance level of 0.05 showed that all variables are 
associated with death during Songkran holidays. In addition, data mining techniques are applied to this research. 
Decision Tree, Bayesian Learning, Logistic Regression and Neural Network are applied to identify deaths described 
by a set of attributes and compare the accuracy of data classification with various data mining techniques. As the 
result, it was found that logistic regression can be correctly classified higher than other classification techniques with 
a precision of 72.20%.

1. Introduction
The World Health Organization (2019) reported that road accidents are the major causes of the death of people 
around the world. In 2016, more than 1.35 million people are died with road accidents which are the biggest killer of 
young people and working people which adversely affects the economy and society. The road accident situation in 
Thailand has been ranked as the top first of death rate in Southeast Asia with a death rate of 32.7 people per 100,000 
people and as the second rank in the world. Ocharoen (2017) said that during 2011 - 2013, the average cost of road 
accident was 545,435 million Baht per year, accounting for 6% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each year. It 
was found that more than 10,000 people die in the road, and more than 1 million people are injured and tens of 
thousands of people with disabilities Especially during the New Year and Songkran Festivals due to it is the long 
holiday period, many people often use the road to travel back to their homeland and travel during the festival. It 
leads to the higher road accident risks than the normal situation. 
Suangka (2016) studied the driver behaviour of adolescents affecting the risk of motorcycle accidents. The sample 
data are students in vocational schools in Nakhon Ratchasima, Surin and Chaiyaphum province about 933 people by 
using the Structural Equation Modelling. The results of the analysis revealed that the driver attitudes had a direct 
influence on risk-taking behaviour in accidents. The drivers who have the negative attitude toward traffic laws, 
speed limits, and driving responsibly lead to a high risk for accidents 
Tanaboribun (2005) conducted a trend analysis of road accidents. The risk factors influencing road accidents in 
Thailand by using the descriptive analysis statistics are time of accident, drinking alcohol, wearing a helmet. The 
study indicated that motorcycles are also vehicles that are the main cause of accidents. It is often an accident without 
a party or Single Vehicle Crash and caused by drinking alcoholic beverages. The number of people suffering from 
accidents during the night will be close to the daytime, but the number of deaths in the nighttime is more than day 
time.

Classification rules are obtained from decision trees. The conditions of the victims from road accidents are the 
motorcyclists who drink alcohol and do not wear a helmet, with no parties during period of time 06.01 - 12.00 and 
24:01 - 06:00 or the parties who drive motorcycles and drink alcohol.

5. CONCLUSIONS
From the analysis of the chi-square test, it was found that drinking alcohol, wearing a helmet, types of vehicles
driving, time and road accidents that are associated with deaths during Songkran holidays. In addition, there are the 
following important conclusions. 
•
Injuries and deaths from road accidents that drink alcohol are most common on rural roads than other roads.
•
Injuries and deaths from road accidents that do not wear a helmet or safety belt are most common on rural
roads than other roads
•
Any motorcyclists without wearing a helmet or safety belt  have a risk of death more than those wearing a
helmet or safety belt 1.59 times
When comparing data classification results among data mining techniques, it was found that logistic regression 
can be more accurately classified than other classification techniques with the accuracy of 72.20%.

Abstract 
This study examined the impact of carbon accounting on firms' financial performance. using data from the 
Jordanian national electric power company annual reports for a period of 16-year from 2000 to 2015.  the 
study employed a linear regression model, the dependent variable of the study was the return on assets ratio 
ROA and the independent variable was co2 emissions in metric tons. the findings show that firms’ financial 
performance is negatively related to carbon emission; meaning that an increase in corporates' carbon 
emissions would negatively affect corporates' financial performance

1. Introduction
Recently, the growing interest in climate change and the growing technological sophistication of industries have 
made carbon accounting the focus of many researchers and environmental organizations. Climate change at the 
corporate level is linked to the concept of environmental accounting, particularly carbon accounting. Carbon 
accounting is a new term in the accounting field and currently attracting the attention of many scholars and 
academic studies in the past few years, many researchers and professionals in the field of accounting believe in the 
role that companies must play in contributing to the preservation of the environment, especially that they contribute 
through their daily production in the increasing pollution of the environment, For example, many factories throw 
down their residues in seas and rivers, threatening the lives of fish in the seas, which are reflected by a negative 
effect on our health, adding to the emission of carbon and toxic gases from these factories to the air we breathe. 
 “Evolving climate change governance mechanisms such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) carbon 
auctions, the European Union Emission Trading System (EU ETS) and the potential federal cap-and-trade system in 
the USA also place pressure on companies to track and disclose their CO2 emissions. Investors are increasingly 
taking note of carbon profiles in their evaluation of asset prices and potential investments. In response, companies 
are learning to report their carbon management initiatives, some going so far as to track CO2 emissions through 
the value chain at the product level and disclose this information on consumer product labels”. Bowen F and 
Wittneben B (2011).   
Corporates should disclose the environmental impact of their industries on the environment and clarify the 
contribution and role they play in preserving the environment. Carbon Accounting, Carbon Emission disclosure, and 
Environmental Disclosure should be integrated with Corporate Social Responsibility in the Jordanian companies 
listed on Amman Stock Exchange (ASE). According to the instructions and legislation issued by the Jordanian 
Securities Commission, the Jordanian companies are required to disclose their environmental activities and their role 
in serving the local community. However, following the annual reports of Jordanian companies, we found that the 
environmental disclosure in the Jordanian companies did not reach the minimum required level and that there is no 
financial data in the annual reports on environmental disclosure or environmental expenses in their financial 
statements. this study tries to investigate the impact of carbon emission and environmental disclosure on Jordanian 
companies’ financial performance according to the viewpoint of the study participants and tries to answer the 
following questions: 1- does Carbon Emissions disclosure affect Jordanian firms’ performance?  2- is it the time for

5. Conclusion  
This study examined the impact of carbon accounting on firms' financial performance. using data from the Jordanian 
national electric power company annual reports for a period of 16-year from 2000 to 2015.  the study employed a 
linear regression model, the dependent variable of the study was the return on assets ratio ROA and the independent 
variable was co2 emissions in metric tons. the findings show that firms’ financial performance is negatively related 
to carbon emission; meaning that an increase in corporates' carbon emissions would negatively decrease corporates' 
financial performance. 
Based on the analysis in this study and after reviewing Jordanian companies' annual reports, the study concludes the 
following: 
1-  Company's financial performance is negatively related to carbon emissions; the more corporates make 
“green investments” the less corporates carbon emissions; leading to a better financial performance.  
2-  There is no separate section for disclosing carbon emissions and carbon management expenses in the 
Jordanian companies’ annual reports. 
Based on the findings, the study recommends the following:  
3- legislators should oblige the Jordanian companies listed on Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) to disclose 
carbon emissions and carbon management cost data in their annual reports.  
4- Carbon management expenses should be included in firm’s Tax Shield.  
5-  legislators should impose a penalty on carbon emissions disclosure failure.    
6-  Companies should have a section for environmental activities and green investments information in their 
annual reports.  
7-  Financial statements audit should be accompanied by environmental audit report.

Abstract 
Capacity planning is a fundamental activity that regulatory agencies in the public sector are called to carry out in order 
to improve the quality of services. Thus, there is an increasing need to understand how the capacity planning used 
under public sector would support activities of operational management from a dynamic perspective. In this article, 
System Dynamics (SD) modelling has been used for strategic capacity planning and policy analysis, supported by a 
dynamic performance management (DPM) approach. This model-based planning methodology, which has long been 
the main way of approaching planning in the public/private sector is supported by a novel performance management 
framework. The results show that institutions in the public sector should change from traditional planning to strategy 
development taking into account the response capacity in the services promised. The main contribution of this article 
is assessed the strategy resources for the public sector, with a regulatory agency of Colombia taken as a case study.

1. Introduction
The key performance indicators (KPIs) help in assessing the quality of supplied service in the private/public 
institutions (Asif et al., 2012). In recent years, research on KPIs management has grown significantly, giving rise to 
assess the capacity of the resources (Asif et al., 2012; Barney, 1991; Warren, 2005). Although this performance 
measures a few times taken into account the sustainability in the long-term, modelling the sustainability of 
organizational implies the understanding of a more complex system than simplistic conditions used for the allocation 
of resources (Bianchi, 2016; Bianchi et al., 2015; Cosenz, 2017).  
In the study case, the allocation of resources (i.e. capacity) influence on two aspects of the dynamic system. First, the 
quality of services depends on the available resources. Second, the used time on service influences on the completion 
rate of service. Thus, the delivery time of service has a high effect on the perceived quality of service (Herrera et al., 
2018). These aspects could be comprising through modelling of performance indicators in order to damp delays service 
caused by insufficient resources capacity in the long-term (Bianchi, 2010; Bianchi et al., 2015).   
The public sector faces challenges related to resources planning (Bianchi, 2010; Bouckaert et al., 2010; Hannon et al., 
2015). These challenges comprise allocation of human and financial resources (Becerra et al., 2016). This paper 
analyses one public institution of Colombia dedicates to regulate the environmental policy. Currently, this institution 
faces drawbacks associated with available resources because of lack of capacity planning, which affects the quality of 
service. This issue can be an impediment to both the institutional reputation and the public financial resources.     
Considering the above situation, it is natural that there has been a rapid growth of the research dedicated to the analysis 
of performance through indicators (i.e. KPIs) for capacity planning; however, these studies have not taken into account 
the dynamic of systems (Cosenz and Noto, 2017; Crespo et al., 2004). The delivery time plays a role important in the 
capacity planning of the public sector because of its influence on making the decision of allocation of resources

4. Results: Framing the Performance of Capacity Planning in the Public Sector 
 
In this section, a framework for the performance management of capacity planning in the public sector is developed. 
This framework obtained from stock and flow diagram represents the interaction between strategic resources, 
performance drivers and end-results of the public institution. This model is based on studies of Bianchi (2016) and 
Herrera et al. (2018).  
 
Figure 2 presents a DPM chart for capacity planning in the public sector. On the one hand, the adjust capacity to 
influence on recruitment of human resources. The recruitment depends on time to adjust capacity (hiring). On the 
other hand, perceived service quality affects the growth rate of citizens because of the delays in adjusting perception 
that influences on change of quality.

5. Conclusions  
 
This paper developed a framework to represent through SD and DPM the benefits of strategic capacity planning in 
the public sector. This framework contributes to identifying strategic resources, performance drivers and end-results 
as well as their interactions. 
 
Although this paper does not present the effects of capacity service on the growth rate of citizens, the simulation model 
could be supported by this analysis. Also, a similar strategy could be used to analyse the private sector, using the 
simulation approach proposed here.

Abstract 
This article seeks to build the method to measure the Logistics Interoperability (LI) using the structural equation 
model.  It was built from the functional link of logistics and interoperability. Partly, the result identified some 
determinants of LI (constructs) as external logistics, internal logistics, inbound logistics, and strategy. 
This work was characterized as exploratory, descriptive, qualitative, and quantitative approaches with bibliometric 
research, and a survey, consisting of a questionnaire, was applied in an industrial company in the Industrial Park of 
Manaus. The data were analyzed using Smart PLS® 3.0 to test measurement and structural model. 
The outputs show the validity (convergent and discriminant), confiability and reliability of the proposed conceptual 
model, through the analysis of reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) and strong correlations between variables with relevant 
factor loadings. A major limitation of this study is the use of data from a single city (Industrial Pole of Manaus), 
despite the high degree of internationalization of each company studied. 
The definition of the Logistic Interoperability can facilitate decision-making and the importance of each in the logistics 
process and provides a guide to managers and organizations.

Abstract 
The Black-Scholes partial differential equation is a very well-known model for pricing European call options. The 
purpose of this paper is to solve the Black-Scholes equation using the Sumudu decomposition method. This method 
is a combination of the Adomian decomposition method and Sumudu transform which is able to effectively and easily 
solve differential equations without discretization, linearization or pertrubation. Two numerical examples are 
presented in this paper. The results show that the Sumudu decomposition method is an efficient and reliable method 
for solving the Black-Scholes equation. 
Keywords: 
Pricing option, Black-Scholes equation, Sumudu decomposition method (SDM). 
1. Introduction
Option is the right held by the holder to buy or sell an underlying asset at a certain price in a certain period. Option is 
a financial derivative product, so its value is derived from or depends on the price of the underlying asset (Hull, 2012). 
Black-Scholes partial differential equation is a very well-known equation for pricing European call options where the 
underlying assets are non-dividend stocks (Black & Scholes, 1973). Black-Scholes partial differential equation with 
boundary conditions for pricing European call option is defined as (Wilmott et al., 1995)

Abstract 
The Black-Scholes model became popular and almost universally accepted by option traders to estimate and assess 
option prices over time. Black-Scholes model involves several assumptions that must be fulfilled, so sometimes the 
Black-Scholes model is difficult to apply to real life under certain conditions because of these assumptions. 
Therefore, several models were developed to approach these assumptions, one of them is fractional Black-Scholes 
model. The model used in this paper is time-fractional Black-Scholes model. This paper begins with a brief 
description of the history of the Black-Scholes model then followed by an explanation of time-fractional Black-
Scholes obtained from ordinary Black-Scholes models. The main points highlighted in this paper are the methods of 
solving the fractional Black-Scholes model. This paper aims to review the methods that have been successfully used 
in previous studies. Like Laplace Homotopy Perturbation Method (LHPM), fractional variational iteration method, 
Block-Pulse operational matrix method, Homo-Separation of Variables method, and several other methods. In 
reviewing these methods, this paper presents summary of the contexts that are worked out using these methods, 
conclusions and the efficiency of the methods, so that differences among the methods can be seen clearly. 
Keywords : Option, Fractional, Black-Scholes Model, Methods. 
1. Introduction
Determining option prices is a major problem in quantitative finance. These problems are theoretical and 
practical problems because of the use of options in the financial industry today. In the option pricing theory, the 
Black-Scholes equation is one of the most effective models for option pricing. Black-Scholes is modeled with stock 
price movements as a stochastic process by adding a number of assumptions related to option markets. These 
assumptions are the chance of arbitration and tax does not exist, interest is risk free and the volatility is constant 
(Hull and White, 1987). In fact, these assumptions are often difficult to adapt to existing conditions. Therefore, to 
approach these assumptions several models are developed, one of which is the Black-Scholes fractional model 
(Chen, 2014). Then, there are many methods used to determine the solution of the fractional model, both analytically

This new fractional operator has a smooth kernel that takes on two different impressions for the spatial and 
temporal variable. They had demonstrated the efﬁciencies and accuracies of the suggested method by applying it to 
the FBS option pricing models with their initial conditions satisﬁed by the classical European vanilla option. By 
using the real market values from the ﬁnance literature, it can obtaiedn how the option is priced for fractional cases 
of European call option pricing models. The successful applications of the proposed model prove that this model is 
in complete agreement with the corresponding exact solutions. Furthermore, the method is much easier than other 
homotopy methods, so the Laplace Transform allows one in many positions to eliminate the inadequacy essentially 
caused by insufﬁcient conditions, which take part in other approximate-analytical methods like homotopy 
perturbation method (Madani et al, 2011).

3. Conclusion 
 
 
This paper reviews the recent advances made in the Black-Scholes model and solution methods. Many 
researchers have attempted to obtain the solution of the Black-Scholes model analytically or numerically, thereby 
adopting and using various direct and iterative methods, respectively. There are a few methods that has the same 
solution in the end. For LHPM, the main advantage of this method is to overcome the deﬁciency that is mainly 
caused by unsatisﬁed conditions. Thus, it is said that the LHPM methodology is very powerful and eﬃcient in 
ﬁnding approximate solutions as well as numerical solutions. The fractional variational iteration method with 
Riemann-Liouville derivative shows that the present method is in excellent agreement with exact solution. It is 
proved with getting the exact solution in two iterations. A new lagrange multiplier whicih the modification of 
variational iteration method that is based on Sumudu Transform ﬁnds the analytical solution without any 
discretization or additive assumption. The analytical method has been applied in the form of convergent power 
series with easily computable components. Fractional partial differential equation to be solved is changed into 
fractional ordinary differential equation by using Homo-Separation of variables. It will be more easily if the 
equation is in the form of ordinary differential equation.  So also with other methods that has their own efficiency 
and simplicity.

Abstract 
Climate change is a phenomenon that occurs continuously and is sensitive to the agricultural sector. Future projections 
show that farmers will face several conditions, including warmer environments, uncertain rainfall patterns, and other 
extreme events. One of the adaptations to climate change in the agricultural sector is through Crop Insurance based 
on climate change. Crop Insurance can protect the financial implications of unexpected crop failures. Currently, there 
are many Crop Insurance products offered, especially in developing countries. There are three types of Crop Insurance 
products, including actual production history (APH), crop revenue coverage (CRC) and catastrophic (CAT). The effort 
that can be made by farmers is to choose the appropriate crop insurance product. However, sometimes there is the 
adverse selection in Crop Insurance. This paper analyzes the types of Crop Insurance products based on climate change 
and strategies for determining the type of Crop Insurance products that are optimal by using Conditional Value-at-
Risk (CVaR) for the avoidance of risk and loss selection. In addition, in this paper, several models have been proposed 
in previous studies.

1. Introduction
Climate change is a phenomenon that occurs continuously. Climate change provides vulnerability to the
environment and the economy, one of the effects of which is on agriculture, which can damage crops. Climate change 
is a change in climate for a long period of time due to natural activities and anthropology. Increased temperatures and 
changes in rainfall have an influence on the agricultural sector with extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, 
storms, and heat waves. The vulnerability of climate change to agriculture can affect food security, trade policies and 
livelihood activities (Farook and Kannan, 2015). 
Agriculture is a sector with great uncertainty. Many people in developing countries have a livelihood in this 
sector. One such inconvenience is caused by the influence of climate change vulnerability, including floods and

6. Conclusion 
 
Climate change is a phenomenon that occurs continuously. Using data on maximum temperature, minimum 
temperature, and rainfall, it is known that climate change and variability affect crop yields, harvest area, and 
agricultural productivity significantly. This shows that agricultural vulnerability to climate change requires an 
adaptation. Adaptation can be operational techniques, change management practices, and through financial 
management, such as using insurance. Agricultural insurance plays an important role in the adaptation between climate 
variations and agriculture so that it can be used to reduce risk. Agricultural insurance is the main component of risk 
management that can be used with climate information so that farmers use it to optimize the characteristics of risk 
returns. With the development of agricultural insurance, there are currently several agricultural insurance products, 
including Actual Production History (APH) or Multi-Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI), Crop Revenue Coverage (CRC) 
and Catastrophic (CAT). This allows for a potential tradeoff between farmers and insurance companies in having an 
optimal agricultural insurance contract with climate variability. However, if both parties are willing to show flexibility 
regarding their best choice, then farmers and insurance companies can achieve long-term sustainability without 
endangering economic stability.

Abstract 
Climate change increases the risk of weather-related disasters in many regions of the world, this has a detrimental 
economic impact on the agricultural sector. In 1980-1990 and 2004 and 2014 there were annual climate-related 
disasters, on average causing losses in the agricultural sector of approximately US $ 14M and US $ 100M worldwide. 
Climate index insurance has been used as a risk transfer in the agricultural sector to provide compensation to farmers, 
so farmers can maximize agricultural products. This peper goal reviews the methods used in climate index insurance 
in agriculture based on the Copula model. 
Keywords : Climate, Climate index, Climate Index insurance, Copula.

Abstract 
In this paper, we examine a periodic-review shipment scheduling problem where a shipment consolidation depot is 
responsible for delivering orders to multiple retailers (customers) located in close proximity to each other. We 
explicitly consider the stochastic dynamic nature of the demand. We also account for the fact that orders placed by 
retailers at different times may be combined into a single, large shipment at the consolidation depot, and, hence, the 
dispatch quantity in each period is determined based on the consolidated load observed at the end of that period. We 
formulate the problem at hand via a stochastic dynamic programming approach and investigate the impact of cargo 
capacity and cost. We investigate both single- and multi-truck dispatch scenarios and analyze the structural 
properties of optimal shipment scheduling policies.

Abstract 
Banking is a financial institution that has very important role in an economic and trade activity that is useful for 
channeling funds in the form of loans to the public who need fresh funds for business in the hope of helping improve 
the people's economy. In the process of lending, bank are often faced with a risk known as credit risk or problem 
loans. Therefore, the credit rating was analyzed by using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm in the Logistic 
Regression model. It was determined by using feasibility parameters of prospective debtors based on past data 
variables held by prospective debtors. This risk can be overcome by using a scoring system that is owned by each 
bank. In this paper, the data used is data on financial service cooperatives in Indonesia. Of the eight factors were 
analyzed, there are six factors that have a significant effect on the risk of default, namely including the age of debtors, 
family dependents, the amount of savings, the value of collateral, given the credit limit, and the loan term.

1. Introduction
Banking is a financial institution whose role is very important in an economic and trade activity [Tan, 2015].
One of the benefits of the bank is to channel funds in the form of loans to the public who need fresh funds for business 
or for consumer needs. So that it can be said that banks are the core of each country's financial system. In the 
implementation of credit, besides helping to improve the people's economy, banks also get a source of revenue in the 
form of profit sharing. However, in the process of bank lending it is often faced with a risk known as problem loans. 
One of the causes of problem loans is the failure of the bank in conducting a credit analysis of prospective borrowers. 
In determining the decision to give a loan depends on the models and algorithms that each financial service has to 
reduce risk in their operations [Turan, 2016]. Empirical studies [Doblas-Madrid et al, 2013; Kusi et al, 2017] shows

3.2  Analysis 
 
Credit worthiness decisions are made using risk prediction (valuation) by considering the probability of defaulting on 
the prospective debtor. Here are the credit risk titles:

The credit risk predicate above can be used to analyze credit in financial service cooperatives. The analysis 
of credit scoring aims to reduce the risk of default on prospective borrowers which results in losses for financial 
services. Therefore, financial service cooperatives to avoid losses must form a credit assessment model based on their 
own debtors. 
 
4. Conclusion 
The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used as a Logistic Regression estimator with the aim of 
analyzing credit in financial service cooperatives. In this study, it was conducted on a financial service. It consists of 
eight factors analyzed, but there are six factors that influence significantly the probability of failure. Estimated 
probability of default is estimated by the logistic regression model, which is then matched with the loan feasibility 
interval to obtain the title of each prospective debtor. Based on the predicate obtained, the prospective debtor will 
obtain a decision from a financial service whether or not the prospective debtor is granted a loan.

Abstract 
The truckload industry faces a serious problem of high driver shortage and turnover rate, typically around 100\%. 
Among the major causes of this problem are extended on-the-road times, where drivers handle several truckload 
pickup and deliveries successively, non-regular schedules and get-home rates, and low utilization of drivers dedicated 
time. These are by-and-large consequences of the driver-to-load dispatching method, which is based on point-to-point 
dispatching or direct shipment from origin to destination, commonly employed in the industry. 
We consider an alternative dispatching method that necessitates careful design of an underlying network. In this 
scheme, a truckload on its way to destination visits multiple relay nodes and the driver and/or tractor are switched 
with a new one so that drivers stay close to their base. Some specific design characteristics include both direct and 
relay-network shipments, multi-route assignments, fixed relay costs, and route circuity, and coverage required for 
relay points. We present a mathematical model capturing these characteristics and a solution procedure based on 
strengthened Benders decomposition enhanced with surrogate constraints and efficient heuristics. The solution 
approach is able to solve the large-scale problems, considering realistic inputs, in a reasonable time, and helps us to 
examine the performance of the RP-network. Computational results demonstrate the performance of the algorithm.

Abstract 
 
This research aims to increase production capacity of wood plastic through Six Sigma DMAIC 
implementation, within the simulation laboratory of production of recycled plastic wood sheets of the 
Universidad Técnica del Norte, Ecuador. Where they simulated the conditions of the current problem, 
which reflects the lack of strategies to improve production capacity, and three steps were determined as 
project methodology based on DIMAC (define, measure, implement and control). First, the current 
diagnosis was carried out where it was identified that the final client has excessive waiting times for the 
product. With which they measured and calculated: production time in 214.3 minutes + / - 15.7, Cp=0.91 
and Cpk = 0.49. Combined these results mean that production times are not suitable for the job and are 
off-center to the upper limit. Second, improvements were implemented from root cause analysis, which 
determined the lack of: maintenance, work method, training and design / construction of larger capacity 
molds. Third, the results were evaluated after the improvements, where a production time of 173.4 
minutes was obtained, that is, an improvement of 19%, Cp=1.09 and Cpk = 0.99. These indicators mean 
that the production times are capable for the job and is slightly displaced to the upper limit.

1. Introduction 
 
Ecuador currently generates 4.1 million tons per year of solid waste, 25% of which is potentially recyclable 
(Ministerio del Ambiente, 2015) The urban area is characterized by 58% organic waste and 42% inorganic waste. Of 
the latter, one of potentially recyclable solid wastes is plastic with 10.7% (INEC 2017). This waste has led to the 
development of new industries that mitigate the environmental impact and generate new products. Within which 
recycled plastic wood provides a range of opportunities and possibilities. Because its physical and mechanical 
properties offer numerous advantages over climatic conditions, maintenance and pest attack (Moya et al. 2012). 
 
During the last decade growing environmental awareness, social responsibility and government regulations have led 
to the development of new industries that mitigate environmental impact, generating new products (Vahdat and 
Vahdatzad 2017). Within which recycled plastic wood offers a range of opportunities and possibilities. Since this 
product complies with the two fundamental sections of an ecological design and these are: environmentally 
conscious design and product life cycle assessment (Vahdat et al. 2018). Because its physical and mechanical 
properties favor climatic conditions, maintenance and pest attack (Moya et al. 2012). Ecuador currently generates 
4.1 million tons per year of solid waste, 25% of which is potentially recyclable (Ministry of Environment, 2015).

with the stated objective of 347.2, thus the process average is stable. If these parameters vary, the use of this tool 
will make it possible to identify when and why changes were generated in the process. 
 
4. Discussion 
 
The discussion will be based on comparative tables before and after the implementation of the DMAIC 
methodology. Table 8 indicates the factors before and after the improvements in the wood plastic production 
process.

From the above table it can be concluded that the results after the implementation of improvements and these are: 
the production time decreased from 214.3 min to 173.4 min. The production lot is now composed of two units. The 
production capacity during a shift/day went from 3 to 4 sheets of recycled plastic wood with a size of 63% larger 
than the previous one. Maintenance was performed on the shredder, now the procedures of the process are defined 
and complies with the training to those involved. With respect to the capacity indexes of the process, Table 9 
presents the summary of before and after indicators of the improvements.

With respect to Table 9 it can be indicated that thanks to the application of the Six Sigma DMAIC methodology the 
potential capacity index (Cp) increased by 0.18 and now this indicator has a value >1. It determines that the process 
is now capable of carrying out its production in the established production time. However, in order to achieve this, a 
strict control is required since there is still variability in the data obtained. With respect to the Cpk index there is also 
an improvement since it increased 0.50 which indicates that the focus of the process has improved. The result of the 
capability index for the upper specification (Cps) is still < 1. However, it is important to mention that this indicator 
went from 0,49 to 0,99 which indicates that the variability in the upper specification limit decreased considerably. 
The lower specification index (Cpi) despite having decreased is still maintained >1 which indicates that the process 
meets the minimum production time.

With the elaboration of the process that intervenes in transformation of recycled polymers into prototypes of plastic 
wood, the times required in each activity of the process were determined, resulting in a production time of 214,3 
minutes to make a sheet of plastic wood. By implementing DMAIC the production time is 347.2 minutes to make 
two sheets (63% larger), which indicates that process time decreased by 19%. 
 
By increasing the production capacity, it was achieved a production of 3 sheets of plastic wood to 4 during a 
working day, this indicates an improvement of 25% in its production. 
 
With the analysis of the results obtained before and after the process, it could be concluded that the higher capacity 
index improved from 0,49 to 0,99. However, it is not within the established limits as it is lower <1. This is since 
there is still a lack of knowledge of the working method and the operation of the machinery on the part of new 
operators. 
  
The application of the Six Sigma DMAIC methodology for any type of organization is very useful since it allows an 
exhaustive analysis of the process and in this way to identify and implement improvement opportunities that adjust 
the production process. 
 
It is suggested that future researches define strategies and methods to improve the capacity indicator >1. For this 
purpose, it is recommended to analyze the variability of the labor force in the productive process, due to the high 
turnover rate of plant workers. This leads to new hiring and poor training in the method of work and use of 
machinery.

Abstract 
A technology driven society of 21st century demands skilled technocrats and engineers. To fulfil this demand, a 
revolutionary transformation is required within higher education. With time, the traditional classroom teaching is 
being replaced by ultra-modern techniques, textbooks by e-books and online database, student backpacks by smart 
electronic devices, and physical labs by virtual labs. E-learning has been introduced for convenient quicker learning 
and better understanding. The virtual lab is an interactive tool in higher education that contributes to dynamically 
prepare the engineers ready for the 4th industrial revolution. This tool is capable to address the need of practical 
component in engineering education in case of unavailability of sophisticated expensive machines and highly skilled 
lab technicians. The virtual laboratory sessions mimic reality and create learning experience similar to physical 
laboratory sessions with flexibility. At University of Johannesburg, an Industry 4.0 Virtual Lab has been developed 
for manufacturing engineering education. This article discusses the rationale and philosophy behind and various 
important aspects as regards to the development of virtual lab sessions for manufacturing engineering education of 
the undergraduate level students at University of Johannesburg.

1. Introduction
The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has embedded a global wave in Industry. Industrial changes and upskilling
the workforce in Africa is a challenge that needs immediate attention. South African school curricula have
embedded Technology as a learning area and Industry adapts at a very fast pace to immediate skills requirements.
The question remains however on how equipped higher education is for skilling engineering students to make the
leap from a basic school education in technology to become a fully-fledged global citizen and engineering
practitioner in South Africa (Senne, 2018; Educause, 2018). Moreover, the general use of technology for teaching
and learning is also a meme brought over for many years as students of technology learn by using technology.
Therefore, a teaching initiative has emerged for teaching basic concepts of Mechanical Engineering to students who
use technology as a general means for discovery learning. This paper largely addresses the design thinking and
development of a Virtual Engineering Laboratory, designed, piloted, and tested to stay abreast with concepts needed
to understand to become engineering practitioners.

A variety of digital artefacts-related to how the general digital information is provided on the Internet and 
in digital spaces is to the liking of students who use modern learning ecologies. 
This development was tested on the qualitative responses of the students in a pilot study. The quantitative data will 
be used to address other experiential issues related to the teaching and learning experience to be published and 
presented in follow-up research.

Abstract 
East Java province is the one of shipbuilding industry cluster in Indonesia. Traditional fishing boats have been 
widely used by most fishermen in East Java. In this study, we aim to test the stability of traditional fishing boats 
according to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) standard. The results show that there are four types of 
traditional fishing boats, namely: ijon-ijon, perahu, pursein, and ethek-ethek. The stability test shows that all these 
types of traditional fishing boats has confirmed to the IMO standard, except the ethek-ethek boat. In order to fulfill 
the IMO standard, the bilge keel can be used to modify the ethek-ethek boat.

Introduction
Traditional fishing boats or wooden boats have been used widely by fishermen in East Java, Indonesia. Based
on the survey, there are 4 types of traditional fishing boats in East Java, namely: ijon-ijon, perahu, purse seine, and 
ethek-ethek. These boat type names are adopted from the local language. Each boat has difference in the shape of 
pole, but has the same hull construction. The stability of these boats is necessary since there is a regulation from the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) standard. 
The study from Rizaldo et al. (2019) showed that roll the in-roll out ferry boat in Indonesia has fulfilled the 
intact and damage stabilities according to the IMO standard. Paroka (2018) studied the relationship between 
geometry and roll in-roll out ferry boat characteristics. The analysis revealed that the stability of the ship is linear to 
the width and ladder ratios. As the ratios are greater, the ship has been more stable. Wongngernyuang and Latorre 
(1989) studied the development of ship course stability diagrams for deep and shallow water with the influence of 
trim. Taury and Zakki (2018) discussed normal modes analysis of global vibration on traditional fishing boat with 
purse seine type in Batang regency, Indonesia. This study is motivated by their initiatives.  
In this study, we aim to test the stability of traditional fishing boats with 4 types, namely ijon-ijon, perahu, 
purse seine, and ethek-ethek. All these vessel types are adopted from local language. We will use the standard of 
IMO for stability criteria. We use 3 types of load case measurement such as when the ship departs for sailing, the

The ijon-ijon, perahu and purseine boat types passed the stability test for load case 1, 2, and 3. All the criteria 
fulfilled the IMO standard, such as: 1) the tilted angle at 0°-30° is not less than 0.055, 2) the tilted angle at 0°-40° is 
not less than 0.099, and 3) the tilted angle at 30°-40° is not less than 0.03. Meanwhile, the ethek-ethek boat types did 
not pass the stability test in load case 3. Ethek-ethek fails the stability test because the area under the GZ curve from 
0 ° to 30 ° is less than 0.055 meters radian. Moreover, the area under the GZ curve to a slope of 40 ° is also less than 
0.099 m-radians.  
5. Conclusion  
The survey has found that there are 4 types of traditional fishing boats in East Java, Indonesia, namely ijon-ijon, 
perahu, purse seine and ethek-ethek. All those vessel types are adopted from the local language. Furthermore, the 
stability test of vessel types is based on the IMO standard. We use three kinds of load measurement for testing such 
as the ship departs for sailing (empty cargo), the ship is sailing (50% load), and the ship is returning to the port 
(100% load). The Maxsurf software is used to calculate the ship stability. The results showed that ijon-ijon, perahu, 
purse seine fulfilled the IMO standard criteria of stability. Meanwhile, ethek-ethek failed the stability test. The 
future research is designing the bilge keel to modify the ethek-ethek boat in order to fulfil the IMO standard.

Abstract 
The unavailability of head truck spare parts in container terminal company caused the maintenance 
operation not to work effectively. The availability of more operating head truck has a negative impact on 
the loading and unloading activities in the port. This study aims to describe the control of the inventory of 
head truck spare parts using continuous review policy. Fast moving spare parts of head truck were selected 
for the purpose of this study. The results show that the safety stock, reorder point, order quantity, average 
inventory level, inventory days of supply, and total annual cost of 13 fast moving spare parts can be 
determined. Subsequently, we compare the results of continuous review policy to the company policy. We 
obtained the continuous review policy decreasing the total annual cost of 16% or USD $ 22,501.77. The 
continuous review policy study is expected to help companies to control the inventory of head truck spare 
parts.

1. Introduction
The availability of head truck spare parts is essential in the container terminal company. As the loading and
unloading activities are getting higher, the utilization of head truck to move back and forth from warehouse to jetty or 
vice versa increases. The maintenance division has the responsibility of head truck preventive maintenance to keep 
these vehicles operating properly. Otherwise, the corrective maintenance should be carried out as the head truck has 
a trouble. Therefore, the spare parts availability in the preventive and corrective maintenances is necessary. The 
unavailability of head truck spare parts impacts to cannibalism of spare parts. If the unavailability of spare parts could 
not be solved, more head truck will not operate optimally.  
There are several strategies for checking inventories such as periodic review and continuous review policies. This 
study aims to control the inventory of head truck spare parts using a continuous review policy. Continuous review 
policy is a policy in which the inventory level is reviewed continuously and when the inventory level reaches the

4.  Conclusion and Future Research 
We have described the inventory control of spare parts using the continuous review and company policies. The 
continuous review policy has the lower total annual cost than the company policy. With the saving percentage of 16% 
and the saving cost of 22,501.77 USD, we can expect that continuous review policy is used to control the inventory 
level of spare parts. By the continuous review policy, the company order with the quantity, Q, for each spare part 
whenever the inventory position level reaches the reorder point. The future research could be carried by comparing 
the performance of continuous review, periodic review, and the combination between continuous and periodic review 
policies.

6. Conclusion 
 
Industry 4.0 is currently a widely used and widespread term for the concept of new industrial revolution that has 
arisen as a result of the development and implementation of new technologies into production. The basis of a smart 
factory will be digitization and the following nine technologies – Autonomous robots, Simulation, System Integration, 
Internet of Things (IoT), Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing, Additive Manufacturing, Augmented Reality and Big 
Data. Implementation of these new technologies will have an impact on employee qualifications. Only highly qualified 
employees will be able to control these new technologies. The qualified employees will become the key to success for 
the future companies. For this reason, the education framework will be very important part of concept Industry 4.0. 
The main aim of this article was created of education framework that should include description of the necessary 
professions for Industry 4.0 and study program.  
In the first part of the article there is a description of necessary professions for Industry 4.0. The job positions 
needed for the Industry 4.0 were founded in our previous research. These job positions are for example Electronics 
Technician, Automation Technician, Production Technician, Manufacturing Engineer, Informatics Specialist, Robot 
Programmer, Software Engineer, Data Analyst or Cybersecurity Specialist. These job profiles were determined using 
individual implementation phases of Industry 4.0. The description of these professions has been extended with the 
necessary soft and hard skills. In the next part, the bachelor´s study program “Process Management of Industry 4.0” 
will be described. Twenty-four courses were set for the study program. On the basis of literary research and interview 
with experts, 24 subjects for the given study program were set.  For each subject, the number of lectures and exercises 
required to acquire and verify knowledge was chosen.

Abstract 
The term Industry 4.0 originated from the German term Industrie 4.0. This next industrial revolution is based on 
intelligent manufacturing. Intelligent and flexible processes characterize the manufacturing companies of the future. 
The main goal of Industry 4.0 is a smart factory that will connected production units by the Cyber-physical system 
(CPS). This system will allow machine and sensors communicate with other machines or sensors. This will create a 
coherent system that will be able to decide independently, manage the assigned technological units and 
independently optimize production process based on the collected data (Big data) from the production machines and 
sensors. Other new technologies such as Autonomous robots, Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud computing, 
Cybersecurity, Additive manufacturing and Augmented reality will be used in the smart factory.  These new 
technologies will affect to the current production process management such as Lean management or Six sigma. Lean 
4.0 is a term for new concept of production management that will combines lean production and digitalization. The 
article describes traditional Lean management and its methods. Lean is based on several basic principles. Firstly, it 
is the effort of the entire organization to continually improve in all areas and avoid unnecessary waste. The second 
principle is to satisfy the customer's needs. The next part of the article describes Lean 4.0 and its methods. The main 
aim of this article is determination of changes between traditional Lean management and Lean 4.0 and assessing 
whether Lean 4.0 can be used in the smart factory. At the end of the article there is an analysis of the risks that may 
arise when Lean 4.0 will be implemented into the company.

An Assesment On The Implementation Of Sustainable 
Supply Chain Management (Green Public Procurement) A 
Case Study In The City Of Johannesburg Municipality

Abstract 
Green public procurement (GPP) in South African local government is still at its infancy stage. The municipalities of 
City of Johannesburg (CoJ), Cape Town, eThekwini, Ekurhuleni, Nelson Mandela Bay and Tshwane (all members of 
International Council for Local Government Initiatives (ICLEI) committed in 2002 at the World Conference on 
Sustainable Development (WSSD) to pursue some form of GPP, however none of these municipalities has developed 
a fully-fledged policy on GPP. GPP is one of the new strategies that are being adopted globally to assist local 
governments in providing solutions for sustainable development and to embrace the green economy through the 
implementation of long-term sustainable policies and strategies. The incorporation of green procurement elements 
into current supply chain policies of municipalities can be the first and most inexpensive step in achieving a successful 
green procurement programs. Municipalities spend a large portion of their budget on procurement and if they use their 
purchasing power by choosing to procure environmentally friendly goods and services, they can make an important 
contribution to sustainable consumption and production. The integration of green criteria in local government 
procurement would provide opportunities for: improved efficiency, reduced resource use, reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions, cost savings and enhanced environmental and social outcomes. The aim of the research was to determine 
factors that affect implementation of GPP practices in the City of Johannesburg municipality. A qualitative research 
approach was used to collect opinions, perceptions and attitudes from 100 targeted procurement personnel, 
management and executives from the CoJ municipality using a survey instrument and it concludes that there is a need 
to confront lack of knowledge and training as critical in driving the implementation of GPP.

I. Introduction
The term “Green public procurement” is still an emerging concept and it has been explained in different ways, one 
definition is that it is “a process whereby public authorities seek to procure goods, services and works with a reduced 
environmental impact throughout their life cycle when compared to goods, services and works with the same primary 
function that would otherwise be procured” (European Commission, 2011). Municipalities spend a large portion of 
their budget on procurement and if they use their purchasing power by choosing to procure environmentally friendly 
goods and services, they can make an important contribution to sustainable consumption and production, or what is 
called Green Public Procurement (GPP) or green purchasing. The integration of green criteria in local government

5. Establish selection criteria on the basis of the exhaustive list of criteria mentioned in the public procurement 
directives. Where appropriate include environmental criteria to prove technical capacity to perform the contract.  
6. Advise potential service providers and contractors that they can utilize environmental management plans and 
declarations to demonstrate compliance with the criteria. 
7. Establish award criteria: where the criteria of the ‘economically most advantageous tender’ is chosen, insert relevant 
environmental criteria either as a benchmark to compare green offers with each other (in the case where the technical 
specifications define the contract as being green) or as a way of introducing an environmental element (in the case 
where the technical specifications define the contract in a ‘neutral’ way) and giving it a certain weighting. Included in 
this step is the consideration of life-cycle costing.  
8. Use contract performance clauses as a way of setting relevant extra environmental conditions in addition to the 
green contract. 
 
7. Conclusions  
The research aimed to determine the factors that affect the implementation of green procurement practices in local 
government in the City of Johannesburg and provide the recommendations to the council. The gap analysis conducted 
on Environmental Management System development indicates that the City of Johannesburg must reduce on its 
unsustainable consumption patterns. The literature review section discussed initiatives, activities, plans and projects 
that have been undertaken by different government authorities globally to implement green public procurement. The 
government is well positioned to promote environmentally-friendly products and business activities through GPP 
policies or strategies that would encourage development and diffusion of environmentally sound goods and services 
in the procurement process. The results of the regression analysis indicated that the Cost of green products, 
Management Practices and Training and Awareness are significant factors of green implementation in the city of 
Johannesburg at 5% level of significance. The research also concludes that although the city of Johannesburg has 
made significant progress in adapting to green transition through various initiatives, green policy documents has to be 
developed and adopted at organizational level.

Abstract 
In an increasingly turbulent business environment and intensive market competition and globalisation, 
manufacturing organisations of the 21st century have been forced to continuously seek improvements 
in their supply chain operations to increase productivity and quality. Therefore, making competition no 
longer between organisations but rather among its supply chains by seeking to reduce costs and improve 
quality as an alternative to gain higher market share. This paper investigates different aspects of 
operations and supply chain improvement of a small and medium manufacturing organisation in UK. 
The main objective of this paper is to help SMEs to identify deficiencies in their operations and take 
necessary steps to correct them to enhance performance and productivity in their supply chain 
operations. For this to happen, the current study has implemented lean approach as a method to improve 
the organisation’s supply chain, enhancing the quality of processes and products. By conducting 
interviews and observations together with gathering company internal records, it remarks some 
potential problems of the manufacturing company. Finally, several recommendations (such as 
introducing ERP system) are made for future improvements.

order processing, and finances (Cousins et al., 2008). The firm use standard applications in monitoring its data 
such as spreadsheets and synced documents, which due to its size these applications can be useful, however are 
insufficient as information is usually misplaced or lost. Business process such as inputting sales and orders from 
various clients, updating inventory and keeping track of invoices cost businesses and if not managed can decrease 
the performance of an organisation (Slack and Lewis, 2011). Therefore, as businesses expand, transactions also 
tend to increase for instance, due to the increase in projects the firm plans to move to a new site. As a result, this 
means that their systems will need to be updated to avid errors and will need to be tracked, as data will need to be 
exchanged from one program.  An ERP system is a cost-effective solution that can automate these processes and 
enable an organisation to allocate time in business development activities rather than administrative work (Oracle, 
2018). Therefore, this can result to boosting performance and overall organisational efficiency.  
Quality implementation  
According to Garza-Reyes (2010), the success and growth of any manufacturing organisation depends on its 
effective management of quality in all stages of production. Due to intensive competition on the market 
organisations are forced to improve their processes and improve quality continuously in all its management 
activities in order to gain competitive advantage (Melton, 2005). ISO 9001 is one of the standards as an 
international standard for quality management that points out seven key standards to ensure quality systems that 
can help organisations manage work effectively and efficiently resulting in the increase in customer satisfaction 
(ISO, 2019). The firm is an ISO 9001 certified organisation; therefore, this shows how its committed in 
implementing quality management practices. Despite this, two important aspects of ISO 9001 can be improved is 
through continuous improvement (CI), employee empowerment and supplier partnership. CI means that 
organisations should continuously redesign and reengineer their process to ensure that quality is maintained as 
there is always room for improvements (Bozarth and Handfield, 2013). For instance, by implementing Kaizen as 
a model that suggests that identifying incremental changes in the day-to-day processes improvements that aim at 
enhancing sustainable quality improvements (Hayes, 2010). This is important as it enables the daily review of 
processes as they are transmitted in the supply chain hence, increasing efficiency (Hill and Hill, 2011). 
Furthermore, review of buyer-supplier relationship is important since if they do not share a positive commitment, 
this can lead to poor quality (Bozarth and Handfield, 2013). To ensure that suppliers are adhering to the quality 
requirements (Jacobs and Chase, 2018) suggests that organisations should be able to effectively monitor their 
performance and take necessary steps to improve where possible. In addition, employee empowerment is one of 
the most important factors that contributes to the improvement of quality. Employee empowerment means 
enhancing staff motivation in giving them more responsibilities as well as enough training and tools necessary to 
manage quality. Therefore, by implementing the above this can ensure not only the implementation of TQM, but 
also the improvement of performance.  
Conclusion 
Based on the above sections, performance improvement is a vital factor for organisational success and growth. 
Managing and measuring performance is important as it enables not only to identifies and eliminate any non-value 
adding activities in the supply chain operations, but also saves bottom-line operational costs of an organisations 
and therefore gain competitive advantage. The paper reviews several aspects of supply chain operations 
improvement in general and in the manufacturing industry in particular. In addition, it analyses the supply chain 
operational of a small and medium manufacturing company in UK.  The results highlight the problems of the 
company in the supply chain operations and information flow in inbound and outbound logistics areas. Finally, 
several recommendations are proposed to cease the problems. This research offers several directions for future 
research such as the implementing ERP system in SMEs manufacturing industry, implementing lean approach 
and performance improvement as well as the difficulties related to a higher level of demand forecasts in the SMEs 
manufacturing industry.

Abstract 
The mining sector is one of the major contributors to the growth of the economy in Zimbabwe. Gold mining is the 
biggest contributor to the economy and in 2017, an average of 28.4 tons of gold was obtained from both small scale 
and large scale miners with women miners contributing to this success. Gold presents an opportunity for value addition 
into products like jewellery, bars and coins, ornaments and electronic devices. The downstream processing of gold 
results in employment creation, technology transfer, infrastructure development and new product development. The 
Jewelleries Council of Zimbabwe in liaison with the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development, Reserve Bank of 
Zimbabwe and Fidelity Printers Refiners are pushing for the value addition of the yellow mineral for the economic 
growth of Zimbabwe. Gender sensitive policies being formulated by government are meant to encourage women to 
tap into gold value addition and beneficiation initiatives for improved empowerment, income for families and 
empowered societies.  
Keywords: Economic growth, employment creation, gold, value addition, women empowerment 
1. Introduction
Gold is one of the most common minerals and is well known for its special properties and value. Gold exists mostly 
with silver and traces of iron and copper with a gold nugget having 70-90% of gold. Gold is mined from gold ore, 
the ore is crushed and the metal is separate from the ore using a variety of techniques. Gold has a very high density

4. Financial Opportunities for Women in Gold Value Addition and Beneficiation 
The Fidelity Gold Printers is driving the $40-million-dollar Gold Development Initiative Fund where women can 
access funding to go into gold mining and value addition. To date 12% of this 100 million fund has been accessed by 
women. The Government is also working hand with the Women’s Empowerment Bank so that women can access 
funding for value addition opportunities in the mining sector. Young women can also tap from the Youth 
Empowerment Bank for investment opportunities for their banks. The Ministry of Mines and Mining Development 
has also set up a stand-alone department that focuses on Minerals Value Addition and Beneficiation in Zimbabwe 
including gold as the key mineral. Women also have an opportunity to be members of the Jewellers Council of 
Zimbabwe where value addition players in gold and related minerals are represented and have direct information from 
the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and the Fidelity Printers and Refiners. 
5. Environmental Considerations 
Although the value addition of gold is promoted and availability of opportunities, it is critical that environmental 
considerations are made and aligned to in accordance to the Zimbabwean laws and regulations.  Women in gold mining 
must also consider the adoption of mercury free gold processing so as to minimize negative health effects on their 
bodies.  
 
6. Conclusions 
 
Gold value addition and beneficiation promotes various business opportunities for women in mining. Involvement of 
women in gold value addition and beneficiation promotes women empowerment, creation of jobs and improved 
livelihoods. The implementation of the TSP programme as well as the women empowerment programs will see women 
in mining benefiting.

Abstract 
This paper proposes a mixed integer linear programming model for a multi-product ordering in a three-echelon supply 
chain network, where multiple manufacturers supply multiple warehouses with multiple products, which in turn 
distribute the products to the multiple retailers involved. The model considers practical production constraints such as 
production capacity, backorder allowances, and economically-viable minimum order quantities. Numerical 
computations show that the model can efficiently solve small-sized problem instances. 
Keywords 
Supply chain network, Vendor managed inventory, Order quantity, Backorder 
1. Introduction
Production systems are under tremendous pressure and face numerous new challenges, such as fluctuation in demand 
and preferences and rapid changes in technology. They often are part of a larger network, a supply chain network 
(SCN), integrating material, financial, and information flows.  
Supply chain management (SCM) allows for supplying customers in a more efficient and cost-effective way, since a 
broad range of planning, implementing, and controlling activities required throughout product flow, from the supply 
of materials to the final product, can be addressed collectively by all parties involved (Zadeh et al., 2014). Decision 
making in SCM can be categorized into three levels based on the planning horizon (Chopra and Meindl, 2007): 
strategic, tactical, and operational. Strategic decisions involve long term decisions such as customer segments, product 
development, logistics infrastructure (manufacturing, warehousing, vendors, etc.), and purchasing; while tactical 
decisions involve transportation modes, transportation planning, and inventory handling and refer to a time horizon

5. Conclusion 
 
This paper introduces a mixed integer linear programming model for the multi-product ordering under the vendor 
managed inventory policy in a three-echelon SCN. Its novelty comes from the simultaneous optimization of order 
quantities and number of shipments. Furthermore, the problem considered has features not studied yet in the 
optimization of such a problem in a three-echelon SCN, such as the allowance of backorder. The computational results 
obtained show that the proposed modelling approach, in addition to being novel, is capable of quickly finding optimal 
solutions for small-sized problem instances. 
 
In the near future, we will further our computational experiments and also develop heuristic approaches so that real-
sized problem instances can be tackled.

Abstract 
Transportation is one of the main subjects in logistics as it is the responsible of connecting the several steps that 
result in the conversion of resources into useful goods in the name of the ultimate consumer.  Thus, making the 
appropriate and effective transportation decisions to properly make the products arrive safe to customers at right 
time, right place and right cost, is one of the most important operations that transportation managers should focus 
on. 
Transportation mode selection is one of the most important strategic transportation decisions. Furthermore, deciding 
on the appropriate transport mode is a complex problem due to the involvement of several stakeholders with 
different conflicting criteria in making decisions. In this sense, the Multi-criteria group decision making methods 
have been used by several researchers to determine the appropriate transportation mode. The aim of this paper is to 
present an overview of the use of Multi-Criteria Group Decision Making methods for the resolution of transportation 
problems, with a special focus on the transport mode selection problem.

1. Introduction
Nowadays, having the best production system, producing with the best quality and selling with the cheapest price 
are not enough to achieve competitiveness on the market. Besides that, enterprises have to ensure that end-products 
are delivered to end-customers at the right time and in the optimum way. Therefore, the organizations should work 
on improving their logistics processes in  order  to  meet  customer  requirements    as  efficiently  and  effectively  
as  possible.  Supply chain management is the process  of  planning,  controlling    and  implementing    the  overall  
logistic functions  of  the  supply chain  in  which  the  typical  goal  is  producing  and delivering  the  products  of  
right  quality  and  right  quantity,  at the right  time,  right  place  and  right  cost  to  all  customers (Chopra and 
Meindel 2003; Manimaran  et  al. 2011). Achieving the supply chain process’s goal involves several decisions 
relating to flow of information, products, and funds (Vahdat et al., 2017).  
Transportation is one of the major logistical drivers as it is the responsible of connecting the several steps that result 
in the conversion of resources into useful goods in the name of the ultimate consumer (Chopra and Meindel 2003). 
By  means  of  well-handled  transportation  system,  products  of  right  quality  and right  quantity  could  be  sent 
to  all  customers  at  right  time,  right place and right cost (Tseng et al. 2005).  
Transportation mode selection is one of the most important strategic decisions in transportation planning. 
Furthermore, deciding on the appropriate transport mode is a complex problem due to the involvement of several 
stakeholders with different conflicting criteria in making decisions.

Abstract 
The manufacturing industry plays an important role in strengthening a nation’s economy. Sustainable manufacturing 
practices contribute heavily to accelerate the organizational performance which is measured in terms of the impact of 
manufacturing practices on environmental, economic and social aspects. Adopting the resource-based view, the study 
aims to discover the relationship between sustainable manufacturing practices and sustainable performance and assess 
the moderating impact of innovation on the relationship between sustainable manufacturing practices and sustainable 
performance. 
A questionnaire survey is carried out among 168 B.O.I. registered manufacturing companies in Sri Lanka. Regression 
and correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationship of sustainable manufacturing practices with 
sustainability performance and the moderating impact of innovation. 
The findings of the study indicate a strong positive relationship between sustainable manufacturing practices and 
sustainable performance in the Sri Lankan manufacturing industry. Further, innovation creates a moderating impact 
on the relationship between sustainable manufacturing practices and sustainable performance. 
The proposed framework assists manufacturing organizations in selecting suitable sustainable manufacturing practices 
and assessing the level of sustainability. Further, it discusses the use of innovation to enhance the sustainability 
performance of the organization.

mass data was undertaken. Furthermore, the elaboration of a data analysis model is being performed for a company 
within the ambit of the retail sector in Mexico. The abovementioned, through the development of a pilot test, which 
consists of three general stages, identification of the client, validation and refinement of the model and a forecast of 
new clients. The pilot test implies the formulation, refinement and reading of data of mass scale. This is undertaken 
by making use of three analyses: discriminant analysis, hierarchical cluster and k – media cluster. The methodology 
employed is DMADV, which is used where there is a need of designing or a re-designing of products and/or processes 
or, such as this case, the process of data analysis. As a result, a model capable of identifying 5 different segments, 
which the potential of providing analytical capacities in order to know, grow, monitor and maintain e-commerce 
clients within the retail business of Mexico.

Figure 16: Cluster Results by Size and Economic Contribution 
  
After analyzing the results, this were the findings: 
 
The biggest cluster in size (Cluster 4) doesn´t represent the biggest economic contribution to the company. The team 
made a proposal to the company in order to make this group of customers more profitable through targeted marketing, 
encouraging sales. 
 
Another important outcome is that Cluster 1, generates more than half of the income of the e-retailer. So, it’s important 
to keep close attention to this group of customers. They’re valuable customers.  
 
Finally, Cluster 2, represents 5% of sales, even though in size it only represents 1%. This cluster has the potential to 
be a very representative group of customers. The team made a proposal to create new strategies to grow this cluster 
that has the potential to contribute in a bigger scale to the company.   
 
6. Conclusions 
 
The execution conclusions were that the IT team got the first efforts and insights related to analytics applied on the 
ecommerce platform. Its important to mention that six months later the company created a data analytics department 
so that the company can make in collaboration with undergraduate students from the University of Monterrey, data 
analytics projects.  
 
This project was followed up by two more teams to transition from prescriptive analytics to predictive analytics.  
 
The customer analytics model was presented to the CEO at the end of the project and the results were beyond 
expectations.  
 
As well, general conclusions, big data analytics (BDA) enables e-commerce firms to use data more efficiently, 
improve decision making and empower customers (Akter, Wamba, 2016). 
 
BDA support business needs such as: 
• 
Identifying loyal and profitable customers,  
• 
Determining the optimal price,  
• 
Detecting quality problems,  
• 
Or deciding the lowest possible level of inventory.  
 
Data analytics and big data aren’t just part of a new trend, it’s part of a new approach to customers and their needs, 
and how the company need this information in order to stay competitive and be able to respond to market changes and 
demand.

Customer’s preferences and demand change. For the model to work correctly, constantly there must be adjustments, 
and getting new input into the model so the output is accurate.  
 
As well, the team made important recommendations for further modeling: (1) obtain more variables, specially from 
unstructured data. (2) do a further segmentation for e-customers that use the modality of “pick and go”. (3) use 
discriminant analysis with 2018 data to validate clusters and compare with 2017. (4) develop causal models to forecast 
sales for each cluster (5) identify the perfect marketing for each cluster.

Abstract 
TKFR2 is a Multifunction Robot that the developers used to stand for the first Letters of the members of the group 
and their supervisor. The main goal of this project is to design and implement a prototype robot that can provide 
people with assistance, Information and sense of security. The robot has a face with eyes and mouth that lights up 
while communicating with the user. It has a nose that displays a color coded meaning. It has different sensors to 
sense the temperature, humidity, fire and obstacle. It uses Bluetooth technology to connect to a smart mobile phone, 
be controlled in three different ways – by infrared, by a mobile phone application and by giving it voice commands, 
and move around with its robot car part. It can answer some questions and instructions and is interactive because it 
can speak with its user using voice commands designed by the developers. It can move around in forward, 
backward, right and left directions depending on the issued command by remote control, mobile phone application 
or voice command. It can be asked to play or stop music, detect an intruder through its motion detector, and display 
some messages in its LCD display.  
TKFR2 robot has different electronic parts made to intelligently work together to do all of the above-mentioned 
functions. Arduino boards (Mega and Uno), 1Sheeld board and a smart mobile phone were used to make these 
electronic parts provide what the developers intended it to do. The programs used to make all of the electronic parts 
smart were done using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software. The mobile phone 
application used in controlling the robot car was developed using the App Inventor. Overall, the group achieved 
their goal of acquiring a lot of knowledge that will benefit them when they graduate from this College.

Abstract 
The principle of JIDOKA (i.e., autonomation) is based upon identifying and eliminating waste in 
all work activities via automation, whether preemptive or non. Therefore, the (Automatic 
identification and data capture) AIDC is a utility that facilitate the production schedule via super-
market's robot (SM'sR) tool to enhance the VSM output. Since AIDC can integrated with 
transporter robot to present unmanned systems, and revamp collected information on the machine 
status, staff attendance, quality losses, scrap …etc., in real time (JIDOKA proficiency). In this 
work, an effective algorithm-applied during a (Value Stream Map) VSM aims to assemble 
Electrical Appliance (EA's) is developed that simultaneously schedules production and material 
handling operations by exploiting the standard time path of operations network to minimize the 
(Manufacturing Lead Time) MLT, as well as material handling, increase productivity with 35%, 
increase indirect SM's robot utilization with 50% (i.e., decrease the transportation energy, time and 
cost with 50%), which resulting in decrease the total costs by 66% in this practical case.

Abstract 
Automated systems have evolved very rapidly into complex sophisticated tasks and advanced technology. Trust can 
play an important role in understanding the cognitive complexity and increased uncertainty associated with a 
complex automated system. Therefore, measuring human operators’ level of trust while interacting with automation 
is vital in predicting their performance. This research focused on investigating the participants ‘cognitive processes 
through evoking trust and mistrust situations. The brainwaves were recorded in real time to identify specific 
brainwaves and active regions of the brain using electroencephalogram (EEG). This study adopted selected words 
from a previous study that evoked trust and mistrust through situations. This research used a power spectrum 
analysis and coherence analysis to examine the simulation results. The results identified while alpha and beta waves 
were stronger in the trust situations, which the frontal and parietal lobes were stimulated, gamma waves were 
stronger in the mistrust situations, which the temporal and occipital lobes were stimulated.

Abstract 
Generational cohorts are groups of individuals sharing birth years, history, and a characteristics. The last Generation 
Y students are currently college and the Generation Z students are currently starting to stream into the tertiary level 
education. In a few years, the generation Z cohort will comprise the majority of the college and university students. 
Much research has been performed on matching learning styles to teaching styles, but not enough research has been 
done to match the learning preference to generational cohorts. Many instructors and educators believe that there are 
too many learning styles and factors to consider for each student, thereby deeming the classroom changes too 
difficult to institute.  The goal of this research is to find the most significant predictors of student learning for 
generation Y and generation Z students. This study determined that generational cohort and learning preference are 
associated with each other. Specifically, this paper sought to ascertain if there is a significant difference between the 
learning styles and perceived level of importance of factors affecting engineering student’s level of satisfaction 
when grouped according to their respective generational cohort – Generation Y and Generation Z. This study used 
Descriptive Method. The survey questionnaire is pilot tested and validated for deployment to engineering student 
respondents. Statistical treatment is applied and the results of the data analysis showed that there is significant 
difference on the learning style of Generation Y and Generation Z engineering students.  Results also showed that 
Generation Y engineering students see Teaching Method and Feedback and Learning Preferences as significant 
indicators of overall student satisfaction. On the other hand, Generation Z students find Teaching Method, Learning 
Environment and Feedback and Learning Preferences  From these significant findings, the study puts forward the I-
E-M method—Integrate, Evolve and Modernize framework that engineering colleges could adapt to optimize 
engineering student’s satisfaction.

The Move It Forward Theory (MIFT) offers a better method 
to manage major machine failure in a serial flow line.

Abstract 
The paper presents the research findings on a problem that may help the decision makers to manage a major breakdown 
in the Trim, Chasis and Final (TCF) area in an automotive assembly plant with lower loss of production. We propose 
the name of the operating procedure as MIFT (Move It Forward Theory). The proposed method recommends keeping 
the line moving both upstream and downstream of the failed machine while the failed machine is under repair. The 
current practice is to stop the line completely until the failed machine is repaired. The entire system resumes operation 
simultaneously following the repair.   
The research findings are based on study of a scaled down abstraction of the TCF area. The results show that use of 
MIFT based operating procedure leads to recovery from a major machine failure with lower loss of production 
compared to the current practice. The results also show that improvement in performance under MIFT procedure 
depends significantly on the location of the failed machine in relation to the pay point and capacity of the buffers.  The 
paper includes rationale for success of MIFT as well as future extensions.

Abstract 
The manufacturing industry is facing a challenge to adapt to an ever changing business and operational environment. 
The fourth industrial revolution has brought a new set of challenges which requires a different approach to problem. 
Hence, this study investigated the readiness of the case study company to operate in fourth industrial revolution. Also 
identified the set of competencies and career ladders to develop engineers in industry 4.0.  The scope of the study was 
limited to the engineering department within the case study company to assess the readiness, set of engineering 
competencies and career ladders for engineers in industry 4.0. The study used a survey questionnaire to collect primary 
data from a sample of 64 employees within the engineering departments. The study used relative important index (RII) 
to assess the readiness of the organization to operate in industrial 4.0. The exploratory factor analysis was used to 
identify the set of competencies required for engineers in industry 4.0. All the items were found to have the RII more 
than 60% with automated manufacturing scoring a high (RII =83%) and customer driven (RII = 80%). The leadership 
and entrepreneurship were identified as two groups of competencies brought by industry 4.0 in the engineering field. 
Keywords 
Engineering competencies, Fourth Industrial Revolution, Industry 4.0, Career ladder 
1. Introduction
The manufacturing industry is facing a challenge to acclimatize with the evolving operations brought by the 
introduction of the fourth industrial revolution which requires a different approach to problem solving to remain in 
business. The fourth industrial revolution influences the internet by digitalizing the available technologies and the 
ideas of quantum sciences to enhance the independence of artificial intelligence in cyber physical systems (Hwang 
2016). Some of the possibilities created by the new industrial wave include the creation of smart factories, cyber-
physical and the generation of big data systems (Crnjac et al. 2017). Industry 4.0 forces organizations to rethink their 
business strategies; processes and resource distribution. The research therefore assessed the phenomena where the 
career progression of engineers relates with the emerging technologies of the fourth industrial revolution. The research 
assessed the readiness of the case study company to operate in industry 4.0; the set of competencies and career ladders 
for engineer in industry 4.0. The research looked at the proverbial ceiling that engineering employees in an 
organization are exposed to by engaging the sample population on career progression with regards to the fourth 
industrial revolution. This was undertaken with the understanding of the adequate challenge that typically

profiles to remove any ambiguities of certain positional structures. Mostly the respondent indicated that the 
organization should play a role in incorporating training and development in their structures that will assist in aligning 
the organizations business strategies with the employee’s career growth.  
 
5. Conclusion  
Engineering employees play an integral role in this technology driven economy in contributing into the 
competitiveness and future potentials of the organization. The research explored the career paths that engineering 
employees are exposed to throughout their careers and focused on the two stakeholders affected by the fourth industrial 
revolution.  These stakeholders are the engineering employees and the organization.  
 
5.1 To the Engineers 
The responsibility of career progression is personal in nature. Engineering employees need to ensure that they obtain 
the relevant competencies and requirements that will lead them to a prospective career growth by getting involved in 
understanding the organizations strategies and goals. Engineering employees need to comprehend that sufficient 
service with broader knowledge of the organization in part with the relative education are essential for career growth. 
The fourth industrial revolution is changing the nature of how the organizations are doing business. Engineering 
employees need to understand the changing technologies with regards to aligning themselves with the nature of 
business.  Engineering employees need to assess their competencies to align with the engineering competencies of the 
fourth industrial revolution. Industry 4.0 requires engineering competencies that are more wide ranging than the 
historical technical competencies. The industry 4.0 characteristics are totally different from the third industrial 
revolution with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT).  
 
5.2 To the Organization 
The three possible structural options for engineering employees need to be visible. Information and training for each 
pillar needs to be relayed to the employees to understand that there is more than one option for engineering employees 
in the organization. The organization needs to promote a culture of career progression to remove any stagnation in the 
organization and promote fair competitiveness for growth. The organization should formulate career progression 
models that are clearly defined with their requirements that will be readily available for potential career prospects. 
These will be hierarchy guidelines set by the organization in regards to career planning to remove any ambiguities in 
relations to the different available roles in the organization. These models should identify the core competencies and 
set of standards of performance of each role the engineer would undertake. With regards to industry 4.0 the 
organization should consider aligning their structures more towards the changes being influenced by technology. 
Aligning with these changes would ensure the organization succeeds and increases its competitiveness in the 
manufacturing and packaging sector.

Abstract 
Systems engineering and development of system dynamics models are strongly interconnected. During this 
process of system construction, system dynamics modelling represents a useful approach to simulation of 
system behaviour over time and to support the quality and suitability of related decision. Appropriate 
application of systems thinking during the whole modelling process plays a crucial role and it is both 
problematic and challenging. This paper focuses on the identification of the issues occurring during the 
modelling process. The applied methods incorporates the experimental set-up, direct observation of 
modellers and qualitative analysis of developed models. Consequently, the list of identified drawbacks 
linked with particular systems thinking track is developed. The identified mistakes together with their 
linkage with type of thinking are summarised in a useful overview of what could and should be omitted or 
eliminated during the system dynamics modelling. Results reveal that operational thinking represents the 
most challenging thinking track. It is followed by non-linear, analytical, critical and structural thinking. 
Based on the achieved results, the modellers could analyse and revise their approaches and thinking 
patterns. These can be reconsidered and appropriately adapted following the principles of the correct 
application of systems thinking during system dynamics modelling.

1. Introduction
Systems engineering and system dynamics represent disciplines that are strongly dependent on successful application 
of systems approach and systems thinking. Systems approach is the result of a scientific and technical way of thinking 
which complements reductionism, mechanism and analytical explanation embodied in the mechanistic approach. Due 
to introduction of system engineering–related breakthrough technologies such as computers, hydrogen bombs and 
space ships, large-scale problems began to penetrate our society. Consequently, as developed and maintained systems 
had been becoming more complex, the traffic-system breakdowns, environmental disasters and nuclear threats were

thanks to the member’s reflection and correction of inappropriate connections or misleading concepts within the 
models. 
6. Conclusions
Systems thinking represents a skill that needs to be mastered by systems engineers in order to help them to develop 
meaningful system dynamics models that can support proper decision-making and comprehensive view. The mistakes 
in the application of systems thinking might cause significant problems and lead in inappropriate and course of action 
in decisions, predictions, situational analysis etc. This paper introduced some of these issues based on the observation 
and assessment of the system dynamics model creation. The sample modellers repeated a set of aforementioned 
mistakes. These were connected either with causal-loop or stock-and-flow diagrams. Moreover, it was possible to link 
them with particular types of thinking. The provided identification of problematic issues, inappropriate approaches, 
assumptions or conclusions aims to help modellers and prospect users of models to avoid or eliminate the mentioned 
mistakes. As revealed in this study, the operational thinking represents the most challenging thinking track. It is 
followed by non-linear, analytical, critical and structural thinking. Therefore, these skills should be (together with all 
the other types of thinking) practiced in pursuit to be appropriately used in transformation of the systems thinking in 
action.

Abstract 
Pork consumption has increased in Colombia, most dealers are importing it from the other countries, such as the 
United States and Canada. The swine supply chain (SSC) of Colombia has a low level of competitiveness compared 
to other countries because of the lack of incentives to foster technological developments that allow sharing 
information. This paper aims to contribute with a dynamic perspective of the Knowledge Management (KM) to 
understand the impacts of delays of technological developments on SSC. A closed loop diagram is used to represent 
the delays of technological developments on the SSC. This diagram could support the design of the technological web 
platform to knowledge management. Results show that interchange of information using a technological web platform 
would integrate stakeholders of the SSC.  
Keywords 
swine supply chain, knowledge management, systems thinking, competitiveness. 
1. Introduction
The swine sector is attractive for Colombian economy, because it is capability of generates employment (DNP, 2018). 
However, it does not have enough technology and knowledge transfer, specialized transportation, or government 
subsidies. Furthermore, swine smallholders are searching to lower its cost, because pork consumption in Colombia 
has been growing for the last ten years according to statistics from the Federation of Cattle Ranchers - FEDEGAN 
(acronym in Spanish), but demand is not enough. In 2017, swine consumption was 7.1 kilograms per inhabitant 
(FEDEGAN, 2018), however the production cost was between 60% and 70% of the total cost which includes disease 
and pest prevention, high quality, health and safety, and the lack of livestock policies (FAO, 2018). This situation will 
could bring challenges and opportunities for the swine sector in terms of technological development.

4. Conclusions 
 
Competitiveness can be seen as a legislative, political, economic, and social advantage between two different systems, 
it involves the transformation of granted and produced goods which represent an economic profit and added value in 
agroindustry. The low technological level in CSSC is the main obstacle in developing competitiveness. Other obstacles 
are the lack of a) production capacity, b) innovation, research and development (R&D), c) exports, d) product quality, 
f) strong government policies in terms of price fixing and market protection, and g) tax incentives to specific industries. 
Thus, the proposed model in KM would be used to encourage industrial cooperation, to share information, knowledge, 
and raise CSSC competitiveness. 
 
Low technological development and a lack of interest from SC stakeholders seem to be the main barriers in the 
development of a KM model in CSSC.

Abstract 
In present day world, apparel industry is developing and exceeding surprisingly. To boost the productivity and 
quality of product or service, a method improvement tool, lean six sigma (LSS) methodology is followed in several 
industries. Execution of LSS technique will be far easier if the key obstructions just as their need by positioning can 
be discovered. To do as such, 20 barriers have been recognized by going through literature review and by taking 
opinions of managers who are practically connected to the organization. In this study, by applying ""Interpretive 
structural modelling"" (ISM) and ""MICMAC"" (Matriced' Impacts Croise´s Multiplication Applique´e a´ 
unClassement) strategy, a logical relationship among the barriers has been built up and those barriers have been 
isolated into various classes as per their reliance and driving force on one another. 
Keywords: Barriers, Lean Six Sigma, Interpretive Structural Modeling, MICMAC. 
1. Introduction
The Ready-made garments (RMG) industry in Bangladesh is an extraordinary prospect as it has been the greatest 
foreign currency earner in its history. Decisions made by its pioneers can have noteworthy effect on its changing 
future on account of its unparalleled development. The business stands the chance to turn into the leading export 
oriented RMG production center in the world through providing high caliber, fairly paid jobs and more importantly 
making the production process progressively productive and successful through utilizing the best possible tools and 
techniques to guarantee the advancement of this life saver industry of the nation since this sector has to manage both 
cost and compliance. To adapt to the changing dynamics of international apparel industry, continuous improvement 
of both forward and backward linkage is an absolute necessity to increase worldwide status.  
To improve the method in successful way, extraordinary strategies are being sought after. Among them Lean 
manufacturing process and six sigma has increased critical prevalence. Lean manufacturing process allots an 
incentive to the raw material despite the fact that it lessens waste. Then again, six sigma definitely diminishes the 
nonconformity of finished products through effective problem solving techniques. In the ongoing years, shorter 
product life cycle requests shorter time to advertise which can be met by incredible usage of lean six sigma. Usage 
of these two techniques is making the procedure significantly simpler to finish than ordinary procedure. In lean six 
sigma process, process improvement is quicker and increasingly proficient on the grounds that lean accelerates six 
sigma process. (Cherrafi, Elfezazi, Chiarini, Mokhlis, & Benhida, 2016). To ensure customer satisfaction, this 
process sets its focus on defect prevention instead of defect prevention to ensure the proper use of resources through 
creating work standard and adjusted stream. The barriers of lean six sigma debilitates the proficiency of 
organization’s procedures. Also, there are between relationships among the barriers which have not yet been 
analyzed.

barriers have been found in this cluster. These selected autonomous factor for LSS are: EB3, EB7, EB11, EB13, 
EB15 and EB19. 
Cluster II represents “dependent barrier”. Manager should take special care of these barriers for successful 
implementation. Four barriers have been found as dependent factors. These are EB2, EB4, EB10, EB12, EB16 and 
EB20. 
Cluster III represents “linkage barrier” which is highly unstable. Any action on this factor can imply effects on 
others, also there will be feedback on themselves. Among our selected barriers none has showed this unstable 
nature. 
Lastly, cluster IV represents “independent barrier”. This factor is called key factor as it plays vital role for the 
implementation of the system. Here we have found EB1, EB5, EB6, EB8, EB9, EB14, EB17 and EB18 as 
independent factors. 
6. Result Analysis 
From the ISM diagraph, we have observed that among our 20 selected barriers, lack of top management support (EB 
1) plays the most vital role as it drives 16 other barriers and is dependent on only 1 barrier which means it has high 
driver power and low dependence. Other barriers such as different function, hierarchical level (EB 8), lack of funds 
for lean six sigma practices (EB 14), lack of formal training for managers about the process (EB 17), project 
manager's lack of adequate skill about project management (EB 18), lack of knowledge and awareness (EB 5) and 
Lack of competence of mid-level manager (EB 6) are also in the lower part of the hierarchy having high driving 
power and comparatively low dependence on other factors. They fall into cluster IV of the MICMAC analysis graph 
and so they are named as independent factors or barriers and they are less dependent on other factors and at the same 
time, capable of influencing large amount of other factors. On the other hand, worker's reluctant behaviour (EB 12) 
and subcontractor's compromised quality of work (EB 20) are at the top of the hierarchy and are driven by many 
other barriers. So these two barriers have very high dependence as they are driven by other 15 and 13 barriers 
respectively. And they have very low driver power as EB 12 influence only 1 other barrier and EB 20 drive no other 
barrier except itself. So, they fall into cluster II and these factors are recognized as dependent factors. In the middle 
we observe both the barriers with high driving power with high dependence and low driving power with high 
dependence which are named as linkage factors (cluster III) and autonomous factors (cluster II) respectively. 
Absence of employee empowerment (EB 13), workers' resistance to change and adopt new practice (EB 15) and 
lack of formal training for workers (EB 19) are some examples of autonomous factors. No factors from the selected 
barriers fell into the cluster of linkage factors which shows unstable characteristics. 
7. Conclusion  
Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) causes us to build up a precise and directional structure for a complex 
framework alongside a practical image of the framework. It shows both direct and indirect relationship among the 
basic barriers of debilitating LSS in RMG sector. It additionally gives distinctive dimensions of the intense barriers. 
With the assistance of these dimensions of the barriers, a basic structure is created. With the assistance of these 
structure and information of various dimensions of various barriers, a manager can co-ordinate among these barriers 
without much of a stretch which will quicken the way toward actualizing LSS in RMG division. MICMAC analysis 
gives four distinctive group through driving power and dependence. From this ISM model and MICMAC 
examination we locate the basic barriers and interrelationship among them which will impede the way toward 
actualizing LSS in RMG sector.

Abstract 
In order to reduce energy consumption and the environmental impact of fossil fuel, a hybrid system which combines 
solar panel and wind turbine can assist to provide a reliable and fully customized power to operate street light. The 
system uses photovoltaic solar cells that directly convert solar energy into electrical energy, combined with a 
horizontal wind turbine generator which converts wind power into electrical energy. This electrical energy is stored 
in a battery. During day time electricity is generated using the solar panel, while the wind turbine is used to generate 
electricity in cloudy and rainy days, as well as at night. Solar and wind energy combine to provide enough energy to 
power the light system for 10-hours, without connected to the grid. The project aims to design a portable and low 
cost power system that combines both wind electric and solar electric technologies. This system will be designed in 
efforts to develop a power solution to minimize the cost of lighting the streets. For this reason, it is imperative to 
design a hybrid system that will deliver a minimum of 1 kWh of continuous power which is enough to power a wide 
range of appliances especially the lights of the streets.

2.0 Introduction 
Within the later times the base of nearly everything is the electrical energy. Fossil and atomic control plants are 
utilized for the most part to meet the show energy request. As the request of electrical energy has expanded 
universally, there’s a major risk of quick consumption of the fossil fuel saves to meet that request. Renewable 
energy is energy that's assembled from characteristic assets that are actually topped off as time goes on. A few 
illustrations incorporate daylight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal warm. Electrical energy can be created by 
numerous sorts of clean and renewable energy sources. A few illustrations incorporate sun oriented energy, wind 
energy, wave energy, hydroelectricity, biomass energy, energy from natural squander, tidal energy, and geothermal 
energy. All sources of renewable energy have natural benefits over utilizing of routine fossil powers. 
2.1 Hybrid Power Systems 
2.1.1 Solar energy 
Solar energy-based energy can be characterized as boundless, renewable and natural contamination free energy from 
the sun. The sun oriented framework has two sorts. To begin with framework changes over sun based energy to D.C 
control and the moment framework changes over sun based energy to warm. The daylight is changed over to D.C 
power with offer assistance of sun based cells. Semiconductor materials are utilized to create sun oriented cells in 
PV module and silicon is the foremost common fabric since it is fundamentally made from sand. The major sorts of 
photovoltaic frameworks are the off-grid (stand-alone).

Analysis of Energy Efficiency between Conventional and 
Insulated wall house in Australia

Abstract 
The residential housing sector consumes a significant amount of fossil fuel energy and thereby the sector generates a large 
percentage of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming and climate change. At present, approximately 39% 
of the total household energy used is required for space heating/cooling and a substantial amount of that energy is lost through 
the house walls. Additionally, the floor space area and volumetric dimension of modern residential houses are increasing at a 
constant rate in most developed countries including Australia. This additional space also requires energy for heating and 
cooling. Therefore, the energy consumption for heating and cooling and greenhouse gas emissions will be increasing rapidly. A 
continuous upward energy consumption trend in residential housing sector worldwide will continue for years to come unless 
energy efficient and carbon neutral house wall systems are developed. One of the biggest challenges is to develop a smart 
house wall system made of thermal mass and insulation materials that can provide reduced energy needs for on-going heating 
and cooling with lower carbon footprint as most house wall construction materials are very energy intensive and have large 
carbon footprints. In order to develop a new energy smart house wall system, a study has been undertaken on thermal 
performance of two house wall systems (one is currently used conventional brick veneer house wall and other is an alternative 
house wall). The thermal performance (heat gain or loss through the wall) has been determined using computational modeling 
and experimental measurements. The effects of various climate conditions on these two house wall systems have also been 
determined. The findings indicate that the house with insulation material provides better thermal efficiency than that of 
currently used conventional house wall. 
Key Words

Introduction
The expansion of global economy and population growth has led to the expansion of cities and urbanization. This expansion 
has dramatically increased not only the demand for new buildings and houses but also energy need. For example, in 2020, 
the energy consumption in the Australian residential house sector will be almost 467 PJ compared to 299 PJ in 1990 which 
means the demand will increase by over 50%. The number of residential houses is expected to be around 10 million in 2020 
compared to 6 million in 1990. In most developed countries, the demand for residential buildings has been rapidly 
increasing due to population growth. More buildings and houses need more energy. Figure 1 illustrates the increasing trend 
the housing sector energy consumption for coming years. Additionally, the average floor space of new Australian residential 
houses is increasing progressively. As a result, the energy consumption is also increasing for the additional space heating 
and cooling. This additional energy consumption leads to higher CO2 emissions [3].

system, Darwin has the highest total energy needs for the heating and cooling while Brisbane has the lowest energy need. 
Adelaide and Melbourne have similar energy requirements for the ongoing heating and cooling. Hobart’s energy load is in 
between of other cities. On the other hand, the house with insulation material used in this study needs significantly less 
energy for all six cities. A notably less energy (~ 30%) for the heating and cooling using the house with insulation material 
(envelope) is required for the city of Darwin. Likewise, the heating and cooling energy reductions for other four cities were 
28%, 20%, 14%, 20% and 19% (Adelaide, Melbourne, Hobart, Brisbane and Sydney) respectively. Energy required for 
heating and cooling, and star rating for all six cities are shown in tables 4 and 5.

Conclusions
The paper presents a thermal performance modelling of two house wall systems (conventional and new) for six Australian 
cities. The study evaluated the total ongoing heating and cooling requirements using two wall systems and compared their 
energy performances. The following conclusions are drawn from the study: 
•
Using the house with insulation material energy savings ranging from 14% to 33% various climate zones is achieved.
This will reduce the greenhouse gas emission, enhance sustainable environment and energy security. However, further
study is required to understand the full potential of the new house wall system.
•
The thermal performance of the conventional house wall system is poor as it needs more energy for ongoing heating
and cooling. However, a retrofit with smart materials can improve its thermal performance.

• 
The house with insulation material provides better thermal performance than the conventional wall systems for all six 
Australian cities.  
• 
Based on major findings and limitation of this study, some future studies have been identified. These recommendations 
include: i) undertaking a thermal performance study using a full-scale model house with conventional and new house 
wall systems; ii) exploring a new concept for the roof system, since a significant portion of heat gain/loss is occurred 
through the roof; and iii) carrying out investigation on the effects of humidity and dynamic heating/cooling loads. 
• 
The house used in this work is an average family house for two adults and two children. In this study, the effect of 
internal heat gains on heating and cooling performance is not considered due to computational modelling limitation.

Abstract 
 
This study proposes methods to improve the performance of Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. This 
algorithm is used in many areas, such as the inspection of fabricated parts. The field of inspection is very 
necessary to ensure the quality of the production. The inspection of manufactured parts consists of automatically 
comparing their CAD model with their point clouds. The comparison of these two models makes it possible to 
conclude whether a manufactured part conforms to its theoretical model defined during its design. In this paper, 
the proposed control method is based on the ICP algorithm. The principle of this algorithm is to find the optimal 
rigid transformation to readjust the point clouds (measured on the real part) on the manufactured part. Many 
variants of ICP algorithm are proposed in this paper. They reduce errors and improve inspection, quality of 
machined parts. A comparison of their efficiencies on the purpose of improving performance and accelerating 
the convergence speed of the ICP algorithm is performed. 
Keywords:

Introduction 
 
The three-dimensional (3D) inspection of parts is the comparison between the Computer Aided Design (CAD) 
model (theoretical model) of the part and the point cloud (real model) resulting from the acquisition (Mahmud et al. 
2011). This comparison allows us to evaluate local and global errors that may exist between models and 
manufactured parts (Boughouas et al. 2008). 
The method used is based on the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm (Besl and McKay 1992) (Chen and 
Medioni 1992), (Zhang 1994). This algorithm is widely used in various fields such as 3D reconstruction (Lu et al. 
2006), simultaneous localization and mapping (Minguez et al. 2006), biometric recognition (Bowyer et al. 2006), 
medical image analysis (Almhdie et al. 2007), adaptation of machining paths (Azzam et al 2014) and 3D parts 
inspection (Biradar and Pande 2015). ICP algorithm is an iterative descent procedure to find the optimal rigid 
transformation between two models (for example, a point cloud and a CAD model). 
The transformation is calculated to determine the rigid displacement that the measured surface (point cloud) 
would have to undergo to come to the nominal surface (CAD model). 
This choice is justified by the robustness of this method, and it is important to underline here, that no attempt 
implementation in the software of the Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) has been reported in the literature 
relative on this research topic (Zhu et al. 2007). 
This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 describes the alignment process of the Iterative Closest Point 
(ICP) algorithm. The results and discussions of the application of the proposed approaches are presented in Section 
3. This is followed by conclusions and future work in section 4.

Figure 6 shows the execution time in seconds of the four-optimization methods of the ICP algorithm (kd-tree 
ICP, ICP SVD, ICP DQ, and ICP UQ) as a function of the number of iterations. This figure shows that the final 
value of the execution time after alignment is lower than with the kd-tree method: T(ICP kd-Tree) = 5.80s, T(ICP 
SVD) = 7.62s, T(ICP DQ) = 10.17s and T(ICP UQ) = 10.71s. 
On the other hand, this figure clearly shows that the kd-tree method converges rapidly to a stable solution after a 
maximum of 30 iterations, whereas the other methods such as SVD, quaternion dual (DQ) and unit quaternion (UQ) 
converge after 36 iterations.

Conclusion 
 
This paper, presents methods for improving the performance of Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to inspect 
freeform surfaces. This algorithm is used in many fields, such as machining, biomechanics and the inspection of 
fabricated parts. 
The main purpose of the ICP algorithm is to find the optimal rigid body displacement between two sets of data. 
This alignment algorithm allows recalibrating the measured surface (point clouds) on the CAD model (theoretical 
model). 
Subsequently, approaches to improve the performance of the ICP algorithm are proposed. A first test allowed to 
test the selection of the points of the two models. It allowed us to show and validate that the point selection method 
was effective. In addition, the proposed method makes it possible to accelerate the ICP algorithm significantly. On 
the other hand, it is not guaranteed for the estimation of the optimal rigid transformation. 
The second test concerns the convergence speed of the ICP algorithm. His test is compared both basic and 
improved algorithms. It allowed us to show that the Delaunay triangulation method is faster than the basic method, 
which is logical because the number of points has been reduced. 
The third test realized also improves the performance of the ICP algorithm, but also to highlight the effect of the 
minimization techniques used in the ICP algorithm. The test clearly shows that the kd-tree method is the most 
efficient towards a stable and fast solution. 
The inspection method used is based on the ICP algorithm. When there is a lot of measurement noise in the point 
cloud, the ICP converges to a false minimum. In future works, new ways could be explored to limit this noise.

Abstract 
Researches on the success of the integration between educational technology and pedagogy approach are 
widely studied in the past. Therefore, implementing pedagogy with innovation and new technology would 
create the tempting learning environment. However, the impact of these factors on learners’ motivation is 
nevertheless to be explored. During this study, factors of collaborative learning and e-learning were chosen 
as important learning approaches of acquiring and constructing knowledge. Consequently, this study 
investigates the impact of the proposed collaborative e-learning on the motivation of second-year students. 
The students were divided into an experimental group (n=25) and control group (n=25). The students in 
both groups will start with taking a pre-test to measure their prior-knowledge of system analysis and design, 
followed by a questionnaire about their computer profile. The students in the control group participated in 
a conventional learning support system, whereas those in the experimental group learned with the suggested 
system. After finishing the learning activities, the students were evaluated their learning achievement 
followed by a perception questionnaire about learning support system. The results of the experiment showed 
that collaborative e-learning effectively increased the students’ learning achievement and promoted positive 
perception toward the system. Besides, the integration of collaborative learning and e-learning approach 
can improve students’ learning motivation.

Abstract 
Adomian decomposition method is a numerical method that introduced by George Adomian to solve stochastic 
equations. This method is able to solve equations without linearization, discretization, perturbation or other restrictive 
assumptions. This method can also be used to solve differential equations with integer or fractional order, ordinary or 
partial, with initial value or boundary problems, with variable or constant coefficients, linear or nonlinear, 
homogeneous or nonhomogeneous. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to review the application of the Adomian 
decomposition method to find solutions for various equations. For example ordinary and partial differential equations, 
also with fractional order. There is also a review of the Adomian decomposition method developed with Laplace 
transform. Heat and Black-Scholes equations can also be easily solved by this decomposition method. The results 
show that Adomian decomposition method is an effective and easy algorithm to solve various differential equations.

1. Introduction
The Adomian decomposition method was first introduced by George Adomian to solve the system of stochastic 
equations (Adomian, 1980). This decomposition method can be an effective procedure for obtaining analytical 
solutions without linearization or weak nonlinear assumptions, perturbation theory or restrictive assumptions on 
stochastic cases (Adomian, 1988). This method can be used to solve integral, differential and integral-differential 
equations. Differential equations that can be solved by this method can have order of integers or fractional numbers, 
ordinary or partial, with initial value or boundary problems, with variable or constants coefficients, linear or nonlinear, 
homogeneous or nonhomogeneous (Bellman and Adomian, 1985; Ray and Bera, 2005; Nhawu et al., 2016; Al awadah, 
2016). This decomposition method is also a powerful and useful technique for solving heat, waves (Biazar and 
Amirtaimoori, 2005; Jafari and Daftardar-gejji, 2006), Fokker-Plank (Tatari et al., 2007) and Black-Scholes equation 
for pricing option (Bohner and Zheng, 2009; Biazar and Goldoust, 2013). Using the Caputo derivative, the Adomian

9. Conclusion 
 
The Adomian decomposition method (or combined by Laplace transform) can be an effective, straightforward and 
powerful technique for solving ordinary or partial differential equation, which is providing generally a rapidly 
convergent series solution, also fractional differential equations. This method provides several advantages such as 
easily computable and be able to obtain analytical or approximate solutions that can be accepted without perturbation, 
linearization and discretization, or resulting massive computation. The ADM assumes the nonlinear term can be 
decomposed into infinite series which loads Adomian polynomials. This decomposition method is also capable, 
successful and efficient to solve heat and Black-Scholes equation.

Abstract  
 
The focus of this study is to present the importance of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for 
disaster management. UAVs are fast and highly customizable. They can play a significant role in 
disaster management. They can be used for assessment of the situation, delivery of supplies and 
locating people. Fast and efficient assessment of disaster-affected regions can be done using 
UAVs. This will help in faster relief and recovery. It is essential to select the appropriate type of 
UAV, along with its additional features, based on the requirements. Also, various parameters like 
cost, speed and height at which the UAV should fly must be considered.

 1. Introduction 
 
Over the past few decades, the number of disasters that have occurred across the world has 
increased exponentially. The disasters may be natural or man-made, but the effects of both have 
caused significant loss to life and damage to people and property. It is crucial that the effects of 
these disasters be reduced to a minimum. Disaster management is the process of reducing the 
damage done by any disaster and working on fixing the damage as quickly as possible. Disaster 
management consists of four parts: mitigation, preparedness, relief and recovery (He and 
Zhuang, 2016). All parts are crucial for reducing the damage caused due to a disaster. Mitigation 
and preparedness must be done before the disaster has occurred while relief and recovery would 
be during and after the disaster respectively.

UAVs can play a significant role in disaster management. Since they are much faster and can be 
of various sizes, they are easier to use and can help reduce the loss of life and the damage done 
during a disaster. The performance of UAVs shows that the rescue time, as well as cost, may be 
reduced. Since they have a more comprehensive view from above, they are instrumental in 
search and rescue operations. UAVs with a higher load-bearing capacity may also be used to 
deliver emergency supplies to places which are not accessible by road. Many modes of transport 
cannot continue because of the damage to the roads. Hence, UAVs can be used to collect 
information about the disaster-affected region faster and more efficiently. UAVs can be used to 
locate people lost or stuck due to the disaster in a shorter period. This information can be used to 
analyse what is necessary for saving the people and for a quick recovery from the disaster. 
 
The UAV to be used for a particular situation should be carefully selected based on battery life, 
weight, load bearing capacity, sensors, automation or remote control, and many such factors. 
Each of its parameters like flight height, speed, the range should be optimised. The routing for 
these UAVs is also essential.  
 
The studies did not consider wind factors for the UAV during flight. The use of thermal imaging 
may improve the possibility of correctly locating a person. Global Positioning System (GPS) is 
not consistently available in mountainous regions. More efficient communication is required 
between the operators and the UAVs. Collision with objects apart from other UAVs should be 
considered while planning its routing. Battery costs are also not considered. Due to the small 
battery life of UAVs, research on the possibility of recharging them mid-air, mid-operation could 
be done. The current UAV technology has several limitations such as limited payload and 
operations range due to energy constraints. Since they have limited flight timings, a hybrid 
system including trucks, Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs), helicopters, and UAVs is the most 
important for disaster response.

Abstract 
This project explains a technique that is reliable for condition monitoring of a car engine by applying instantaneous 
angular speed (IAS) analysis. The rotating of the crankshaft is affected by piston velocity that was derived in this 
report using the equation. The experimental work and the analysis discussed in this project provide a fine 
understanding of the damage effects on the instantaneous angular speed. Moreover, it is showing the details in 
crankshaft motion using angular motion technique. The optical encoder is used to acquire the angular motion data. 
The signals were obtained and analyzed in the phase domain using the signal averaging to determine fault and its 
position. 
National Instruments hardware is used and NI LabVIEW software code is developed for real time. The sensitivity of 
optical encoders to pistons fault detection techniques is experimentally investigated by applying IAS analysis under 
different operating conditions.

Abstract 
Skills and abilities of production employees influence radical the production processes performance, value 
added and efficiency of production flows. Presented paper analyse important parameters of digital literacy 
of employees in production processes and confronts the results with the actual requirements on production 
employees in digitized technology environment. Crucial conclusions of research realised in industrial 
companies will be presented. Orientation of production employees on standardisation of digitized 
knowledge and skills will be confirmed as crucial point of digitized production processes as a whole.

1. Introduction
In last 5 year, we have a lot of experiences from industrial companies from the area of employee’s ability to learn new 
technologies, connected with automation a digitization of production processes. Due to the continuous automation of 
simple manufacturing processes, the number of workspaces with a high level of complexity will increase, which results 
in the need of high level of education of the staff. The challenge is to qualify employees to shift their capacities to 
workspaces with more complex processes and ensure the retention of jobs in changing working environments 
(Hecklau, 2016). Industry is currently undergoing a transformation towards full digitalization and of manufacturing 
processes. Although a common agreement exists on the necessity for technological advancement of production 
technologies and business models in the sense of Industry 4.0, a major obstacle lies in the perceived complexity and 
abstractness which partly hinders its quick transformation into industrial practice (Erol, 2016). Knowledge transfer is 
becoming increasingly important in organizations. Organizations that are able to transfer knowledge effectively from 
one unit to another are more productive and more likely to survive than those that are less adept at knowledge transfer. 
Although organizations are able to realize remarkable increases in performance through knowledge transfer, 
successful knowledge transfer is difficult to achieve (Argote, 2000). By focusing on the psychological processes that 
underlie knowledge transfer within a unit and between units within a firm, this special issue complements work in 
cognitive psychology on knowledge transfer at the individual level of analysis as well as work in strategy and 
organizational theory on knowledge transfer at the firm or industry levels of analysis. This special issue opens up the 
“black box” of knowledge transfer in organizations by providing new theory and empirical evidence on the 
psychological processes that are the foundations for knowledge transfer in organizations. Large increases in 
productivity are typically realized as organizations gain experience in production. These „learning curves have been 
found in many organizations. Organizations vary considerably in the rates at which they learn. The volume of process 
related data is growing rapidly: more and more business operations are being supported and monitored by information 
systems. Industry 4.0 and the corresponding industrial Internet of Things are about to generate new waves of process 
related data, next to the abundance of event data already present in enterprise systems. However, organizations often 
fil to convert such data into strategic and tactical intelligence. this is due to the lack of dedicated technologies that are

Horizontal integration focuses on manufacturing technology, machinery and equipment scheduling, human capacity 
scheduling, material flows, and on-going automation of workplaces, capable of working on-line and under the 
management of digital technologies. The result of planning is a complete process map of the digitized process in 
connection with technical, technological and human resources. Horizontal integration allows the elimination of 
isolated workshop activities while maintaining a complex manufacturing process by concentrating all the activities of 
the manufacturing process into one compact unit that is directly linked to the resulting vertical integration module. 
Each process map element has an accurate digitized label and description that allows digitized technologies to be 
flexible in planning based on on-line orders for a given production system. 
Vertical integration provides the transfer of work instructions and the flow of information - from the simplest digital 
sensor to the workshop - to the corporate internet, cloud and other available technologies to support the digitization 
of production processes. It is good if these technologies are linked to MES, MRP, SAP. The main purpose of vertical 
integration is the elimination of excess data and the support of efficient online controlled information flows for 
digitally controlled production processes. 
 
5. Conclusion 
The future of production as it is envisioned by Industry 4.0 is characterized by small decentralized and digitalized 
production networks which are acting autonomously and are therefore capable of efficiently controlling their 
operations in response to changes of the environment and strategic goals. The nodes of such a network are so called 
smart factories which are connected to a larger value-chain network that fulfils a certain customer demand. Machines 
and materials are the assets that are located at the bottom line of the whole automation pyramid but are all well 
integrated through standardized interfaces. Materials and products are uniquely identifiable and locatable at all times 
during the manufacturing process and as well along their entire life-cycle. These smart materials and products are 
customized to a large extent at the costs of mass production (Erol, 2016). One of the key trends is that companies must 
pay more attention to the accuracy and timeliness of data for product development and their subsequent production

(Hou, 2017). If individual product components come from multiple manufacturers, digital technology and digitally 
managed production equipment must communicate effectively with one another. Here we talk about so-called digital 
networking technologies that claim different types of digital standards, and then new data transfer technologies among 
many industrial companies. Object Intelligence will be a completely new parameter, which we are starting to monitor 
very closely now, having a crucial impact on waste reduction, elimination of downtime, failure of machines and 
equipment. Just the tracking of sensors for each machine, digital technology or workplace delivers cloud-based on-
line decisions to further run the production processes in real-time.

Abstract 
This paper aims at learning from the mistakes of a single case in which the mismanagement of the relationships with 
the local community stakeholder has resulted in extensive social protests against the project and its shut down. 
Interviews with local authorities and journalists reflected their perception from Repsol’s behaviour during the period 
starting from oil prospection initiating phase in early millennium till 2015 when the project was completely 
abandoned by the project organization. The results of the exploratory case study revealed that the shareholder 
orientation of the project organization has resulted in several mistakes in community management policies and have 
eventually amplified the opposition against the project. Lack of transparency, reluctance to build trustful relationship 
with the local community, lack of respect to the local community’s dignity and prioritization of the shareholders’ 
demands and values over those of the local government and community have resulted in being recognized as 
illegitimate and invalid.

Abstract 
Lumber production planning can be classified as a general lot sizing and scheduling problem, which has been 
addressed with MIP formulations and myopic methods. These models allow backlogs, inventory, and sequence 
dependent set-ups based on due date of orders, but they do not analyze the effect on costs. The research conducted in 
this field until now focused on fulfillment of demand for lumber in a certain period without questioning the 
manufacturing cost of this policy. My research determines the opportunity cost of a multi-period LP approach in 
comparison with order-processing sequences. I conducted a study to determine the cost of scheduling sequences to 
process production orders. First, I built a multi-period MIP model (PL) where demands must be satisfied in a certain 
period of the planning horizon, without explicit orders and due dates. A relaxed version of the PL model allowing 
backlogs without penalties was also built. Second, I added a production sequence to test how sequences to process 
orders affected their due dates and called this model planning-scheduling (PS). The periods of the formulation were 
dropped and an “earliness” constraint that forced orders to be processed without violating their due dates was added. 
Earliest due date (E), longest processing time (L), and shortest processing time (S) heuristics sequences were used to 
sort orders which were then fed to the DSS. A relaxed version of this PS model allowing overdue orders (i.e., 
relaxing the earliness constraint) without penalization was also built. The PL model and its relaxed version PLr were 
solved with five sizes of demand, and the PS model and its relaxed PSr version were solved with five sizes of orders. 
The demand and sum of the orders were equivalent in volume, and order due dates occurred in the corresponding 
periods. The PL approach was the cheapest, although with a small cost gap in comparison to the PS with an E 
sequence. However, when relaxing overdue orders, this last approach was as efficient as PL, with lower backlogged 
volumes (high fulfillment of order due dates). Thus, the PS with an E sequence is proposed as the best approach to 
plan lumber production orders in sawmilling operations. Although the percentage differences in costs of the 
planning and scheduling approaches PSA-scenarios were not dramatic, the economic effect of the PS with an E 
sequence could be significant given the operational scale of this type of facility. Moreover, the PS with an E 
sequence showed the ability to reduce the backlog ratio close to zero, when the corresponding PL backlog ratio was 
14%. I did not apply any penalties for backlogs because of the subjective nature of these costs; however, when 
shortages occurred the demand was lost or backlogged with substantial costs. Therefore, if I adopt my planning 
approach using a conservative backlog cost, sawmill which produces 300,000 m3 or 125,000 mbf per year would 
reduce backlogged orders by 42 thousand m3 (i.e., 14% backlog reduction). If the holding lumber cost is 2 US$/m3, 
annual savings would be $336,000.

Abstract 
The mechano-probabilistic study is based on a set of statistical models allowing the understanding of the modes 
of fracture materials. In our case, we used the model of BORDET which has the distinction of being slightly 
complex and thin compared to other statistical models. This model takes into account the maximum principal stress 
at each moment and not the maximum main stress during loading. The Bordet model requires the knowledge of 
parameters intrinsic to the studied material (unalloyed steel killed with aluminum centered cubic structure). This 
work allows the optimization of the BORDET probabilistic model parameters; It defines a probability of rupture 
of the test pieces tested for the estimation of the durability of product. In our case the simulation test is done by 
quasi-dynamic tensile test for the extension to the cyclic tests.

Abstract 
Needle Stick Injury (NSI) is a percutaneous wound set by a needle point, other sharp instruments or objects 
which is a major risk factor to transmit blood-borne diseases among health care professionals. Present study 
was done to assess NSI as a health hazard in regard to their knowledge & practice & to find out the co-
relation between knowledge & practice among 100 health care workers of Private Hospitals, Pokhara, 
Nepal. Data was collected by structured questionnaire. Study result revealed that majority of health care 
workers were females (93%) with mean age of 22.66 years (±3.1). Forty two percent had wrong concept 
about the meaning of NSI. There were only 35% of workers who dispose the sharps in cardboard box where 
as 65% used wrong place. Only 22% had a proper practice of disposal of sharp box when it is 3/4th full. 
While finding a used needle on the floor after closing the box with sharp only 38% use a new box which is 
the correct means. Seventy nine percent of workers expressed that, they never received any training in the 
prevention &/ or treatment of NSI. There was a positive correlation between knowledge & practice scores 
(p= 0.004). As it denotes that poor knowledge leads to poor practice, thus study concludes that poor 
knowledge and practice can be the key causes to get NSI as a major health hazards among health care 
professionals.

Abstract 
Local community is the forgotten legitimate stakeholder of megaprojects which can influence the project 
organization’s activities by its support or opposition. However, megaprojects have always been recognized as being 
unpopular leaving project organizations with the community’s dissatisfaction. Understanding the local community’s 
evaluation of the project organization activities would lead organizations to better satisfying them as well as gaining 
their support and being recognized as legitimate. This research adopts an exploratory case study method to reveal 
organizations which try to get utmost compatibility with societal norms and values are known as better legitimate 
compared to those aggressively change the societal values. Additionally it suggests that while a community has a 
history with an organization over time it considers a stereotype for the organization and limits the further analysis of 
new information for finding causality of organization’s activities. Therefore, organizations which aim as changing 
their approach should involve local community to actively observe and analyze organization recent behavior to 
develop a new stereotype for the organization.

Abstract 
 
In this paper, the location routing problem (LRP) with outsourced delivery is studied. The objective of LRP is to 
determine the best combination of depot locations and vehicle routes that minimizes the total costs. In the classical 
LRP, all products are delivered with non-outsourced delivery, which is the delivery mode where all customers are 
included in the delivery routes. Non-outsourced delivery is efficient if customers are densely located. However, if 
customers are sparsely located, outsourced delivery is more efficient. In outsourced delivery, products are delivered 
to customers directly by third-party delivery services. In this study, the outsourced delivery mode is added to the LRP 
model so that suitable transportation modes are selected. Introducing this model makes the LRP more complicated. 
To solve the problem efficiently, a clustering-based heuristic is proposed. Test instances based on LRP benchmark 
instances were solved by using the algorithm. The results of our computational experiments showed the proposed 
algorithm can find a 20% better solution than MIP within an hour for problems with a hundred customers.

 1. Introduction 
 
It is essential for logistics businesses to solve the location routing problem (LRP) to reduce delivery costs. The LRP 
is the combined problem of the facility location problem (FLP) and the vehicle routing problem (VRP). The objective 
of the LRP is to determine the best combination of depot locations and vehicle routes that minimizes the total costs, 
which include the fixed costs of the depot, fixed costs of the vehicle, and variable costs of the vehicle. Maranzana 
(1964) was aware of the need to decide the location of the facility and the dispatch route simultaneously. Since a 
heuristic algorithm for the LRP was first proposed by Jacobsen and Madsen (1980), many algorithms for the LRP 
were proposed. Tuzun and Burke (1999) applied a two-phase tabu search. Chan & Baker (2005) combined the 
minimum spanning forest and a modified Clarke-Wright procedure. To solve the capacitated LRP, Prins et al. (2007) 
used a Lagrangian relaxation of the assignment constraints and a granular tabu search, and Escobar et al. (2014) 
proposed algorithm that included a granular tabu search within a variable neighborhood search. Ponboon et al. (2016) 
tried to get exact solutions for the LRP with delivery time windows by using a branch and price algorithm. Farham et 
al. (2018) also applied a column generation approach for the LRP with delivery time windows. 
For logistics, it is essential to solve the LRP, therefore, there are many variations. One of the variations is multi 
echelon LRP. Goodarzi and Zegordi (2016) tried to solve the two-echelon LRP with cross-docking. Rahmani et al. 
(2016) proposed the two-echelon LRP with pickup and delivery. A heterogeneous fleet with two-echelon capacitated

5. Conclusion 
 
To improve delivery efficiency, we proposed a new location routing problem (LRP) model with outsourced delivery. 
The model includes not only selection of depot location and vehicle routes, but also selection of delivery mode, that 
is selection of non-outsourced delivery or outsourced delivery. And a clustering-based heuristic is proposed to solve 
LRP with outsourced delivery. The algorithm divides the original LRP into smaller problems to make it easier to solve, 
without reducing the optimization potential as much as possible. The idea of clustering is not to divide all customers 
into clusters, but to cluster only close customers. In the next step, non-clustered customers are assigned to vehicles by 
MIP. The computer experiments on small-scale problems showed that the case in which about 80% of the customers 
were grouped into a cluster could get better solutions. Test instances based on LRP benchmark instances were solved

by using the algorithm. The results of the computational experiments show that the proposed algorithm can find a 20% 
better solution than MIP within an hour for problems with a hundred customers.

Abstract 
In conjunction with the sustainable development in the current society, University serves as a higher educational 
institution, has a strong influence in promoting the sustainable development. As an effort in accomplishing 
sustainability, University are encouraged to employ sustainable development in the campus, as it is identified as the 
centre of community whereby a various kind of human activities take place in the University campus, the energy 
consumption is significant due to the large population in the campus. Behind every activity there are carbon emission 
that would contribute to global warming. In order to develop an intervention framework for the carbon footprint, the 
carbon footprint of the campus has to be identified. UCSI University Kuala Lumpur campus has six buildings and 20-
acre of land located within the city, the carbon footprint of the campus has been identified and analysed. The total 
carbon footprint of UCSI campus in year 2018 is 6 005 107.24 kilogram of Carbon Dioxide (kCO2), according to the 
surface area covered with the greatest interest, the carbon emission from the major activities is identified. Carbon 
footprint mitigation strategy has been suggested according to the energy consumption behaviour of UCSI campus.

Abstract 
The industrials and peoples in this century are looking for a car with alternative energy sources. This matter 
becomes more significant because of the fluctuating prices of petroleum and diesel as well as, the emission of 
poisonous gases from different types of vehicles has become highly damaging to the health of beings. For this 
reason, it is the right time to look for a car that is 100% green eco-friendly. 
The idea in this project was to build a new car without any pollution, by using the compressed air as a source of 
energy to move the car. An Air Compressed Driven Car designed and developed were the engine is a pneumatic air 
motor which uses the compressed air inside the air cylinder as a source of fuel to create mechanical energy. The air 
can provide the expected performance with no pollution. The model was verified using the experimental setup which 
demonstrates the effectiveness of the Air Compressed Driven Car. To achieve better speed and distance some 
improvement must be made like how to lower the air consumption. Moreover, keep in mind this vehicle still in its 
early stage which required much improvement to be satisfactory to the consumer.

Abstract  
 
Teaching assistantship (TA) assignment is typically a time-consuming and enduring process due to conflicting 
constraints and multiple objectives. This project involves assigning TA assignments to a large pool of candidates 
over a smaller set of offered courses, all the while ensuring that fairness is maintained during the assignment. A 
program was developed to address and optimize based on the given constraints and objectives.  It begins with a data 
collection phase where all relevant information on the candidates and courses is acquired and then a software 
program is used to optimize the TA assignment using the Hungarian algorithm. The model was initially formulated 
as a multi-objective function consisting of three objectives viz., Course/Instructor Preference, Student Preference 
and Income deviation among candidates. It was then scalarized into a single weighted-sum objective function. The 
optimizer was tested on candidates applying for teaching assistantship towards three separate semesters, yielding an 
average of 60-70% matching with the manual assignments that were previously carried out by the department. The 
statistical dispersion in optimization cost and matching extent towards the manual assignment was observed under 
the different set of weights. Higher assignment deviations would extend the Pareto domain, which also results in 
more favorable optimization costs.

Figure 9 (c) – Distribution of tasks among courses in semester 3  
 
This may be indicative of lesser availability in assigning TAs towards other courses when varying the set of weights. 
This is further reinforced when analyzing the allocation odds (given by equation (18)) provided in Table 2.

The allocation odds in Eq. (18) is the number of registered preferences by students towards a specific course divided 
by the number of available tasks in that course, summed up over all courses within a semester. As shown in the 
equation, τ is contingent on the provided raw data but not on the optimization. The higher the allocation odds, the 
higher will be the combination of available assignment solutions. As a result, it serves as an overview to the rigidity 
of a particular assignment problem. From the analysis of the three semesters, the mismatch deviations (σ) when 
tested against multiple weight vectors increased with an increase in allocation odds. It should be noted that 
computing the allocation odds a-priori can serve to test the optimizer’s susceptibility to variations in the sub-
objective weights. This perhaps also explains why the average cost tends to be lowest with semester 3 (as shown in 
Figure 9 (c) containing the highest τ). When more possibilities are obtainable and the formulated assignment 
problem is flexible, the statistical advantage from expanding the Pareto domain would yield more favorable costs. 
6. Conclusion 
The project attempted to replicate the TA assignment computationally via the Hungarian algorithm and was 
successful in achieving the desired objectives. The developed VBA script was able to successfully extract all 
necessary candidate and preference information from the TA application metadata, and parse the income history of 
each candidate, then carry out the optimization procedure.  Optimization involving minimizing the objective 
function was carried out on the developed model that had three individual sub-objective functions accounting for the 
income deviation, student-course preferences, and vice versa. The three objectives were averaged into a single 
function using a vector of three weights represented as Barycentric coordinates. The optimizer was tested on 
candidates applying for teaching assistantships in three separate semesters, yielding an average of 60-70% matching 
extent from the manual assignments previously carried out by the department. This was done across 37 different 
combinations of varying weight vectors. 
The statistical dispersion in optimization cost and matching extent towards the manual assignment was analyzed 
using different set of weights. If the number of available tasks and registered student preferences were more 
balanced and not clustered towards a few courses (termed allocation odds), the more susceptible the model was 
towards assignment deviations. Higher assignment deviations would extend the Pareto domain, resulting also in

more favorable optimization costs. The constructed model was able to successfully carry out feasible assignments on 
all weight vector combinations, and achieve its primary purpose of eliminating the grunt work required by the 
department TA committee every semester. Also, by being able to adjust the weight vector, the client is given the 
flexibility to prioritize the model’s decision-making process. 
With VBA’s programming paradigm being object-oriented (mostly!), it provided the developer with plentiful 
possibilities of updating and adding additional features in any future iterations without major alterations to the base 
code. In the latter stages of the model’s development, additional features were added such as relaxing the conditions 
of disqualification (for not meeting certain pre-requisites), and forcing the assignment of certain students towards a 
course. Other options may seamlessly be added in the future, such as allowing a student to be assigned to more than 
one course, or if the client would like to reduce the parity between students based on other secondary attributes such 
as gender or immigration status. The optimizer may also undergo more extensive modifications for usage in other 
problems, such as optimizing administrator and faculty member tasks under different sub-objective criteria.

Abstract 
Nowadays, energy consumption in the building sector is considered one of the main contributors to increased carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions, which is having an enormous negative environmental impact worldwide. 
Correspondingly, rising CO2 emissions have become a global environmental issue.  Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) 
have been deployed for evaluation of the ecological impact of the building sector will be used to analyze and assess 
ecological effects. The primary objective of this research is to consider the different phases of life cycle energy and 
CO2 analysis of a PV system integrated residential building by designing geometry, spaces, and thermal zones in 
Sketch Up and simulating the building and calculating the energy load in EnergyPlus. For illustrative purposes, a 
single residential building in Toronto was simulated. Moreover, carbon emissions of the residential building were 
calculated through LCA and compared with the case of added PV systems. It was found that there would be a 
significant reduction in operating cost, energy cost, and CO2 emissions. However, the capital cost would increase by 
integrating PV systems, but it would be less significant considering a higher carbon tax in the future.

Nowadays, energy consumption in the building sector is considered one of the main contributors to increased carbon 
dioxide (CO2) emissions, which is having an enormous negative environmental impact worldwide. 
Correspondingly, rising CO2 emissions have become a global environmental issue.  Life Cycle Assessments (LCAs) 
have been deployed for evaluation of the ecological impact of the building sector will be used to analyze and assess 
ecological effects.  As the architecture and construction industries increasingly accentuate sustainability, more 
holistic approaches are underway, which were developed to assess and reduce the environmental effects caused by

Table 5 : Life Cycle Renewable Energy Analysis 
 
The results of the life cycle energy analysis considering the use and cost show that the electricity consumption was 
about 102,453 kWh, fuel consumption approximately 327,793 MJ, and their costs are significantly lower. The 
discount rate for costs was 5.5%.  However, the results of life cycle renewable energy analysis using PV system 
shows that the amount of energy consumption of integrated PV system (Low Efficiency),  (Medium Efficiency),  
(High Efficiency) was 10,644 kWh/yr, 21,288 kWh/yr, 31,932 kWh/yr respectively. As a result of these, there would 
be a significant reduction in operating cost, energy cost, and CO2 emissions. However, the capital cost  would 
increase by integrating PV systems, but it would be less significant by a higher carbon tax in the future. 
6. Conclusion 
In this study, the different phases of life cycle energy and CO2 analysis of a PV system integrated residential 
building considered. We used the signal residential building located in Toronto in this study. EnergyPlus, SketchUp, 
and Open Studio were the software programs utilized for modeling the building. The benefit of this study is reduced 
energy consumption, higher energy efficiency and environmental benefits of CO2 emission reduction.  The life 
cycle analysis is an effective method to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The results show that the 
energy consumption of the single residential building was affected by many weather variables. High and low 
temperature and humidity in the air affect HVAC system usage, which affects energy consumption and related CO2 
emission levels. Besides, carbon dioxide emissions from space heating HVAC systems for a single residential 
building is higher than business as the usual electricity generation system. Moreover, hot water uses the largest 
amount of energy compared to other energy sources in SRB, which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions.  On 
other hand, propane water uses the lowest amount of energy compared to other energy sources in SRB, and it 
represents the smallest amount of CO2 emissions compared to other sources. In addition, the results quantify the 
annual CO2 emissions by considering the occupants, the energy impacts of specific electronic equipment and some 
places of SRB pointed that car park ventilation represents the lowest amount of CO2 emissions annually compared 
to other impact energy sources; hot water uses a significant amount of electricity compared to other equipment in the 
building, and this leads to increasing carbon dioxide emissions each year.  Finally, the results of the life cycle energy 
analysis show that there would be a significant reduction in operating cost, energy cost, and CO2 emissions. 
However, the capital cost would increase by integrating PV systems, but it would be less significant than higher 
future carbon taxes.

Abstract 
Drug stability is one of the vital subjects in the pharmaceutical industry. All drug products should be kept stable and 
protected against any chemical, physical, and microbiological degradation to ensure their efficacy and safety until 
released for public use. Hence, stability is very important to be estimated or predicted. This work involved studying 
the stability of drug agent using three different mathematical models. These models included both empirical models 
(linear regression), and mechanistic (kinetic) models. The stability of the drug in the three cases studied was 
expressed in terms of concentration, hardness, temperature and humidity. The predicted values obtained from the 
models were compared to the observed values of drug concentrations obtained experimentally and then evaluated by 
calculating the mean of squared. Among the models used in this work, the mechanistic model was found to be the 
most accurate and reliable method of stability testing given the fact that it had the smallest calculated errors. Overall, 
the accuracy of these mathematical models as indicated by the proximity of their stability measurements to the 
observed values, led to the assumption that such models can be reliable and time-saving alternatives to the analytical 
techniques used in practice.

Figure 6. Mechanistic model vs. Experimental values 
 
Figure 6 shows the stability values produced from the mechanistic model vs the experimental real values. As shown 
in Figure 6, most of the values do exist on the fitted line. It shows that the mechanistic model could express the real 
values very well. 
6. Conclusion 
Stability testing requires vigorous work and lengthy studies. Analytical techniques have been the commonly used 
methods in drug stability testing. These techniques include high performance liquid chromatography (HLPC) or thin 
layer chromatography (HPTLC), gas chromatography (GC) and electrophoresis. Recently, there has been a new 
trend towards the use of statistical modelling techniques. The modelling techniques commonly used nowadays are 
the empirical models such as linear regression, artificial neural network, and the mechanistic models. Such 
techniques are thought to be reliable and economic alternatives with the advantage of time saving. To assess the 
reliability and applicability of statistical modelling in studying drug stability and estimating its degradation with 
time and to know whether statistical modeling can efficiently substitute the ordinary analytical methods, several 
models were applied in this research on ASA which was chosen from the pharmaceutical literature. Three different 
models (linear regression, artificial neural network and mechanistic models) were implemented to predict the drug 
concentration over time. These predicted values were compared to the observed values and then evaluated by 
calculating the mean of square errors (MSE) to determine how close those values were to the exact values resulted 
experimentally. Moreover, the coefficient of determination (R2) was calculated to further evaluate the model 
accuracy as well. This work focussed on the stability of acetyl salicylic acid (ASA) tablets. The concentration of 
ASA at variable temperatures (35, 40, 45, 50 ͦ C) was determined experimentally at different time intervals using 
HPLC. Firstly, a linear regression model was proposed, and the unknown parameters were estimated and found to be 
significant as concluded from ANOVA table. The errors were found to be normally distributed with a mean equal to 
zero and the residuals residual had a random pattern as seen in normal probability and the residual plots, 
respectively. The MSE was 6.33, and R2 was 84.67%. This meant that the regression model represents the data very 
well. Secondly, the artificial neural network was applied, and it was able to capture the relationships between the 
inputs and the output in the testing datasets despite the limited number of the experimental data (21 data points). The 
MSE was 1.5168 whereas the R2 was 94% indicating a high accuracy for artificial neural network model as well. 
The third model applied was the mechanistic model. This model was linearized to determine the decomposition rate 
constants (kApp) at various temperatures and the order of the reaction (α). The hydrolysis process was found to 
follow first order kinetic dependent only on the concentration of one reactant; i.e. aspirin.  The apparent activation

energy of aspirin hydrolysis of 49 Kcal/mole was calculated by using the Arrhenius equation method. MSE was 
found to be 2.92833x10-7 and the R2 was 96.48% which indicates that the predicted values were very close to the 
observed values which in turn indicated that the mechanistic model is reliable. Based on the results the regression 
model is the best model predicting the stability of ASA.

Abstract 
Sustainability of lean six sigma (LSS) model relies upon the purchasing strategy of the organization’s supply chain 
individuals which makes the supplier selection strategies basic for implementing LSS. Supplier selection is a major 
consideration for meeting an organization’s need consistently at an allowable price range through identifying the 
suppliers with highest potential. For the firms who are willing to apply LSS, supplier selection strategy becomes a 
factor of paramount significance as this model focuses on eliminating waste. Yet there is no current study which 
discussed about the supplier evaluation strategy for implementing LSS. Thus, this paper aspires to aid the decision 
making of supplier assessment through determining the decision criteria and supplier evaluation for actualizing LSS. 
The suggested model incorporates Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to pinpoint the supplier panel with 
highest potential. The focus of this paper is to assist the upstream management of supply chain to draw out the best 
outcome of lean six sigma implementation.

Abstract 
In today’s world, the number of industries is increasing geometrically for accomplishing the demand of a rapidly 
growing population. With this growing number of industries, the total amount of production is also accelerating. 
And no production is possible without generating waste. Appropriate waste management is an appropriate way for 
making the world a comfortable habitat.  To achieve the apex of the competitive production process, ecological 
incorporated manufacturing and recycle planning is of incredible significance. So non-avertable byproducts and 
wastes ought to be recycled by the manufacturer. In this study, a mathematical model is developed for optimizing 
the cost of recycling and solid waste management. For optimization Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method is 
used to identify the level of disposed solid waste and recycled solid waste. Another meta-heuristic algorithm named 
Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used for evaluating the efficiency of the result getting from PSO. 
1. Introduction
Management of waste is a process by which waste is controlled appropriately from the generation of waste to the 
final phase of waste management. This incorporates the gathering, transport, treatment and transfer of waste, 
together with checking and guideline of the waste administration process (Pongrácz, 2003). Waste can be solid, 
fluid, or vaporous and each sort has distinctive strategies for disposal and the executives. In this study, only solid 
waste is considered. Form the study of different industries shows that there is a large gap exist between theory and 
practical implementation of different waste management process only because of thinking that waste management is 
expensive. But with appropriate management of waste the cost can be reduced. There is a strong connection between 
ecological coordinated effort and sustainability execution (Kjaerheim, 2003). The contribution of this study is to emphasize the 
ecological concern as an unseparated part of the industrial organization. Next contribution is environmental thinking along with cost 
minimization. With the appropriate management of waste, the cost of the production process is automatically reduced (Bruno, 2016). 
In this study, recycle and dispose of waste is considered as the two process of managing solid waste. Conversion of waste material 
into a useful material is known as recycling process. Thus, the cost of production can be optimized. The steps of solid waste 
management are collecting the waste from production floor, storing them for proper management, passing through a treatment 
process, recycling the suitable material, finally, disposing the rest of the waste. So, recycle and dispose are the two main process of 
managing solid waste. Waste is disposed when there is no value exist in the waste that can be used for production of new goods 
(Costi, 2004). In this study, mathematical models for recycle and disposal cost are developed. Then the model will be solved with 
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) approach. Finally, compare the result with a metaheuristic algorithm known as Genetic 
Algorithm (GA).  
2. Literature Review
Eco-efficiency is perceived as an imperative instrument to assess all the while the natural and the financial 
difficulties of an organization (Carvalho, 2017). In present business condition, just as contending on expense and 
profitability, associations have another attention on sustainability (Zhang, 2016). Some research works deals with 
mathematical or simulation analysis for analyzing the relationship between recycle, reuse and rework (Govindan, 
1799","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management 
Pilsen, Czech Republic, July 23-26, 2019

Figure 5.3: Comparison Between PSO and GA Method 
As PSO and GA two are population-based optimizing approach, it can be compared easily. From this bar chart 
representation one can easily interpret that there is a small difference between PSO and GA method. It also indicates 
the computational efficiency of PSO is high. Moreover, for optimizing any problem population-based approach PSO 
can be used undoubtfully.    
6. Conclusion 
In this study, mathematical model is developed for optimizing the cost for the management of solid waste. For 
developing this model recycle cost, disposal cost is considered. Fixed demand rate per period and no volume 
discount are assumed for formulating the objective function. At first, cost function is developed for these systems 
separately. Then the objective function is developed by combining all these separate mathematical models. PSO and 
GA methods are used for optimizing the model. The optimum solutions obtained from PSO and GA methods are all 
most same. There is a very small deviation (<2.5%) between these two optimum objective function values.

Abstract 
Since traceability of halal food is not talking any longer about one step backward and one step forward and only can 
be done in inbound logistic, therefore we have to do business process reengineering as a strategy and methodology to 
make it happens along logistic activities. As we know logistic activities consist of inbound and outbound logistic, 
where halal traceability in inbound logistic has been implemented quite well that is why we have to discuss it in 
outbound logistic as a scope in this research. One of the features of business process reengineering is to capture the 
existing process and represent new processes adequately. Business process modeling plays a crucial role in such 
efforts. This paper proposes a structure for modeling business process in order to capture essential concepts of tracing 
halal food in its distribution activities and represent them structurally. The structure possesses two main features 
suitable for business process modeling: one is that it can represent critical processes and the sequences in the 
distribution of halal food, and the other is that it shows how to trace during the distribution of halal food by the 
information provided. Since the problem of tracing halal food is a probability function, so we do formulation by 
stochastic dynamic programming to develop the computation model. The computation model is a mathematical model 
and then how it operates in the tracing processes should be figured out in its business process model. The objective 
function of this computation model is to minimize the cost of halal food traceability activities. The business process 
modeling method is illustrated by an order fulfillment tracing processes in the stages of distribution of halal food using 
BPMN. The use case of this business process model explains the role and the interaction of  the activities of the actors 
in doing transfer information of the halal food at their critical processes. The internal actors of the ecosystem are the 
distributor, retailer, transporter, and warehouse company while the external actors involve supplier of halal food and 
halal certification body and government as the parties that have responsibilities to assure the halalness of the food 
distributed in the market. When the business process model is valid, it will be simulated in halal food traceability 
system.

Abstract 
The Facility Layout Problem (FLP) is all about obtaining the optimal arrangement of machines or departments in a 
given area or plant. Most of the research in the area of the FLP assumes that the material flow between the departments 
is constant. However, in today’s competitive and volatile manufacturing environments, this assumption does not 
usually hold. Layouts constantly need to be changed from one period to the other to adapt to the changes in the product 
mix and demand. The Dynamic Facility Layout Problem (DFLP) searches for a layout for each period of the planning 
horizon minimizing its respective total material handling costs, for all periods, as well as the total rearrangement costs 
between successive periods. Because of the prohibitive combinatorial nature of DFLP, absolute optimality is not 
usually sought and larger instances of the problem are solved using near-optimal algorithms. In this paper, Dynamic 
Programming (DP) is used to solve the DFLP problem. The layouts considered in each period forms the state space 
for DP; the problem is decomposed to stages— one for each DFLP period. This state space is arrived at using a 
hybridized heuristic approach that includes the use of a Simulated Annealing (SA) metaheuristic. Consistent with the 
rest of the literature, the proposed method is comprised of two phases; in the first phase, the set space to be considered 
and searched in each phase of DP are arrived at using SA and two different heuristic procedures. To obtain these 
layouts and for smaller manageable instances of the problem, exact optimum layout for each period is found by solving 
the QAP formulation of the static facility layout problem. As for larger instances and due to the inherent combinatorial 
nature of the problem, sub-optimum layouts for each period are arrived at using SA. Two other heuristics are utilized 
to complete the set space of layouts for each stage by applying different neighborhood functions to the previously 
obtained exact- and sub-optimum solutions. In the second phase, the DP recursive formulation is solved. 
Computational experience exhibits promise.

Abstract 
Sago is a potential alternative food that can increase farmers' income. Sago production in South Sorong Regency still 
depends on the results of the sago forest. Sago varieties in South Sorong Regency are sago tuni and sago molat. The 
sago agroindustry in South Sorong Regency often experiences difficulties in providing fluctuating raw materials that 
occur in the sago agroindustry. For this reason, this research was conducted to determine the sustainability of sago 
agroindustry in South Sagu Regency. The research method used is descriptive quantitative. The sampling method is 
saturated sample. The data analysis method used is Rap-Sago. The results of the analysis show that the sago 
agroindustry X in South Sorong Regency is in a quite sustainable position with an index value as 54.27.

1. Introduction
Sago (Metroxylon spp.) is a monocot plant belonging to the order Spadiciflora, the family Palmae, genus 
Metroxylon, and species Metroxylon spp. This plant is native to Indonesia and is commonly found in Papua (Bintoro 
et al., 2010). This plant is spread in the wet tropical regions of Southeast Asia and Oceania, mainly grown in swamp, 
brackish land or often flooded (Scuiling and Flach, 1985). 
Indonesia has the largest sago forest area and the largest genetic diversity in the world. The area believed to 
be the center of the origin of sago is around Lake Sentani, Jayapura Regency, Papua. In that place there is the highest 
diversity of sago germplasm with a total area of around 1.2 million ha (Bintoro et al., 2010). However, the attention 
of the Indonesian Government to the development of sago plants is still very lacking, this is indicated by the 
development of sago plant area data that is not yet known. Bintoro et al. (2010) stated that the data on sago area in 
Indonesia is 4,1833 million hectares. While sago productivity per tree, the potential for sago in Indonesia is estimated 
at around 5 million tons per year.

Abstract 
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anti-corrosive effect of natural extract of Opuntia Ficus Indica 
(O.F.I) for X60 mild steel in drilling water environment used in petroleum engineering. Experimental work 
has been achieved by weight loss, potentiodynamic polarization and EIS measurement, as well as SEM 
surface characterization. Among the results obtained, we can mention an inhibitory efficiency of 90% by 
gravimetric method and 80% by electrochemical method at 20% (v/v) of O.F.I.  Moreover, The O.F.I extract 
acts as a mixed inhibitor; however, adsorption free enthalpy indicates a physisorption. The adsorption obeys 
the Langmuir isotherm model. These results have been improved by SEM micrographs.

Abstract 
Semi-refined carrageenan (SRC) is a carrageenan product with a lower purity that it still contains a small amount 
of cellulose. Carrageenan which is produced from the extraction of red seaweed is part of the gelling compound 
and polysaccharide. Carrageenan has no nutritional value. In the food industry, carrageenan is used as a food 
additive and so its quality must be maintained properly especially during the process. The effect of processing on 
quality of carrageenan has been proven by several previous studies. This meta-analysis research was conducted 
to determine the effect of alkali concentration on carrageenan quality. Required data taken from previous studies 
was used to analyze the effect of alkali concentration on carrageenan quality. The variables of carrageenan quality 
analyzed were yield, water content, ash content, and viscosity. The results show the influence of the alkali 
concentration on carrageenan quality except water content. This can be seen from Z score and the effect size of 
each variable. Z score of yield, water content, ash content and viscosity are 6.3743, 1.3937, 2.1200, and 2.5694. 
The effect level of those variables are 1.8676, 0.2874, 1.1376 and 16.0021. All the p-value are below 0.05 
(confidence level 95%).

1. Introduction
Food additives are ingredients that are not used as food and not a typical food ingredient; have or do not have 
nutritional value and intentionally added to produce a compound that affects the typical characteristics of food. 
One of the food additives that is widely used in the world is carrageenan. Carrageenan which is produced from 
the extraction of red seaweed is part of the gelling compound and polysaccharide. Although carrageenan has no 
nutritional value in the food industry. It is used as a food additive. There are two types of carrageenan: (1) semi 
refined carrageenan (SRC) and (2) refined carrageenan (RC). Semi refined carrageenan is a carrageenan product 
with a lower purity because it still contains a small amount of cellulose. The steps taken to processing red seaweed 
are as follows: 
•
Sorting dried seaweed to remove impurities such as gravel, coral, ropes and more.
•
Washing dried seaweed with clean water.
•
Extracting process using chemicals and water.
•
Neutralization of pH using clean water.
•
Drying
•
Flour making (SRC product)

After the effect values of each variable is known, then look for the confidence interval and Z score (Z’). This can 
be seen in table 7. The confidence interval is the range between two values where the mean value is in the middle. 
It is influenced by the confidence level. The mean value in this confidence interval is the effect values of each 
variable. To find out the confidence interval of each variable by using equation 14. The standard error (SE) used 
is the result of equation 15. The Z score is obtained by using equation 16.

The confidence interval and Z score of each variable showed that the alkali concentration affected the yield, ash 
content, and viscosity. The effect of alkali concentration on yield is significant, this is indicated by the confidence 
interval does not cross the zero point and Z score is greater than Z table , therefore H1 is accepted. This is in 
accordance with previous research which states that the alkali concentration has a significant effect on yield. The 
higher of alkali concentration than the higher of the yield produced (La Ega et al 2016). The alkali concentration 
affects the ash content, the confidence interval is between 0.27 and 3.11 and Z score is greater than Z table. This 
states that the alkali concentration has a significant effect on ash content, therefore H3 is accepted. The effect of 
alkali concentration on viscosity is significant, so H4 is accepted. High concentrations of alkali can dissolve salts 
on seaweed, so viscosity can decrease. Besides that, the small sulfate content caused by the high concentration of 
alkali, therefore the viscosity is low. There is no significant effect of alkali concentration on water content. This 
is indicated by the confidence interval passes the zero point and Z score is smaller than Z table, so Ho is accepted. 
After that look for the effect level of each variable by using equation 17, see table 8.

Based on table 8, it is known that alkali concentrations have a high influence on quality variables except water 
content. The effect of alkali on water content is low, this is different on yield, ash content and viscosity. The effect 
level of alkali concentration on yield, ash content and viscosity is highest, very high and highest.

Abstract 
Maternal healthcare is very important for India from social, economic and development perspectives. Success in terms 
of decreasing mortality rate is directly related to the extent of provision of related healthcare facilities. In similar 
countries with more number of poor people, facility location decisions would naturally require the least expenses to 
be incurred on transportation cost by the facility-seekers for visiting these facilities. Maternal healthcare facilities are 
to provide primary care to all mothers-to-be, with some to provide facilities for routine birth, and some others for the 
non-routine birth and neonatal assistance to high-risk babies. In countries including India, where the funds for the 
development of such facilities are limited, each facility cannot be conceived to have all the care requirements and, 
besides, all the mothers-to-be may not require the services of the facilities with neonatal care. Due to these practical 
considerations, the governments may try to find right mix of these facilities each at different geographic location to 
provide primary healthcare support, basic support with facilities for normal birth, and with additional support for 
premature birth and neonatal care.  Thus the capacity of a facility type at a location will be defined separately for each 
type of associated healthcare support provided. Depending upon the requirement, a mother-to-be may be taken from 
one facility type to another advanced one and this will also involve transportation cost. To avoid a mother-to-be to 
visit a far off health facility, a network design restriction is considered in terms of maximum distance to be covered 
by her. Within this distance itself, all the required facilities are to be available. To determine the location of such 
facilities and allocation of all mothers-to-be to these facilities, a successively inclusive hierarchical mathematical 
model has been proposed in this paper that aims to minimize the total of the cost of visiting the facilities by the 
mothers-to-be and the fixed cost of the facilities.  A numerical example has been taken to illustrate the use of the 
model. A python program, linking the model with GUROBI 8.0.1 optimization software, has been developed to solve 
the numerical example. To prove the properness of the functionality of the proposed model, impact of the increase in 
the number of the mothers-to-be has been studied on the location and allocation decisions. The analysis carried out 
proves the validity of the model as the changes in the location and allocation decisions are supportive of the changes 
conceived.

Abstract 
Inventory management decisions are critical to industrial companies’ efficiency and performance. This 
paper aims to identify a pattern, coined by (Hoberg et al., 2017) as “Inverted hockey stick effect“, of a 
systematic reduction of inventory (raw materials, work in progress, finished products and the sum of 
these) of European industrial companies in the last fiscal quarter. Such reduction would correspond to a 
conscient management decision, with an impact on the supply chain, something that may not be in line 
with strictly operational needs. 
The theoretical basis of this paper is the study from (Hoberg et al., 2017), where a systematical inventory 
reduction in the last fiscal quarter was detected in a sample of 4877 North American industrial companies 
between 1990 - 2010.  
The use of inventory days as a variable, integrates companies’ economic activity by taking into 
consideration the COGS when analysing inventory behaviour. 
Because a reduction of inventory can result from a peak of sales, the “inverted hockey stick effect” 
reduction of inventory must be noticeable in all three components (RM, WIP, FP).   
The quarterly data concerning the period 2008 - 2017, were obtained from Compustat® using the S&P 
Capital IQ® interface, filtered by region (Europe) and classification (Industry).   
In this preliminary study, we state the following propositions: 
Proposition 1 – Companies promote inventory reduction in the last fiscal quarter 
Proposition 2 – The inventory reduction in the last fiscal quarter is identified in all three components 
(RM, WIP, FP)

Abstract 
Consumers are showing growing concerns and preference towards incorporating environmentally sustainable diets 
and wanting to associate with organisations which promote and encourage sustainable food chains. Ideally, identifying 
and responding to the consumers’ dynamic and complex needs through Industry 4.0, organisations can revisit the 
foundations of agility with the aim to improve operational efficiency. In this research-in-progress paper, we investigate 
a complex environment where the relationship of simulated suppliers is assessed alongside a semantic analysis from 
the consumers’ perspective. A conceptual framework that quantifies the benefits to the supplier from obtaining 
commitments from downstream customers is developed. The proposed model is built to embed dynamic capabilities 
into Supply Chain practices and to assist in operational decision making. Careful balancing of the contemporaneous 
consumers’ opinion can lead to effective cost management for all members of the supply channel. The authors propose 
recommendations for future work in regard to responsive frameworks within Industry 4.0.

Abstract  
Plastic is a material that has a high impact on the environment due to the long amount of time it takes to decompose, 
contaminating residues involved in this material, and the damage caused to human health that this implies. Currently 
tons of plastic are discarded day after day, for this reason our research is oriented to the production of a bioplastic 
capable of supplying the conventional plastic but with the advantage that our bioplastic has a considerable 
environmental impact since this comes from conventional organic waste which are of daily consumption. In the 
development of our project, we present the data that validate that self-extinction was improved unlike a commercial 
plastic, in the present project is also taken into account the productivity part of improvement since through operational 
excellence, costs are reached in several areas of the project such as savings in the amount of raw material when 
working with a waste material. 
Keywords: reusable material, bioplastic, temperature. 
 
1. Introduction  
There are many companies and industrial plants where the operations do not have cyclic or repetitive patterns. Such 
is the case of the greenhouse industry (Espinosa, G et al., 2017). The greenhouses are an important type of agriculture 
covered in the whole world and have as main objective to achieve a greater production of crops through the 
modification of the natural environment; especially prolong the growing season in relation to open field crops. 
Greenhouse cultivation benefits people by providing off-season or high-quality fruits to improve health while 
generating employment opportunities and high incomes in relation to conventional vegetable cultivation (Jessen, M, 
and Malter, A 1995). The main goal of building a greenhouse is to provide an optimal level of microclimate conditions 
for plant growth, development and productivity on a year-round basis or to extend the growing season (Ali, S 2012). 
Although modern agriculture plays an important role in the provision of goods and services for human well-being 
(Tilman, D et al., 2002), it also causes the degradation of some ecosystem services (MA 2005). During the last two 
decades, the productivity and efficiency of greenhouses has been improved, however, farmers must use their resources 
such as land and water more effectively. Therefore, achieving maximum performance per unit area has become a high 
research priority. A greenhouse allows to increase the productivity of the crops maintaining a favorable environment 
for the plants; and thus, production using greenhouses has become more popular than in the past (Cemek, B et al., 
2006). During the eighties and nineties, greenhouse cover materials and their effects on the environment received 
special attention due to the high production costs involved (Cemek, B et al., 2006). The greenhouse cover materials 
have a substantial impact on weather conditions. The development of alternative materials that can regulate radiation 
and heat penetration in the greenhouse can significantly improve the growing conditions, as well as minimizing the 
energy requirements for heating (Kavga, A et al., 2018). Bioplastics are defined as a new generation of plastics that 
significantly reduce the environmental impact in terms of greenhouse effect and energy consumption. They have the 
potential to replace petrochemical plastics in homes and private offices, as well as in technical devices. Due to its 
biodegradability, it can be used for packaging materials or unidirectional applications as an opportunity to decrease 
the amount of plastic pollution in the world (Schulze, C et al., 2017). 
 
2. Theorical Framework   
A greenhouse is a structural building with various types of roofing materials, such as a glass or plastic roof and often 
glass or plastic walls; It´s heated because the visible solar radiation coming from the sun is absorbed by the plants, the 
soil, and other things within it. However, the cost of glasshouse (greenhouse) systems is much higher (Sangpradit, K 
2014). The plastics used are made of polyethylene film of polycarbonate material, or acrylic glass of PMMA (Geoola, 
F et al., 1998). Plastics block or selectively enhance certain wavelengths, improve growth rates, inhibit certain diseases

The results of the tests indicated which modifications will be necessary to achieve for the bioplastic to reach a level 
of production for greenhouses. We had a disadvantage in the bioplastic because the specimen had many fluctuations 
that interfered with the results. For a bioplastic to be ready for production, it is necessary to follow the next 
methodology: Synthesis, Rheology tests, Mechanical tests, T, R.P.M., technical tests, Tm, TG and T degradation. 
The flame ignition tests are done on the plastic in a test tube and measures how it burns after being exposed to a flame 
of low calorific value. The aim of this point is to characterize the reaction of fire to small sources of ignition. They 
are categorized into four types of classifications. These are given as a function of self-extinguishment and the dripping 
of the burned material. In Table 7 we can see the information of the Self-extinction flame test.

As you can see, the bioplastic gets to be classified in V0, while the greenhouse plastics are in the V1 classification. 
 
4. Conclusion 
To implement bioplastics as a roofing material in the greenhouses, it is necessary to carry out mechanical tests, 
rheology tests and technical tests. In order to obtain an accurate temperature and extrusion speed data to make 
bioplastic films, so it can comply correctly with the previously established specifications. Alternatively, one of the 
main characteristics to consider in the project is the application of bioplastic in different industrial areas as part of 
evaluating its different uses. One of its uses, is the use of this bioplastic as a replacement for packaging material in 
products such as: food, cookies, bags used for fruits in supermarkets, which has a very high degradation life and a 
very low consumption life. This project seeks to be a basis for future research that promotes the introduction of 
bioplastics to industry, sustainability and ecological impact.

Abstract 
Collaboration in supply chain is widely recognized as one of the core challenges for the next future. In this context, 
horizontal collaboration is believed to be one of the innovative solutions to tackle the growing logistic challenges 
from both, environmental and economic points of view. In this paper, a close look has been taken on the horizontal 
collaboration opportunities across industry sectors of Bangladesh to reduce traffic burden, capture more 
opportunities and make their supply chain more efficient. Horizontal collaboration  is  characterized  by  the  sharing 
of  information,  knowledge,  risk  and  profits among industries working in the same level of supply chain. The aim 
of this paper is to discuss possible horizontal collaboration opportunities in supply chain between Bangladeshi 
industries to impose an impact on the reduction of traffic burden. Further, a new comprehensive model named 
„Smart Conveyance‟ has been proposed which will not only allow the companies to improve their efficiency but also 
will play a significant role in reducing traffic congestion.

1. Introduction
Simatupang et al. has defined collaboration in supply chain as “when two or more independent companies work 
jointly to plan and execute supply chain operations with greater success than when acting in isolation‟‟. The purpose 
of supply chain collaboration is to reduce costs, make the operations run smoothly, reduce lead time, meet uncertain 
demands with rapid delivery and to increase revenue. Collaborative practices can facilitate the operations of 
different industry sectors; and this collaboration can occur either vertically or horizontally. Vertical collaboration 
takes place between partners (typically suppliers and customers) located at different levels of the supply chain, while 
horizontal collaboration refers to partnership between two or more unrelated or competing organizations that operate 
at the same level of the supply chain (Barratt et al. 2004). This paper focuses on various ways through which 
horizontal collaboration can be established across different industry sectors of Bangladesh. Industries in Bangladesh 
have steadily increased their production rate and quality during the last few years. But the quality of transportation 
in Bangladesh isn‟t up to the mark, which hampers not only the smooth flow of products but also affects the quality 
of life. As a result, both the working class people and the companies are pushing towards private transports rather 
than choosing public transport. In consequence to this, the number of vehicles on the roads is increasing everyday 
causing more trouble on our traffic system.  Traffic congestion is one of the severe problems in Dhaka city which is 
home to major Bangladeshi industrial conglomerates. In accordance with World Bank report, the average traffic 
speed has dropped from 21 kilometers per hour (kmph) to 7 kmph. Another study, according to Brac Institute of 
Government and Development, indicates traffic congestion in Dhaka eats up around 5 million working hours every 
day which eats up almost 6% of annual GDP and costs the country USD 11.4 billion every year. This financial loss 
is due to the money spent on conducting vehicles for the extra hours. As transportation is one of the most vital 
elements for transferring goods in all the industries and it determines the overall logistics costs, finding out the most 
cost-effective and most efficient way for transferring goods is the major concern for every company. Unplanned

9.2Pharmaceutical Industry 
 
One way that companies can see if horizontal collaboration is right for them is by determining whether or not their 
supply chain offers them differentiation. If a supply chain does not present a specific market opportunity, then it 
makes sense for this to be an area where companies do not invest additional funds. The most developed and hi-
technological sector in Bangladesh is the pharmaceutical industry Due to recent development of this sector we are 
exporting medicines to global market including European market. This sector is also providing 95% of the total 
medicine requirement of the local market. Pharmaceutical firms in Bangladesh mainly sell to the private sector 
pharmacies, the government and its public health care facilities, and international organizations operating in 
Bangladesh (e.g. UNICEF). The drug distribution marketplace is composed of small independent pharmacies. On 
average, each pharmacy visits 10-50 pharmaceutical firms that supply them medicines on a daily basis. The 
Bundling of shipments for two collaborated pharmaceutical companies will make it possible to use the same means 
of transport and thus increase the load factor. Bundling opportunities can be detected prior to shipment, with the 
help of smart conveyance system and, if necessary, the timing of a shipment can be altered. These horizontal 
collaborative opportunities can reduce the traffic burden to a great extent. Also using the GPS coordinates of the 
beginning and end of each route can be effective. 
 
9.3 Agriculture & Food Industry 
 
Another promising industrial sector in Bangladesh is agriculture & food industry. This industry consists of 
commodities like frozen food, tea, bakery and confectionary, fruits and vegetables, dairy, carbonated beverages and 
non-carbonated fruit. Among these dairy, fruits and vegetables are highly perishable. Collaboration is needed in 
agri-food supply chain system in order to minimize cost, increase the profit, fulfil the quality assurance, and gaining 
trust from consumers. (Dania et al. 2016). However, complexity lies in the application of collaboration in the agri-
food industries of Bangladesh. As also identified by Bezuidenhout et al. (2012), trust, commitment, and willingness 
to share risks become the main keys in achieving a long term goal to create strong collaboration. Horizontal 
collaboration can be applied in reducing outbound transportation among confectionary SMEs participating in a 
logistic system consortium as suggested by Ghaderi, et al. (2012). SMEs that have small orders can implement the 
horizontal collaboration by combining the load among the parties. Horizontal collaboration can also be applied to 
support the relationship among the food retailers (Nielsen, et al., 2014). It is identified that collaboration among 
retailers need enthusiasm, strong commitment, a high level of maturity, and willingness to override individual 
actions. Companies prefer to cooperate with an organization that has a similar size, structure, capabilities, and 
resources (Dania et al., 2016). Perishable products from suppliers can be cross-docked and sent to retail outlets for 
daily basis. Cross-docking during night time will reduce traffic pressure during day-time. 
 
10. Limitations of the Study 
 
The main limitations of our study are due to a limited research budget and time. One of the main limitations is only 
qualitative analysis is done in our study. But the study developed in this paper has the potential to have significant 
managerial implications. The research demonstrates the importance of taking a supply chain approach when 
evaluating the feasibility of horizontal collaboration among competitors. 
 
11. Conclusion 
 
To conclude, horizontal collaboration is a basic need now for the industries all around the country for their own 
existence. It brings many advantages for the industries like reduced transportation cost, less transport emissions 
which may lead to Greener Transport Modes. The biggest impact is less traffic clogging during peak hours. 
Moreover, horizontal collaboration holds promise of far larger efficiency and sustainability improvements. So it is 
proposed that the industries should collaborate with each other and simultaneously consider appropriate performance 
measures, integrated policies as well as information sharing to make a win-win situation for all parties, The  main  
objective  of  this  study  was  to  identify  the  possible solution to design a system  that will  affect  the  efficiency  
of  performance of supply  chain  collaboration  of  Bangladeshi  industries and reduce traffic burden. It has 
demonstrated possible approaches that can improve logistics performance. This paper  was  concerned  with  finding  
a  framework  for  developments  of possible collaborative  model  within  supply  chain  partners for Bangladeshi 
industries. The study developed in this paper has the potential to have significant managerial implications. But much

has to be worked on within the industries before the fuller potential of transport collaboration can begin to be 
achieved.

Abstract 
This project analyzes the patterns of consumption and production of waste by using of polyethylene terephthalate 
(PET) bottles in a higher education institution, which represent a threat to the environment and due to excessive 
consumption have caused damage to the environment. Habitat of many species. Among the main consumption habits 
were identified that, of a sample of 541 students, 88% normally use plastic bottles, 70% reuse them, 9.5% yield them 
for their subsequent recycling. The applied method was based on the geographical and climatic conditions of the city, 
as well as renewable and non-renewable elements of the product life cycle, as relevant results establishes the ecological 
footprint of PET as 1,017x10−4  global hectares for every 8000 students, as an index of degradation 0.7547 
representing a decomposition time between 520 and 680 years, among the weekly resources used were identified 8068 
liters of fuel, 48900 watts, used raw material 6.11 kilograms, 146.71 liters of water consumed for a total mass of 12.22 
kilograms of PET with an average volume of 500 milliliters.

1. Introduction
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) currently occupies an important space in the manufacture of bottles for carbonated 
beverages and mineral water, however, its use has become another pollution problem in the world, due to the fact that 
most of them end up in landfills, increasing the volume of plastics waste (Prada Botia, Acevedo Peñalosa, & Orjuela 
Abril, 2018).  
Polyethylene teraphthalate (PET) is a plastic that is generally used in the manufacture of bottles (Gonzales, 2016), one 
of the main characteristics of this material is that it is part of the group of materials known as polyesters, it is also 
characterized by its crystallinity (NAPCOR, 2016). The main component of this material is carbon and thanks to the 
other substances that are part of it can be molded using heat or pressure, in addition to this material properties that 
differentiate it from others, the most prominent is its resistance to degradation (Mansilla Pérez & Ruiz Ruiz, 2015). 
Currently PET is considered a serious environmental problem, since millions of products of this material are consumed 
in the world, and when they are discarded, they generally end up in the oceans. 
Many years ago a gigantic rubbish spot was discovered in the Pacific Ocean, it currently occupies a large extension 
and is composed of 80% plastic waste (Ruiz, 2015) 
The excessive use of polyethylene terephthalate or PET is considered an environmental problem since in the world 
there are large quantities of plastic waste, approximately 5000 metric tons of this type of garbage. It is very resistant, 
easy to manufacture and low cost; but its excessive use along with some of the components used in its manufacture is 
very dangerous, being a product of a long useful life, it also becomes a factor that causes damage to the environment 
since it has the ability to stay in the ground and in the water for hundreds of years (Braungart, 2015). In the world, the 
environmental impact due to the use of PET plastic bottles is great, because if a recycling culture is not adopted and 
if there is no study that identifies which are the factors that prevent reducing the ecological footprint, we will continue 
to observe the excessive use of this material.

When applying the logarithm of ecological footprint calculation, we considered the values already established by the 
Global Footprint, 2015 in order to facilitate its application, we start from the proposed values and multiply by the 489 
containers as shown in the table 8 the collected containers have the following values.

The consumption area (CA) was calculated according to table 4, considering that a 500 ml PET container requires 56 
cm2 or 0.0052 m2, obtaining a total consumption area of 2.54 m2, corresponding to the area of mineral resources and 
that requires an average PET bottle in its different stages of the life cycle. The ecological footprint is calculated through 
the square root of the division of renewable elements for non-renewable, this result is multiplied by the area of 
consumption, the result is usually expressed in global hectares.

(8068 l x 48900 w x 6,11 kg)
x 2,54 m2 
 
HE = 0,4235m2 m2 = 4,235x10−6 hag  
 
These data indicate that the ecological footprint obtained by the consumption of polyethylene terephthalate for a 
sample of 489 containers in a period of 7 days corresponds to 4,235x10−6 hag , in the same terms, making a projection 
for the population of the study in the same period would be equivalent to 1,017x10−4 hag , in other words 
approximately a week of one meter of land would be consumed exclusively by the use of plastic. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
The ecological footprint is the final indicator since it transforms every unit of consumption and waste produced into 
a totally significant number, offering a clear and precise idea of the impact of man's activities on daily life.

The degradation index obtained from the climatologist conditions of the city indicate that the minimum degradation 
time of PET is 520 years, which represents a serious environmental impact and waste of raw material for other types 
of processes. 
 
The calculated ecological footprint is low, considering that it has been determined based on a single product, in 
comparison to the traditional ecological footprint established by the Ministry of Environment that includes many other 
parameters, so the value obtained represents only 0.0084 % of the ecological footprint of 1.2 hectares nationwide. 
 
Among the weekly resources used for 489 containers were identified 8068 liters of fuel, 48900 watts, raw material 
used 6.11kilograms, 146.71 liters of water consumed for a total mass of 12.22 kilograms of PET with an average 
volume of 500 milliliters.

Abstract 
Organisations find themselves in a rapidly changing business environment where their success and sustainability 
depend largely on their ability to respond to these changes timeously and effectively. Given that traditional project 
delivery elongated the time to respond to these rapid changes, organisations are opting for agile methodologies to 
deliver projects in order to keep abreast of changes. Agile project management allow for greater focus on business 
value, getting continuous feedback from customers and reducing release times. The processes are flexible and allows 
changes to be adapted if the customers or business needs are not met. However, this approach poses its own challenges 
when it comes to governing project delivery. It require control, responsibility and accountability. 
The study seek to answer the question of what governance mechanism should be used in Agile Project environment 
to ensure responsibility and accountability toward the project outcome.  From a quantitative perspective, a survey was 
used to gather data from key role players in the agile project environment, and they were analysed using descriptive 
statistics. While agile software project delivery is a growing trend to deliver projects, it still poses many challenges to 
various business stakeholders in measuring the value derived. The study has proposed a conceptual framework for 
governance of agile projects. 
Keywords

1. Introduction
Agile software development encapsulates various software development methods that work in an incremental and 
iterative way. These methods are formed based on continuous improvement, better communication by fostering 
collaboration, embracing and adapting to changing requirements (Agrawal, Atiq and Maurya, 2015:291). Traditional 
project management operates on following established plans, which are inflexible, and should these plans change, an 
approval process must be followed to cater for the changes (Collins, 2017). 
In traditional project management, governance frameworks were in place to assist with the management of projects 
and bridging the gap between IT and the business. Müller (2009) defines the concept of governance as the combination 
of the value system, responsibilities, processes and policies that provide organizations a framework emphasizing the 
distinction between ownership and control for decision-making and managerial action to serve the best interests of 
internal and external stakeholders and the organization itself. 
Agile projects by their nature are managed differently as compared to traditional projects therefore the current 
framework may not be suitable in an agile environment. However, agile projects still require much control, 
responsibility and accountability as it is the case with traditional projects. 
Upon review of literature, much more work still needs to be done on agile governance as there is no governance 
framework that covers agile projects. 
The question is what governance mechanism should be used in Agile Project environment? 
2. Literature Review
2.1 Agile methodology overview 
The agile methodology has been a growing trend to manage the complexities that come with software development 
projects (Lappi and Aaltonen, 2016:263). Organisations are leaning towards this methodology due to one of the

• 
Agile methods have challenges that need to be addressed to enable and empower IT practitioners to deliver 
on projects and reduce number of failed projects; 
• 
Senior leadership need to acquaint themselves with the theories of agile delivery to provide the necessary 
support to IT for them to deliver timeously and deliver the right things; 
• 
Collaboration and communication remains an issue to be further addressed amongst agile delivery teams and 
external stakeholders; 
• 
Minimal research has been done on agile governance framework and more studies need to be conducted 
regarding this topic. 
Through the empirical study, the following findings were made: 
• 
Organisations are on the agile journey utilizing different methodologies, some still have a mix of traditional 
and agile methods, however they are learning and improving through the process; 
• 
A governance framework is required to monitor and control agile projects, traditional frameworks are 
creating obstacles in the agile delivery space; 
• 
There is a need for education around governance frameworks for IT practitioners. 
The objective of this study was to address the gap about a governance framework for agile projects. Based on the 
results of the studies high level components were identified that needs to be in a framework, however there is further 
studies that need to be conducted to find a framework that will be conducive for organisations and be recognised by 
ISACA as a standard of monitoring and control. 
We can draw a conclusion that agile methodologies have brought about an appreciated change in the industry. The 
issues that are still experienced need to be researched and find ways to reduce their occurrence. A well-defined 
governance framework will ensure good governance for organisations.

Abstract 
A Project Management Information System is generally a single or a collection of computerized software applications 
that provide easier, efficient, and integrated methods for managing project information from their inception through 
to their completion. Many free project management information systems tools are available for use by project 
management professionals; however, they do not provide enough support methods to project management. Most of 
these tools can be useful in managing small projects, with short duration, low budget and simple implementation 
processes. When the project is broad and diverse, sophisticated tool(s) such as MS Project or Primavera are required. 
These tools are more expensive; they require skilled project team members and support a single project methodology.  
In this paper, we assess the use of project management information systems in projects and its impact on the project 
outcome. Project management information systems vendors may use this as a guideline to indicate the key things that 
organization expects from the tool and to address the shortcomings that exist in their tool. Organizations may use the 
results as guideline in selecting the best set of project management information system tools that would enable success. 
Keywords: PMIS; project management methodology; project outcome; PMIS tools 
1. Introduction 
Since the beginning of the 21st century, global and local markets have rapidly grown while becoming more 
competitive, leaving corporations with little or no alternatives but to learn to adapt to remain relevant in their respective 
markets. Advancements in technology and the world becoming more integrated and interconnected has put pressure 
on companies either to consider and utilize at least some form of information systems or face damaging declines in 
productivity. Information systems such as Project Management Information Systems (PMISs) are one of the major 
support providers in the modern business world, helping companies remain relevant and keep-up with the forever-
changing market demands. 
 
A Project Management Information System (PMIS) is generally a single or a collection of computerized software 
applications, which provide easier, efficient, and integrated methods for managing project from their inception through 
to their completion (Riņģis and Bērziša, 2016). PMIS has become a mandatory tool and a characteristic for successful 
companies (Raymond and Bergeron, 2008). Light et al. (2005) found that companies that use PMISs have an estimated 
success rate of 75%.  
 
However, the effectiveness of a PMIS within an organization depends on several aspects. Firstly, it requires thorough 
training and understanding of it usage. Secondly, and maybe most significantly, the level of experience of the project 
manager. Nelson (2016), records that only 4% of project failures are due to technological mistakes rather than a 45% 
failure caused by the lack of PMIS technical expertise as well as low experience in project management. This suggests 
that the use of PMIS within organizations has a greater impact on its success.

When testing whether the project management information system (PMIS) has an impact on project outcome, over 
89% of respondents agree as depicted in Figure 8. Various reason were mentioned. The respondents indicated that 
project tracking is the main benefit of using PMIS tool, and it is important for the optimal management of the project. 
However, what stood out was just like a dashboard in the car, the value that the PMIS tool add to the project is the 
ability to measure, monitor, indicate and alarm project status, without the dashboard it becomes difficult for a driver 
to effectively and efficiently drive the vehicle.  
 
 
 
Figure 8: The impact of the use of PMIS tool on project outcome 
 
From the basic statistics of the results, it is a unanimous view that the use of PMIS to manage and track project 
increases the chances of project success. The standard deviation of 0.31 supports this view. 
 
 
 
Figure 9: The basic statistics of the use of PMIS tool on project outcome 
 
5. CONCLUSION  
PMIS must provide reliable and accurate information that will enable the project team to perform their tasks efficiently 
and effectively. It is not the complexity of the software that matters but the quality of the information generated by 
the system and the ability of the user to use the information to manage the project. This information helps the users/ 
project managers to perform their tasks in a much professional manner. It is recommended that organizations should 
adopt the use of PMIS in the management of their projects. PMIS guarantees better management of project since it 
generates quality information needed for the management of the project.

This research has produced three key findings, firstly the results indicate that project management information system 
tools provide some level of support and makes a major contribution to project success. However due to the rapid 
changes in technology most of the tools fall behind when it comes to making more features available. Secondly, most 
users of project management information system tools are project managers because of the features that are available 
including monitoring and tracking, budgeting and cost control, and planning and mobility. In a traditional project 
delivery ecosystem, the project manager is the one who is responsible for these activities.  Furthermore, they have the 
responsibility to report to all other key stakeholders. 
5.1. Recommendations 
This research report recommends that since there is significant relationship between project management information 
system features, quality of the information output from the project management information system tool, the use of 
project management information system tool to perform project management tasks, on the project outcome: 
1. Organization should start making use of Project Management Information System in the management of 
their projects. This is because they have the potential to make the management of projects better. Software 
vendors needs to work very close with organization to enable the exact features that matters to the 
organization. 
2. The project management information system tool itself does not have a direct impact on project success; it is 
only through its ability to provide quality information output to support project team in tracking their projects 
better.

Abstract 
The electricity generation system of Greece relies heavily on conventional fossil fuel thermoelectric power plants. A 
high proportion of the electricity generated in Greece, in particular, comes from lignite-fired power plants. The 
purpose of this paper is to assess the performance of lignite-fired electricity power plants that are currently operating 
in Greece. Electricity generation units are considered as linear multi-input/-output systems. A standard data 
envelopment analysis tool is utilized in order to evaluate their overall efficiency. Technical and environmentally 
adverse performance indices are employed. Computational results included in the paper are presented and discussed 
in detail. Implied future electricity generation policies are also identified.

Abstract 
One of the major problems in the implementation of projects is failure due to poor organization, lack of action plans, 
lack of leadership, teamwork and little organizational culture, for this reason, the development of the mercury 
decontamination project in water with orange peels was based on two highly effective and essential methodologies to 
achieve positive and sustainable results, as well as a high impact in the area of industrial and chemical engineering. 
On one hand, there is operational excellence with ideas that encompass quality, efficiency and effectiveness, but above 
all, there is a very strong focus on the organizational culture. On the other hand, there is the change management that 
is covering the issues related to the motivation of human capital, directing it towards the change management and 
leadership, reaching a point of balance with both methodologies, which will be the pillars of our project, ensuring the 
viability and success of this.

1. Operational Excellence
Operational Excellence is highly essential for the growth of organizations and industries of all sizes, within the 
characteristics that govern operational excellence exist the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of companies (Tijerina 
and Tapia, 2019). Operational Excellence is not just another theoretical concept; is a philosophy that aims to achieve 
a better performance and finalize commercial success, operational excellence involves the organizational culture of 
the company, where employees have the ability to identify problems and solve them analytically (Tijerina and Tapia, 
2019). Operational Excellence is the development of enablers to generate competitive benefits in a dynamic 
environment based on the resources of an organization (adaptability). The composition and expansion of enablers is 
the basis for continuous improvement, change and optimization of business processes. According to Tijerina (Tijerina 
and Tapia, 2019), the four fundamental vertices that jointly constitute operational excellence are presented in Figure 
1, which were taken as the basis for the development of this project. Nowadays, market conditions set the tone for any 
organization to take the road to success and face the challenges to be able to continue in the market, obtaining 
significant improvements in the indicators of the organization. If operational excellence is practiced, companies aim 
to have lean processes. The result offers value to customers at low prices. One of the ways to achieve Operational 
Excellence is the reduction in the amount of waste existing either in the value chain of the product or service or in the 
links between them. 
Being clear about the characteristics and elements of excellence is a key point for success in the implementation of 
projects. Due to this situation, the program proposed by Tijerina and Tapia (Tijerina and Tapia, 2019) is shown in 
table 1 to carry out a project starting with or taking operational excellence as a key element.

Finally, we must remember that in our changing world, the production plants continue to be an important part of the 
productive sector of our country and generate a boost in economic development such as these that creates the 
greenhouse industry that offers its services and in the same way, it gives progress and comfort to our society (Espinosa 
et al. 2013). 
 
5. Results of change in decontamination of mercury in water  
Once the study of minerals, profile of fatty acids, resveratrol and phytosterols finished, the tests with different solutions 
contaminated with mercury were done. For these purposes, the powder was mixed with the samples that were 
contaminated with mercury inside the Erlenmeyer flasks. The resultant mixtures were shaken for thirty minutes to 
assure that these adhered with the mercury and could clean it. Finally, the water was filtered through funnels covered 
with Whatman 40 paper with the intention of cleaning the above-mentioned solutions of the pollutant. The filtered 
solution was taken to a laboratory to determine the amount of mercury and in this way, establish the quantity of this 
decontaminated metal. 
In the first test, a solution of mercury was prepared in nitric acid in a concentration of 28.6 PPM. 40 ml of this solution 
were placed in each of three different flasks. In the first flask, 4.86 grams of pulp from the dehydrated orange peel 
were added and sifted to 150 microns. In the second flask, 5.01 grams of dehydrated orange peel were added and sifted 
to 150 microns and in the third flask, 5.08 grams of dehydrated orange peel were added and sifted to 250 microns. 
During the experiment, 30 ml of water were included to every sample to improve the adsorption. The time of contact 
of the samples in the solution was of approximately 30 minutes, with constant shaking. After this period, a filtration 
was done. During the second test, two solutions of mercury in nitric acid in a concentration of 10 PPM were prepared 
and another one in a concentration of 5 PPM. 100 ml were placed of this solution in both flasks. In the first flask 5.89 
grams of the dehydrated orange peel were added and sifted to 150 microns. In the second flask, 5.01 grams of pulp 
from the dehydrated orange peel were added and sifted to 150 microns. The time of contact of the samples in the 
solution was of approximately 40 minutes with constant shaking. After this period, a filtration was done in which the 
results are presented in Table 3.

As it can be seen in Table 3, the filtering material that has been used to eliminate mercury in the water has managed 
to decontaminate it up to proportions of 0.7550ppb which are minor quantities to the ones allowed by World Health 
Organization. 
 
6. Conclusion 
The project presented above is very attractive, since it combines two branches of the exact sciences to consolidate a 
project satisfactorily in the branch of industrial engineering, which includes the application of quality methodologies 
such as operational excellence and change management with the objective of guaranteeing business competition, 
participation and incursion of human capital in projects. These projects aim to reduce costs, maximize productivity, 
spread the organizational culture in all its aspects, management, leadership, and in ensuring the permanence of the 
organization in the market. All these concepts were applied to the branch of Chemical Engineering in the development 
of the mercury decontamination project in the water with orange peels, resulting in a project with positive results and 
impact in the two areas, respectively, industrial engineering and chemical engineering.

Abstract 
 
In the year 2000 governments of all countries established the so-called Millennium Development Goals of 
the United Nations. Among the main objectives of these guidelines is to provide conditions so that each 
person (child, young or adults) can take advantage of educational opportunities to meet their basic needs. 
The Brazilian Indice de Desenvolvimento da Educacao Basica (IDEB), index created and calculated 
biannually by the National Institute of Educational Studies Teixeira (INEP), shows that the levels of 
proficiency in Portuguese and Mathematics is still below the target. Recent studies suggest that the shortage 
of public resources and the disorganization of these features are the causes for the poor performance. This 
study aims to analyze technical efficiency of primary education schools in the state capital of Santa Catarina 
State (with nearly 500 thousand inhabitants), in the South of Brazil. For this study, Data Envelopment 
Analysis models were applied using secondary data obtained from INEP. The results show that schools 
with large numbers of enrolled students tend to have more difficulty managing their human and physical 
resources, resulting in worse technical and scale scores. Finally, management actions are proposed in order 
to overcome the congestion of resources that causes inefficiency of the municipal schools.

1. Introduction 
 
According to the ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education), basic education concerns primary and 
inferior secondary education. In Brazil, a specific law details the citizens’ rights concerning education, and organizes 
general educational aspects. According to such legislation, “the education, duty both of the family and of the State, 
inspired by freedom principles and human solidarity ideals, targets the integral development of the individual as well 
as his/her preparation for active and full citizenship and qualification for job market.” (BRASIL. Law nº 9.394, 1996). 
As pointed out by an OECD (2015) study, 17.2% of total public spending in Brazil concerns education, from its 
primary to higher education. Among other OECD countries, such figure is only lower than Mexico’s and New 
Zealand’s, spending approximately 18% in education. In 2012, the spending in higher education was 5.6% of total 
budgets, more than the OECD average of 4.7%. However, when such figures are expressed in per student terms, Brazil 
falls far below the OECD average: US$3,826 per student in Brazil, less than half of OECD average of US$8,477 
(OECD, 2015). In addition to the substantially lower investment levels, Brazil also lacks proper resource management. 
According to a study from the federal government think-tank IPEA (Applied Economic Research Institute), although 
spending per student figures are higher in Brazil than in some other countries such as Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and 
Bolivia, these countries present Human Development Indexes (HDIs) higher than in Brazil (Dalberto et al., 2015). 
The same study sates that Brazilian spending is the 13rd most inefficient among all OECD members. 
Inefficient usage of public resources has been a major source of the weak performance of the Brazilian educational 
system in contrast to other countries (Marques, 2010). A study put forward by Neto et al. (2013) showed that a great 
deal of the Brazilian schools lack minimal infrastructure conditions (such as libraries and study rooms), fact that 
translates into very low educational quality standards. Another study carried out by the OECD in 2016 deals with 
teachers’ wages. Once again Brazilian figures are half OECD’s, being teacher’ yearly wages in Brazil around

to note that the variable “number of enrolled students” differs approximately +68.6% while the variable “number of 
teachers” differs around +42.8% between the two groups. The same happens to the variable “number of classrooms” 
(+76.1%) when compared to the number of enrolled students. Besides, the “number of student per computer” increases 
46.5%, as well as the average number of students per class in the first and last years, growing 10% and 6.7%, 
respectively, what suggest that schools in Cluster 2 have bigger problems in managing physical resources. The basic 
education development indexes from 2011 and 2013 (IDEB 2011 and IDEB 2013) show a reduction of 3.74% and 
3.11%, respectively, among the schools of the two groups. 
 
5.3 Principal Component Analysis 
 
The application of DEA models requires previous dimensionality reduction of the problem. This section presents a 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in addition to the correlation analysis described in the last section. The objective 
is to find out the group of variables that have the highest significance and account for a high share of data variability, 
hence, belonging to the first principal components. Table 4 presents results from the first six components and the 
correlation value ρ of each variable in the components 
The schools become technical and scale efficient with the new values of the input variables. The values of the clusters 
become more similar: Cluster 2 remains with the largest number of enrolled students, but is smaller then cluster 1 with 
respect to the number of employees and the number of teachers. It can be seen that 20 schools out of the 25 analyzed 
in this sub problem would have to decrease the number of enrolled students in order to become technical and scale 
efficient. The difference in the number of enrolled students before and after the projection is of 5,385 students. Such 
figure account for 39.4% of the 13,679 students enrolled in 2013. From the 5,385 students to be reduced, 4,421 belong 
to schools in Cluster 2. 
By considering the whole educational system of the city as a single transformation process, such decrease in the 
number of enrolled students is not viable, because it would drastically reduce the supply of basic education for the 
population of the city. An alternative for such challenge is to increase the number of DMU’s in a sense all of them can 
be properly sized. In order to do so, according to the average values of enrolled students before and after the efficiency 
frontier projection, 16 new schools would have to be constructed with capacity of 337 students each. Alternatively, 
the number of classrooms in each school could increase, thus reducing the number of students per classroom. It is 
important that the number of students per teacher also grows proportionally, making the school environment adequate 
for quality teacher/student interaction. 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
The objective of this study was to assess technical and scale efficiency of selected public basic schools from the half-
million people city of Florianópolis, in the south of Brazil. For doing so, we have considered data from the 2013 
edition of the School Census and Brazil Exam programs. Correlation and clustering analysis have shown two 
homogeneous groups of schools: small- and large-sized. Substantial differences in resource management could also 
be observed between the two groups by the different figures of number of students per classroom and the number of 
computers per student. 
The most representative variables to the problem were identified by means of the Principal Component Analysis, 
which was used to perform dimensionality reduction as a pre-processing step prior to the application of the DEA 
models. The number of teachers and employees, full- and part-time enrolled students composed the set of variables 
chosen as input and the Basic Education Development Index (IDEB, 2013) was considered as the output of the 
transformation process. 
The application of the DEA models have shown that larger schools are the least efficient, from both technical (pure 
technical efficiency) and scale perspectives. The analysis of congested variables pointed to school size reduction as a 
way to project schools’ production plans to the efficiency frontier. Having seeing that a reduction in the supply of 
basic education is unviable in the context of the considered schools, it is then proposed that new schools should be put 
forward, or that the existing schools should grow in size, but keeping the efficient relation between resources and 
students present in the small-sized schools. 
It is then finally suggested that future research could explore difference between money spent with the teachers directly 
(such as wage and bonus) and with their professional qualification (training, career plans). Familiar environment 
impact on student performance could be also an interesting venue of future research.

Abstract 
 
Transportation sector is important to the economy and its rapid development has contributed significantly to the 
socioeconomic development of the country. The transportation sector in Malaysia accounts for approximately 35% 
of the total energy consumed nationally and produces nearly 50 million tonne of CO2 per year in 2015, second only 
to electricity power generation. Though shares only 0.3% of global GHG (Greenhouse gas) emissions, Malaysia is 
second largest per capita GHG emitter among the group of ASEAN countries and the major concern lies in the ever 
increasing trends. The aim of this work was to perform dynamic quantitative emission analysis of Malaysian vehicle 
fleet until year 2040, primarily on land transports including both passenger and freight transports except train. 
Utilizing a System Dynamic approach using Powersim Studio®, several emission scenarios were modelled in 
compared to current scenario (baseline model). The baseline model was used to determine carbon dioxide (CO2), 
carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) reduction for different policy scenarios in compared to baseline 
scenario. The complex relationships between the various components in the transport system are reflected in the 
dynamic model considering the vehicle technology, legislation and drivers’ attitude. This work found that CO2 
emission in 2040 can be reduced by up to 50%, compared to baseline scenario, without affecting the economy and 
vehicle demand. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides pollution can also be reduced by 75% and 93% respectively 
with implementation of several policies compared to baseline scenario.

1. Introduction  
 
Malaysia has been one of the fastest growing ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) countries since its 
independence and has significantly transformed itself from a predominantly agriculture-based country to 
manufacturing and, now, toward modern services and modernization towards a vision 2020 (Shahid et al. 2014). 
Transportation sector is important to the economy and its rapid development has contributed significantly to the 
socioeconomic development of the country (Mustapa and Bekhet 2016). The transportation sector in Malaysia 
accounts for approximately 35% of the total energy consumed nationally and produces nearly 50 million tons of 
CO2 per year in 2015, second only to electricity power generation. The vast majority (i.e. 85.2%) of transportation 
emissions comes from road transport. Due to the high rate of personal automobile ownership, cars account for about 
59% of the overall emissions from transport, while freight is responsible for 27%. Although there are a roughly 
equal number of cars and motorcycles on the roads, motorcycles account for only 11% of the CO2 emissions from 
the transportation sector (Horizon Gitano Briggs and Leong Hau Kian 2016). Transportation sector is the largest 
pollution emitter and it is reported that energy efficiencies from this sector was merely at 20% (Bekhet and Othman 
2017). Still heavily reliant on fossil fuels, the transport sector has continued to be top contributor to hazardous

Figure 7. Comparison of CO2 emission for different policy applied 
 
As for Policy 2 (Reduce VKT) average vehicle-kilometer travelled (VKT) for all fleet were reduced by 20%. This is 
made possible by increasing pump fuel price, providing alternative transportation system such as rail services, 
educate driver to plan their drive and to avoid unnecessary travel. For this policy, a reduction of 28% of total carbon 
dioxide emission with respect to 2016 baseline was observed. In Policy 3 (Improve FC) fuel consumption (FC) of 
passenger car was improved from 7.2 L/100km to 4.1L/100km. This can be achieved with the introduction of fuel 
efficient vehicle. This policy leads to 17% of total carbon dioxide emission. Policy 4 (Fuel quality-EURO 6 
adaptation) mainly the adaptation of Euro 6 emission standard, however was only affected for carbon monoxide 
(CO) and NOx emission (Figure 8). Policy 5 (Combination) shows the lowest emission with over half of emission at 
2020. The main contributor is by improving the fuel consumption and reduces the vehicle kilometre travel. Only by 
utilizing the Policy 5 the target emission can be achieved.

4. Conclusions   
 
Fulfilling Malaysia’s objective to a long-term, sustainable transport sector requires addressing a huge amount of 
threat to the environment. Transportation sector, as the second largest producer of carbon dioxide emission in 
Malaysia, it plays as an important key element for resolving this threat. Due to the high rate of passenger car 
ownership, cars account for about 59% of the overall emissions from transport, while freight is responsible for 27%. 
Although there are a roughly equal number of cars and motorcycles on the roads, motorcycles account for only 11% 
of the CO2 emissions from the transportation sector. As the economy continues to develop the rate of energy 
consumption rises, and corresponding Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are also increasing, resulting in an almost 
constant rate of CO2 emissions, making it logical to approach better vehicle management.

Abstract 
There is little research documenting the use of clean technologies (CT) in Agribusiness in Mexico. In this regard, the 
objective of this article is to provide an in-depth literature review that can cover this gap and help decision-makers 
and investors to identify opportunity areas in the industry. It also provides a good theoretical background for 
researchers and practitioners to further investigate applications of clean technologies in this sector or other potential 
ones. To conduct this research, an in-depth analysis of the literature on clean technologies and their use by agribusiness 
in Mexico was carried out. The databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, and Springer were used to identify the 
relevant international journals in the field and their research-contributions. The main results show that there is a need 
for financial investments on clean technologies CT that can help optimizing processes and products on the sector. The 
results also showed that CT is mainly used to minimize energy consumption, to optimize planting and harvesting, to 
enhance irrigation and water use, and to maintain the soil fertility. Despite these wide applications, the authors found 
that the penetration of CT is still low and policy-strategies are required with effective financial investments in the 
sector.

1. Introduction
In the modern world, many people share a great concern for the increasing deterioration of the environment and its 
effects on human life. As it provides food to humans and other species and helps to sustain life on Earth, agriculture 
is one of the most relevant of human activities. This critical activity has been affected by water pollution, use of 
pesticides, emissions of greenhouse gases, soil erosion and loss of biodiversity, among other negative activities 
(Kirchmann and Thorvaldsson 2000). In addition, the persistent levels of hunger and malnutrition in the world, the 
continuing pervasive incidence of unsustainable practices and increased human activities on the Earth's capacity 
represents a challenge for agriculture, aggravated by the continuing growth of the world's population. According to 
the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (2015), to meet the growing food demand for

Abstract 
Lean has benefited industries, however, the research regarding its implementation in the transportation sector is 
limited. Therefore, there is huge potential for the implementation of Lean in the transportation sector. With the 
growing population and production, traffic congestion is no surprise, placing constraints on transport operations. This 
research utilises two extensions of the Lean tools of Transportation Value Stream Mapping (TVSM) and 
Transportation Overall Vehicle Effectiveness (TOVE). This research presents a case study of company XYZ based in 
Thailand, to optimise their transport operations through utilisation of Lean and its extensions mentioned earlier. As a 
result, the TOVE index is projected to improve from 17% to 31% and TVSM from 51% – 70%. The empirical study 
presented in this research paves the way for further research and adoption of Lean in transportation operations.

Introduction
The lean approach was developed by Toyota to strengthen and establish itself against its US rivals after world war II 
(Garza-Reyes, 2015). The concept focuses on a systematic approach to identify/eliminate waste throughout the 
business processes and create value for its customers (Womack et al., 2007). Ever since its successful outcomes, 
the scope of Lean has been extended to various other industries, including the service sector (Nadeem et 
al., 2017). These modifications/extensions of Lean have resulted in both broadening the impact of Lean and yet at 
the same time to make it precisely applicable to specific industries through development of adapted niche 
approaches such as healthcare (Teichgräber and De Bucourt, 2012), service sector (Barber and Tietje, 2008), 
supply chain and administration (Myerson, 2012), and transportation (Villarreal, 2012; Villarreal et al., 2016a, 
2016b, 2009).
This research explores the impact and benefit of Lean in the transportation sector. There are two major developments 
in terms of Lean extension specifically for the transportation sector. These extensions are Transportation Value 
Stream Mapping (TVSM) and Transportation Overall Vehicle Effectiveness (TOVE). Value Stream Mapping (VSM) 
not only assist in scoping the current state

Furthermore, value added time of transit and serving clients processes are projected to increase to 75% and 
64% respectively. TMS can generate delivery route optimisation which eliminates the excess distance and 
reduces fill-loss and speed loss by 10% and 18% respectively. Moreover, automation can speed up loading 
and unloading, eliminating the excess time by 0.8 hours. Meanwhile, communication with customers can 
lead to the elimination of 0.5 hours of waiting time for available space at the customer’s plant (see Table 
3). Overall, the increase of value-added time of transport operations from 51% to 70% is projected. 
 
8. Conclusions, Limitations and Future Research Direction  
The research utilises Lean tools of TVSM and TOVE to optimise transport operations of XYZ 
company. The analysis and output further affirm the benefit that Lean implementation can bring 
to the transportation sector. The limitation of this research are the narrow span of time for 
observing only 30% of routes, as well as the lack of actual implementation of recommendations 
due to time constraints. Further research with the application is recommended.

Abstract 
Growing academic research explores how the principles, practices, and enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 can be 
integrated with Circular Economy (CE) and Sustainable Manufacturing. However, there is a lack of empirical studies 
about adaptation of these technologies in manufacturing companies. From this perspective, the paper presents a case 
study of the implementation of Smart Factory System (SFS) in a manufacturing SME based in Nottinghamshire. The 
use of data and information throughout the production lifecycle creates flexible manufacturing processes that respond 
rapidly to changes in demand. This drives better quality, productivity and flexibility and helps the company to deliver 
products in a sustainable way, at a large scale and with better resource utilization and energy efficiency. The study 
also outlines the challenges presented during design, installation and an early operationalization stages of SFS. This 
study intends to contribute to the limited research focusing on implementation of Smart Factory System and 
development of metrics to evaluate the environmental performance in terms of products, processes, organization and 
people. The study has strong implications for both, theory and practice, aiming to improve SME’s Smart Factory 
System adoption.

Abstract 
The present work is a case study about the application of the methodology named Stylistic Design 
Engineering (SDE), that is an approach to develop car design projects in the industrial world. For attending 
this goal, it was chosen the E-segment car products, in particular following the necessity to fill a gap in the 
Alfa Romeo’s market, which offers currently only models in A, B, SUV and coupé segments and needs a 
kind of model that could be successful in the market. In fact Alfa Romeo does not own a E-segment sport 
sedan flagship car model for years now (the last one was the 166). Based on this assumption and the fact 
that the largest car manufacturers are currently investing heavily on E segment cars, it was interesting to 
think about a new Alfa Romeo flagship model, maybe named with glorious name “Alfetta”. In the following 
pages will be illustrated the summary of the path that led to the final product following the “instructions” 
of SDE.

1. Materials and Methods
1.1 SDE Stylistic Design Engineering
Stylistic Design Engineering is one of the set up phase of the industrial project, to be considered part of the macro-
area of Design Engineering. It is finalized only to define an aesthetic shape of a new product (not only automotive
one) adopting an engineering approach. In fact it was invented by a famous mechanical engineer, Eng. Lorenzo
Ramacciotti, former CEO of Pininfarina Spa.
Scientifically - not only technically – speaking, it is important for designers and engineers study this methodology
because it helps who develops a product to have a road map for arriving at a good aesthetic result that nowadays is a
fundamental feature for the success of every products on the market.
Moreover, the method, industrially consolidated along the last 20 years, didn’t find a wide application in the industrial
field, but it remained finite to the realization of not so many products realized by Pininfarina Spa (for this reason, it is
known in the industrial world also as “Pininfarina Method”), although it is sharply the most convenient economically
speaking, for a stylistic design project. Finally, it must be remarked that, in the academic and scientific world, it can
open big spaces for the research, because each one of its step can be adapted to the new emerging technologies of the
fourth industrial revolution.
About the goal of SDE, the methodology aims to:
•
analyze cogent stylistic trends
•
provide new stylistic idea for new products
•
offer a stylistic technical study (for example, a maquette) as final result
•
realize style project using an engineering method, as abovementioned, developed by an engineer
1.2 SDE Stylistic Design Engineering: framing and structure 
As already said before, Stylistic Design Engineering is one of the set up phase of the industrial project, and it is 
fundamental for the good success of a new product. 
Normally, new industrial project structure is composed by three macro phases:

In the following figure (Figure 22) can be summarized the future developments. They are oriented to the 
implementation of the emerging technologies (derived from Industry 4.0) instead of the techniques nowadays used for 
SDE.

In conclusion, it can be affirmed that SDE Stylistic Design Engineering applications reached the given targets in the 
present case study, that means: 
 
- 
Analysis of Cogent Stylisitic Trends was performed  
- 
A New Stylistic Idea for a new automotive product was provided 
- 
A Styilistic Technical Study (performed also with a physical Maquette) was realized as Final Result 
 
Moreover, last but not the least, new perspectives to SDE were given, looking at the innovative technologies of 
Industry 4.0.

Abstract 
Stylistic Design Engineering (SDE)  is an engineered method developed for creating a structured way to realize Car 
Design Projects. SDE is composed by the following steps: (1) Stylistic Trends Analysis; (2) Sketches; (3) 2D CAD 
Drawings; (4) 3D CAD Models; (5) Rendering; (6) Solid Stylistic Model (defined also styling maquettes). In the 
present paper, SDE is applied to a new SUV, in particular to a new possibility of launching a new FIAT 
Campagnola, an off-roader that was very successful in the 1950s - 1970s. This project deals with the exernal 
redesign of Fiat Campagnola. It has been carried out using various design technologies and methodologies that will 
be further explained in details, such as the Pininfarina method, the QFD (Quality Function Deployment) method, 
Benchmarking e Top Flop analysis. The work has been organized according to different phases. At first it has been 
studied the Fiat style, an essential step to understand better the features of the brand and also the main characteristics 
carried out during the decades. Later we carried on with the phase of the freehand sketches, being inspired by what 
was previously learned in every single step of study. This phase continued until a satisfactory form was found by 
analyzing and discarding the various proposals of the various types of style. Once the proposal was choosen, then 
the three-dimensional shape was obtained and on which it was possible to evaluate proportions and dimensions, also 
thanks to rendering software. All the analysis methodologies required for the quality of the project mentioned before 
have been used during all these phases

Abstract 
Establishment of general equilibrium models allow us to determine the relevant measure of investment risk, and 
determine how the relationship between investment risk for any assets when capital markets are in balance. In a 
balanced market conditions, the correlation between expected return of a risky asset with the risk freeasset can be 
modeled with the CAPM. In CAPM, change risky asset returns are influenced by the market return and the return of 
risk-free assets, which is a risk-free asset return is the lowest gain required in investing. The problem that arises is 
why do not gain the required lows is not based on a risk-free asset. In this paper studied the determination of asset 
returns based on some form of CAPM which refers to zakat, NGDP, inflation, and the price of gold (GP). Based on 
the study results obtained by the return of assets is determined based form of ICAPM, NGDP-CAPM, Inf-CAPM, 
and GP-CAPM. So with by some form of the CAPM can be used as a measure of determining asset returns and 
investment risk that is relevant.

1. Introduction
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) is a model for determining the price of an investment asset. The model is 
formulated based on an equilibrium asset market condition. In an equilibrium state the level of returns required by 
investors for an investment asset will be affected by the risk of the price of investment assets in the market 
(Choudhary&Choudhary, 2010; Ferson& Locke, 1998). Here investment risk is no longer interpreted as a standard 
deviation of the rate of returnof an investment asset, but is measured based on the value of beta parameters in the 
CAPM model (Shamim, Abid, & Shaikh, 2015). Use of beta parameters β This is consistent with the theory of 
investment portfolios, which says that if investors diversify well, the risk gauge is the contribution of risk from 
additional assets to the investment portfolio (Shamim, Abid, & Shaikh, 2015; Wakyiku, 2010). If an investor holds 
an investment market portfolio, then this risk contribution is nothing but a beta parameter β (Alqisie and Alqurran, 
2016).

have a pattern that is almost the same, only on the return movement of assets estimated using the inflation 
benchmark has higher fluctuations. Visually, it appears that even though asset return movements fluctuate, the 
average return on assets estimated using the terms of zakat is higher. 
Based on a brief comparative analysis of the forms of CAPM, it is hoped that it can create insight for 
investors, that CAPM analysis can not only be done by referring to risk-free assets only. But it can also be done by 
referring to the return of other relevant assets. 
 
4. Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
This paper has discussed the determination of asset returns based on several forms of Capital Asset Pricing 
Model (CAPM). Here have been reviewed several forms of CAPM which include: standard CAPM, CAPM, 
Inflation-CAPM, Gold Price-CAPM, and Islamic-CAPM Bonds. Using some forms of CAPM, then used to 
determine the return of assets, and then analyzed differences in the characteristics of asset returns calculated using 
each form of CAPM. Based on the analysis, it shows that the estimators of each of the fluctuating asset return 
movements are similar, and the average return of assets estimated using ICAPM is higher than the others. Therefore, 
investors prior to investing should determine the reference used. Then in a balanced market the analysis of 
determining the return of assets, as a consideration in making investment decisions.

Abstract 
Determination of the theoretical price of a stock using a dividend discount model is done by setting various levels of 
dividend growth. The problem is what if dividend growth is assumed to follow a time series. In this paper it aims to 
discuss stock valuation using a fluctuating dividend discount model along with the time series. It is assumed that 
the expected dividend fluctuate with time series model. To estimate the magnitude the expected dividend was 
performed using a Autoregressive Integrated  Moving Average (ARIMA) model. As for determining the theoretical 
price of the stock is done by using the dividend discount models, which include some level of growth. Based on the 
dividend discount model of stock prices in the period to

1. Introduction
One form of investment that is often chosen by investors to invest is stocks. In order for the investment 
decision to generate returns as expected, investors need to make a prior assessment of the shares they will choose 
(Adebiyi, Adewumi& Ayo, 2014; Charumathi&Suraj, 2014). This stock valuation is important to produce 
information on intrinsic value, and then it will be compared with the stock market price to determine the buy or sell 
position of a company's stock. The discount dividend model is one of the useful tools for determining the intrinsic 
price of shares.The assessment of the intrinsic price of shares is carried out by establishing various assumptions 
about the level of dividend growth (Olweny, 2011). The usual assumptions used are starting dividends without 
growth, dividends with constant growth, dividends with multiple growth rates, dividends with two levels of growth, 
and dividends with three growth rates (Gray & Hull, 2013). The problem is what if it is assumed that the dividend 
growth rate follows the time series model. 
With regard to price valuation, Gottwald (2010) measures stock price volatility using a dividend discount 
model. Olweny (2011) evaluates the reliability of the dividend discount model in the valuation of capital market 
share prices in Nairobi. Gray & Hall (2013) estimated the cost of equity using a discounted dividend model. Both 
Gottwald and Olweny and Gray & Hall, determine the returns required by using the Capital Asset Pricing Model

3.2  Determination of Stock Prices with Dividends Growing Following Time Series 
 
The data of a bank's shares amount to n = 2489 which is the result of observations from 14 July 2004 to 25 
March 2014. Furthermore, the stock price data is determined by return values. Using the data return estimation of 
the average model with a time series approach. First, stationarity tests are conducted on stock return data using unit 
root test statistics. Stationarity test is done with the help of Eviws 7 software, and the results show that the stock 
return data is stationary.Second, the stationary data return is then estimated by the average model. The estimation is 
done using the ARMA model referring to equation (6). Estimates carried out include stages: identification of the 
average model, estimation of model parameters, parameter verification test, and diagnostic test. All stages are 
carried out using the software Eviews 7, and the estimation results of the mean model have been significant. Based 
on the estimation process obtained ARMA (3,3) model with the equation: 
𝐷𝐷𝑡𝑡= 0.542394𝐷𝐷t−3 −0.581179εt−3 + εt 
So the predictor model is: 
𝐷𝐷෡𝑡𝑡= 0.542394𝐷𝐷t−3 −0.581179εt−3 
 
Using a predictor model, predictions are made for the next 5 periods and the results are as follows:

Analysis of time series data can be used to predict capital market conditions and to determine investment 
decisions (eg when to sell or buy shares). Analysts will advise investors of a stock if the rate of return is above the 
level of return required. On the other hand, analysts will suggest selling a stock if the rate of return is below the level 
of return required. This method is useful if historical data shows a random fluctuation, which is sometimes the price 
rises and there are times when prices fall. 
 
From the discussion of technical analysis above, it can be said that stock prices are the main object of 
analysis. Technical analysts do not pay attention to the fundamental factors that cause changes in stock prices. This 
is because analysts assume that these factors have been reflected in the stock price at the time of the analysis. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
In this paper, stock valuation has been discussed using a dividend discount model with a growth rate 
following a time series. In the dividend discount approach grows to follow the time series model, dividends will 
grow or decay fluctuating with changes in time. Analysis of dividend growth follows a time series, including 
technical analysis that does not pay attention to fundamental factors, because it has been assumed to be reflected in 
stock prices during the analysis. Analysis of dividend growth following a series of times, has a weakness in the mass 
of predictions, namely the prediction of dividends for the time farther from the starting point, the greater the 
deviation.

Abstract 
Stochastic rules and their inequality are very useful tools in various economic fields and financial 
problems. The purpose of this paper is to determine the main results obtained from the use of stochastic 
rules on financial optimization. Emphasis is placed on demand problems and the effects of changes in 
portfolio selection problems. Some other examples are not directly related to the optimization problem, 
this is given to show a broad view on the application of stochastic rules in financial matters. Stochastic 
orders and their inequalities have been used in various fields on problems related to opportunities (probability) and 
statistics in general. For example, a queuing system with a single service with Increasing Failure Rate (IRF) service 
time and service discipline that prioritizes job savings. Suppose Ti states of the ergodic arrival time of a customer 
when service discipline is used. In this paper it is assumed that the market guarantee is comprehensive and mutually 
independent.

1. Introduction
Stochastic orders and their inequalities have been used in various fields on problems related to opportunities
(probability) and statistics in general. For example, a queuing system with a single service with Increasing Failure
Rate (IRF) service time and service discipline that prioritizes job savings. Suppose Ti states the ergodic arrival time
of a customer when service discipline is used.
In the financial sector, the future price (or rate of return) of financial assets is shown by random variables that are
uncertain. Therefore, a tool is needed to solve the optimization problem which cannot be an exception for the field,
where many of them use stochastic rules. Likewise in many portfolio selection issues many use stochastic rules.
Thus, stochastic rules are very useful tools in the problem of portfolio selection. Investors are considered as a utility
function for u, that want to invest wealth into one or two assets or even more. In the case of two assets, call A and B,
take X and Y as random variables that show the results of assets A and B.
Furthermore, according to the principle of utility expectations, these investors overestimate asset A than B, if and
only if  (Kahneman, Daniel and Amos Tversky. 1979)
𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢(𝑋𝑋)] ≥𝐸𝐸[𝑢𝑢(𝑌𝑌)] 
(1) 
The above inequality shows, that for all investors, the utility functions are included in several function classes, 
which are part of stochastic rules for X and Y. 
The purpose of this paper is to introduce stochastic rules on economic problems, namely more specifically on the 
problem of demand and the problem of the effects of changes in portfolio selection. The next section discusses the

4. Conclusions 
Based on the analysis and discussion that has been done then it can be concluded that: Stochastic rules 
and inequality are very useful tools, especially in financial economic problems, especially on demand 
issues and the effects of changes in portfolio selection. Likewise, bivariate characteristics, risk aversion, 
average harmonic price generalization and equilibrium prices are a broad spectrum of applications for 
stochastic rules on financial problems.

Abstract 
Unit link insurance contains investments where the value varies according to the value of the investment asset. This 
can be overcome by limiting the minimum (floor) and maximum (cap) benefit that the insured will get. This research 
was conducted to calculate single net premium of unit link whole life insurance by limiting the benefits that will be 
accepted by insured. The method used is the Compound Ratchet method. Data used in this research is stock closing 
prices for case study at PT Astra InternasionalTbk. in 2016. Based on the research result, obtained the amount of 
premium that must be paid by prospective policy holders in four different cases of floor and cap values. The higher 
of the top value and the floor value, the higher of the premium value to be paid.

Introduction 
Some people now prefer to invest their money because it is considered more profitable than joining traditional
life insurance. Therefore, unit link life insurance was developed to increase public interest in following insurance. 
Unit link life insurance is life insurance where policyholders will get two benefits at once, namely protection and 
investment benefits. This insurance product gives the policy holder the freedom to choose the desired investment. 
Usually, policyholders choose to invest in stocks because they do not have a minimum capital limit and the highest 
return compared to other investments. 
Unit link insurance contains investments where the value varies at any time according to the value of the 
investment asset. When stock prices fall then the benefits also drastically come down. The way to overcome this is 
that the insurance company provides a minimum (floor) benefit and the insured will get the benefit of the price of 
the agreement on the contract. Conversely, if the stock price rises sharply, then the benefits also rose. This can be 
overcome by giving the maximum benefit limit (stamp) that the insured will get. The Insured or heir will receive the 
maximum benefit in the amount of the current stamp value and the minimum benefit in the amount of the agreed 
floor value, Hardy, M.R. 2003. 
There are three indexing methods that can be used to calculate unit link insurance benefits, namely point to 
point, annual ratchet, and high water mark Hardy, M.R. 2004. The Annual Ratchet method consists of 2 types, 
namely the Simple Ratchet Method and Compound Ratchet Method. The Simple Ratchet method is suitable for 
customers with stable income, while the Compound Ratchet method is suitable for high-income customers. The 
Annual Ratchet method calculates the benefits to be obtained by the insured by giving a minimum (floor) and 
maximum value (cap) limit by paying attention to the stock price for one year so that it can be used to overcome 
existing problems. 
Research on the calculation of the whole-life insurance premiums of unit links using the Compound Ratchet 
method has not been done so the authors will conduct the research. The stock data used is the daily stock data of PT

Conclusion 
Based on the research that has been done, it can be concluded that: Determining the amount of a single net premium 
for whole-life unit link insurance with the Compound Ratchet method can be done using the formula in Equation 
(20). Based on this equation, the results of the calculation of the single net premium unit unit lifetime insurance for a 
man aged 50 years with the initial share price (𝑆𝑆0) of IDR. 5,900.00 and the number of shares (𝑢𝑢) as many as 1,000 
in four different cases cap values and floor values are in Table 3.1. The higher of the value of the cap and the floor, 
the higher the value of the premium that must be paid because the policy holder has a greater opportunity to get 
more profits from the investment in shares.

Abstract 
Graph coloring problem is to find the minimal number of colors to color vertex of a graph in such a way that every 
two vertex linked by an edge have different colors. A vertex coloring algorithm has been presented. As a result of 
applying vertex coloring algorithm no two vertex are to be allocated in same color if they are adjacent in graph. 
Graph coloring and its generalizations are useful tools in modelling a wide variety of scheduling and assignment 
problems.

1. Introduction
1.1. Vertex Coloring 
       The vertex coloring problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem in graph theory (Jensen, 
Toft, 1994), which is widely used in real life applications like computer register allocation (Chaitin, et.all, 1981), air 
traffic flow management (Barnier and Brisset, 2002), timetabling (de Werra, 1985), scheduling (Giaro and Kubale, 
2009), frequency assignment, and light wavelengths assignment in optical networks (Gamst, 1986). A legal vertex 
coloring of graph G = (V, E), where V(G) is the set of |V | = n vertices and E(G) is the edge set including    |E| = m 
edges, is a function f : V → C from the vertices of the graph G to the color-set C = {c1, c2, . . . , cp} such that f(u) ≠ 
f(v) for all edges (u, v) ∈ E. That is, a legal vertex coloring of G is assigning one of p distinct colors to each vertex of 
the graph in such a way that no two endpoints of any edge are given the same colors (Suyudi et al., 2018; 2017; 
2016). Formally, the vertex coloring problem can be either considered as an optimization problem or as a decision 
problem. The optimization version of the vertex coloring problem is intended to find the smallest number of colors 
by which the graph can be legally colored, and the decision problem aims at deciding for a given p whether or not 
the graph is p-colorable, and is called p-coloring problem (Suyudi et al., 2018; 2017; 2016). 
      It is a way of coloring the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertex share the same color this is called 
a vertex coloring (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/graph coloring)

1. G is a bipartite graph. 
2. There are no odd length cycles in G. 
3. G can be colored with 2 colors. 
 
Proof:(1 ⇒ 2) 
• The vertices of G can be partitioned into 2 sets A and B such that each edge connects a vertex from A with a vertex 
from B. 
• The vertices of any cycle alternate between A and B. 
• Therefore, any cycle must have an even length. 
Proof: 2 ⇒ 3 
• Run BFS on G starting with an arbitrary vertex. 
• Color odd-levels vertices 1 and even-level vertices 2. 
• Tree edges connect vertices with different colors. 
• In a BFS there are no forward and backward edges and a cross edge connects level ℓ with level ℓ′ only if |ℓ − ℓ′| ≤ 
1. 
• If ℓ = ℓ′ + −1 then the cross edge connects vertices with different colors. 
• If ℓ = ℓ′ then the cross edge closes an odd-length cycle contradicting the assumption. 
• Thus, all the edges connect vertices with different colors. 
Proof: 3 ⇒ 1 
• Let A be all the vertices with color 1 and let B be all the vertices with color 2. 
• By the definition of coloring, any edge connects a vertex from A with a vertex from B. 
• Therefore, the graph is bipartite. 
 
5. Conclusions  
 
    The main motive of this paper is to present the new Graph Coloring Algorithm with its space and time 
complexity, this algorithm can be applied to so many applications based on Graph coloring.

Abstract 
The traveling salesman problem is a well known optimization problem. Optimal solutions to small instances can be 
found in reasonable time by linear programming. However, since the TSP is NP-hard, it will be very time 
consuming to solve larger instances with guaranteed optimality. Setting optimality aside, there’s a bunch of 
algorithms offering comparably fast running time and still yielding near optimal solutions. Therefore, in this study 
we will examine the search for solving TSP problem using branch and bound methods.  
Keywords: Traveling Salesman Problem, The Greedy heuristic, Branch and Bound. 
1.
Introduction
The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is to find the shortest hamiltonian cycle in a graph. This problem is NP-hard 
and thus interesting. There are a number of algorithms used to find optimal tours, but none are feasible for large 
instances since they all grow exponentially. 
We can get down to polynomial growth if we settle for near optimal tours. We gain speed, speed and speed at the 
cost of tour quality. So the interesting properties of heuristics for the TSP is mainly speed and closeness to optimal 
solutions (Suyudi et al., 2018; 2017; 2016). 
There are mainly two ways of finding the optimal length of a TSP instance. The first is to solve it optimally and thus 
finding the length. The other is to calculate the Held-Karp lower bound, which produces a lower bound to the 
optimal solution(Johnson and McGeoch 1995). This lower bound is the de facto standard when judging the 
performance of an approximation algorithm for the TSP (Suyudi et al., 2018; 2017; 2016). 
The heuristics discussed here will mainly concern the Symmetric TSP, however some may be modified to handle the 
Asymmetric TSP. When I speak of TSP I will refer to the Symmetric TSP

The following v3 is the most likely to be chosen to expand the next vertex. Now faced with only one vertex that has 
not been traversed, v2. Then the tour is finished so it will return to v1 vertex. So the order of traversal is: 
v1        v9             v8                v6             v7              v5                v4                v3                 v2                 v1 
    87        41          83         48        30         63          28           35           77 
So the total cost of the trip in the graph is: 87 + 87 + 83 + 48 + 30 + 63 + 28 +35 +77 = 492. That means, someone's 
tour starts from the city: 
 
Bandung           Cianjur          Sukabumi         Bogor          Cileungsi          Bekasi          Karawang 
            Cikampaek          Purwakarta           Bandung. 
 
So the total cost of the trip is Rp. 492,000, 00 (Total estimated cost of Premium BBM used throughout the trip). 
 
6. Conclusion  
 
The proposed method, which uses Branch and Bound, is better because it prepares matrices in different steps. At 
each step the matrix costs are calculated. From starting the starting point to knowing that what can be the minimum 
tour fee. Costs at the initial stage are still uncertain but provide some ideas because costs are approached. Each step 
is given a strong reason that which vertex must be passed next from the vertex that has not been passed. In this case 
to provide an expansion of certain vertex costs. So as to provide the total cost of the trip.

Abstract 
In stocks market, investors need a forecasting method which has high accuracy for predicting stock prices. In this 
study, the conventional forecasting method of Double Exponential Smoothing Holt will be compared with the 
modern forecasting method, namely the Fuzzy Time Series method. The Fuzzy Time Series forecasting method used 
in this study is the Cheng model, which used linguistic interval partition and adaptive forecast equation. Through 
this forecast analysis and calculation on PT Bank Central Asia Tbk’s stock price, Fuzzy Time Series forecast 
method has higher accuracy than Double Exponential Smoothing Holt, so Fuzzy Time Series is the best method for 
predicting PT Bank Central Asia Tbk’s stock prices.

1. Introduction
Stocks are securities that include capital in a company or limited liability company. Investors who buy stocks
will face the risk of capital loss partially when the stock prices go down and in the worst case the risk of total loss of 
capital when the issuing stock company is liquidated (Sharpe et al, 1995).Fundamental analysis is used by investors 
for making decisions depend on these sources of company’s information: Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Annual 
Report, Newspaper, Company Announcementsand Industry News (Iqbal et al, 2013). While technical analysis is a 
model through which investors make investment decisions by analyzing company’s stock prices by using market 
data such as stock prices, changes in stock prices, volume of stock trades, and market trends (Neely, 1997). In this 
study, technical analysis is used to forecast stock prices in the months ahead. The forecasting method that can be 
used is the Double Exponential Smoothing Holt and Fuzzy Time Series methods. 
The Double Exponential Smoothing method is a forecasting method that has two parameters from Holt, namely 
the data smoothing parameter (α) and the trend smoothing parameter (γ). The values of α and γ need to be optimized 
so that the best combination is obtained between the two parameters which produces the smallest MAD and 
MAPE.). Fuzzy Time Series method is one of the forecasting methods used to predict time series data based on the 
concept of Fuzzy logic. In the forecasting method of the Fuzzy Time Series, there are three factors that can improve 
the accuracy of forecasting, namely the determination of reliable long interval definitions to determine linguistic

5. Conclusion 
Based on the discussion and the results of comparative analysis of the Fuzzy Time Series and Double Exponential 
Smoothing Holt methods in forecasting the stock price of PT Bank Central Asia Tbk above, it can be concluded that 
the Fuzzy Time Series method is the best forecasting method that produces smaller MAD and MAPE values 
compared to the Double Exponential Smoothing Holt method.

Abstract 
In agricultural farming, the use of conventional seeding process results in waste of time and increase in 
labor. The seed planting rate is slow and the time required for the total operation is long yet the total cost 
is high due to labor and hiring of equipment. Automatic Seed Sowing Machine can dig the ground and 
plant the seeds and cover it afterwards with soil. This undergraduate student project was inspired by 2030 
vision of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia to create more sources of income and to meet local food demands. 
The development of this project will get us a step closer to the kingdom's vision by decreasing manpower 
dependency and increase in production. The project was carried out step by step from conceiving the 
main idea, sketching it on a piece of paper to discuss it within team members, designing each part with 
proper factor of safety, analyzed using 3D SolidWorks, manufactured and assembled as per design, and 
finally tested the prototype successfully. The results were encouraging yet leaving a lot of space for 
improvements such as remote control, solar power supply, and variable distance between seeding 
locations, and configuring the machine with GPS system.

Abstract 
Although hazardous materials (Hazmat) transportation plays an important role in the economy, it has 
always raised authorities’ concerns on the potential risks to humans and the environment. A Hazmat 
accident may impact serious damage to the people within the scope of the incident so in the areas where 
special relief centers do not exist, Hazmat accidents may be more severe. In the present research work, a 
mathematical model for locating the relief and rescue centers has been developed in which the network 
risk coverage is maximized. A procedure has been developed to determine the optimum 
sites for constructing special relief and rescue centers based on Hazmat transport risk. In order to validate 
the proposed model, an experimental intercity road network including 46 nodes and 126 two-way edges 
(252 edges) in the Iranian northern province of Guilan has been selected as the case study. The results 
revealed that solving locating problems in terms of risk coverage and distance coverage have different 
results on location, so local or national authorities who are dealing with Hazmat transport planning should 
be aware on attributes considered for locating rescue and relief centers.

1. Introduction
1.1 Hazmat Transportation 
Developing the urbanization and industries, especially the logistics industry increasingly complicates the movement 
of people and commodities while urban development entails the increased level of demand and the increased 
number of distribution firms in the transportation industry (Ho et al., 2008). One of the most important materials 
carried over the world is known as hazardous material (abbreviated as Hazmat). Every day, millions of tons of goods 
are transported in the transit routes of different countries whilst some of them contain hazardous materials. United 
Nation classifies Hazmat into nine categories: explosives, gases, flammable liquids, oxidizing materials, toxic and 
infectious materials, radioactive materials, corrosive materials, and finally waste products (Environmental Health 
&Safety, 2011). In fact, the impact of the hazardous materials may be due to the heat of combustion or explosion, 
the mechanical effects of the explosion, the toxic effects by breathing, contact with or consumption of toxic 
chemicals due to leakage, and/or the effect of radioactive materials due to ionizing radiation (Mabrouki et al., 2015).

Abstract 
In present scenario manufacturing organizations are facing problem-related to quality, cost, and customer 
satisfaction in the current market. To overcome such situation manufacturing companies are ready to adopt 
continues improvement (CI) techniques which keep them stable in fluctuation in demand as per the market situation. 
Lean Six Sigma (LSS) continues improvement methodology which helps to improve the bottom line result of the 
company with the use of their tools and techniques. The successful implementation of Lean Six Sigma approach 
provides significant improvement in key metrics but deficiency of proper implementation of LSS provides a 
negative effect. To prevent such situation need to have knowledge about their failure factors. The study main 
objective is to assess the Lean Six Sigma critical failure factors (CFFs) for implementing their framework in 
manufacturing organizations. The leading LSS-CFFs for manufacturing organizations situated in India has been 
identified and selected through literature review and experts opinion. The model on LSS critical failure factors has 
been developed using ISM-MICMAC approach. The developed structured model will help LSS practitioners, 
consultants, researchers to anticipate the potential CFFs to implement LSS framework in their organization for 
continues improvement and achieve a leading position in a competitive market.

1. Introduction
Manufacturing organizations is one of the rapid growing sectors in India and it has tremendous impacts in the Indian 
economy. India is 5th largest manufacturer within the globe with total manufacturing value added of over 420 billion 
USD in 2016. The average of seven percent growth has been achieved every year which account 16 to 20 percent 
total GDP in India (The Hindu, Business Line, 2018). Today due to increase in demands for quality products and 
services, manufacturing organizations are continues adopting continues quality improvement approaches such as 
Total Quality Management (TQM), Lean manufacturing (LM), Six Sigma (SS). The Lean manufacturing approach 
is used to eliminate wastes, continuously improve quality, and create value to customers (Grasso, 2005; Fullerton et 
al. 2014; Swarnakar and Vinodh, 2016). Six Sigma is a methodology which highlighted the variation in the 
manufacturing process and helps to reduce them through their statistical tools and techniques (Vinodh and 
Swarnakar, 2015). The combination of these both approaches (Lean Six Sigma) provides extensive benefits to the 
organization and improves the bottom line result. The concept of combining LSS principles began in the middle the 
to late 1990s. The adaptation of the LSS approach maximizes the value of shareholder through continues 
improvement (George and George, 2003). Numerous studies have reported the LSS framework implementation 
benefits such as increase in production utilization rate, reduction in defects, improvement in quality, improve 
production capacity, improvement in key metrics, eliminate non value adding activities (Lee and Wei, 2010; 
Bhuiyan et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2006; Vinodh et al., 2011; Vinodh et al., 2014; Chen and Lyu, 2009; Chakravorty 
and Shah, 2012; Waite, 2013, Swarnakar and Vinodh, 2016)  The successful implementation of LSS framework in a 
manufacturing organization resulted in benefits such as uninterrupted and defect-free production. It also helps to 
achieve a higher degree of competitiveness in a competitive market if implemented successfully. The deficiency of 
proper implementation will achieve the negative effects which cause decrease quality, dissatisfied customers,

7. Limitation and future work  
The ISM model for LSS-CFFs has been developed based on the input data gathered from experts from 
manufacturing organizations. The findings obtained from this study would differ in other organization. This study 
only 12 CFFs has been considered for assessment purpose. In future more no. of CFFs will be considered with 
different MCDM approaches. The model can also be validated through other tools and techniques.

Abstract 
 
The purpose of this paper is to prioritize service quality factors for polytechnic institutes as per student‟s perception 
in the state of Madhya Pradesh India. A total of ten service quality factors were identified from the exhaustive 
literature review and the expert opinion of polytechnic institutions. These service quality factors were prioritized 
using Relative Importance Index technique. The data was collected using convenient sampling technique from the 
students studying in the polytechnic institutions of Madhya Pradesh, India. The findings of the study suggest that 
quality infrastructure, well-qualified faculties and supporting staff, better academic performance and placements are 
the most important service quality factors for improvement of quality in polytechnic institutions. The outcome of 
this research would be helpful to the administration of polytechnic institutions in determining their optimal strategies 
and consequently designing their education policy.

1. Introduction 
Technical Education System has an essential purpose for socio-fiscal expansion in any country. The system not only 
deals with information growth, skill transfer, and cultural exchange but also make an alliance with industries. The 
demand and opportunity in this system comprise the exponential increase in a number of technical institutions 
particularly in the developing countries like India. Also, there exists stiff competition among these institutions to 
attract meritorious students and fill their sanctioned intakes. The only approach available to these institutions is to 
increase the quality of education for gaining more market share. Thus institutions start many lucrative things like a 
collaboration with a foreign university, launching new courses and updating labs with modern facilities-cum 
technologies, recruiting excellent faculties and developing the existing infrastructure. Through these initiatives, the 
institutions try to increase their service quality in all aspect and build their brand image. Consequently, various 
challenges limit the technical institutions to reassess their brand equity and market positioning through sufficient 
control to follow the quality standards of education (Liberatore and Nydick, 1999).  
 
The quality of education comprises numerous extent associated with system-level factors. The enhancement upon 
these extents is mandatory if the institution desires to enhance its efficiency and thus the quality of education is an 
issue of apprehension for technical institutions. It has been studied and recognized quality as a prerequisite and has 
been suggested as a multiplicity of measures for its enhancement. Further technical education in India is divided in 
three major streams namely Industrial Training Institute (at high school level), polytechnic education (after high 
school level or at the intermediate level) and engineering education comprising of graduates and postgraduates (after

This paper reports the importance of ranking associated with the service quality factors in the polytechnic 
institutions situated in Madhya Pradesh, India. It is exceedingly necessary for these institutions to examine their 
services designed for sustainable existence. It would be a challenge intended for the polytechnic institutions to 
afford quality services for the students. The adaptation success of service quality factors in polytechnic education 
institutes would bring quality students having excellent skills and knowledge required by industries and another 
sector for job purpose. However, in quest of ranking these service quality factors, Relative Importance Index was 
used. The result suggested that the most important service quality factors were quality infrastructure, faculty and 
supporting staff and academic performance, placement and career counseling and appropriate physical facilities. The 
result of this study discussed by the authors with a panel of educational experts and the experts validated the 
outcomes based on their experiences. The panel experts are having more than 10 years‟ experience in educational 
quality enhancement field. This research will undoubtedly assist the polytechnic institutions in determining their 
optimal strategies in order to take student perception in increasing the service quality levels of polytechnic 
institutions in Madhya Pradesh, India. 
This research will also help to design quality education model to ensure quality enhancement in polytechnic 
institutions. Further studies for measuring service quality factors may focus on issues of sub criteria‟s effect on 
quality enhancement. The research may expose new aspects of service quality factors in polytechnic institutions for 
quality enhancement and to be integrated into the extent of an attempt to further explore the concept of service 
quality in technical education. However large dataset may be used involving more number of stakeholders like 
faculties, administration, industries to get a clear picture about quality enhancement in polytechnic institutions of 
Madhya Pradesh, India.

hunting algorithms and their applications. We also give an overview about interpretability in 
several key supervised data mining algorithms. This allows for exploring the potential for using 
PRIM, with its interpretation capability, as a core technology towards building a highly accurate 
and interpretable classifier in a mixed data space.

1. Introdudction
With the advent of supervised learning research, several data mining algorithms have been 
developed. Most of the available classification algorithms offer a high accuracy for most problems 
but are unable to provide insight into predictive structure of supervised learning algorithms. 
Furthermore, interpretability is necessary for decision making, especially in the context of sensitive 
application areas such as healthcare, security or sociology. Black box models still need to be 
demystified.  
Machine learning models have reached, today, a high level of accuracy. They have demonstrated 
a great success in learning complex patterns that enable them to make predictions. Thus, using such 
models for predictions requires a high amount of attention to achieve a satisfied level of 
interpretability. However the notion of interpretability leads to confusion since it is unclear how the 
wide array of proposed interpretation methods are related and what common concepts can be used 
to evaluate them.  
Assessing model’s trust was discussed by many authors. In [1], interpretability is considered as 
a way to the model’s trust by providing a transparent reasoning on how it works. Also in [2], the 
same idea was reported with insisting on the importance of intelligibility and modularity.  
In addition to that, many authors addressed the interpretability through its ability to enable 
“action and reaction” by means of results exploratory. In the same context, in [3] and [4] authors 
proposed, respectively, Variables Importance plots and Partial Dependency plots as tools to provide

of the two algorithms on a medical database and discovered that PRIM failed at discovering a subgroup. One 
cause is that PRIM doesn’t handle in an optimal way the ordinal variables.  
Other applications of PRIM has been done in the literature, and it all leads us to guidelines for future 
work. 
3.3 Review of PRIM’s application 
In order to stress PRIM’s shortcomings and limitations in high dimensional data, we briefly present some 
applications in the literature. 
To see how PRIM performs comparing to logistic regression and CART, Abu-Hanna et al. in [35] applied, 
first, PRIM and logistic regression to select high-risk subgroups in very ederly dataset patients. They 
obtained satisfied results for PRIM as it arrives at “bumps” at different regions of the feature space than 
those found by the logistic regression model. And in their second work [32], the authors applied PRIM and 
CART on the same database and noticed that CART performed best because in one peel PRIM did the 
“wrong” choice: since it can peels just a small amount of data (α) if PRIM’s choice is not the optimal one it 
may not be able to recover from its mistake. However the authors aim was to reach the highest level of 
accuracy, without given attention to the interpretability side of the model. 
Also in [36] [37] [38], authors applied PRIM on high dimensional data. The common point between all the 
studies, is the intensive user interaction required by PRIM even if it gives a large amount of tools for 
diagnostic to the data analyst. Nevertheless, from those paper we notice that PRIM is weak in providing us 
with a satisfied degree of interpretability. 
4. Conclusion and Guidelines 
This paper highlights the intense need of interpretability in today’s ML. Indeed, ML have reached a high 
level of accuracy but still miss the same level of interpretability. Therefore, the numerous data mining 
algorithms could give different models with a various complexity.  
After presenting key classification supervised data mining algorithms, we have focused on PRIM, a bump 
hunting algorithm. Although PRIM presents several advantages, studies in literature have revealed several 
of its limitations. Researchers have highly participated in improving some PRIM’s shortcomings [29] [30] 
[31] [33] [34]. Nevertheless, the huge amount of rules provided in high dimensional data still requires both 
the data analyst and the expert analysis and interaction. Thus, the interpretability relies on decision makers 
input and interaction. 
This paper is a first step for us to set the problem of interpretability in PRIM and guides us to future work 
in the same perspective with the aim of integrating PRIM in a supervised learning context to give rise to 
interpretable classification models.

Abstract 
Nowadays, increase in the prevalence of preventable viruses, age-related treatments and similar health 
problems that are transmitted by non-organic nutrients or environmental factors, escalate drug usage. To 
meet this accelerated request, a pharmacy typically store pharmaceutical products and their equivalences 
in their depots before being sold to the customer. Therefore, several problems may rise about the stock of 
the original drug and its equivalence such as non-optimal storing of products in depots, lack of storage 
space, shortening of product life, and cost of medical waste in non-resale products. In this study, a general 
continuous review inventory model with backorders and equivalences, which is not in the literature, has 
been proposed. A case  from a big pharmacy is analyzed  by using realistic parameters in order to show 
the efficiency of the model in real life inventory systems. The results confirm that the proposed model is 
very accommodating to minimize inventory cost with optimized order quantities and reorder points.

Abstract 
Performing well in developing production industry is an important factor for companies to survive and sustain a 
competitive edge in the current turbulent business environment. The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of 
learning orientation on innovation performance with the mediating role of operations strategy (cost, quality, flexibility, 
and delivery). Environmental uncertainty plays a moderator role in this model. Using a questionnaire to measure 
variables, data were collected from 243 UK production companies. Structural Equations Modelling used for data 
analysis and hypothesis testing. The results support 9 out of thirteen research hypotheses.  Learning orientation 
influences innovation performance and two dimensions of operations strategy (delivery and quality) mediates this 
relationship. Also, environmental uncertainty positively moderates the relationship between quality and flexibility 
strategies with innovation performance.

Abstract
Conventional manufacturing processes depend on the principle of removal of materials, which involves
non-linear materials processing and have waste material left after the manufacturing is completed.
However, there was always a desire to manufacture products in such a way that the wastage reduces to
zero. The concept of additive manufacturing, in the form of 3D printing, made a breakthrough in this
direction and has attracted the attention of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. 3D printing has
opened  new  opportunities  in  terms  of  manufacturing  possibilities  and  shifted  the  manufacturing
paradigms. This capstone design project aimed to in-house design, fabricate and test a 3D printer. A
design was developed consisting of sets of screws, BLDC motors and one CNC controller controlled with
Mach3 software. Our printer uses BLDC motors due to significantly higher levels of accuracy and
efficiency as compared to the current practice of using stepper motor. Moreover, we used ball screws
instead of the lead screws as they provide smoother, quieter, and efficient motion. These components
make this design a novel one that has potential to compete with other 3D printers. Finally, the printer is
tested to see if this creative combination can be used to advance this manufacturing process.

1. Introduction
Once a machine or device fails and requires repairing, the company maintains inventory of spare parts, which is a
relatively expensive process. If the inventory is not maintained, then the order process for required parts will result
in work delays. Therefore, a quick solution is need as a temporary solution until the spare parts arrive. These are one
of the few problems faced by industries, which led to the development of Additive Manufacturing (AM) that
precisely produces the required part of the product in a short time and low cost through layer by layer deposition of
materials (Industry 2014). 3D printing is an upcoming revolution of the industrial prototyping and manufacturing
that encourages and drives innovations for small companies and even individuals. The development process of the
3D printing technologies is shown in Table 1.

6. Conclusion
 
A 3D printer is designed in this final year project based on FDM process. Initially, four different concepts were
generated following a set of design specifications. The final concept was developed through a selection process and
combining the good features from others. It had the print bed moving linearly along Y-axis while the print head
moves along the other two axes. In detail design calculations, decisions were made to select a component based on
design calculations or manufacturing by ourselves in the workshops. Standard parts like motors and controller were
selected and bought online. A CNC controller was used to control all movements and the filament feed. Load
determination and safety calculations for the housing and the printer structure were done and found to be safe. All
the standard parts and fabricated parts were then assembled to build the 3D printer. Finally, a dry run was done to
test the complete motion system of the printer. Once the dry run was successful, the printer was finally assembled
and then tested by modeling an object on SolidWorks® software and then printing it using our 3D printer. After
couple of unsuccessful attempts and error debugging processes, the printer worked excellently to print different
products. It was noted that the printer can print simple to moderately complex objects with exact dimensions but for
complicated models it needs better nozzle. The surface roughness of the printed objects varies with its complexity.
Furthermore, the printer was tested to print the same object multiple times with different colors, and it was found to
have an excellent repeatability.

Abstract 
Growing trend of market competition and higher customer demands with more preferences are creating a complex 
scenario within global business environment. Today’s greater product variety, shorter product life cycle and  lower 
production costs are pushing companies to look beyond their own boundaries, thereby, creating complexity in the 
management of the supply chain. Supply chain complexity creates uncertainties and disruptions, thereby reducing the 
performance of the entire supply chain. Although dealing with complexity is not easy, various studies have shown that 
if managed well, it leads to better supply chain performances. To manage complexity, the management should 
understand the associated complexity drivers and level of supply chain complexity. This research identifies twenty-
two complexity drivers of supply chain. Further, the study proposes integrated AHP and Grey relational analysis to 
quantify the level of supply chain complexity based on the identified drivers. A case study from a multinational 
company is illustrated to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, and the practical implication of the 
results obtained is discussed. Results show that the supply chain complexity level of the case company is low, 
signifying that there is a huge scope of improvement in the case company in terms of managing complexity. Moreover, 
results show that the case company mainly needs improvement in “internal communication and information sharing,” 
and “compatibility of SC network” to minimize complexity in their supply chain.

Abstract 
The iron and steel industry plays a major role in the growth and development of modern societies, and is an intensive 
consumer of energy. Manufacturers facing fierce market competition and increased customer awareness about 
environmental problems and efficient use of natural resources and energy for sustainability, strive for material, energy, 
and costs reduction to maintain competitiveness. Implementing lean manufacturing methodology is a sound way to 
achieve this aim. This study investigates the prospective effect of lean practices on improving productivity within a 
deformed rolled bar steel manufacturing facility. The adopted methodology is data-driven based on various lean and 
quality tools as Value Stream Mapping (VSM), the 5 Whys technique, and Pareto Analysis. The application of lean 
tools aid in identifying the major causes of losses and may help in increasing productivity and reducing waste in 
energy consumption. Recommended actions may also contribute in decreasing the stoppage time and the risk of 
equipment damage. By applying the same approach to the whole production line, additional waste reductions in both 
material and energy are expected.

1 Introduction 
The iron and steel industry is considered a primary industry as it provides input for different other dependent industries 
such as construction, housing, infrastructure, consumer goods and automotive. According to the World Steel 
Association, by 2050, steel usage is expected to be 1.5 times higher than the present levels in order to meet the needs 
of a growing population (Worldsteel 2018).  Steel production is a chain of major processes applied to scrapped steel 
or iron ore in order to get deformed bars or wire rod coils. Rolling process is used for mass production of long steel 
products as rebar, wire rod, sections, rails, angles and flat products. Cobble is considered a major defect causing a 
large amount of losses in steel production. It occurs due to abnormalities in rolling conditions. This defect causes loss 
in production, equipment damage, and major delays in the mill. 
Lean manufacturing is a philosophy of production that targets minimizing the use of resources throughout the 
manufacturing process. It involves identifying and eliminating waste, which is defined as any activity that does not 
add value from the customer’s perspective. There are 8 types of wastes: overproduction, waiting, unnecessary 
transportation, over processing, excess inventory, unnecessary movement, defects, and unused human potentials 
(Khaba and Bhar 2018). The most commonly used lean manufacturing tools are: value stream mapping (VSM), 
standardized work, 5S (sort, set in order, shine, standardize, sustain), single minute exchange of dies (SMED) (Cudney 
and Elrod 2011). Not all lean manufacturing tools lend themselves to the application to continuous production 
processes. VSM is a versatile tool that highlights the source of waste and helps making target area of improvements 
visible. It uses a flow diagram to depict every step of a process. VSM focuses mainly on identifying waste, reducing 
manufacturing time and making the manufacturing process more efficient. Recently, VSM scope has been extended 
to include energy and water to reflect the objective of sustainable manufacturing (Cheung 2017). Furthermore, the 5 
Whys technique is considered an effective lean tool used to determine the root cause of a problem.  
This paper focuses on identifying and reducing waste in material and energy in the steel industry with the help of lean 
manufacturing tools. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a review of the 
applications of lean manufacturing tools within various industries; Section 3 describes the proposed methodology;

Conclusion and Future work 
Lean manufacturing has been extensively used to identify and eliminate waste in industrial facilities. The application 
of VSM in conjunction with the 5 whys technique and other quality control techniques may resulted in savings in 
material and energy in steel plants. The proposed methodology results in identifying the main causes of losses and 
thus may help in saving 0.56 % of total monthly production from the lost billets as a result of cobbles that occur at 
one of the most critical locations in the rolling line. Furthermore, a potential saving of 26.9% of natural gas 
consumption, an increase in production by 7.58%, and a decrease in stoppage time may be achieved. These results 
obtained by recommended actions between 2 guides only. By applying the same approach to other rolling guides, 
additional savings are expected. The approach is data-driven, yet no extra data collection is needed, it relies on data 
collected for production and quality control which is readily available. The future work is to extend the value stream 
map to account for all types of energy and water consumption.

Abstract 
Energy recovery by appropriate management of solid waste from municipal can be the solution to sustainable 
waste management as well as providing energy security in Bangladesh. However, the choice of appropriate waste 
to energy technology is a complex and challenging issue as a widespread variety of environmental, economic and 
social controlling criteria need to be identified and investigated. In this paper an Analytic Hierarchical Process is 
used to find the most preferable waste to energy technology by evaluating environmental, economic and technical 
criteria. The technologies considered were anaerobic digestion, gas recovery from landfill and incineration. 
Conducting a qualitative and quantitative assessment a preference ranking is produced which concluded that 
anaerobic digestion is the preferred technology for Bangladesh based on cost, benefit and environmental risk. We 
believe this study will provide a guideline for waste to energy decision makers in Bangladesh alongside with other 
similar developing countries.

1. Introduction
In the developing economy of Bangladesh, the energy consumption, mainly in the form of electricity, has 
experienced a rapid and significant increase over the last few decades (w to e report). Energy generation is mostly 
based on conventional energy sources for instance natural gas (75%), fuel (18%) and coal (2%) (Bangladesh 
power development board, 2011). Although the country is still disposing of natural reserves, mainly in term of 
natural gas, the dependence to importation is high and the energy sector is subjected to market volatility. 
Moreover, the energy sector of Bangladesh is a matter of great concern because of its generous contribution to 
greenhouse effect and global warming. Through this observation, it is obvious for Bangladesh to diversify the 
energy sector with the implementation of alternative solutions based on unconventional energy source.  
In parallel of that, the increasing urbanization coupled with the change in consumption patterns thousands of tons 
of waste is generated every day throughout the country. Waste generation rate of Bangladesh varies from 0.25 to 
0.56 kg per person per day (BBS,2013). Sometimes those are dumped in landfills, but mostly illegally dumped in 
law land besides streets, riversides and households. Management of solid waste is becoming a major concern for 
Bangladesh and represents a social, environmental and technical challenge. Based on these different 
considerations, generation of energy by treating these wastes with appropriate technology is an alternative solution 
for both energy and appropriate management of solid waste. 
But the selection of technology to convert waste into energy is a complex problem as physiochemical parameters 
of solid waste from municipal is different in each area. Waste management should include environmental and 
economic criteria (Berger et al., 1999). Different researchers have investigated impact of environment from 
different waste to energy technology as well as economic criteria. (Antopoulos et al. 2014, Finnveden et al. 1995, 
2005). Researchers have reviewed previous studies regarding waste to energy technology and found that MCDA 
can be an effective analyzing tool to access quantitative data and qualitative data regarding waste management. 
In MCDA experts selects important criteria (such as environmental, economic, social) then weights these by

6. Conclusion 
 
Success and sustainability of a waste to energy conversion technology largely depend on the communities 
economic and social status. This study evaluates and compares three technologies for waste conversion from 
MSW in Bangladesh. Based on the analysis it can be said, incineration produces similar benefit as landfill gas 
recovery. But the cost and risk is much higher than anaerobic digestion and landfill gas recovery. This is due to 
the unsuitability of the waste stream and increase of capital cost and operation cost due to unsuitable socio-
economical condition as skilled labor needed to be imported for lacking in Bangladesh. The risk factor is highest 
due to the lack of environmental regulation. On the other hand, landfill gas recovery requires the least cost but the 
benefit is fairly low from anaerobic digestion. The risk factor difference between these two bio-thermal method 
is fairly close because of similar mechanism, but as Bangladesh falls in the tropical region with high precipitation 
and high water table, landfill poses some threat of water pollution from leaching. Considering all three factor of 
CBR, anaerobic digestion is the most preferable for Bangladesh with highest benefit and lowest risk. The cost 
factor is slightly high due to pretreatment requirement of waste segregation. This cost can be reduced by 
incorporating at source separation of biodegradable and non-bio degradable waste. Thus it can be concluded that 
anaerobic digestion with source separation will be the best solution for Bangladesh municipal waste management 
and energy generation from MSW.

Abstract 
The vision of Industry 4.0 accentuates the global networks of machines in a smart factory setting capable 
of autonomously exchanging information and controlling each other. This cyber physical system allows the 
smart factory to operate autonomously. Fourth industrial revolution or better known as Industry 4.0 (I4.0) 
is changing the manufacturing industry. However, the change is not limited to manufacturing sector, but 
also to the field that are linked with it. One of the field that is changing with I4.0 is supply chain. Therefore, 
it is important to know about the current trends, opportunities, and challenges associated with the advent of 
this pioneer revolution. This paper explores the supply chain in context of I4.0. Current state of the art of 
this field, and the future prospects have been investigated in this work.

1. Introduction
The evolution of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) has proven being fruitful in providing several business benefits including 
operational optimization and value chain optimization (Strange & Zucchella, 2017). I4.0 is an amalgamation of digital 
technology with the manufacturing, which transmutes the industrial production to next level. With the arrival of cyber 
physical systems (CPS) into the manufacturing domain, the concept of I4.0 evolves. Basically, it was originated and 
nurtured by the German manufacturing sectors. However, at present every nation is investing in this pioneer 
technology and all the big firms are adopting it (Bag et al., 2018). The fundamental platform for the success of this 
technology is the revolution in technologies that consists of Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data analytics and Cloud 
Computing in the CPS side, and advanced materials, additive manufacturing, and smart robotics in the manufacturing 
side. I4.0 will change the complete production, operations and maintenance of products, and services through 
connected components, machines, and humans. With the effect of I4.0, the industrial production systems are 
anticipated to perform 30% faster than before and 25% more efficient (Gerbert et al., 2015). The first industrial 
revolution was driven through steam power that transformed lives of people. The second industrial revolution was 
driven through electricity and communication, production line, enabling just in-time operations and production lines

3. Discussion, Conclusions and Recommendations 
 
The digitization of the supply chain empowers organizations to address the new requirements of the customers, the 
challenges on the supply side as well as the remaining expectations in efficiency improvement. Digitization brings 
about a Supply Chain 4.0, which will be faster, more flexible, more granular, more accurate, and more efficient.  The 
potential impact of Supply Chain 4.0 in the next two to three years is huge - up to 30 percent lower operational costs 
and a reduction of 75 percent in lost sales while decreasing inventories by up to 75 percent are expected, at the same 
time increasing the agility of the supply chains significantly. The characteristics of the supply chain 4.0 are shown in 
figure 7.

Transparency – Complete view and monitoring of supply chain 
Communication – Information is available to all members of supply chain simultaneously 
Collaboration – Natural development of collaboration with customers as well as suppliers 
Flexibility – End customer demand changes can be rapidly assessed 
Responsiveness – Real time response on planning and execution level (across all levels to demand changes) 
Interoperability – Works with various platforms, and technology type 
 
Supply chain 4.0 is the future, and one should invest wisely in this domain. The delivery will be made through drones 
and autonomous vehicles; orders will be placed online, and customers will have full flexibility in terms of material 
and product specifications. Changes in the order will be made by the customers can be dealt in the more efficient way 
if all the machines and human involved in the supply chain are connected and real time monitoring and tracking is 
enabled. Therefore, to deal with the future demand and supply, it is important to digitize the various levels of supply 
chain.

Abstract 
Indonesia has not been separated from the problem of remaining washing in the amalgamation process of 
gold mining which is classified as still containing heavy metals, especially mercury (Hg). If the dangerous 
Hg heavy metal is wasted into the environment, it can cause various problems in the environment and 
especially can threaten human life. Disorders caused include lumps, tumors, nerve damage, brain damage, 
and even death. Therefore, it is necessary to handle gold mining waste before being disposed of to 
eliminate Hg content, so that gold mine waste is no longer dangerous for humans or the environment. 
Meanwhile, on the other hand there was a long-standing event which until now and was considered a 
disaster, namely Lapindo mudflow. The purpose of this study was to find out how to reduce the content of 
heavy metal Hg produced from the amalgamation process of gold mining by adding activated sludge by 
HCl. The activation of the Lapindo mud causes the impurity mineral component that cannot function as a 
binding group of heavy metal ions which leaves a lot of pore in the mud. Increasing the number of pores 
causes the surface area of the touch field of mud which has an active group of silanol. This results in a 
greater and more effective absorption of Hg heavy metal ions. Heavy metal ions will be trapped in the 
pores of the mud which have many active silanol groups. The more silica found on the surface of the 
touch field, the more heavy metals can be absorbed during the adsorption process. In this study qualitative 
and quantitative tests were carried out on the effect of using activated sludge from Lapindo mud on the 
binding of active ingredients from heavy metals Hg. Analysis of qualitative data is done by observing the 
presence of white deposits formed as a result of the qualitative test. Quantitative data analysis is carried 
out by weighing the white sediment formed. This study was also supported by a SEM test to observe the 
surface morphology of HCl activated sludge material. Based on the results of the study, it was found that 
the greater the concentration of HCl activator, the greater the binding capacity of the sludge to heavy 
metals Hg. According to the results obtained in this study, the best HCl concentration as a Lapindo mud 
activator is 0.4 M. Because the activated sludge with this treatment has the best ability to absorb heavy 
metals Hg up to 96,06 %. This is in line with the SEM test which shows that Lapindo mud which is 
activated by 0.4 M HCl has a large amount of pore so that it can absorb Hg heavy metals.

1. Introduction
Mining technology is indeed progressing, but often the impact of waste on the environment is often not noticed.
One of the hazardous waste producers that can damage the environment is the waste from the gold mining industry 
(Halimah, 2003). This waste has considerable potential in improving pollutants in the environment. In the process of 
extracting gold in mining, mercury is currently still used as its main ingredient (Diaz, 2000). If the mercury is released 
into the water around the mine it will certainly be able to flow into the river, even to the sea. Bioaccumulation of Hg

2[=Si(-O-H)2]n + Hg2+ → [=Si-O-Hg-O-Si=]n + 2H+ 
The bond type that occurs between atoms in these complex is covalent bond. Covalent bond is belongs to very 
strong bond. This causes the complex compound become stable and hard to be re-ionized, thus the heavy metal ions 
will be adsorbed perfectly. 
The activation of Lapindo mud causes impurity mineral component cannot binds the heavy metal ions, thus 
leaves a lot of pore in the mud. Increasing the number of pores increases the mud surface area which have silanol 
active group. this results in a greater and more effective absorption of Hg ions. Heavy metal ions will trapped in the 
mud pores that have a lot of silanol active group. The more silica that found on the surface area, the more heavy 
metals can be absorbed during the adsorption process. 
 
3.4 Atomic Adsorbance Spectofotometer (AAS) Test 
The test using Atomic Adsorbance Spectofotometer (AAS) to find supporting data from reducing mercury ions 
concentration along with increasing HCl activator concentration in each treatment quantitatively. Thus the 
relationship between HCl activator concentration and Lapindo mud absorption capacity that has been activated by 
HCl will be found. Based on testing, the quantitative and qualitative data obtained as follows:

Based on data above can be inferred that concentration of mercury ions decreases as long as HCl activator 
concentration increase. This following table shows decreasing ions concentration along with increasing HCl 
activator concentration.

Based on graph above can be inferred that the greater HCl concentration, the greater decreasing mercury ions 
concentration, or in another words absorption capacity of mercury ions by activated mud is getting bigger. Based on 
these data also can be known that the decreasing mercury ions concentration in the greater amount is known at the 
greater activator concentration 0.4 M.

4.1 Conclusios 
Based on the result and discussion, it can be concluded that heavy metal (Hg) level in gold mining waste can 
be reduced by adding activated mud by HCl, which the concentration affects the surface area of mud. The greater 
concentration of HCl activator, the smaller mud pores, but the number of pores getting bigger so that the activation 
process of Lapindo mud,  shows that the greater concentration of HCl, the greater capacity of mud binds the heavy 
metal (Hg). Based on this study, the best HCl concentration as an activator of Lapindo mud is 0.4 M. 
 
4.2 Recommendations 
It is recommended for researches and reviewers about this material by conduct the research 
to know absorption capacity  from Lapindo mud that has been activated by HCl and applying the 
adsorbent that has been developed in society so that problem of detergent-waste can be solved.

1. Introduction 
The use of natural stones such as granite and marble has tremendously increased over the years in whole world. Granite 
in particular is widely used as building material due to its strength and unique natural patterns with attractive 
decorative properties. As far as India is concerned, it is one of the largest producers and exporters of granite in the 
world. At present, India serves a contribution of around 15% of the global production. India has more than 100 varieties 
of colourful granite produced and explored. At present machining and processing of natural stones are generally 
carried out by conventional machining processes like diamond multi-wire sawing and blade sawing. With the growing 
use of natural stones as a construction material, there is an increasing demand on the new machining and processing 
technologies to improve productivity and reduce costs. As an advance manufacturing technology, a non-conventional 
technique abrasive water jet machining has been widely used by industries for machining and processing of granite 
stones. Due to its high advantages such as no thermal damages and highly versatile to cut different materials, small 
cutting forces it is increasingly accepted by the industries (Aydin et al. 2011). AWJM is an abrasive blasting 
machining process that uses abrasives propelled by a high velocity water pressure to erode material from the 
workpiece.  
Karakurt et al. (2010) used abrasive water jet machining for studying depth of cut and kerf width in granite cutting by 
taking into consideration traverse speed, abrasive flow rate, standoff distance, abrasive size and water pressure. They 
concluded that the traverse speed is the most significant process parameter affecting the cut depth of granite whereas 
standoff distance and abrasive flow rate are highly effective parameters on kerf width. Riverio et al. (2015) used CO2 
laser using supersonic nozzle for cutting 10 mm Zimbabwe black granite stone. Gupta et al. (2014) studied 
minimization of kerf taper angle and kerf width using Taguchi’s method in abrasive water jet machining of marble

4. Conclusions 
The present work attempted to find optimum process parameters for granite cutting using AWJM method. Taguchi’s 
L9 orthogonal array was used to design the experiments. Following conclusion was withdrawn from the work: 
1. ANOVA analysis results revealed that the traverse speed was the most significant process parameter affecting MRR 
during granite cutting. 
2. Further, S/N ratio analysis revealed optimum process parameters as water pressure 280 MPa, SOD 5 mm, and 
traverse speed 100 mm/min.

Abstract 
In the present age of e-commerce, mobile penetration has risen to a significant level and can be seen as it grows 
exponentially in the past decade. The mobile application has opened up a new sense of customer service. With an 
increase of these applications, researchers have inclined their interest towards development and identify various 
issues linked to it. This study focuses on accumulating a vast academic literature in a time frame of the last ten 
years. A comprehensive and systematic literature review was done in the emerging area of mobile application 
development. After the process of reviewing the extensive literature from the biggest database ‘Scopus’, a total 
of 26 relevant journal papers were considered for the review after multiple steps of filtrations. This paper gives 
the scope and the direction in the field of mobile development and helps the organization to have a vast knowledge 
regarding the same. The findings of this study provide valuable insights and future recommendations in this 
developing field.

1.0 Introduction 
The introduction of mobiles and applications in the various fields has ushered in a revolution in the last decade. 
The initial usage was in the advertising, marketing and various service sectors, later it got expanded into various 
sectors like healthcare and insurance leaving no industry and organization untouched. The exponential pace of 
application development encouraged research community to understand all vertices in niche. Past researcher (Lee 
et al.,2014) proposed a framework that takes into account the vitality productive execution of mobile applications 
by mostly loading the workload of a mobile device into a clever cloud. The framework contains a development 
toolkit, which encourages the development of mobile applications fit for supporting computation loading, and a 
runtime infrastructure for the organization in the cloud. Miravet et al. (2013) developed a device-independent 
mobile application generation (DIMAG), a framework which demonstrates how the final detail of client-server 
mobile applications can be a proper way for creating both customer and server sides of native applications. Yusop

3.0 Discussion and conclusion 
 
The need and want for the custom mobile application development is genuine, yet numerous undertakings are 
finding that testing on various fronts like, from the mobile development procedure to choosing the best 
methodology to make the mobile application successful. For a successful implementation, endeavours ought to 
have the best possible development process including prerequisite social event, structure, development, quality 
affirmation, dispatch, and support. The mobile application development ought to be strategized thinking about 
exhibitions, adaptation, client commitment, and so forth. What's more, challenges like security, UI/UX and 
execution v/s battery ought to be defeated to make the application successful.  
With the aim to assess the current state of practice for the mobile application development we are developing a 
leave management system app. The proposed leave management system app will make the whole leave 
management process efficient. There will be no paperwork as users in an organization can apply for leave through 
the app. Users will now be able to know their leave status. The employees can apply for leave from their home 
also. For security, users have to first login through their user-id and password which will be sent on the server. 
The server will then authenticate the data with the stored database. This supporting app will help the management 
in decision making in case of leave related affairs.

Abstract 
While technology is evolving to be more patient oriented to provide a better care for them. How the e-
Health works from process view is a bit uncertainty about how. Many security questions need to be solved 
before using an e-Health as a tool for a wide range of people. There is also a one about e-Health itself. Field 
of e-Health is gaining more and more attention considering we are going through industry revolution 4.0. 
Research provides process perspective on this issue including a risk analysis together with structured process 
map from patient/user to his social worker for example doctor, nurse or other medical personnel. This model 
should serve as a basic template for better understanding and easier implementing an e-Health almost 
anywhere. 
Keywords: e-Health, Process, Modeling, Risk Analysis, Industry 4.0 
1. Introduction
Fourth industrial revolution is a keyword in many current research papers. This term has impact on different areas
of our life. One example is healthcare services. The current literature discusses this issue under a term e-Health. The 
e-Health is being mode and more popular to provide quality and less expensive healthcare service [1]–[4]. The
implementation of the e-health concept represents not only the implementation of an appropriate information
infrastructure, but also a description of the processes that will be implemented within the framework of digitized
agendas. Therefore, an example of development a process model will be the subject of this article
On the other hand, many applications for e-Health Internet connection and accessing medical data through a 
secure platform immediately. Medical data of users, doctors and healthcare companies are a big target of focus 
concerning their security and privacy. This creates a wide area of research, where mostly a security and privacy issues 
are solved.  
Currently, the issue is not solved by many e-health related processes in present research. Focus of this work is to 
propose a process model of e-Health communication, how it works, what risks it involves and how it contributes to 
quality management system. So when you want to improve something you have to start at a model. This process model 
is completely explained later in paper. Second part is a brief example of e-health security problematic parts. It is not 
possible to cover every aspect, framework, communication or certain part of e-Health by this work. Mentions about 
those aspects are for pointing out their existence. 
Last part is a risk analysis based on process model. Tables in this work shows vulnerability and their score from 
a subjective point of view. The next table follows the vulnerability table and shows a qualitative risk analysis. From 
this table a complete risk analysis created together with risk management plan which is explained. 
Main issue solved in this paper is to show a more detailed model of communication between patient, doctor and 
healthcare company. Based on this model and data which were obtained by interviews there is a risk analysis which 
focuses on threats and vulnerabilities and measures to them. 
2. Literature review
Many articles mentioned issue about e-Health in relation with information security and data protection [1],
[3], [4]. Although all of them are focused on same topic, everyone is giving a new perspective. In first article is a
security framework for authentication and data transmission. Framework consists of protocol architecture, which

In this section will be about detailed description of risk analysis in tables above. The most important is the final 
table where the assets, threats and risks with precaution and also a responsible person.  
First asset for evaluation is electronic records. They contain a personal data about assigned doctor, patients 
personal and their treatment data. Threats that are possible to happen to electronic records are data leakage, equipment 
and employee failure and infection of the terminal/network. Data leakage in electronic record is one of the most 
problematic one because it is a very complex one. It can happen by unintentionally or deliberately both doctors and 
patient by their terminal where medical personnel and assistant or social worker have access. Unintentionally means 
that data leaked through attack or virus that was downloaded or uploaded by accident. There should be a control in 
form of monitored access with permission for everyone that can access it and with extra firewall and antivirus. The 
next thing is if equipment is not working in terms of power failure and this results in the unavailability of medical data. 
In those critical points there should be a secondary power supply to power them up and keep communication chain 
active. 
Another valuable asset is a data store, which can be both cloud storage and local. Both have the possibility of 
overheating because they need to be properly cooled. Overheating can lead to data unavailability, loss or inaccessibility 
of information. Exact threats, which can occur, can be failure of the cooling device. To prevent that from happening, 
there should be monitoring system that can warn supervisor that system server or hard disk is overheating. As a 
prevention to data leakage some form of backup to external company for all data. When infection occurs either of 
terminal or whole network there could be a case of virus that deletes data or somehow modifies them and eventually 
can erase them.  
That leads to another threat which through virus can rise to the occasion infect and influence our data. This threat 
can come through the software. Prohibition of installing third party software without permission to the computer should 
prevent from this to happen. Training should be introduced as a complement to this measure. 
Prevention to same threat but in terms of hardware is to implement checkpoints of external devices and together 
with that prohibit connecting external devices to computer. 
Last and very important part is a healthcare company. Their access to data is quite extensive and chance of a 
threat is very high. Precaution for infecting a communication network or a terminal (terminal is a local PC in the 
company) is quite similar to threats with connection to infecting. An extended antivirus and spyware control of emails 
should be in place together with employee training whit what their actions could do. Equipment failure for healthcare 
company could mean failure to deliver order within a given deadline. 
 
5. Conclusion 
This paper tried to introduce the issue e-Health in context of process modeling and risk management. Major 
contribution of this work is a non-technical point of view on problematic in e-Health. Firstly, a process model of 
communication between patient, doctor and healthcare company for e-Health has been described. E-Health is gaining 
more and more attention to be a subject of study from security point of view. Quality management now can start 
continuous improvements to a proposed model. This sets a capability maturity model to a level 3 because this paper 
defined a process of communication in e-Health. 
Secondly, this work contains a risk analysis of mentioned model. Risk analysis is based on model that is proposed 
and together with this, there are three tables that shows how certain risks were assessed. First table is for assessing 
asset value and threats that can occur. Second table shows a qualitative risk analysis and this table gives foundation to 
a risk management plan. Risk management plan consists of threats, risks and measures how to manage risks. 
The possibilities of implementing process management and risk management as an essential element of the E-
health concept will be the subject of further research.

Abstract 
Productivity is not just about doing more, it is about creating more impact with less resources, and it can be 
achieved only by intelligent planning and sustained hard work. Employee productivity play a vital role in any 
organization, it is biggest challenge to sustain with low operating cost and manpower cost with high profit margin 
in such competitive environment. This paper illustrate the journey to improve employee productivity and resource 
optimization approach in a pharmaceutical industry. The entire exercise consists study of existing process and 
manpower deployment pattern, identify the redundancy and bottlenecks in the current system, manpower 
benchmarking and comparison exercise and proposed standard manpower with skill enhancement framework. 
Industrial engineering tools and techniques being applied in the data collection and process mapping exercise. 
Study has been conducted in the pharmaceutical processes like- Granulation, Compression and Coating and 
packaging. This paper also includes a skill enhancement framework to make the operatives multi skilled, thereby 
allowing them to work in different departments flawlessly.

1. Introduction
In the journey to improve employee productivity, it is important to have a robust structure of manpower planning 
which should ensure adequate supply, proper quality and quantity as well as effective utilization. It is the process 
by which management determines how an organization should move from its current manpower position to its 
desired manpower positions with the objective of less resources with high productivity Manpower planning helps 
the organisation to tap talents efficiently which will help to achieve both the individual and organisational goal. 
This will consequently minimise some of the problems associated with absenteeism and labour turn- over. 
Moreover, the process of manpower planning includes analysis of skill level in the organisation (skill inventory), 
analysis of expected and current vacancies due to discharges, transfers, promotions; sick leaves, absence on other 
reasons.  
This manpower planning exercise is divided into two parts:-  
(a) Standard manpower mapping Exercise:
•
Identify the current manpower (operatives) numbers in each area like-Granulation, Compression,
Coating in Plant-1.
•
Study the current occupancy of the machines and workload.
•
Benchmarking and comparison of manpower against the equipment capacity with other units and
industries.
•
Identify the gaps in current manpower deployment and conduct a Time and motion study, DILO study
(Day in a life of officer/operator/ helper) and Man M/c study, SMED to identify the current utilization
of manpower.

Critical parameters and machines were also mapped and a training plan of 3 months is prepared for the upskilling 
of the operatives. (Critical parameters are not mentioned due to company confidentiality)  
The Planned Training deployment for operatives is as follows, The L0 operatives can observe and learn the critical 
parameters, making their progress quicker than usual 
9. CONCLUSION:-
As, stated in the beginning, manpower planning is the process by which management determines how an
organization should move from its current manpower position to its desired manpower positions. Which
eventually help the organization to sustain in terms of optimum utilization of resources, employee productivity
improvement, manpower for casting with proper recruitment plan, Skill enhancement and career progression
roadmap etc. Based on the study done and proposed optimum manpower with a concrete skill enhancement
framework, there has been 15% saving in the manpower numbers and 10% reduction in the cost. Moreover it
helps in succession planning of existing operatives with proper road map on career progression. Training plan has
been shared for all the current identified skills and implemented successfully. The best practices of this study has
been shred with other pharma plants and horizontal deployment in under execution. Apparently this also helped
the production planning team and human resources team to work together to plan the current and future resources
at optimum level.

Abstract 
Agriculture wastes are generated in large quantities as well as Industrial wastes, disposing these waste 
materials are gradually becoming major challenge globally. This study examined the impacts of locally 
available additives, which doubles as wastes material like Sawdust as well as Palm kernel Shell as means 
of stabilizing the soil of Ido Osi Local Government, Ekiti, Southwestern part of Nigeria. Soil samples were 
obtained from six different locations from the study area. The two additives were mixed with the soil 
samples at 2 – 8% proportion and laboratory tests like Compaction as well as California Bearing Ratio 
(CBR) tests were conducted on them. It can be deduced from the results that CBR and Optimum Moisture 
Content (OMC) worth decline as the additive contents rise in most of the soil samples, While the Maximum 
Dry density (MDD)  worth decline as the additive contents rise for most of the samples. Generally, it can 
be concluded that the two additives have effects on the strength properties of the soil samples from the 
study area. Though, it requires profound research works on the additives.

Introduction 
Construction industries depend on deeply on conventional resources like sand, cement, and granite, during 
construction processes of either building or road projects. Owing to the increasing cost of many of these construction 
materials, there had been serious setbacks in the infrastructural development in developing countries[1]. The need for 
considering the use of cheap, locally available resources: Palm Kernel Shell denoted as PKSA in this study, Sawdust 
Ashes (SDA), was equally considered as a replacement for the conventional aggregates. This innovative idea 
drastically reduces the construction cost especially in road and building projects[2]. 
Several scholars have made attempts to reduce construction cost by exploring the effectiveness of local available 
resources (additives) which can be grouped as both agricultural and industrial wastes[2-8]. These wastes comprise 
sawdust,  palm kernel shells, Cocoa leave ash, pulverized fuel ash, Grand nut shell ash, Snail shell ash, Eggshell, slag, 
fly ash which are formed from thermal power station, oil production waste treatment plants and milling stations. 
The usage of PKSA, SDA, and other local additives as stabilizers in road or building construction is gaining more 
popularity. Fernandez[9], quantified the fly ash formed in India from power plants to be approximately 105m tonnes 
yearly[9]. The current study seek to investigate the appropriateness in the use of sawdust as well as Palm Kernel Shells 
Ashes as stabilizers on the strength properties of Ekiti State Soil using Ido-Osi LGA as a case study. This assessment 
will embrace “Waste to Wealth” strategy, most of the additives which are waste products no economic value and there 
is always a problem in disposing them. Thus, this study assessment not only resolve the issues encountered in 
disposing them but will equally reduce environmental pollution.

Literature Review 
Soil can be simply defined as a thin layer occupying land area on the surface of the earth. It encompasses various sizes 
of particles, which are of great importance to the living creatures. Soil is considered as a natural property found on the 
surface of the earth, formed by mineral particles with three significant properties; water, air, and organic material. Soil 
is the oldest and the most complex of the construction materials used by Engineers[10]. Also, soil is a three-phase 
structure endowed with various mixtures of locally-derived solids, including fine to coarse-grained rock as well as

It could also be due to excessive Additives Contents that were not mobilized in the reaction, which consequently 
occupied spaces within the soil samples. Thus, reducing bonding in the Soil – Additives mixtures. While the CBR 
values increase as the Additives Contents increase in the other soil samples (i.e. B, C, and D).  
 
Figure 4.4: Graphs of CBR Test for the Treated Soil Sample at 2.5 
 For soil sample, A and F CBR value decrease as the AC increase, the decrease in the CBR values is due to the 
reduction in silt and clay content of the soil which reduced its cohesion. Also, CBR value increase as the AC increase 
for soil sample B, C, and D For soil sample E, CBR value decrease as the AC increase for PKSA, while for SDA CBR 
value increase as the AC increase. The increment in the CBR values could be attributed to gradual formation of 
cementitious compound between the Additives and Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) present in the soil. 
 Generally, the above results showed that the additives were able to stabilize the soil to some extent. This is due to the 
facts that there were increments in the CBR and MDD values of the majority of the soil samples.    
5. CONCLUSION 
 
In view of high cost of construction materials for stabilization of soil, the use of locally available industrial and 
agricultural products  (e.g. palm kernel shell and sawdust), to reduce environmental stresses and hazards, has 
necessitated this piece of research work. The general aim of this project is to assess the effects of PKSA and SDA on 
the strength properties of Ekiti State soil (Ido-Osi LGA as a case study) From the research, it can be concluded that: 
The additives have effects on strength as well as stability of soil sample in the study area. There were increase in OMC

and MDD as the additives Contents increase. However, where there were decrease as Additive Contents increase, it 
could be due to excessive Additive Content that were not mobilized in the reaction, which consequently occupied 
spaces within the samples. Thus, reducing bonding in the Soil – Additive mixtures. It could be also be due to 
replacements of the soil samples fine particles by the additives fine particles which are of lower Specific Gravities. 
The outcomes of the compaction assessment showed that addition of both the PKSA as well as SDA improve the 
mechanical assets of soil. Coarse particles rise immediately soil samples were preserved with both PKSA and SDA. 
It is suitable for Ekiti State soil stabilization because most of the soil samples in the study area were positively affected 
(i.e. soil samples B, C, D, and E). 
 
This research work has revealed that it is possible to use locally available materials i.e. (PKSA and SDA) as stabilizing 
agents. This will really help in achieving aim of converting “Waste to Wealth policies” of agricultural and industrial 
wastes disposal and management. Thus, reduces or eliminates environmental problems that may arise as a result of 
these wastes, by constituting nuisance where they may be dumped. Nevertheless, there is need for further studies on 
this project work in other to ascertain any other suitable hidden properties of the additives that can enhance the 
Engineering performance of the soil samples.

Abstract 
Data-based prediction models for vehicular crash counts are in high demand by transport and traffic authorities in 
Qatar. The road crash models based on in-depth data are important for developing efficient road safety analysis and 
auditing. The collection of such data is often expensive or even not possible. This work outlines the process through 
which the penalized maximum likelihood-based Poisson regression is applied to model the vehicular crash as a 
function of several categories of driving licenses issued in Qatar during the period 2007-2012. A real case study from 
Qatar is introduced and analyzed.

1. Introduction
Prediction models for road crash counts are critical to all aspects of transport and traffic studies. Such models are 
crucial for developing and directing traffic and safety programs. These days, several regression-based approaches are 
available for shaping the relationship between vehicular crash counts with one or mode of contributory crash factors 
such as traffic flow, vehicular traffic volume, and road geometry. However, since road crash counts are nonnegative 
integers, regression models based on discrete distributions are preferable. Among the wide variety of discrete 
distributions, the Poisson distribution is the most popular for modeling roads crash counts such as the vehicular crash 
rate (VCR) and fatality (VCF). 
The collinearity is a problem that may arise in count regression analysis. The collinearity occurs when two or more of 
the model predictors are linearly related to each other. One issue associated with the collinearity is that significance 
of the correlated variables on the response variable might not be rightly estimated. 
The generalized linear models (GzLMs) are popularly used models in statistic when the response variable fails to 
satisfy the normality assumption. The GLM is a general form of the linear regression. Modeling road crash count with 
GzLM regression is common in literature (pls. see, e.g., McCullagh & Nelder (1997), Sellers & Shmueli (2010), 
Tortum  et al. (2012), Razzaghi et al. (2013), Zha et al. (2014), Abdur Rouf et al. (2018),  Ghadban et al. (2018-a), 
and Abdella et al. (2019-a), (2019-b)). The two well-known techniques for estimating the coefficients of the GzLM 
are the weighted least squares and the maximum likelihood estimation. The maximum likelihood is the most preferable 
method adopted by researchers. Many of statistical computer packages use the maximum likelihood estimation as the 
default method. However, the maximum likelihood estimates usually experience serious instability because of the 
collinearity between model predictors. To reach better estimates, one might replace the conventional maximum 
likelihood estimation by its penalized scheme. The penalized maximum likelihood estimation is formed by adding a

5. Conclusions and Remarks 
This paper examines the effectiveness of the penalized Poisson GLM in modeling the traffic road counts. The real-
world example illustrated that the penalization regression would provide accurate prediction models comparing with 
its counterparts Poisson regression model. To specify the value of the penalization parameter 𝜆𝜆, we applied the 
penalized likelihood estimation under the K-fold cross-validation proposed by Goeman (2016).  
 
One limitation associated with the application of the cross-validation is the case of a small traffic dataset in which the 
estimate of the penalization parameter 𝜆𝜆 becomes accurate. One way to overcome this limitation is the usage of the 
leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation.

Abstract 
The change has been always the most difficult challenge of human race. Change is part of life doesn’t matter if the 
change was to start walking after months toddling when we were a babies or if is it change in a company 
management style. The question is why change is easier to say then to do. This paper looks in to the challenges 
associated with the start of change in a company environment and will examine different tools which are available 
for leading change. Other points covered in this paper will be leadership qualities and formulating a vision as those 
are considered enablers for success.

1. Introduction
It is not long ago when it was allowed to smoke in every pub or restaurant and it was normal. It was the way 
people lived, it was the way we do things around. However, since 2006 when a public health act was implemented 
things has changed. Nevertheless  it took many years until it got stuck in humans mind that we do not smoke in 
restaurants because this is how we do thinks around (Reid, 2013). In case of smoking policy there was a big effort 
done by health organisations who lead change to success. However not every change program end so well and 
research show that about 60% of all change programs fail. (Beer, Eisenstat and Spector, 1990; Jørgensen, 2008; 
Hayes, 2014). Question is why is implementing of change so difficult. Based on literature review the major answer 
on why the change afford fail is a lack of leadership and insufficient vision (Kotter, 1998; Hayes, 2014).  
The implementation of a change follow number of stages as is shown in the Figure 1. Each stage bring challenges 
which needs to be overcome and change behaviour of employees is seen as the most difficult task to do.(Kotter, 1998; 
Burnes, 2004; Hayes, 2014) 
Figure 1: Implementation of change adopted from (Hayes, 2014) 
2. Change Management
Whether the change is minor or major, the Leader who lead the change effort will experience some kind of resistance 
to the proposed change from both teams Stakeholders and employees. This was recognized by experts in the field who 
designed models which guide leaders through change and curb resistance. Some of the most known methods are shown 
and compared visually in Figure 2. Due to variety of internal and external environmental factors changes are always 
different. For this reason understanding of benefits of different change management tools and methods is essential to 
be able to use them accordingly to the situation.

work. The goal is to teach thousands of people how to think strategically, recognize patterns and anticipate problems 
or opportunities before they occurs.”     
Clarke (2010) recommend tool to enhance discussion which he call Renovator Delight and is shown in Figure 12. He  
ask what part of employees work would be in each of this boxes. This tool is especially helpful for finding 
misalignment in internal communication of the company. Other tools such a SWOT, PESTEL or Poter’s 5 Forces is 
practical to define position of a company in the market and factor which might impact it. (Burnes, 2004; Hayes, 2014; 
Procházka, Krejčiříková and Krejčíř, 2019) All agree that use of visualization tools is essential in this stage to manage 
discussion between the stakeholders to find opportunities for change. Tools should be easy to use as the  Threat-
Opportunity matrix recommended by (Galli, 2018) which is shown on the Figure 13. 
6. Formulating the Vision
People need something what they can believe in and follow. (Collins and Porras, 1998, p. 23) interpret “A well-
conceived vision consist of two major components: core ideology and envisioned future”. Authors agree that having 
a vision help companies to promote changes. As (Kotter, 1998,p8) conclude “In failed transformations you often find 
plenty of plans and programs, but no vision”. (Collins and Porras, 1998) have done an intensive research in to building 
a vision and they stress that vision should be easy to understand and as (Kotter, 1998, p. 9) promote “If you are not 
able to communicate vision in less than five minutes you are not done”. Vision is supposed to enhance communication 
about change. If there is something easy to share with colleagues it will spread quickly throughout the company. 
However this is not so common, leaders often have many complicated points which are difficult to describe even for 
them in 30 minutes meeting (Collins and Porras, 1998) . This is definitely not something what catch people attention. 
Vision should be the topic which enhance communication between colleagues during lunch time. So make it simple 
and share it.  
(Ancona et al., 2007, p. 99) argue that “even the most completing vision will loose its power if it floats, unconnected, 
above the everyday reality of organization life.” So leader should make sure to establish vision that will resonate but 
also walk the change. 
7. Conclusion:
This paper focus on change of management. It examines six change management methodologies which can be used 
for implementing change. This are Lewin’s 3 steps, Kotter’s 8 steps,  McKinsey 7S, ADKAR, Change Acceleration 
Process Model (CAP) and Oakland’s Framework of Eight. It is defined that choice of methodology depend on the 
environment in which change is supposed to be implemented since none of the tool is universal. Differences between 
tool are discussed and downsides highlighted to enable leader choose a tool which fit to situation. 
The paper continue with implementation of the change from leadership perspective, which start from recognizing need 
for change and continue with leadership qualities needed to implement the change. The major quality for leader is 
determined to be ability to listen and communicate with employees to get people on board, since change cannot be 
made without strong coalition. Kubler Ros change Curve is recommended to be used as it helps the leader to 
understand what are employees going through. Other visualisation tools which are available for leader are shown to 
enhance change effort. 
Last section focus defining core problem and formulation of vision. Good vision need to be easy to communicate 
between employees and should contain two messages which are core ideology and envisioned future. As it was defined 
by (Oakland, 2014) that 90% of change efforts are struggling in this stage so do not repeat this mistake.

Introducing a Measurement Framework to Assess Lean 
Readiness Level Within Emergency Departments in Kuwait

Abstract 
The purpose of this paper is to identify the key quality practices deemed essential for lean system (LS) implementation 
within emergency departments (EDs) and to develop a measurement framework to assess the lean readiness within 
EDs.   
This study is exploratory in nature; thus, the data obtained is secondary. First, the relevant literature was reviewed; 
the authors focused on the most recent literature (from 2013 to 2018). The review covers aspects such as lean 
assessment frameworks, lean critical success factors, lean readiness levels, and articles dealing with LSs within 
hospitals in general, and more precisely, in EDs.  
After analysing the literature, the main constructs were identified and the conceptual framework developed. As a 
second phase, in order to increase trustworthiness regarding the findings of the main constructs, and thereby enhance 
the robustness of the assessment framework, an expert panel was approached to validate the authors’ findings and 
assumptions and to ensure that the constructs represented the main factors to enable the authors to measure the lean 
readiness levels within EDs. A total of 65 experts in lean healthcare were contacted through their hospitals and via 
LinkedIn; the experts worked in hospitals in countries such as Canada, Egypt, Germany, India, Poland, Spain, the UK, 
and the USA. A total of 28 experts agreed to validate the conceptual model; however, only 17 returned the forms to 
the authors on time.  
Based on a literature review, several factors have been identified as essential factors for lean implementation within 
EDs. Those factors were then validated based on the experts’ opinions. The main factors were grouped into six main 
constructs: top management and leadership, human resources, patient relations, supplier relations, processes, and 
continuous improvement. The measurement framework has been developed to enable EDs to assess their lean 
readiness before attempting a lean system.   
This framework should help in mitigating the lean failures initiatives within EDs as it can be used to determine the 
factors that will enable/hinder the implementation of LSs within their EDs. The constructs of the framework have been 
validated by experts in lean healthcare practitioners and educators but have not yet been tested, which prevents the 
author from declaring it fit for EDs. Future research could be focused on the validation of the proposed framework 
presented in this study by using the framework to measure lean readiness within non-lean EDs. 
The proposed framework is the first lean readiness measurement framework that concentrates on EDs and one of the 
few lean readiness assessment frameworks in the healthcare literature.

Abstract 
Steel is one of the major reinforcement materials in concrete. The use of other relatively available, natural, and 
local construction materials such as perforated bamboo for concrete reinforcement is given high consideration 
this day because of the high cost and unavailability of steel. In this research, perforated bamboo was evaluated 
as a reinforcement material in concrete. Both perforated and split bamboo were subjected to flexural strength 
test to characterize their performance as reinforcement material for concrete. Another flexural strength test was 
conducted on a concrete reinforced with steel in order to compare its strength properties with both the perforated 
and split bamboo. It was observed that the use of perforated bamboo as a reinforcement material in concrete is 
suitable for minor structural construction projects such as lintel.

Introduction 
A Reinforced concrete can be defined as a compound material having a low tensile as well as ductility is stabilized by the 
addition of reinforcement with higher and complex tensile strength.[1]. 
The reinforcement process involves embedding the steel reinforcing bars or any other reinforcement materials in the 
concrete. One of the main usefulness of reinforcement is to counterattack tensile stresses in specific areas of the concrete 
that could lead to cracking, spalling and delamination. 
Most of the reinforced concrete of this days contains various reinforcing resources made of polymers, steels or could be 
other compound constituents made of steel in concurrence to rebar. To achieve a sturdy ductile and solid construction, it 
becomes highly imperative for reinforcement material to possess the following   
(i) High- pitched strength
(ii) Good ability to withstand tensile strain
(iii) Regardless of pH moisture as well as other comparable factors, it has to have a noble bond with the concrete.
(iv) It must have a good thermal compatibility to resist unacceptable stresses due to instability in temperatures.

Figure 4.8 Graphical Representation of Various Samples In Comparison With the Control With Respect To 
Flexural Strength. 
 
In this research, grade 20 ratios 1:2:4 was used and a target mean strength of 20N/mm2 was selected. It can be seen from 
figure 4.8 that at 7days, 14days, 21days, and 28days of curing for perforated bamboo, none of the strength is less than the 
target mean strength.  
Also, at 7days the strength of split bamboo is lower than the target mean strength while at (14, 21 and 28) days, the values 
obtained is higher than the target mean strength. 
For concrete beam made without reinforcement, it was observed that at the age of (7 and 14) days, the flexural strength 
obtained is less than the target mean strength while the flexural strength at the age of (21 and 28) days is higher than the 
target mean strength. 
It was observed that perforated bamboo with two nodes and split bamboo with concrete have almost the same results 
irrespective of the number of days of the experiment. It is also observed that the flexural strengths obtained from all the 
samples increases as the number of days increases. Also, in all the results gotten so far from the tables and figures, it can be 
seen that concrete with reinforcement has the lead control of all with the highest mean values in all the days while perforated 
bamboo with two nodes and split bamboo with concrete are similar in mean values and can serve the function. But concrete 
without reinforcement is of no use except for mass concrete where the tensile stresses are not significant. 
  
 5. 
 Conclusion and Recommendation 
 
Using the result obtained so far, it can be concluded that split bamboo with concrete and perforated bamboo with two nodes 
can perform the same function in a minor structure such as lintel, the flexural strength obtained from all the samples 
increases as the number of days increases. 
In using this type of materials in reinforcing concrete the structure to be used should be considered, and then the load on it 
should be minimal. 
Unreinforced concrete is not recommended for any structural work except for mass concrete where tensile stresses are not 
significant. 
In this research, it can be concluded that wet bamboo cannot serve any function because it may decay and be damaged by 
insects which can lead to voids within the concrete and thereby causing collapse of any structure. 
 
According to the above research, the use of perforated bamboo as reinforcement in concrete in a minor structure such as 
lintel is highly recommended, the use of steel as reinforcement in concrete is the control of the reinforcing concrete in any 
structural design. 
As a material resource, bamboo as not receive the mainstream recognition it deserves. The bulk of bamboo is gathered from 
the wild or rural environment, but in many areas where bamboo is used either split, unsplit and perforated, it is said to have

been dwindled due to overexploitation, poor management, and its lack of natural durability. It is suspected to have been 
attacked by insects and fungi and its service life is low due to years on ground contact. 
Perforated and split bamboo can be recommended for design of minor structural importance e.g lintel, but further research 
can be made on bamboo itself if there will be preservatives which can control the attack of insects and fungi when using it

Abstract 
The quality of process or product is often characterized by the univariate or multivariate distribution of quality 
characteristics. The linear profiles are widely used to model the relationship between dependent and independent 
variables. This paper aims to investigate the statistical performance of the double exponentially weighted moving 
average control chart (dEWMA) in quickly detecting the existence of assignable causes under different patterns of 
process shift. The performance of three existing control chart is estimated and compared using the Average Run 
Length (ARL) as a criterion of comparison.  For all the compared charts, the ARL and standard deviation (SDRL) at 
several parameters of shift patterns are estimated in order to draw conclusions and provide future work guidelines.  
Keywords: Simple Linear Profile, dEWMA Control Chart, dMEWMA Control Chart, Phase II Process Monitoring,

1. Introduction
The statistical process control (SPC) tools have been widely used to monitor the quality of process or product in 
different manufacturing and service sectors. It is conventional in the literature to describe the quality by using the 
univariate or multivariate distribution the quality characteristics. This research filed has received notable attention 
over the last years. See for instance Yeh et al. (2006), Huwang et al. (2007), Yeh et al. (2012), McCracken and 
Chakraborti (2013), Jones-Farmer et al. (2014), Abdella et al. (2017), and Jinho et al. (2019). Other researchers have 
shown an interest in monitoring the covariance matrix of the process quality characteristics. Some of these valuable 
contributions can be found in Li et al. (2013), Maboudou-Tchao et al. (2013), Shen et al. (2014), and Abdella et al. 
(2019).  
Over the last few years, the applications of the SPC tools has witnessed a new direction in describing the quality of 
product or service. The quality has been started to be described by the functional relationship between the response 
variable with one or more quality characteristics. Several types of relationship have been considered over the last few 
years. For instance, simple linear, polynomial, or multiple linear. The following section summarizes the research work 
done under the monitoring of quality profiles. 
Kang and Albin (2000) developed two profiling methods called as multivariate T2 and EWMA/R for detecting shifts 
in both the slope and intercept of simple linear quality profiles or function.  Kim et al. (2003) firstly coded the values 
of the independent variable to have a zero average, and secondly used three individual EWMA control charts

Abstract 
The Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) have huge potential to apply lean techniques in their day to 
day chores in order to minimize waste and increase productivity. Toyota is a pioneer in applying lean techniques. 
But many MSMEs are of opinion that applying lean tools into manufacturing systems is an expensive matter and the 
benefits of applying lean system do not justify the associated cost. Its time to understand MSMEs that lean systems 
have tremendous benefits associated with it in the longer run. This paper presented the case study of some MSMEs 
where lean techniques like MUDA, MURA has successfully implemented.  
Keywords 
Lean manufacturing, Value Stream Mapping (VSM), OEE, and ZED. 
1. Introduction 
There are many lean manufacturing tools like 5S, Kaizen, Just-in-Time, Kanban, Value Stream Mapping, Jidoka, 
Total Productive Maintenance, Overall Equipment Effectiveness etc. All the tools have their own benefits and own 
methods of application. So deciding which tools are more critical to an MSME is of utmost importance as not all 
MSMEs are capable of spending money on applying all these lean techniques.  Yang et al. (2011) studied the 
relationship between lean practices, environmental management practices and its impact on business outcomes. 
Bergmiller and Mccright (2010) correlated waste reducing techniques and strength of business management which 
ultimately resulted in improved business. Deif (2011) presented a system model capturing various planning activities 
for migrating from green to greener to more eco-efficient manufaucting.  
2. Research Methodology 
We have applied different lean manufacturing techniques like Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), 5S, Kanban, 
Value Stream Mapping (VSM), Process layout, Single Minute Exchange of Dies (SMED), Zero defect zero effect 
and Capability analysis in 3 different factories viz. Avval Industries, Ganesh Metal, and Siddhi Industries. We have 
attempted to elaborate on various lean tools in short in the next section. 
3. Techniques of Lean and Green Manufacturing 
The various techniques of lean and Green manufacturing are 
3.1. Kan-Ban System or pull systems  
This technique uses coloring cards, Bins and activity board to track what needs to be produced within the factory 
(Bergmiller, G.G. and McCright, P.R. (2009b)).

Overview 
Vehicle license plates are essential for identification and are closely associated with road safety and 
security. This paper highlights a few studies that involve the evaluation of license plates for vehicles used 
in Saudi Arabia. There currently exists two types of license plates for cars (normal and long) and one type 
for motorcycles. The authors examine various readability design aspects of the license plates. Based on the 
results, an enhanced design for each type of plate is suggested. Results from a pilot survey also support the 
preference of the proposed design for each type of plate. 
Keywords 
License plates, Saudi Arabia, Cars, Motorcycles 
1. Introduction
There currently exists an estimated 18 million registered vehicles in Saudi Arabia [1]. There are three major types
of vehicle license plates that are currently used in Saudi Arabia. Both normal series (with dimensions of 32 cm by 16 
cm) and long series (52 cm by 11 cm) are used for cars, while the motorcycle series comes in one standard size of 18
cm by 9 cm [2]. To our knowledge, no study has yet been performed to evaluate the readability of vehicle license
plates. Therefore, in the studies presented here, we focus on several ergonomic design parameters for such an important
identification tool, including contents of plate, font type, number arrangement, languages, logos used, etc. These
aspects are discussed below for each of the three license plate types, with the overall goal of finding the means to
enhance the speed of reading each of these plates.
2. Car License Plates – Normal Series
Variations of the current version of the normal Saudi license plate are shown in Figure 1, including sample private
car plate (left top), sample import/export plate (right top), sample commercial plate (middle left), sample public car 
plate (middle right), and a sample diplomatic car (C.D.) plate, with some signs/numbers blurred out for confidentiality 
purposes (bottom). The normal plate is the most commonly used vehicle plate in Saudi Arabia. Previous research on 
this specific type of plates was conducted by a group of senior design project students back in 2011 [2, 3, 4]. This is 
actually the sixth version of normal license plates, whereby for each preceding version (starting from the 1950’s) the 
design was modified by adding more numbers and letters in order to accommodate for the increasing demand 
throughout the years. The current version consists of up to four numbers and three letters, thereby -according to basic 
forecasting techniques- having a capacity of 49.3 million unique plates, which is expected to suffice until 
approximately the year 2052 A.D. [2].

Research on this specific type of plates was recently conducted by a group of senior design project students in 
2018 [7]. As with car plates, research has focused on investigating ways to increase the readability of the plate. The 
suggested refined motorcycle plate is shown in Figure 6, incorporating Saudi logo and “KSA” letters, a fixed location 
for bolts, English and corresponding Arabic letters, and common Arabic numerals. 
 
 
Figure 6 Proposed motorcycle Saudi license plate. 
 
In view of the previously mentioned, well-established importance of incorporating English letters into the plates, 
students presented three alternatives aimed at reducing the identification time for this particular plate, while keeping 
character content at a minimum for such a small plate area. An additional objective was to unify the location of the 
bolts at a specific corner of the plate, as not to interfere with the character content of the plate, which can result in 
misleading readings (whether done intentionally or unintentionally). 
 
A pilot study was conducted on 227 volunteers (49% male, 51% female), mostly between the ages of 18 and 35. 
The majority of volunteers were Arabic-only speaking (70%), while 3% were English-only speaking, and the rest 
(27%) were bilingual. The students conducted the survey electronically. The participants were simply asked to 
determine which of the motorcycle plate designs they preferred. Note that participants were also shown two other 
alternative designs (not shown here) and the design with only the best subjective results (see in Figure 6) has been 
displayed. The responses were scaled down to a score (or scaled preference factor) out of a maximum of 4.0. The 
results are summarized in Table 3, whereby the proposed design was clearly preferable for both Arabic-only and 
bilingual speakers (more than double the preference in both cases).

5. Final Remarks and Recommendations 
 
This paper summarizes findings from a few studies that have analyzed and evaluated existing normal and long car 
plates, as well as motorcycle plates used in Saudi Arabia. Our studies have shown that the readability of each plate 
was affected by such factors as language content, character orientation issues, and plate fixation problems. The 
findings of our studies serve as evidence of the inevitable need to improve vehicle plate design as language, 
technological, and security demands change over the years. Future research entails incorporating advanced objective 
means of evaluation of such and other design improvements in addition to some of the subjective results presented in 
this paper, which will be the subject of forthcoming publications.

Abstract 
Strategic sourcing, stands out to be not only costs savings mechanism but it also helps the organization to 
realize its long-term objectives. It is therefore essential for all organizations to go for a strategic sourcing now 
a day. Manufacturing organizations might be the most evident candidates, however the positive effect of 
strategic sourcing can be enormous for organizations as diverse as manufacturing organizations, service 
organizations, real estate firms and non-profit associations. The target of the strategic sourcing in 
manufacturing organizations is to guarantee that procurement activities accomplish best value for money and 
to provide best services to satisfy its clients. This paper examines and talks about the strategic acquisition 
elements in manufacturing organizations and suggests the techniques for further improvement in the 
framework dependent on certain perceptions in the present framework being practiced.

1. Introduction
In the era of globalization, technological developments that occur today have made the world increasingly without 
a border. The development of information technology today has a broad positive impact both for individuals and 
for organizations and businesses. The advancement of information technology has made many people continue to 
race to improve information systems in many ways, one of which is the use of sophisticated gadgets that support 
the use of the internet. According to APJII (Indonesian Internet Service Providers Association) in 2016 out of

It can be seen in Table 4 that the results of SEM estimation using AMOS software shows the relationship between 
the variables of Entrepreneurial Competency (X1) and Social Media Marketing (X2) on the SMEs Competitive 
Advantages (Y) is positive and significant. Thus, the hypothesis states that Entrepreneurial Competence and Social 
Media Marketing have a positive and significant effect on the SMEs Competitive Advantages is accepted. 
5. Conclusion. 
Based on the results of the study, it is found that entrepreneurial competencies have a positive and significant 
influence. The implication of these findings, SME owners must be able to increase individual competencies 
towards the business they own so that it will make SMEs competitiveness also increase. It is in line with the 
opinion of Mangkunegara (2005) which states that entrepreneurial competence is a fundamental factor that a 
person has in doing business that makes it different from other business owners who have the average ability. The 
ability of entrepreneurial competence is as the ability of entrepreneurs to deal effectively with a difficult situation 
by feeling the limitations of the business environment and activating internal relationships and resources (Iandoli 
& Raffa, 2007). 
Whereas Vijay and Ajay (2011) stated that entrepreneurial competence could make it possible to increase business 
sustainability and business success. These things will increase the competitiveness of a business that will help 
make a business have an advantage in business competition. SMEs owner who has entrepreneurial competencies 
both in marketing, finance, building relationships, and technical competencies will have an advantage in business 
competition.  
The results also show that social media marketing has a positive and significant effect. It is in line with the research 
of Nugroho and Kastaman (2014) which states that the use of social media in marketing activities will increase 
sales in a business to make a business more competitive in business competition. Maharani Mutia et al. (2012) also 
support this statement by stating that social media provides a competitive advantage by increasing the bargaining 
position towards customers. It is following the phenomenon that social media plays a role in marketing for young 
people who are always in touch with internet-based technology and the use of social media, so people spend more 
time reading on social media than reading newspapers and things can spread widely through social media. Research 
findings are also following the study of Gurnelius (2011) which mentions the pillars in social media marketing. 
Social media marketing really plays important parts in creating a competitive advantage for small and medium 
enterprises.

Abstract 
The life that modern all-round nowadays, making demands and necessities of life that high makes everyone work 
with each other in an attempt to meet all the necessities of life. These conditions force any individual to attempt 
in various ways to meet the needs of his life. So sometimes forgotten what exactly is the purpose of actual work 
for them. Such a condition makes the behavior of individuals working in companies being encouraged to seek 
purely material and forget manners and a sense of family within the company. The company works should be a 
comfortable and pleasant event turned into a mutually oppress one employee with the other employees, if this 
situation continues then it becomes unhealthy for the company to growing forward. Here it takes a spiritual value 
for employees in the works so that they are aware of and understand the true meaning of working together with 
other people and friends in an attempt to advance a healthy company. Through spiritual company, employees 
will feel that their place of work as a House of worship and large family homes each other mutually in hand to 
achieve the goal and well-being together without sacrificing each other a sense of family.

1. Introduction
If we are observant observe, lately there is an interesting trend in employee behaviour and many companies. 
Employees working in companies or factories are always trying so that at any moment his earnings can always 
rise, his savings always growing and very worrying if at any time a shortage of property. Business is also not to 
be outdone, their running mates, vying to make a profit, income from year to year are expected always to 
increase. To achieve that goal they are willingly to any roads, no problem harming others, damage the nature. 
Even to the extent that appears adigum that times now to achieve the unlawful sustenance only difficult let alone 
looking for halal sustenance. There is another saying that if in working or doing business do not use religion 
because surely will be hard road. Thus the first phenomenon. Then if we look again there are phenomena that 
accompanied the first phenomenon i.e. the growing proliferation of study groups, spirituality in the Office Office 
of both private as well as Government-owned, even in Jakarta also spiritual groups grow rapidly. The employers 
also do not want to lose, they are also looking for something more than profit. They feel that caring for the 
environment, helping human beings who lack is an act of giving more meaning in life. Money as a single bottom 
line in pursuit of enjoyment of life was not able to meet the needs of today's modern community life. And why 
does this phenomenon can happen thus? Actually the idea of modernization requires the existence of a strict 
distinction between religion with worldly problems like ecomony, politics, and science as well as others, which 
eventually gave birth to understand secular desires sparate between the Affairs of the religion with life issues.

5. Conclusion  
After discussing the results of the analysis, there are several important conclusions need to get attention from the 
management of the company, i.e.. 
Emotional quotient, creative quotient, adversity quotient, and spiritual quotient is a unity that can not be 
separated in to build a kesadarn myself so that every employee can begin to fix all the action ends at the repair 
passion in working. 
Four variables on top of each other, intertwined in the lives of employees, especially in the building of 
community self when someone has the same goals with others in carrying out its work in a company. So the 
emotional quotient, creative quotient, adversity quotient, and spiritual quotient can be applied gradually in 
accordance with the changes of time i.e. do the application through the hierarchical approach. 
After understanding all forms of the above conclusions, there is a suggestions and recommendations should be 
made within the company i.e.. 
Improvement and application of the emotional quotient, creative quotient, adversity quotient, and spiritual 
quotient can not be applied simultaneously, therefore its application must follow by the change of motivation, 
i.e. changes to welfare improvements, the award, reward, more employee rights are met and provide confidence 
to employees as individuals who have the ability to work. 
Need to apply a rule that employees have different services and contributions to the company, therefore it is 
necessary to appreciate the efforts and contributions of services given to every employee to the company through 
a particular container capable employees with full sense accepted his consciousness. It is certainly better than 
nothing at all to do something. Because in the long run will all have benefits which result cannot be measured in 
material, because this is part of an investment company for the cultivation of the sense of having participated in 
the long run, until they entered a period of full duty later.

Abstract
Conventional manufacturing processes depend on the principle of removal of materials, which involves
non-linear materials processing and have waste material left after the manufacturing is completed.
However, there was always a desire to manufacture products in such a way that the wastage reduces to
zero. The concept of additive manufacturing, in the form of 3D printing, made a breakthrough in this
direction and has attracted the attention of researchers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. 3D printing has
opened  new  opportunities  in  terms  of  manufacturing  possibilities  and  shifted  the  manufacturing
paradigms. This capstone design project aimed to in-house design, fabricate and test a 3D printer. A
design was developed consisting of sets of screws, BLDC motors and one CNC controller controlled with
Mach3 software. Our printer uses BLDC motors due to significantly higher levels of accuracy and
efficiency as compared to the current practice of using stepper motor. Moreover, we used ball screws
instead of the lead screws as they provide smoother, quieter, and efficient motion. These components
make this design a novel one that has potential to compete with other 3D printers. Finally, the printer is
tested to see if this creative combination can be used to advance this manufacturing process.

1. Introduction
Once a machine or device fails and requires repairing, the company maintains inventory of spare parts, which is a
relatively expensive process. If the inventory is not maintained, then the order process for required parts will result
in work delays. Therefore, a quick solution is need as a temporary solution until the spare parts arrive. These are one
of the few problems faced by industries, which led to the development of Additive Manufacturing (AM) that
precisely produces the required part of the product in a short time and low cost through layer by layer deposition of
materials (Industry 2014). 3D printing is an upcoming revolution of the industrial prototyping and manufacturing
that encourages and drives innovations for small companies and even individuals. The development process of the
3D printing technologies is shown in Table 1.

6. Conclusion
 
A 3D printer is designed in this final year project based on FDM process. Initially, four different concepts were
generated following a set of design specifications. The final concept was developed through a selection process and
combining the good features from others. It had the print bed moving linearly along Y-axis while the print head
moves along the other two axes. In detail design calculations, decisions were made to select a component based on
design calculations or manufacturing by ourselves in the workshops. Standard parts like motors and controller were
selected and bought online. A CNC controller was used to control all movements and the filament feed. Load
determination and safety calculations for the housing and the printer structure were done and found to be safe. All
the standard parts and fabricated parts were then assembled to build the 3D printer. Finally, a dry run was done to
test the complete motion system of the printer. Once the dry run was successful, the printer was finally assembled
and then tested by modeling an object on SolidWorks® software and then printing it using our 3D printer. After
couple of unsuccessful attempts and error debugging processes, the printer worked excellently to print different
products. It was noted that the printer can print simple to moderately complex objects with exact dimensions but for
complicated models it needs better nozzle. The surface roughness of the printed objects varies with its complexity.
Furthermore, the printer was tested to print the same object multiple times with different colors, and it was found to
have an excellent repeatability.

Result and Discussion 
Both of these training media had the same goal, they were increasing the success of hitting softball balls where hand 
eye coordination was very supportive to get the success of hitting in a good softball playing, but each of the training 
media had a difference in terms of implementation. 
3.1  
The application of exercises using hanging ball media (A2) is better than training using 
batting tee media (A1) 
The results of the motion analysis above were reinforced by the results of the calculation of variance analysis about 
the difference in effectiveness between the two training methods as a whole, F observation between columns (Fh) = 
48,140, was greater than F table (Ft) which was 4,113 by focusing on success softball used tee (𝑥𝑥̅ = 2,83 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑠𝑠=
5,79) comparing to the result of hitting the softball by using hanging ball media (𝑥𝑥̅ = 2,02 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑠𝑠= 3,98). It can be 
concluded that overall the medium of training with batting tee media is better than the medium of hanging ball training 
on the results of hitting softball balls. 
3.2  
There is interaction between the media training with hand eye coordination on the results of 
the skill of hitting the softball balls 
Based on the results of the two-way variance analysis, the interaction between the training media using the batting tee 
and the exercise using hanging ball media on the success of hitting the softball was shown in the anava calculation 
table above. Score calculated Fo interaction (FAB)= 56,333 and F table (Ft)= 4,11. It was shown that F count > F table 
so, How was rejected and H1 was accepted. Thus it can be concluded that there was an interaction between the training 
media on the success of hitting the softball. 
 
Picture 1: Interaction between training media and hand eye coordination 
Source : result of processing data through 2x2 anava 
Thus it can be concluded that for athletes who have high hand eye coordination if they want to improve their softball 
skills, they should be trained using the opposite media batting tee training for athletes who have low hand eye 
coordination if they want to improve their softball skills. 
3.3  
For athletes who have high hand eye coordination. The result of the skill of hitting softball 
balls through the application of media batting tee (A1) is better than the medium for hanging ball 
training (A2) 
The method of the batting tee and hanging balls training made a significant difference to the success of hitting softball 
for groups that had high hand eye coordination. This was proven by the results of further tests using the Tukey test. 
The group that had high hand eye coordination with tee batting training media (P1) compared to the group that had 
high hand eye coordination using hanging ball training media (P2) obtained Qh= 0,567 and Qt= 4,330. Thus Qh>Qt 
so that Ho was rejected. The conclusion for athletes who have high hand eye coordination success is hitting softball 
by practicing using batting tee media (𝑥𝑥̅ = 2,61 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑠𝑠= 3,80) better than practice using media hanging ball exercises  
(𝑥𝑥 ഥ= 2,53 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑠𝑠= 3,84). It can be concluded that exercise using media batting tee is better than practice using 
hanging ball media for hand eye coordination groups.

3.4  
For athletes who have low hand eye coordination, the results of the skill of hitting softball 
balls through the application of hanging ball media (A2) are better than the batting tee exercise media 
(A1) 
Training media using batting tee and hanging ball training media made a difference to the success of hitting softball 
for groups that had low hand eye coordination. This was proven by the results of further tests using the Tukey test. 
The group that had low hand eye coordination with tee batting training media (P3) compared to the group that had 
low hand eye coordination using hanging ball training media (P4) obtained Qh= 14,444 and Qt= 4,330. Thus Qh > Qt 
so that Ho was rejected. The conclusion for athletes who have low hand eye coordination is success hitting the softball 
by practicing using hanging ball media (𝑥𝑥̅ = 3,84 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑠𝑠= 6,05) better than practicing using media batting tee 
exercises (𝑥𝑥 ഥ= 2,14 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑠𝑠= 3,31). 
It can be concluded that the low hand eye coordination group is better trained by training using a hanging ball media 
compared to training using a batting tee media. 
To test hypotheses one and two, the researcher used two-way variant analysis (ANAVA) technique. The complete 
calculation of ANAVA can be seen in appendix 21. Summarize in table 1 below.

Conclusion  
Based on the results of data processing and the results of data analysis that was done the researchers concluded (1) the 
success of hitting softball for groups of athletes trained using the tee batting media was better than the group of athletes 
who were trained by using hanging ball media, (2) there was an interaction between the use of exercise media and 
hand eye coordination on the success of hitting the softball, (3) for athletes who had high hand eye coordination, the 
success of hitting by using batting tee media was better than training using hanging ball media, and for athletes who 
had low hand eye coordination, the success of hitting softball by using a hanging ball media was better than training 
using a batting tee media.

Abstract 
Virtual experiments have been developed on the concept of thermodynamics. This study was intended to analyze the 
level of understanding of students' thermodynamic concepts after learning with virtual labs. Model testing used the 
pretest-posttest control group design. The research subjects were fifty-four students divided into two groups, 
experimental and control groups. An essay test was given to test the level of conceptual understanding of students. 
Data was processed to examine differences in improvement in both groups. The results showed an increase in mastery 
of students' thermodynamic concepts in both groups. The increase in mastery of the thermodynamic concept in the 
experimental group was higher than the control group. However, statistical analysis showed that the differences 
between the two groups were not significantly different. The concept of temperature and expansion is the concept with 
the highest increase.

Introduction
Experimental activity is an essential component of physics learning. Through experiment, students can develop their 
thinking skills and creativity. Many skills can be developed through the activities of physics experiment. Students can 
practice observing, measuring, assembling tools, communicating, and teaming up to solve problems. Physical 
experimental activities are also important for training students' process skills. Sinaradi (1998) stated that students need 
to be trained to acquire various skills such as observing, measuring, classifying, interpreting data, experimenting, and 
communicating,  which can be adjusted to the material being studied and the level of thinking of students. One of the 
factors that influence the success of physics experiment is the availability of resources that includes materials and 
equipment, space and furniture, laboratory staff, and technicians. Sufficient resources will support the implementation 
of experimental activities, on the contrary, the limitations of tools and materials are the reasons for educators not to 
conduct experimental activity. Thermodynamics is a part of physics, which consists of several abstract concepts. This 
leads to low of students' mastery of physics concepts. In its study, physics has several principles, laws, and abstract 
theoretical concepts that need to be proved through a series of experiments. Some of the materials in physics, the proof 
of principle and law cannotbe done with ordinary experiments that require simple materials. It requires some 
equipment with sophisticated technology. This then led to the emergence of innovations in physics learning, such as 
the use of virtual labs in the form of computer simulations. The development of virtual labs presents innovations in 
learning and physics experiment. Physical experiment using computer technology is called virtual labs. Finkelstein 
(2005) stated that the computercould be used to support the physics teaching in collecting, presenting, and processing

still many students who have not to reach maximal achievement in both experiment and control class. The results of 
the statistical analysis also showed that there was no significant difference between the students’ comprehension of 
the concept in both classes. It was also influenced by the type of problem used in this concept, which was quite a lot 
of matter in the form of a mathematical problem. In the case of a mathematical calculation, the ability of the two 
classes is not significantly different. In contrast to procedural and conceptual issues, the students' mastery of the 
experimental class was higher than the control class. It means learning that has been done with virtual labs gave 
students a better understanding of the concepts and related procedures. Finkelstein (2005), found that conceptual 
mastery can be improved through the use of computer simulations. Computer technology can also help the process of 
gathering data analysis, experimental modification,and presentation in virtual form. McKagan et al. (2008) found that 
students' mental intuitions and models can be improved with the help of visualization of concepts, abstract processes, 
and microscopic processes that can not be observed. Zacharia (2003) stated that students' positive attitudes toward 
physics also increased after learning by using simulations. Interactive simulation helps students to visualize the 
problem and follow up the solution. The use of a virtual lab is effective in improving students' generic science skills, 
especially on logical inference indicators and concept-building capabilities (Gunawan et al. 2013). Finkelstein et al. 
(2005)argue that the application of computer simulation on direct current electric circuit learning could help students 
master concepts, complete tasks, assemble real circuit, and explain how it works. The recent researches have 
emphasized that the use of the simulations bea benefit in the teaching process of Science concepts (Gorghiu et al. 
2009). Donnelly et al. (2013) have found that the implementation of virtual chemistry laboratory could overcome the 
difficulties of discovery learning that teachers typically encounter in working in the laboratory. Virtual laboratories 
can be used as a risk-free environment for education and training. Virtual laboratory utilization is proven to help 
achieve the stated goals (Noor & Wasfy 2008). Theory and practice can be combined through the use of virtual 
laboratories. Students are able to improve problem solving skills (Gunawan et al. 2017) as well as their creativity in 
learning (Gunawan et al 2017). This pattern enables the development of interactive experiments, sharing experiments, 
data management, semantic integration, and support for web-based graphical user interfaces (Ciepela et al. 2010).In 
their study, Zacharia & Constantinou (2008) compared the effects of experiments performed physically and virtually. 
Gunawan et al. (2018) stated that virtual simulations help students to be creative, especially for aspects of elaboration 
and fluency. The results show that the experimental mode is equally effective in increasing students' understanding of 
the concepts of temperature and heat. 
4. 
Conclusion 
This research has successfully developed several virtual experiments to improve students’ mastery of thermodynamic 
concepts. The implementation of virtual laboratory was proven to make it easier for students to understand the concept 
of thermodynamics better than the control group who study conventionally. Improved mastery of the concept of 
experimental group was higher than the control group on all sub-concepts of thermodynamics. The concept of 
temperature and expansion is a sub-concept with the highest increase, which is equal to 72.9% in the high 
category.Although there was a substantial increase, the differences in mastery of the thermodynamic concepts in the 
two groups did not differ significantly.

Abstract 
Efforts to achievement in triple jump (TJ) can be done in the process of providing learning methods. Furthermore 
motor skills are the determinant of the quality and quantity of  jumper. The purpose of this study was to find out 
differences of part method learning (PML) and whole method learning (WML) by involving motor skills (MS) in 
improving of the TJ skills. This research uses a 2 x 2  by level experiment design method. Participants (n=89) were 
male collage students aged 18-20 years category. Sampling was carried out by specifically selecting 27% of the highest 
score and 27% of the lowest score, refers to Verducci's theory. Hypothesis test results 1)PML is better than the WML 
around this p-value 0,048<0,05, H0 is rejected. 2) There is an interaction effect Fo (LMxMS) p-value 0,000<0,05 H0 
rejected. 3)  PMLMS1  is better than WMLMS1 on students with high motor skills category p-value 0,0005<0,05 or 
H0 rejected. 4) PMLMS2 better  than WMLMS2 on students with high MS category  p-value  0,34> 0,05 H0 acepted. 
TJ skill that taught with PML is higher than the group that being taught by using WML. The low MS category of the 
PML are more suitable.

Introduction
The Triple Jump (TJ) athletic sport is part of the effort to improve the quality of the quantity of Indonesia education 
that leads to the learning process in universities in Indonesia especially in Physical Education Department. TJ is one 
of number categories with fundamental technique aspects, such as start, hop, step, jump and landing. The effort to get 
the achievement in TJ athletic sport is done through the teaching and learning process and sport as the activity. The

The difference of the TJ skills result between group t0 (PMLMS1 - WMLMS1) = 3,496, p-value = 0,001/2 = 
0,0005<0,05 or H0 rejected. Because of that, there is an average different of the students who were taught by PML 
and WML in the students with high MS category. And PMLMS1 is better than the WMLS1 for students collage high 
motor category. 
2. 
The difference of the TJ skills result between group t0 (PMLMS2 - WMLMS2) = 0,286, p-value = 0,680/2 = 
0,34> 0,05 or H0 accepted. Thus, there is different average of the students who were taught by PML and WML with 
low MS. And PMLMS2 is better than the WMLS2 for students collage low motor category. 
 
4.  
Conclusion 
In the score of learning method  treatment effect PML and WML gives a significant difference. Group treatment 
PMLMS1-WMLMS1 has a different value, and PMLMS1 is better than the WMLS1 for students collage high motor 
category. mean while in the group treatment PMLMS2-WMLMS2 there is an different value. And PMLMS2 is better 
than the WMLMS2 for students collage low motor category (hypothesis rejected) Furthermore, the TJ skill that taught 
with PML is higher than the group that being taught by using WML, this shows that PML  is more beneficial than 
WML. This is because the part method is simpler, making it easier for students to understand the process of the 
movement in part to part. after teaching the whole method. Complexity of the movement of the basic techniques of 
high triple jump, the part method makes it easy for students to analyze the basic techniques of triple jump. This is 
because the triple jump material is arranged in a regular and multilevel manner until the basic technical phase of the 
prefix to the final basic technique. Whereas in the whole method it is different from the part method which are arranged 
as a whole and are devided d in part to part. This overall method is not effective in the group of low motor students 
and high motor students in improving the achievement of triple jumper. Thus, the researcher recommends and suggests 
PML to be used as the teaching guidance for teaching and learning process in the triple jump athletic training.

Abstract 
The educational environment is in need of finding ways for improving organizational performance.  The global 
academic competitive with the 4.0 era necessitate lecturers whose committed and willing do more to for the 
organization. Organizational commitment and organizational citizenship behavior are two imperative concepts in 
the organization. This study examined the relationship of the three dimensions of organizational commitment 
(affective, normative, and continuance commitment) with employees' organizational citizenship behavior in an 
academic environment. Based on the results of the analysis, it revealed that in an educational environment only 
affective commitment shown to have a direct, strong, and positive correlations with one type of OCB of 
sportsmanship behavior. This result suggested possible impacts of such behaviour. Discussion on limitation of the 
study and implication for future research were also provided. 
1.
Introduction
Globalization with emerging 4.0 industries has brought more unpredictable environment in the workplace and 
drive the organizations to find ways for improving organizational performance. In the academic context, the trends 
have become part of the reality, such as an increasing motivation for internationalization to cope with the global 
academic environment (Altbach and Knight 2007). One of the ways is to enhance the capacities of employees by 
understanding individuals in the workplace. The ability of an organization to manage its employees and to ensure 
that it is congruent with the organization’s needs is the key to sustaining the organization’s competitive advantage 
(Maia and Bastos 2015; Mello 2002). Since, an individual’s ability and psychology offer cooperative and initiative 
driven set of attitudes (Bindl and Parker 2010; Kuehn and Al Busaidi 2002) and fundamental elements in reaching 
the twin goals of effective performance and higher quality of working life (William 1999). Studies have supported 
the idea that employees’ attitudes and behaviors are related strongly to performance (DeCarlo and Leigh 1996; Jha 
2011). Thus, it is valuable to identify factors that may influence and contribute to predicting employees’ behaviour 
at work. Accordingly, this study concerned with identifying a high level of organizational commitment and a high 
level of organizational citizenship behavior; the two conceptions are highly considered as predictive aspects of 
employees’ work behaviour in a competitive era. 
1.1.  
Organizational Commitment (OC) 
The concept of employees’ organizational commitment has been conceptualized in various ways (Liou and Nyhan 
1994; Meyer and Smith 2000; Zangaro 2001). Employee commitment is a relative strength of an individual’s 
identification and involvement with an organization (Mowday et al.  1979). One of the prevalent concepts of 
organizational commitment, which has been applied in a number of organizational studies, e.g. in Meyer and Smith 
(2000) and Yousef (2000), proposed a multidimensional concept of organizational commitment (Allen and Meyer 
1990). The concept consisted of three distinct types of employees’ attachment to the organization. Affective 
commitment reflects the level of employee’s emotional attachment to, identification with, and involvement in the 
organization. Continuance commitment is related to the employee’ perception about the costs associated with 
discontinuing employment with the organization. Normative commitment refers to a sense of obligation and 
dedication on the part of the employee to maintain the membership in the organization. This model of commitment 
is described as ‘commitment, whether an employee wants to, needs to, or should do to remain with an organization’ 
(Zangaro 2001). The differences in motivation lead to engagement in varying types of commitment, so that the 
outcomes can also be quite diverse (Meyer and Smith 2000).

is shown to have a direct, strong, and positive correlations with sportsmanship behavior of OCB (0.33). This result 
suggests that employees with a high level of feelings of attachment to, identification with, and involvement in, the 
organization (affective commitment), then, they are more likely to exhibit sportsmanship behaviors, such as, using 
their working time effectively and; if problems arise in their workplace, ensuring that they are not making problems 
bigger than they already are. 
  
4.  
Conclusion 
This study is an exploratory single-case study. It is not a longitudinal study to see the effect of, for example the 
performance appraisal over time on the employees’ commitment. The instruments used were mainly developed 
based on western work environments and work behavior, while the sample population in this study was from non-
western countries. Consequently, the instruments, perhaps reflect cultural bias. This study used a narrowly defined 
population, therefore it might be inappropriate to generalize the findings. Despite the limitations mentioned, this 
study opens several avenues for further research. This study is conducted as an exploratory study, thus there are 
needs to do a significant amount of work in this area. The first is to conduct research in different workplace settings. 
More research is also required to explain the cultural background of this sample population to see if there are any 
differences because of this reason and to explore whether there are cultural factors in the context, method, and 
results of studies in other university context in other countries.

Abstract 
In the year 2012 Riau PON DKI takraw team in Jakarta is included in the top 5, and in 2016 Bandung West Java PON 
sepak takraw team is not included in the top 5, this shows that the performance of DKI Jakarta takraw football team 
has decreased. Based on this background path analysis study aimed to obtain information on the influence of the 
physical condition of leg muscle explosive power, nutrition status and self-confidence towards skill smash 
sepaktakraw at the athlete's of DKI Jakarta, Indonesia. The method used is a quantitative approach, survey and test 
methods (vertical jump, BMI and questionnaire). The subjects in this study were DKI Jakarta athletes as many as 30 
people. Sampling is done using the technique Total Sampling. Based on testing the hypothesis, the results of this study 
are that there is a positive influence between explosive power limb muscle on skills smash sepak takraw DKI Jakarta 
athletes 8.52%. There is a positive influence between nutritional status with skills smash sepak takraw DKI Jakarta 
athletes is 8.4%. There is a positive influence between confidence and Skills Smash sepak takraw DKI Jakarta athletes 
by 10.0%. There is a positive influence between e-limb power muscle with the confidence of DKI Jakarta athletes at 
38.4%. There is a positive influence between nutritional status and the confidence of DKI Jakarta athletes 6.4%. There 
is a positive influence between explosive power limb muscle and nutritional status in DKI Jakarta athletes by 31.5%.

0.6042x 100% = 0.3648 or 36.48%. While the variable of confidence (X3) towards skills smash sepak takraw(Y) has 
a direct effect of 0.4842x 100% = 0.2342 or 23.42%. From the description above it can be seen how much influence 
the variable explosive power limb muscle, Nutritional Status and confidence inskills smash sepak takraw, it can be 
concluded that the variables X1, X2, and X3 have a direct effect on variable Y, this refers to the research conducted by 
Pano, Sirajudin says there are influences significantly exercise leg muscle power towards sepak takraw smash abilities 
(Aristóteles 2002). 
Second, the hypothesis there is a significant effect of explosive power limb muscle and nutritional status on self-
confidence after hypothesis testing has been proven to be individually influential on skills smash  sepak takraw in DKI 
Jakarta athletes. Structural equation from the results of path analysis from explosive power limb muscle to confidence 
and Nutritional Status to confidence is X3 = 0.334 ρ31 + 0.321 ρ32 + 0.863ɛ2. The effect of variable explosive power 
limb muscle directly on self confidence is 0.3342x 100% = 0.1115 or 11.15%. Nutritional status directly influences 
self-confidence of 0.3212x 100% = 0.1030 or 10.30%. from this description it can be seen the effect of variable 
explosive power limb muscle and nutritional status directly towards self-confidence the rest is the influence of other 
variables apart from the variable explosive power of leg muscle and flexibility of the hip joint. Other variables that 
can influence self-confidence include internal factors including the caring of athletes, past experiences, ideals and 
expectations (Jufrianis 2017). While external factors include available facilities, facilities and infrastructure, training 
programs and the environment, this refers to a study conducted by Sujarwo saying the positive effect of capacity of 
the function, Nutritional Status, Physical Activity and Exercise Motivation towards Physical Fitness on the athlete 
KONI Depok City (Sujarwo 2018). 
Third, the hypothesis is that there is a significant effect of explosive limb muscles on flexibility of the hip joint. after 
testing hypotheses it was proven individually to have a significant effect on Nutritional Status DKI Jakarta Athletes. 
Structural equation from the results of path analysis from explosive power limb muscle to Nutritional Status is X2 
=0.188 ρ21 + 0.982ɛ1. The effect of the leg muscle power variable directly on the size of 0.1882x 100% = 0.0353 or 
3.53%. From this description it can be seen that the effect of variables explosive power limb muscle directly on 
Nutritional Status is the influence of other variables other than the variable  explosive power of limb muscle. Other 
variables that can affect flexibility are exercise and other biomotor factors. From the results of the description above, 
we can see the results of the research on the effect of explosive power limb muscle, Nutritional Status and achievement 
self-confidence skills smash on sepak takraw kedeng in DKI Jakarta athletes. This finding shows that to improve the 
achievement of sepak takraw athletes, an athlete must have explosive power limb muscle, Nutritional Status and of 
course good self-confidence, where all three have an influence in improving the achievements of DKI Jakarta athletes 
going forward (P. D.B., V. E.A., and M. M 2014).

Conclusion 
Based on the calculation of path analysis of such structures, the result of hypothesis analysis model line-1, model 2 
and model-3 provide information objektif some direct influence on the effect of eksplosive power leg muscle 
(X1),nutritional status (X2) and confidence (X3) towardsskills smash  sepak takraw. (Y) which can be seen as follows: 
(a). Direct effect of variable X1 on Y (X1→ Y) or (r1y) = 0.292. So theeffect explosivepower of limb muscle(X1) 
directly affectsskills smash sepak takraw's(Y) of 0.0352x 100% = 0.0982 or 9.82%. 
(b). The direct effect of variable X2 on Y (X2 → Y) or (r2y) = 0.604. So the influence of Nutritional Status (X2) directly 
affects the affect ofskills smash sepak takraw(Y) of 0.5052x 100% = 0.0703 or 7.03%. 
(c). The direct effect of variable X3 on Y (X3 → Y) or (r3y) = 0.484. So the effect of self-confidence (X3) directly 
affects the affect ofskills smash sepak takraw's(Y) of 0.4842x 100% = 0.2342 or 23.42%. 
(d). The direct effect of variable X1 on X3 (X1 → X3) or (r12) = 0.434. So the explosive effect of limb muscle power 
(X1) directly affects self-confidence (X3) of 0, 4342x 100% = 0.868 or 8.68%. 
(e). The direct effect of variable X2 on X3(X2 → X3) or (r23) = 0.3521. So the effect of nutritional status (X2) directly 
affects self-confidence (X3) of 0.3521 2x 100% = 0.642 or 6.42%. 
(f). The direct effect of variable X1 on X2(X1 → X2) or (r13) = 0.1188. So the explosive effect of limb muscle power 
(X1) directly affects the nutritional status (X2) of 0.11882x 100% = 0.2376 or 23.76%.

Abstract 
The purpose of this research is to identify the Empowerment Community which was held in the Buru Regency since 
the year 2005 to 2014. The approach used in this research using methods qualitative with the approach of the 
description, determination of informants using purposive with consideration of the informants are considered as related 
parties to achieve the research objectives. This study uses data collection techniques of observation, in-depth 
interviews and focus group discussions. Data analysis technique used to follow the concept of Miles, Huberman and 
Spradley. The results of the analysis of the data shows during the period 2005-2014 the implementation of 
empowerment in Buru Regency has not yet reached the value of the substance is visible of the low level of community 
understanding of the program overlapping the implementation of the program and the regional center as well as the 
dependence of the program on the system of budgeting. The results of the formulation of the empowerment model 
indicates there needs to be changes in the pattern of implementation of the empowerment program, namely the 
integration of Empowerment Community programs at the level of structure and operational. Hall program become 
central to the implementation of the program in a top-down and vice versa as well as have channels to avoid the 
buildup of empowerment programs in the area. Thus, the expected empowerment program more flexible to achieve 
the values of substantial and able to provide a solution to the problem of poverty 
1. Introduction
In the context of regional development, Empowerment Community is one of the priorities of the Buru District Government 
policy in efforts to overcome poverty towards achieving the development vision of Buru Regency that is “Buru Regency 
Society Forward Towards A Healthy Bupolo, Smart, moral, prosperous and independent” (Chairul Basrun Umanailo). As 
known, alleviation of the poor is one of the priorities for medium and long term development in Buru Regency. This 
Empowerment Community policy is implemented through a variety of programs or activities both funded by the Regional 
Revenue and Expenditure Budget and from various other sources, including the State Revenue and Expenditure Budget 
Buru Regency is one of the regions in Maluku Province with a relatively high poverty rate in the last 5 years (Afandi and 
Umanailo). this poverty problem, has directly affected the level of community welfare in Buru Regency, especially those in 
the countryside. Weak Empowerment Community in realizing prosperity is one indicator of the problem poverty (Solano 
Lara et al.). Various empowerment programs carried out by central and regional governments, it is known that it has not 
been able to answer various problems of poverty. Through research that has been done, known from 2005-2014 a number 
of Empowerment Community programs have been carried out in Buru Regency, but there are several problems that directly 
affect the sustainability of the program such as the target group, sustainability and the impact of the empowerment program. 
Dwi Pratiwi Kurniawati in a study of Empowerment Community in the field of economic business find a program that 
has been implemented by the Empowerment Community Agency of the City of Mojokerto especially in the Economic 
Business Sector covering individual assistance and institutional assistance has not been fully successful, dominance 
in the implementation by the local government made the program not run optimally (Kurniawati et al.). Meanwhile, 
Faizatul Karimah in his study of the management of village fund allocation in Empowerment Community showing 
normatively and administratively the management of village fund allocations is done well, but in substance it still has 
not touched the true meaning of empowerment (Karimah et al.). Achievement of indicators of Empowerment 
Community in the poor empowerment program Hairi Firmansyah's research shows that the indicators of 
Empowerment Community have not yet been achieved (level and basis of empowerment) (Prasetyono et al.) Isnan 
Murdiansyah shows several operational problems Gerdu-Taskin Program in Malang Regency like limited capital,

Figure 1. Elaboration Of Institutional Empowerment Community Model 
 
Sources of empowerment that comes from private parties, the Central Government as well as provincial government 
(Adamson) through the Canal heading to the ""hall program"" and so also with the empowerment resources originating 
from Buru Regency Government will tag along on the Canal towards ""hall program"". It is intended to create an 
integrated and accelerated management program – the program empowerment are integral (Luo et al.), So what was 
planned and who want to generated does not happen partially.  
Elaboration of institutional is a description of the subject matter regarding the circulation and distribution channel 
grouping and proposing of empowerment programs sourced from the Central Government and the regions as well as 
from private parties (Kaasinen et al.). 
Empowerment of private parties in the form of aid or grants program, in its implementation should participate on the 
channel so that in planning and implementing more focused on institutional undergoing the program. So are a variety 
of programs that come from the Central Government in this Ministry or ministerial institution, the provincial 
government, need to be included on channel program that leads to the ""hall program"" in the implementation of the 
necessary empowerment of intrinsic values in societies that also became a source of strength, like family values, co-
operation and unity. Independence of the community are elements that allow a society survive, and in the sense of a 
dynamic develop themselves and achieve progress. self-reliance community became a source of what it called political 
insight in national resilience. 
 
4.  Conclusion 
Empowerment Community is a process that aims to change. Empowerment Community is an effort to provide 
opportunities to the community at the same time the ability to play an active role in the development. One of the 
positive impact of Empowerment Community program implementation, is the community is able to take responsibility 
towards their work. of research results and the above discussion can be taken a few conclusions. 
Buru Regency is one of the areas in Maluku Province with potential natural resources abundant enough accompanied 
by the strength of local cultural life of community support for the achievement of well-being. From the beginning up 
to the present already formed a considerable amount of Empowerment Community programmes provide deit her by 
the central government and the regions as poverty reduction and the improvement of well-being. Empowerment 
programs based individuals and groups as community development efforts tend to overlap in one region of the 
implementation, lack of concentration and focus on the process and impact of programs implemented so that happened 
during this is empowerment in partial form and lack of synchronization and verification of the database or the 
individual target group.  
Weak data synchronization and networking opportunites for work program occurred attenuation of programs that have 
an impact on the target product so the program empowerment more stop on the implementation process and target 
group.  
The empowerment model integrates the findings of the implementation model is divided into two parts, institutional 
and operational basis to ease the process of implementation of the activities and the preparation of various instruments. 
The empowerment model integrates ease of initiation society to convey the proposals as well as stimulate the creativity 
of individuals and target groups in the implementation of Empowerment Community. 
Hall became the center of program implementation of the program that integrates the initiation, the process of 
implementation to monitoring and reporting the end of Empowerment Community team empowerment of village 
community became an important pillar for the process of implementation and accompaniment towards individuals or 
target groups in each village. The main source of initiation is derived from a structured society up to the hall program 
which are divided into internal initiation and sharing programs against the central government, local government or 
private parties.

Abstract 
This article aims to analyse  the use of qualitative methods by students in carrying out their studies at Iqra Buru 
University, then explained about information, reason, and the orientation they have about qualitative methods. The 
approach used in this study is descriptive qualitative, by using interviews as a data collection model and data analysis 
techniques in the form of textual analysis techniques from the results of field note transcripts. Results from the field 
show the theoretical information of the qualitative methods possessed by informants is still low causing reasons for 
use because the field of science is studied, while the orientation of informants prioritizes the use of qualitative methods 
to complete the final task. Conclusions from field studies show that the use of qualitative methods is still considered 
a complement in the completion of the informant's study, so it is difficult to get research results that have contributed 
to the development of qualitative methods.

1. Introduction
University of Iqra Buru as a higher education institution in the province of Maluku (Indonesia) set the devotion of the 
university which include education, research and community services with the aim of, Iqra Buru University students to have 
academic ability to suit the needs of the world of work. Thesis is the final assignment in the form of research to do a 
prospective undergraduate, Similarly, the quality of University research will be seen through the results of thesis students. 
Research by students at the college requires a clear method (Smith and Shaw), in this case there are two methods of research 
i.e. qualitative methods and quantitative methods. Qualitative research model domination often occurs on University 
students of social sciences as a convenience that is owned by that method (Eden and Ackermann). Term qualitative research 
according to Kirk & Miler originally a qualitative observations on disputed with quantitative observations (Booth et al.). 
They interpret qualitative method is a certain tradition in social science is fundamentally dependent observations to man in 
the relationship between the people (Gallopín). 
Nanis Susanti in the research about qualitative research paradigms in business, many models of consumer research suggests 
that on going qualitative studies as well as some businesses are starting to learn, develop, filter, as well as the need to apply 
qualitative research methods (Susanti).In the meantime, Ihwan indicates that qualitative methods can now be accepted for 
consumer research and the broader field of marketing, offers its research methods from the perspective of qualitative and 
some possible marketing research and its application in the measurement of business performance (Batubara). 
The orientation of previous research use of qualitative methods favor on more specific segmentation, as the development of 
qualitative methods for business research and marketing as well as the use of secondary data as a data source in the 
explanation of the subject matter of. This study is an overview of the use of qualitative methods by students focused 
discussion of actions and knowledge in choosing and applying qualitative methods as an approach to complete the final 
assignment.  
Understanding the results of previous research that has been done, then the researchers in this study raised the issue of how 
the pattern of election of the research methods for the settlement of the final project by students. The objectives to be achieved 
from these problems is to map the knowledge of students about qualitative methods as well as explaining the factor 
endowments as well as a barrier to the use of qualitative methods in students at the University of Iqra Buru.

Table 4 shows that the largest obstacles found on the use of the theory of 45.454%, to informants considered the 
factors that hinder the completion of the final project-related use of qualitative methods. In the elaboration of results 
the interview the author finds an understanding of students who consider the theory as a way of strengthening and 
justification of focus problems researched so sought the same theory with the phenomenon researched. The author 
understands the use of the relevant literature in qualitative research is to endorse the accuracy of the results of the 
findings of the research conducted, especially on qualitative research that tests the validity of a theory. With the use 
of existing literature, should informants can shed some light on various rationalization of the existence of differences 
and similarities of the theory or concept that is a result of the findings of research conducted with the theory or concept 
in the previous literature not vice versa impose similarity theory with object or the problems examined (Eden and 
Ackermann). 
In addition to theory, transcript (21.21%) and research reports (33.33%) regarded as an obstacle in the use of 
qualitative methods, from the interviews the author of auto summary, students seen trouble to compile the results of 
the interview transcript to made in the form of data. As for report, student difficulties with formatting and academic 
rules require that each report must adjust. The author's understanding of qualitative methods against the more 
descriptive analysis, this review of how to collect and collate the results of the interviews into a transcript, It's been a 
lot of digital technology enabling researchers in transferring voice data to writing (Smith and Shaw). Authors see this 
condition not as a barrier to the qualitative methods in yet more adjustments to the results on technological 
developments. For research reports, the difficulty is not included in the implementation of the research method but is 
a rule drawn up by the institution in order to facilitate comprehension and readability of the results of research 
conducted a student. 
 
4.  Conclusion 
Qualitative methods is one of the approaches used in making the students final assignment at the University of Iqra 
Buru. On the selection of research methods, the average student Iqra Buru prefer qualitative method by passing three 
main reasons. 3 main reasons i.e.ease of data analysis field, the process of collecting and processing data as well as 
the ease of getting a reference supporting the research process. The ease with which it is intended as a result of the 
implementation of the students against the interpretation of research related qualitative understanding they get during 
the process of learning at the University of Iqra Buru. 
The obstacles in the use of research methods in the form of interviews into a copy of the transcript, use of theory and 
the making the final report. For the making of transcripts, students still skimpy against the use and adjustments against 
facilities that make it easy to transfer digital data into interview transcript. The theory is the drag caused by the element 
of coercion against the theory with the phenomenon researched. To report form, drag caused by the factor of institution 
regulation  for ease in understanding the content of research conducted by the student. 
The limitations of an understanding of qualitative research into the main base of the students explain the ease and 
barriers in applying a qualitative approach to completion of the final project. Information and availability of the 
literature about qualitative research methods are the cause of the occurrence of such limitations. This research has yet 
to include the use of these kinds of approaches in qualitative methods such as Phenomenology, case studies, 
ethnography, grounded theory and so is expected to devote the existence of advanced research were able to elaborate 
on the use of more specific about research methods among college students.

1. Introduction
Educators through the chemistry learning processes expect their students to need improved 21st-century skills 
(Jufri 2015). Without skills such as collaboration and team work (Gunawan, 2015), creativity and imagination 
(Binkley, et al. 2012), critical thinking and problem-solving skills (vanLaar et al. 2017), students will not be able 
to participate in the global economy (Pekdag 2010). Additional skills that students must possess are skilled at 
using information and communication media (Greenbowe). The use of information technology in science learning 
was proven to be able to help improve problem solving skills (Gunawan et al.2017), and student creativity 
(Gunawan et al. 2017; Gunawan et al. 2018). The observations in the chemistry learning process in all classrooms 
in Indonesia shows that learning is still teacher-centered, students receive all the information from the teacher 
without additional information from other sources. This causes students unable to relate lessons received with 
their daily lives so that students' understanding of the content is only superficial (Agung and Schwartz 2007). The 
use of interactive media that supports the chemical learning process is also very rarely used (Coppola 2008). It 
causes chemical learning processes is less attractive (Ardac and Akaygun 2004). This interactive media is 
expected to explain many abstract concepts in chemistry easily. Furthermore, it can be used as a tool for 
visualizing chemical models and can be used as a substitute for chemical laboratory demonstrations. In this paper, 
we present the feasibility of green chemistry based interactive multimedia for use in chemistry learning. The 
development of interactive multimedia is based on the contextual teaching and learning model. The choice of 
acid-base topics for media development is in accordance with the contextual teaching and learning model because

advantages of interactive multimedia on each concept (Gunawan, et al 2016). This interactive multimedia 
developed in general has similarities with other multimedia, including multimedia components consisting of text, 
images, animation, simulation, video,and audio. Multimedia was developed to be a tool for chemistry learning, 
especially the concept of acid-base learning in class both by teachers and students. Multimedia is made to be used 
independently by students with the help of students worksheet. However, in general, this multimedia can also be 
used as a media presentation by the teacher in the classroom. This interactive multimedia is used in learning with 
contextual teaching and learning models. Various learning innovations with efforts to expand teaching materials 
have positioned the computer as a tool that contributes positively to the learning process, especially learning 
chemistry on acid-base material (Morgil et al. 2004). Computers can do some activities to help teachers. One 
innovation in computer-based learning is interactive multimedia. Computer-based interactive multimedia helps in 
delivering information in the learning process, carrying out teaching management, and providing stimulus to 
students during the learning process. Green chemistry-based interactive multimedia that we developed was 
computer-based multimedia. Feasibility test data from green chemistry-based interactive media were obtained 
from the results of questionnaire filling. The instrument is given to 3 experts to assess the feasibility of the product 
being developed. The results of the feasibility test are analyzed and carried out to revise the product in accordance 
with the expert's advice. The results of the feasibility test are shown in Figure 2. 
Figure 2.A validity test of green chemistry-based interactive multimedia  
(three different intensity of black colors in block diagram indicate three experts) 
Figure 2 shows the feasibility test of interactive multimedia products. The feasibility percentage of the syllabus 
was 85.53%, the feasibility percentage of the lesson plan was 78.67%, the feasibility percentage of the learning 
media was 81.08%, the percentage of feasibility of teaching material was 79.42%, the percentage of feasibility of 
scientific literacy instruments and creative thinking was 71.25% and 59.49%, respectively. The total percentage 
of all product items developed was 75.90%. Thus, it can be concluded that interactive chemistry based on green 
chemistry in the acid-basetopic is categorized as feasible to be applied. The results of research reinforce this 
finding by Sulistyono (2013) which states that interactive learning media developed using flash were categorized 
as feasible to be used in learning to administer servers in the network. This isalso supported by Priadana (2015) 
which states that interactive learning media assisted by Macromedia Flash software on basic competencies apply 
various basic logic circuit gates effectively to be used as learning media. In addition, research was conducted. 
Adawiyah et al. (2019) which states that interactive e-book can provide a positive response and increase students' 
learning interest as shown in the results of very high learning evaluations and excellent learning activities. 
Interactive multimedia that has been developed also has several drawbacks. The shortcomings in this study are as 
follows: (1) this research only arrived at the validation stage (2) this interactive multimedia has minimum 
computer specifications and requires users to install Adobe Flash software to run programs 
4. Conclusion
The development of green chemistry-based interactive media on the topic of acid-basewas generally categorized 
as having high validity. This shows that the products developed can be used in the chemistry learning process. 
This research will continue to examine the practicality and effectiveness of this interactive media.

Abstract 
The purpose of the research was to analyze sorghum pie products from the type and concentration of flour as a product 
diversification. The method used quantitative research with the study used a randomized block design (RBD) of 2 factors 
with 3 replications. I: type of flour (T): T1: red flour (Sorghum bicolor) and T2: white flour (KD 4). II: Concentration (K): 
K1: 25%; K2: 50%; K3: 75% and K4: 100%. Observations: organoleptic tests on the parameters of taste, color, taste and 
crispness, water content and carbohydrate. Organoleptic test using the Friedman test, while water and carbohydrate levels 
used variance test analysis followed by 5% duncan. The results showed: 1) Sorghum pie as one of alternative product 
diversification based on sorghum flour; 2) combination of sorghum pie best treatment: T1K3 (type of sorghum flour treated 
(T): T1 = Red Flour / Sorghum bicolor and concentration (K): K3 = 75 %); and the second sorghum pie: T2K3 (type of 
sorghum flour treatment (T): T2 = white flour / KD4 and concentration (K): K3 = 75%); 3) Sorghum pie is supporting 
diversification of alternative design products in higher education entrepreneurship.

1. Introduction 
Sorghum has good nutrition, in addition to carbohydrates, proteins, fats also contain minerals calcium, iron, phosphorus, and 
vitamin B1. Sorghum nutrition compared to other staple foods, sorghum calories 332cal per 100g, and carbohydrate content 
of sorghum 73g per 100g. But these grains have a high protein content (11 g per 100 g), calcium content (28 mg per 100 g), 
iron (4.4 mg), phosphorus (287 mg), vitamin B1 (0.38 mg ). Based on this, sorghum can be used as an alternative source of 
food. Sorghum can be used as raw material for semi-finished products which is directed at enriching the potential of sorghum, 
namely sorghum flour, one form of its use is to substitute wheat flour for making pie products (Kangama, 2005; Noerhartati, 
2010, 2012, and 2014). Pie is a savory snack, usually also

The test results of the sorghum Friedman product showed that the colour parameters were significantly different (Sig 0.006 
<0.05), while the taste parameters (Sig 0.086> 0.05), flavour (Sig 0.382> 0.05) and crispness (Sig 0.845> 0, 05) not 
significantly different. This means that the parameters of sorghum pie colour are influenced by both type factors and the 
concentration of sorghum flour. The colour of sorghum pie is strongly influenced by the colour of sorghum flour and the 
more flour is used, the colour will darken (FAO, 1999). 
3.2 Moisture Content Test 
The results of sorghum pie moisture content 2.17-2.22%, the variance analysis showed that sorghum pie moisture content 
levels Sig 0.144> 0.05, meaning that the sorghum pie moisture content was not significantly different (Kim , 2018). 
3.3 Alternative Selection 
The probability value indicates the level of importance of a basic state, the greater the probability value of a ground condition, 
the more important is the basic condition. For sorghum pie products, taste parameters (30%) are considered to be the most 
important parameters when compared with other parameters, which are moisture content (20%), crispness (20%), colours 
(19%), and flavour (11%). Alternative processes are compared to determine the optimal process. The selection of this 
alternative is done by calculating the expected value obtained by each alternative process. The results of the calculation of 
the expectation value for each alternative process are presented in Figure 3. 
Figure 3. Probability and Expectation Value Pie Sorghum 
Based on the results of the calculation of the expected value, the chosen treatment alternative is the treatment of T1K3 (T1 = 
Red flour / Sorghum bicolor (T1) and the concentration of sorghum flour K3= 75%), with the calculation of expectation value 
= 9.36, the second is the treatment T2K3 (T2 = White flour / KD4 (T2) and the concentration of sorghum flour K3 = 75%), 
with the calculation of the expectation value = 6.21. This means that the treatment is based on the best quality when compared 
to other treatments. Alternative processes are compared to determine the optimal process. The selection of this alternative is 
done by calculating the expected value obtained by each alternative process (Siferow, 2014). 
4. Conclusions 
Sorghum pie as one of alternative product diversification based on sorghum flour; combination of sorghum pie best treatment: 
T1K3 (type of sorghum flour treated (T): T1 = Red Flour / Sorghum bicolor and concentration (K): K3 = 75 %); and the 
second sorghum pie: T2K3 (type of sorghum flour treatment (T): T2 = white flour / KD4 and concentration (K): K3 = 75%).

Abstract 
Lean has its origin in the Toyota Production System. Aiming to deliver customer value through people’s respect and 
waste reduction, Lean advocates five principles: value specification, value stream identification, flow, pull and 
perfection. Knowledge management, through the process of identifying, capturing and leveraging knowledge, became 
a source for competitive advantage for organisations. This paper aims a contribution to a better understanding of Lean 
combined with Knowledge Management (KM) tools, through the study of the outcome from Lean and KM tools 
adoption in invoice verification process at a Portuguese shared services organisation. The study analysed how the 
execution time of a process depends on the operators who perform it and if operators’ individual practices have an 
impact on the process execution time. The implementation process was surveyed through observations and statistical 
analysis, which identified differences in terms of practices used by operators. Statistical evidence made it clear that 
best practices adopted by operators have a positive impact in their execution times. Moreover, it was also important 
to notice that Lean and knowledge management combined practices can be useful to organisations in a digital 
transformation program, which will require standardisation and process automation.

1. Introduction
Shared services organisations are dealing worldwide with the challenge of digitalisation, in order to shift from resource 
related processes to automation. To be competitive these organisations have been forced to introduce automation in 
their administrative processes, characterised by being massive and repetitive, so as to decrease operating costs and 
increase quality information and customer satisfaction. 
In Europe, European Union directives want public administrations to become ready to electronic invoicing (EI) and 
electronic procurement (EP) by 2020. In the meantime, benchmarking between countries regarding EI/EP 
implementation has been carried out (Knoch 2019).

their first priority, as long as the quality of the process was assured. Others were driven by time performance with no 
focus on process quality.  
 
4.2. Do operators’ individual practices have an impact on the process execution time? 
The Fisher LSD test allowed to ranked operators in top and worst time performance. It was confirmed that operator 9 
and operator 7 are the best time performers and operator 12 and operator 17 the worst time performers. In fact, 
operators 9 and 7, the two top time performers, are applying all the practices identified in the Lean gemba and KM 
storytelling. Operators 12 and 17 (the two worst time performers) are not applying these practices. This validates that 
the practices identified in gemba are in fact good practices.  
So, the study may conclude that good practices and their adoption in this invoice verification process have a positive 
impact on the execution time.  
 
5. Conclusions 
The study surveyed a finance shared services department through observations based on Lean gemba and waste 
identification combined with knowledge management tool, storytelling and KM approach internal benchmarketing. 
These tools were fundamental to identify the different practices adopted among the operators and the wastes in the 
process procedures.   
 
Statistical analysis were made with the support of statistica software, namely One-Way-ANOVA test, which led  to 
the conclusion that the process execution time is dependent on the operator who performs it, producing an effect of 
approximately 55 % in the variability of the process execution time. Hence, through the Fisher LSD test interception 
with the practices identified in the gemba and storytelling, it was proved that operators’ individual practices impact 
their process time performance. 
 
Also, the Fisher LSD test allowed to understand where the significant differences among the operators’ execution 
times were, and cross check with their current practices. Top performers were applying the same practices identified 
in the gemba and worst performers were not. This validated those practices as good practices, since it was proved they 
have a positive impact on the process time performance. 
 
Moreover, the lean and knowledge management tools allowed the identification of wastes through storytelling and 
visual analysis of the process procedure and their elimination via communities of practices and peer assistance. In this 
sense, it was proved that the combination of lean and knowledge management tools can be useful to organisations, 
such as organisation A, in a digital transformation program, by enabling the required standardisation, process 
automation and continuous improvement actions. 
 
Additionally, the study converged to the organisation knowledge management strategy, “Identification and share of 
best practices”, and consequently to the organisational business strategy of improving their operational performance. 
However, for the time being it is not possible to measure those contributions.    
 
For future studies it would be interesting to implement the mentoring knowledge management tool. Not only to share 
the good practices identified among the operators in the gemba, but also to understand the impact of sharing these best 
practices and to analyse how the log-normal distribution parameters of execution times will react.

Abstract 
Innovation has been crucial in developing sustainable business. Previous studies have also proved that 
innovation is one of the main strategies to compete in the globalized and diverse market. While many 
studies focus on innovation culture in large enterprises. Meanwhile, the MSME had not received enough 
attention despite their contributions to nations’ economic growth exist. Therefore, this study proposes an 
empirical investigation the influence of organizational culture, organizational learning and market 
orientation on innovation culture in MSMEs sector. This study is categorized a quantitative study with a 
mixed of direct and online questionnaires data collection technique. This study is conducted in big cities of 
MSME’s. Further, structural equation modelling was performed in order to test the construct relations in 
the theoretical framework of this study. This study found that organizational culture, organizational learning 
and market orientation have significant and positive impact on the creation of innovation culture among 
MSME’s in Indonesia. This study provides relevant information for MSMEs owners on the elements that 
could nurture innovation culture in their organizations. More effort should be devoted from practitioners 
and the government to comprehend the concept of innovation culture among MSMEs from the context of 
developing country.

Abstract 
The service quality of public sector organizations in Indonesia is currently considered to be less satisfactory 
than the private sector. One reason for the low performance of public sector employees is because the reward 
and punishment system is not applied firmly and consistently. The reward system is very important in both the 
private and public sectors, because rewards have a central role to keep employees motivated and tied to work. 
The Social Exchange Theory states that when a person is satisfied with the award given by the organization, 
they will reciprocate by developing a positive attitude towards the organization such as a higher level of 
commitment. This study aims to explore the effect of reward systems on the commitment and performance of 
public sector employees using quantitative methods. Analysis of research using primary data collected through 
questionnaires using survey methods and hypothesis testing using PLS software. The results showed that 
:extrinsic rewards negatively affected affective, normative, and sustained commitment; intrinsic and social 
rewards have a positive effect on affective, normative and sustainable commitment; Affective commitment has 
a positive effect on organizational performance, while normative and sustainable commitments negatively affect 
organizational performance

1. Introduction
The public sector is an institution whose funding sources come from the state budget; being in charge in 
providing public goods that can be accessed by any individual who is not under any competition (Ajmal 2015). 
It includes various organizations, which are used to make and implement decisions regarding the satisfaction of 
the public interest. The old paradigm which argues that the public sector provides public goods needed by public 
without any competition such as health and education at this time begins to shift, because many private sectors 
also play roles in providing public goods. This is where the competition starts between business organizations 
and public sector ones that provide the same public goods. For people whose level of welfare is high will choose 
schools managed by business organizations rather by the government, with the consideration private schools 
have better quality. Image ""Number-2 Quality"" has been attached to public sector services. 
Due to improve the performance of public sector organizations, miscellanous policies have been widely applied, 
including: bureaucratic reform, remuneration systems, certification, etc. However, none of these policies has 
been able to change the performance of the public sector yet. Therefore, it is very important to develop a 
systematic and consistent performance measurement system to improve organizational management and 
community satisfaction with the services provided and accessibility to public sector organizations. One of the 
causes of the low performance of public sector employees is the reward and punishment system is not applied 
strictly and consistently. The same appreciation to the employees who perform both well and badly causes 
motivations that ultimately affect employee commitment. 
Work commitment is an employee's psychological bond in the form of a very strong desire to remain as an 
employee in an organization characterized by his/her willingness to maximalize all the power and force for the 
benefit of the organization. The commitment depends on perceived organizational support which also affects 
employee attitudes and satisfaction. Two main factors that increase the level of employee job satisfaction are 
intrinsic and extrinsic motivation factors in the form of reward systems. Job satisfaction refers to employee 
outputs on their remuneration and other support from the organization. 
Reward systems are very important in the modern era. In both the private and public sectors, awards play a key 
role to keep employees motivated and tied to work. Human resources are the most important source of any

5. Discussion and conclusion 
Firstly, the reward system has a major role to keep employees motivated and tied to their work. Employees' 
positive perception to the organization develops when they feel the organization values their contribution and 
realizes the rewards in recognition of their hard work and effort. The loosening of the rules of employee 
management and the weak implementation of rewards and punishments in public sector organizations has led to 
a lack of satisfactory public service performance. When the public demand for excellent service and competition 
with the private sector in the supply of public goods is increasing, various policies such as bureaucracy reform, 
formation of Public Service Agencies (BLU), remuneration systems, etc. are applied. However, nowadays, these 
policies still have not produced maximum output yet. Referring to the Social Exchange Theory, the reason 
someone is involved in an exchange relationship with another person because of the relationship will be 
rewarded. Social exchange theory discerns between behavior and environment as reciprocal relationships. Some 
studies say that monetary rewards are considered the most effective way to increase employee commitment and 
performance, but the fact shows that the increase in monetary rewards has not been able to optimally improve 
the performance of public sector employees, such as: remuneration, salaries 13 and 14, educator certification 
etc. 
The results of this study are different from the results of previous studies which stated that extrinsic rewards 
have a positive effect on organizational commitment and performance. It shows that extrinsic rewards are not 
always able to improve employee performance because: first, referring to Crowding Theory that in certain 
conditions extrinsic reward actually weakens intrinsic motivation. Providing monetary rewards only increases 
performance within a certain time. When employees receive an increase in external rewards it will be followed 
by consumptive activity. This activity causes satisfaction with external rewards to last only for a while, then 
employees will try to seek additional rewards from other sources (there is a decrease in commitment); extrinsic 
reward expectations cause a person to behave as desired if there is a reward given. This effect is called The 
Hidden Cost of Reward. 
Secondly, social exchange theory sees there are reciprocal relationships between behavior and the environment; 
when the employee management system has not been implemented optimally in which there are still unfair 
procedures in the process of promotion, the impact on employee commitment is even given an increase in 
external reward. The study proves that the basic principle of social exchange is a ""distributive justice"" rule 
saying that a reward must be proportional to investment not always valid; but it is precisely procedural justice 
that perpetuates an exchange relationship. 
Lastly, pointing at the characteristics of respondents in which 81% had undergraduate education and 50% of 
respondents had worked more than 20 years, the need for intrinsic and social rewards is greater than the need for 
external reward. Even if there is an increase in external rewards, it will still have a negative impact on employee 
commitment and performance when the type of work they accomplish is below their competence,. This is 
reflected in the last main function and position of each public sector job is to carry out duties in accordance with 
the orders of superiors. This rule requires employees to do whatever the boss instructs, even if it has nothing to 
do with official duties, ultimately creating employee dissatisfaction.

Abstract 
Poverty is a fairly complex problem at the regional and national levels, so the government must have the right 
and sustainable strategy in handling it. Indonesia is a country in the category of developing countries and has 
problems in terms of poverty. Education, MSEs, population growth, unemployment, economic growth are 
factors that trigger problems in poverty alleviation. Lamongan Regency is included in the 10 Regencies / Cities 
in East Java Province with the largest percentage of poor people with a percentage of 14.42% in 2017. The aim 
of the study was to examine and analyze the influence of educational factors, MSEs, population growth, 
unemployment on poverty levels directly or indirectly through economic growth. The analysis technique uses 
path analysis with data from 2002 to 2017. The results of the study show that the Lamongan Regency 
government has a commitment to improve education, MSE and economic growth. However, it is not optimal in 
dealing with population growth, unemployment and poverty levels. There are a number of constraints, including 
the measurement of poverty that is not uniform among related institutions. In addition, social and cultural 
factors have not been optimally considered.

Introduction
The purpose of the development of an area is to increase economic growth which is expected to reduce 
unemployment and poverty in the area. Maipita (2014) states that the ultimate goal of economic development is 
to improve people's welfare. The condition of poverty in a country is a reflection of the level of welfare of the 
population living in the country / region (Christanto 2013). The government has tried to overcome poverty 
through several government programs such as Repelita II-V during the 1976-1996 period. Even after the 1997 
crisis, along with the regional autonomy policy that focused on districts / cities, the government also 
implemented various kinds of policies and programs in tackling poverty. However, there are still gaps between 
the plan and the achievement of goals due to the lack of good and integrated integration in solving the problem 
of poverty. 
Understanding of poverty according to Amarta Sen in Bloom and Canning (2001) in Revi (2010) is a person 
said to be poor if he experiences ""capability deprivation"" where a person experiences a substantive lack of 
2463","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

In addition, there is a tendency to measure the level of poverty among related institutions which is not uniform, 
resulting in an economic bias and invalid. Inequality in the measurement of poverty in Indonesia is supported by 
the statement of the Minister of Social Affairs Khofifah Indar Parawansa, that data on poverty in Indonesia is 
still not uniform. Differences occur because indicators to determine poverty for each institution are different. 
The institutions that have different indicators are the World Bank, the National Team for the Acceleration of 
Poverty Reduction (TNP2K), the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Central Statistics Agency (BPS), and the 
National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas), which have their respective references. This uniformity of 
poverty indicators makes it easier to measure poverty indicators so that measurements are easier. 
 
Effect of Unemployment Rate on Poverty Level Through Economic Growth in Lamongan Regency 
The study results prove that the unemployment rate in Lamongan Regency encourages high levels of poverty 
through economic growth. That is, that when unemployment increases, poverty will also increase. 
Unemployment results in a decrease in people's income, which will reduce the level of prosperity achieved. If 
the community does not work, the consequence is that they cannot meet their needs well and the impact will be 
that they will fall into the category of poor people. For this reason, the government must make sustainable 
empowerment programs, even though empowerment programs already exist, but in practice the results have not 
been maximized. Monitoring and evaluation of empowerment programs is still weak, not optimal in synergizing 
grant programs from various related agencies, so that the community not only bears the burden and in the end 
the community empowerment program is not optimal and the poverty level is not maximized. However, the 
Lamongan Regency government has succeeded in reducing unemployment, of course this is inseparable from 
the government's role in alleviating poverty, one of which is to build a Training Center that is able to provide 
training to workers, and reduce poverty in Lamongan Regency. This proves that the Job Training Center has 
successfully carried out its duties effectively and efficiently. 
 
5. 
Conclusion 
The results of this study provide some conclusions, such as the high level of education in Lamongan Regency 
has not been followed by economic growth, because the availability of employment in a broad area is still 
limited so there are still many open unemployment rates. People who do not work cannot fulfill their 
consumption, so economic growth is low. At present, Lamongan Regency is ranked as the top 10 in the poorest 
City District in East Java. However, there has been an increase in the number of MSEs which has triggered a 
fairly good rate of economic growth. 
The population growth in Lamongan Regency has not had a direct effect on the level of economic growth, while 
the unemployment rate in Lamongan Regency has encouraged high rates of economic growth. This phenomenon 
gives the idea that economic growth is not triggered by people's consumption needs derived from their income. 
On the other hand, higher levels of education have an impact on the decline in poverty rates through high 
economic growth. In addition, there is an increase in MSEs which will reduce poverty through improving 
economic growth. There is something interesting when the population growth rate increases, the poverty rate 
also increases through increasing economic growth. This indicates that the consumption needs of the community 
are not spent on income from work but from income as migrant workers and migrant workers or from 
government grants. In addition, there is a tendency to measure the level of economic growth that is less valid 
and the measurement of non-uniform poverty rates between institutions that empower communities. 
The Lamongan Regency Government must continue to improve job training programs that are competitive and 
certified to produce a workforce that is superior in terms of education and expertise so that it has high 
competitiveness. In addition, it must always improve monitoring and evaluation of all community empowerment 
programs that are rolled out to the community. This is done to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of 
community empowerment programs, so that the poverty rate in Lamongan Regency can be reduced optimally 
and provide effective education to the people of Lamongan District so that the programs rolled out are more 
useful in alleviating poverty. There must be uniformity in measuring poverty levels between related institutions.

From the side of the structure, law enforcement officers in this case the police as the first law enforcers to process 
crime, improve exist legal structure, maximizing the working system of law enforcement apparatus. In addition, law 
enforcement officers not only take action against the crimes that occur but also take actions that prevent the 
occurrence of crime, in this case cyber crime, through the socialization of high school and junior high school, as one 
of the environment that most affect the character of a person / child. (Suparni, 2001) 
 
Factors cause the difficulty of solve cybercrime cases . 
The difficulty of solve cyber crime cases most often is due to lack of evidence and determine locus delicti or the 
determination of the crime was done. Determination of where it was done very difficult to determine because cyber 
crime is a cyber crime committed anywhere, even with the current technological sophistication it is possible that 
criminal used equipment difficult allows or even not tracked where the crime was committed. This also supports the 
difficulty of looking for evidence for cybercrime cases. 
Another cause of the difficulty of cybercrime case resolution because of many cases that occur, whether reported or 
was not reported to the authorities. This is due to the easy access to study the crime, either directly from the internet, 
or learn from colleagues or others. Society also affects the number of cybercrime actions; there are still many people 
who did not really understand the rules or laws that concern cybercrime, so sometimes there are still people who rate 
cybercrime not a problem too serious to discuss. (Widyopramono, 1994) 
 
4. Conclusion 
The earliest cybercrime settlement used a persuasive way then proceeded, enhancing the quality of law enforcement 
in settlement the case, making the law the foundation of every action to create equality before the law and the 
supremacy of the law. Factors cause the difficulty of cybercrime settlement that is, the number of people who still 
did not understand the existence Law of Information and Electronic Transactions in Indonesia, felt the difficulty of 
this cybercrime settlement because it was difficult to determine locus delicti or where the crime was done, because of 
the technological sophistication that made it possible to not traceable internet access.

Abstract 
Computer technology can be used for learning assessment activities, commonly called e-assessment. Assessment is 
an important part of learning. This study aims to develop an e-assessment model using a Moodle-based learning 
management system. This development research uses the DDD-E model, including define, design, develop, and 
evaluate. This e-assessment development uses Moodle 3.0 Software. In the e-assessment model generated the 
questions can be accessed by physics teacher candidates flexibly. This model can help students to evaluate 
independently to know the level of learning achievement. In addition, this model also encourages motivation and 
learning to solve the problems given

1. Introduction
The development of computer technology brings a significant impact in life, including in the field of education. 
Computer technology in the field of education can be utilized for academic information systems, learning media, 
and assessment. Gunawan & Liliasari (2012) stated that some forms of interaction, such as practice, practice, 
tutorial, andproblem-solving,couldbe raised through computer technology. Computer technology that applied to 
physics learning can improve students’ creativity (2017). The interactive display in the computer program helps 
students recall the material discussed earlier (Gunawan et al. 2017).  
Assessment in education is a must and a fundamental aspect of teaching. Therefore, accurate assessment is related to 
the learning process (Kearns 2012). Both of themare the system that has been built for years in the scope of 
education and can not be separated. A teacher will succeed in gathering information about the process, the product, 
or the attitude of the student through an assessment. While students have a role as an object that will get benefit 
from the test results that is in the form of information about the stage of development that has been achieved 
Based on the aspect of meaningfulness in the education process, the assessment serves as: first, the selector, that is 
obtaining information about whether or not the student is successful in learning, whether or not the student passes 
the exam, whether or not the student goes to the next level or not, and whether or not the award is given; secondly, 
as a diagnostic tool, namely the detection of students' mental normality; third, the placement basis, such as the basis 
of class division, the basis of the award of the scholarship recipient or an award, or the determination of the division 
of the group; fourth, the success of the teachers. The success of teachers in guiding, success in learning for students, 
the success of institutional programs, and the success of education in general (Supriyadi 2002).

Overall, the e-assessment model has been successfully applied in the evaluation of several physics courses. Students 
were also excited about the tests in this model. Online exam models in e-assessment can improve concentration and 
train students' thinking processes. The use of e-assessment in assessment is excellent and relevant to create an 
effective and efficient learning environment. The results of e-assessment were also clear, fair, and encourage 
students to keep learning better. 
 
4. Conclusion 
This research has successfully developed the e-assessment model using learning management system (LMS). LMS 
uses Moodle 3.3 software. The developed e-assessment has been validated by the expert and declared eligible to be 
used for the evaluation of physics learning. Questions in the e-assessment model can be made in a variety of forms 
such as multiple choice, essay, and another form. At the testing stage, the number of questions on each display 
influenced the participant's focus in answering. 
The random and different question between the students made them more focused on answering independently than 
conventional tests with almost identical order and type questions. The time limit in working on the question made 
the student more disciplined and used the time wisely. Quick feedback and follow-up recommendations help the 
student to know the weakness during the test so they will prepare for the next test. 
During the study, there were no significant obstacles due to adequate internet access, an easy feature for students. 
However, this should be maintained in subsequent research. Another thing that should be controlled during the test 
is that students do not open a new tab for internet access on other sites.

Abstract 
This study was done to find out the effect of using the technology in the Community Language Learning (CLL) 
Method for teaching-learning speaking English with second semester students in the English Education Study Program 
at a private university in West Java in an effort to improve the English speaking skills of the students. This study used 
an action research method where the researcher was accompanied by an observer as a collaborator. Three cycles were 
done for this study. Data were gathered from observations, a questionnaire and tests. The mean of index gain score 
from the preliminary study to the post-test 1 was 0.12. The mean of index gain score from post-test 1 to post-test 2 
was 0.18. While The mean of index gain score from post-test 2 to post-test 3 was 0.32. Hence the results showed that 
the use of technology in the CLL method was a success. The students enjoyed their lessons more, and were more 
motivated, interested and confident during the teaching learning sessions. From the finding it is strongly recommended 
to use technology in assisting to gain the purposes of English teaching and learning.

1. Introduction 
Speaking skills is one of the most challenging and demanding aspects of language for learners to master (Guo 2014). 
Of the four skills, speaking skill usually gets the first priority in English teaching (Lumettu and Runtuwene 2017). 
The ability to speak in a foreign language is at the very heart of what it means to be able to use a foreign language 
(Luoma 2008). Being able to speak to friends, colleagues, visitors and even strangers, in their language or in a language 
clearly, lucidly, and fluently is surely the goal of very many learners. Yet speaking in a foreign language is very 
difficult (Luoma 2008), (Alharbi 2015), (Gani, Fajrina, and Hanifa 2015). It takes a long time to develop and needs a 
lot of practice and strong will-power to continue practicing (Ghiabi 2014). For many ESL/EFL learners, even speaking 
short sentences is a difficult task for them. To speak in a foreign language learners must master the sound system of 
the language, have almost instant access to appropriate vocabulary and be able to put words together intelligibly with 
minimal hesitation. It is in line with what (Leong and Ahmadi, 2017) claimed that to speak English is not easy because 
skills like pronunciation, grammar, vocabulary, plus fluency, and comprehension need to be mastered by the speakers.","Proceedings of the International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Operations Management

Figure 17. Mean Scores of Index Gain from All Four Speaking Tests 
 
This graphic clearly indicates that there is improvement of the students from cycle to cycle. The mean of index gain 
in pre-test to post-test 1 was 0.21. The mean of index gain score of post-test 1 to post-test 2 was 0.18. The mean of 
index gain score of post-test 2 to post-test 3 was 0.32. Overall, it can be concluded that there were improvement of 
students’ speaking ability from cycle to cycle and the implementation of Orai as a product of technology in CLL 
method was success. 
 
5. Conclusions 
This study showed that orchestrating technology in the CLL method as a means of organizing learning activities for 
speaking resulted in improving the EFL speaking ability of the students. The devices available in Orai help the students 
to study individually and in group. They can learn within in the classroom or out the class room. By the assistance of 
media the students enjoyed their lessons more and were more motivated, interested and confident during the teaching- 
learning sessions. Therefore, the CLL method should be applied in activities designed for teaching-learning EFL 
speaking. It is recommended that the CLL method should be extended for teaching-learning other language skills, 
such as reading, phonology, conversation skills, interpreting, and drama. Yet, Orai has some weaknesses. It relays 
much on the availability of internet connection and costly. It also not able to give any suggestion related on the 
grammatical error. For these weaknesses it is suggested that the institution should provode the sufficient facilities for 
the successful of teaching and learning. And for the founder of this application should think the solution of the 
weakness of the application by making some improvement on the device.

Abstract 
One of service quality assessment is patient satisfaction. Perceived value will affect patient satisfaction 
(customer satisfaction). This research aimed to analyze the effect of service quality to perceived value of 
impatiens at private hospitals in Surabaya. It was explanatory research cross sectional approach. The population 
was 162 patients with 140 samples at 4 private hospitals type B in Surabaya taken using proportional random 
sampling in each hospital. The data was analysed using analysis techniques of regression weight, standardized 
regression weight, and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) through multi-group or multi-sample analysis 
approach to test the effect of exogenous and endogenous. Results of the variable parameter estimation Service 
Quality to the perceived value based on the indicators showed significant results in value CR 2.264. This value 
is greater than 1.96. Besides, it was acquired a significance level 0.024 (P <0.05). So it was substantiated that 
the hypothetical of service quality had significant effect to the perceived value. The perceived value was the 
patient's perception to the value of quality offered being higher than competitors will affect the levels of 
consumer loyalty. The higher the value perceived, the higher the relation happened in the hospital (transaction).

Introduction
Quality is the core of viability of an institution. The quality revolutionary movement through integrated quality 
management approach becomes the demands that should not be ignored if an institution wants to live and thrive. 
The intense competition lately claims providers of services for patients to provide the best service [1]. 
To keep the patients, hospital is claimed to keep the trust and the needs of patients carefully as an effort to fulfill 
the hopes and expectations for the services provided. In this case, patients who expect hospital services are not 
only those who expect medical services but also expect comfort, good accommodation, and harmonious 
relationship between the hospital staff with patients. Thus, an improvement in the quality of health services at 
the hospital is needed. 
According to the Data obtained in the private Hospitals in Surabaya, complaints of patients are increased from 
year to year and those complaints are various starting to the parking lot to the other services that directly used by 
the patient. All core services and support services got complaints until the patient out from the hospital. Most 
complaints related to quality of services. 
Companies need to manage the emotions of patients to create positive emotions and reducing negative emotions. 
Rating of patients’ emotions may include feeling angry, happy, scared, anxious, unhappy, dissatisfied or bored. 
Patients who have positive emotions tend to give a good evaluation while patients who are dissatisfied tend to 
give a bad evaluation. 
The perceived value is a form of patient evaluation. Value felt by the patients is the overall value of utility of 
products based on the perception of what is accepted and what is given [2]. Perceived value affects patient 
satisfaction. Kotler, et.al. [3] pointed out that customer satisfaction is the level of one's feelings after comparing 
the performance or results which he/she felt compared to his/her expectations. If the cost spent by patients is 
appropriate with their expectations or more than what they expect, it will make them satisfied and vice versa. 
According to Parasuraman, et. al. [4] quality services are built based on their comparison of two main factors, 
the customer's perception of the services they received in real (perceived service) and the services that are 
actually expected or desired by the customer (expected service). If the services received or perceived are as 
expected, then the perceived service quality is good and satisfactory. If the services received are more than what 
patients expected, the quality of service is considered as the ideal one. Otherwise, if the service received is lower

The service of doctors, nurses, and adequate medical equipment is very important to improve the quality of core 
services at the hospital. This will make the patient's perceived value positive and it can be used as a basis to test 
and analyze the influence between the two variables. 
The service of doctors and nurses that are friendly, attentive, skilled, and polite promotes the establishment of 
positive perceived value, so it will be appropriate with the expectation of patients in private hospital in 
Surabaya. Medical tools owned that are complete, fully functional, and modern will support the core quality of 
service resulting positive perceived value of patients in the private hospital in Surabaya increased. The higher 
service quality, the higher positive perceived value of patients in private hospital in Surabaya will be. 
The result of this research supports the results of studies that have been conducted by Mort [10],  Hume [6], 
Skogland and Siguaw [7], and Pattersson et al. [9]. The hypothesis states that service quality significantly 
influence the perceived value. 
 
5. 
Conclusion 
Service quality (X1) is positively influenced the perceived value (Y2) in privat hospital class B in Surabaya. It 
means that the better patient's perception of service quality applied by a private hospital class B in Surabaya, the 
better (positive) the perceived value wil be. Therefore, the medical tools must be improved such as by providing 
new and modern additional medical equipment. With the new and modern additional medical devices, it will 
provide patients with better care.

Islamic Social Reporting (ISR) disclosure. The research is research explanatory which used secondary data listed 
companies at Jakarta Islamic Index (JII) by 2013 – 2017. The research results show that the size has positive 
effects not significant toward Islamic Social Reporting (ISR) disclosure. The size of the company also directly 
influence positively but not significantly to firm value, insignificant effect mediation through Islamic Social 
Reporting (ISR) disclosure. Profitability has a negative significant toward Islamic Social Reporting (ISR) 
disclosure and firm value positive insignificant effect mediation through Islamic Social Reporting (ISR) 
disclosure. Environmental performance has a positive significant impact on ISR disclosure and firm value but has 
no significant effect through ISR disclosure. This study also found that the influence of ISR disclosure has a 
positive insignificant effect on firm value.

Introduction
Today’s business environment is more complicated than ever. Investors are forcing managers to focus on value 
maximization. For most companies and at most times, managers do focus on shareholder value maximization, 
because in the long run stockholders do remove directors and managers who fail in their fiduciary duty (Brigham 
and Daves 2007). The value of the company is the investor's perception of the level of success of the company 
that is closely related to its stock price (Sujoko and Ugy 2007). High stock prices make the value of the company 
also high, and increase market confidence not only in the company's current performance but also in the company's 
prospects in the future. 
The stock price used generally refers to the closing price and is the price that occurs when the stock is traded on 
the market (Fakhruddin and Sopian 2001). Corporate value as a form of investor response and the image formed 
of a company is influenced by several factors including profitability, company size, capital structure, company 
growth, and so forth. The formation of the company's positive image is described through social responsibility 
activities known as Corporate Social Responsibility Disclosure (CSRD). CSR disclosure activities are used by 
companies to take a role and in facing the economy towards a free market. CSR is an idea makes the company no 
longer faced with the responsibilities are based on the single bottom line, namely corporate value which is 
reflected in its financial performance (financial) but the company's responsibility must also be based on the triple 
bottom line which includes economic aspects/profit, social/people, and environment/planet (Achmad Daniri 
2008). 
The importance of CSR activities carried out by the company is not enough to only be answered by stating that 
CSR has been mandated by the Law. If CSR is considered important only because of law, companies will tend to 
be forced and half-heartedly implementing CSR. There must be a philosophical understanding and ethical 
commitment to CSR. The importance of CSR needs to be based on the company's awareness of the facts about

Conclusion 
Firm size has a positive but not significant effect on ISR disclosure. This indicates that the size of the company 
proxied through the company's total assets does not affect the level of corporate ISR disclosure registered in JII 
for the 2013-2017 period. 
Profitability has a negative and significant effect on ISR disclosure. This indicates that the higher the profitability 
value proxied through the company's Return on Assets (ROA), it will result in a decrease in the level of corporate 
ISR disclosures listed in the JII for the 2013-2017 period. 
Environmental performance has a positive and significant effect on ISR disclosure. This indicates that the better 
the company's environmental performance, the higher the ISR disclosure of companies listed in the JII 2013-2017. 
The size of the company has a direct positive effect but not significant on the value of the company, and has no 
significant effect through ISR disclosure. This indicates that the size of the company does not affect the level of 
ISR disclosure, and indirectly also does not affect the value of the company. Or in other words, ISR disclosure is 
not able to mediate the relationship of company size to firm value. 
Profitability has a direct and significant negative effect on the value of the company, but has no significant effect 
through ISR disclosure. This indicates that profitability affects the level of ISR disclosure, but indirectly does not 
affect the value of the company. Or in other words, ISR disclosure is not able to mediate the relationship of 
profitability to the firm value. 
Environmental performance directly and positively influences the value of the company, but has no significant 
effect through ISR disclosure. This indicates that environmental performance affects the level of ISR disclosure, 
but indirectly does not affect the value of the company. Or in other words, ISR disclosure is not able to mediate 
the relationship between environmental performance and firm value. 
ISR disclosure has a positive but not significant effect on the value of the company. This indicates that the high 
or low level of corporate ISR disclosure does not affect the value of the companies listed on the JII 2013-2017 
period.

Abstract 
The research aims to study the effect of training methods and reaction time on skill of sprint 100 meter. The research 
was conducted using an experiment method that is by giving a training program to the teste. The population used is 
44 male students of physical education. Sampling was conducted through total sampling technique. Assessment of 
reaction time was conducted using the whole body reaction test, while the assessment of the results of 100 meter 
sprint skills used a 100 meter run test instrument that has been validated by experts in the field of athletics. The 
results of the assessment are numbers with a scale of 100. This research produce: 1) The method of interval training 
produces a higher value (85.62) compared to the continuous training method (80.41). 2) The training method and 
reaction time produces interactions with 100 meter speed skills of 59,386. 3) Interval training methods produces 
higher values (92.39) compared to the continuous training method (81.39) in the high reaction time category. 4) The 
interval training method produces a lower value (78.85) compared to the continuous training method (79.44) in the 
low reaction time category.

Exercise methods, reaction time and skill of sprint 100 meter 
1. Introduction
Sprint 100 meter skill is an ability that is characterized by the process of moving body position from one place to 
another quickly. Thus to produce a fast run, the things that need to be considered are: the posture is leaning forward, 
the footsteps must be longer, the hand swings must be in accordance with the foot movements and the arm 
movements where the fingers are clenched or opened tightly and relaxed . This is so that the maximum time can be 
reached up to the finish line. (Bompa and Michael 2015); (Gembata 2007); (Harrison 2010); (Housewright 2009) 
and (Shepherd 2007). 
Several factors that absolutely determine the good and bad of runners in the sprint are three things: start, sprint 
movement (when running), and finish (Freeman 2014); (Peter 2013) and (Joseph 2000). Basic techniques must be 
mastered by all runners in order to run quickly based on multilateral ability to move. The exercise that needs to be 
developed on runners is the ability of the right basic techniques with good basic physical abilities. Therefore, 
lecturers who teach athletic courses are required to understand the training stages from the aspects of the exercise so 
that they know when and how much the training portion is. Students who have the ability to run a good basic 
technique will be able to use it in various situations, so as to provide convenience in applying tactics, then able to 
create maximum results to achieve victory.  
Schmidt, et. al (2016) and Shepherd (2007) say short distance runners must get high speed in the shortest possible 
time in order to succeed in the race. Thus, runners must have a good start time and  be able to increase speed, and 
maintain the maximum speed at the remaining distance to the finish line.

Thus 1) The interval training method produces a higher value (85.62) compared with continuous exercise method 
(80.41). 2) The training method and reaction time produces interactions with 100 meter speed skills of 59,386. 3) 
The interval training method produces a higher value (92.39) compared to the continuous training method (81.39) in 
the high reaction time category. 4) The interval training method produces a lower value (78.85) compared to the 
continuous training method (79.44) in the low reaction time category. 
Based on table 3, the interval training method produces a higher value (85.62) compared to the continuous training 
method (80.41), so it can be concluded that there are significant differences in the 100 meter speed skills between 
the interval training method group and the group continuous training method namely p-value = 0.049 / 2 = 0.0245 < 
0.05 or h0 is accepted (Table 4), thus the interval training method is superior or high than the group value of the 
continuous training method. The findings from other studies suggest that the interval training method in its use can 
increase oxygen absorption and reduce injury (Herzog 2017) and (Shi et al 2018). Because in the interval training 
method there are breaks (Avery and Wayney 2009) and (John and Juliette 2005). Likewise the statement from Cissik 
and Dawes (2015) interval training method can minimize the effects of fatigue and burn calories. 
Based on table 5, it is stated that the training method and reaction time produce interactions with 100 meter speed 
skills of f0 59,386. This means there is significant interaction effect between the practice and the reaction time of the 
100-meter dash skill that is p-value = 0.000 < 0.05 or h0 is accepted. Furthermore, it can be seen from the analysis 
that the influence of the training method variable and reaction time on 100 meter speed skills is RSquared = 0.664 x 
100 = 66.40%. Thus, it can be explained that the 100 meter speed skill besides being influenced by the training 
method, is also influenced by reaction time. Results between training methods and reaction times were also found in 
other sports studies such as research on table tennis (Atmaja and Tomoliyus 2015) and karate sports (Santos 2016).  
Based on table 3, the interval training method produces higher values (92.39) compared to the continuous training 
method (81.39) in the high reaction time category. It can be concluded that there are significant differences in the 
values of 100 meter speed skills between groups of training methods. interval with continuous group training 
methods in high category, p-value = 0.000 / 2 = 0.000 < 0.05 or h0 is accepted (Table 6). Thus the interval training 
method is superior or higher than the group scores trained with continuous training methods in the high category. 
The findings indicate that those who have a high reaction quickly react to the response or the stimulus given as the 
sound of a gun at the start (Jhon 2007). This relates to reflex time, movement time, and response time. The impulse 
reflex is delivered from the sensory nerve to the reflex center and then to the efferent nerve, then to the effector, 
(Lailatul 2009). 
Based on table 3, the interval training method produces a lower value (78.85) compared to the continuous training 
method (79.44) in the low reaction time category, so it can be concluded that there is no significant difference 
between the interval training method and the continuous training method on categories reaction time low of p-value 
= 0.826 / 2 = 0.413 > 0.05 or h0 is  rejected (Table 6). The findings suggest that the training process in the 
continuous method is continuous exercise without rest (Harris et al. 2014) and Continuous training involves a longer 
duration of exercise at a lower intensity (Kalyani 2004).  
This research resulted in the interval training method and the continuous training method can increase the running 
speed of 100 meters, while according to the results of the report Wewege et. al (2017) says that the interval training 
method and the continuous training method can increase body composition in overweight adults. Thus the interval 
training method can improve 100 meter speed skills and can lose weight. 
The research produced an interval method training program consisting of 30 meters, 60 meters, 80 meters and 100 
meters running can increase the speed of 100 meters running from the start start to the finish line. Whereas 
according to the report of Mackala et. al (2015) said that the determinant factor of acceleration at the initial 
acceleration was at the start time to the distance of 30 meters. Thus the interval training method for acceleration is 
not only at a distance of 30 meters, but starts at the start of the start to the finish line.  
Thus based on the results of the above research, the researcher recommends that the method of interval training be 
more influential than the continuous training method in an effort to improve 100 meter speed skills. In accordance 
with the results of the report Pattyn et al. (2016), it was shown that aerobic interval training was superior to 
continuous training in increasing training capacity. 
 
5. Conclusion 
Conclusions in this research are in accordance with the submission of hypotheses from the results of hypothesis 
testing conducted. It can be concluded that : 1) There is a difference between the interval training method and the 
continuous training method for 100 meter speed skills. 2) There is an interaction effect between the training method 
and reaction time on 100 meter speed skills. 3) There is a difference between the interval training method and the 
continuous training method in the category of high reaction time on the results of 100 meter speed skills. 4) There is

no significant difference between the interval training method and the continuous training method in the low 
reaction time category on the results of the 100 meter speed skill. 
The implications of this research are made from research conclusions and are a reflection of the research findings. 
With the existence of this research, it can be used as a basis for further research regarding the variables in it. 
However, the results of this research are not the only ones that have become a reference, perhaps there should be 
other references that have other views about the influence of other training methods in order to develop 100 meter 
speed skills. These results can be used as a theoretical basis for taking action both for further research in the scope of 
academics, schools, or training centers especially the Indonesian Athletics Association (PASI). In addition, the 
results of this research can be used as a reference for developing research in other places that have similar problems 
or conditions in improving 100 meter speed skills.

Introduction
Based on its function and application, Research and Development method is one form of research method that is 
relevant and can be used in the education field. It is also widely used to develop teaching materials, learning 
media, and learning management. In addition, it is a method of connecting or breaking gaps between basic 
research and applied research (Sukmadinata 2008). Argued that exercise is a systematic activity in a particular 
long time which is progressively and individually improved and leads to the characteristics of human 
physiological and psychochemical functions to achieve predetermined goals (Bompa and Haff 2009). 
Exercise is a process that involves many aspects of knowledge because it involves body components that need to 
be systematically developed and science that supports exercises including physiology, motion learning, 
pedagogy, nutrition, biomechanics, psychology, sports health, tests, measurements, and statistics (Whyte 2009). 
Stimulation in exercise is needed so that an athlete starts changes in his/ her body (Pupisová et al. 2015). The 
speed in swimming is very important because it allows swimmers to allocate time as quickly as possible 
(Sanders et al. 1995). The pace of exercise at various swimming speeds and combinations is an important part of 
exercise before competition (Messinis and Platanou 2010). Swimming exercises can improve motor skills and 
basic swimming methods (Ganchar et al. 2017). 
Defined motion skills as movements that follow a particular pattern or form that requires coordination or control 
of part or all of the body that can be done through the learning process (Widiastuti 2011). A person who is able 
to move his/ her skills well is called a skilled person. Swimming in a butterfly stroke technically includes body 
position, leg movements, breathing, coordination between foot movements, breathing and hand rotation, 
coordination between breathing and hand movements, improvement of stroke, and coordination of all 
movements during swimming. Research conducted by found that the application of properly-made exercise 
programs will make learners adapt to the aquatic environment, basic swimming skills, and foundation in 
practicing many complex swimming strokes (Ildikó et al. 2017). 
The objectives of the research were developing drill-based exercise model on butterfly stroke swimming for 
athletes in the age group of 11-13 years; and improving butterfly stroke swimming skill for athletes in the age 
group of 11-13 years.

Research Methodology
Research on the development of the exercise model of butterfly stroke swimming is developed as a guideline for 
coaches to provide variations in butterfly stroke swimming practice for athletes, especially in the age group of 
11-13 years.

butterfly stroke swimming skill for athletes in the age group of 11-13 years can be used in the swimming 
exercise for athletes in the age group of 11-13 years and is very effective in improving their butterfly stroke 
swimming skill.. This discussion section will present 4 explanations which include (1) model strengths, (2) 
model weaknesses, (3) model supporting factors, and (4) model inhibiting factors. 
Model Strengths 
The strengths of the drill-based exercise model of butterfly stroke swimming skill for athletes in the age group 
of 11-13 years can be seen from the final product in the form of a module and exercise media for butterfly stroke 
swimming skill focusing on athletes in the age group of 11-13 years. Swimming coaches will be greatly helped 
by the existence of module and media of the drill-based exercise model of butterfly stroke swimming skill for 
athletes in the age group of 11-13 years to improve the athletes’ skill in swimming the butterfly stroke. In 
addition, the drill-based exercise model of butterfly stroke swimming skill for athletes in the age group of 11-13 
years makes an application. Thus, swimming coaches can understand model variations more easily which helps 
the them in achieving their goals. 
Model Weaknesses 
The weaknesses of the drill-based exercise model of butterfly stroke swimming skill for athletes in the age 
group of 11-13 years are that each variation of the exercise model is interrelated so that the athletes must master 
variations of the exercise model properly. If one variation of the exercise model cannot be mastered well, it will 
hinder the process of exercise model which is more difficult. The weakness of the drill-based exercise model of 
butterfly stroke swimming skill for athletes in the age group of 11-13 years is that it is arranged with the 
combination of easy-to-difficult movements. Therefore, the athletes must be more focused in the exercise 
process. 
Model Supporting Factors 
The product, that has been developed, aims to increase the chances in achieving the objectives of swimming 
exercise for athletes in the age group of 11-13 years, which is also very beneficial for the coaches. Therefore, it 
indirectly motivated the authors to create the drill-based exercise model of butterfly stroke swimming skill for 
athletes in the age group of 11-13 years. The enthusiasm of a number of swimming clubs that become the 
research setting for small and large group testing made it easy for the researchers to carry out a series of 
research processes and data collection. The swimming competition in the near future motivates the authors to 
complete the drill-based exercise model of butterfly stroke swimming skill for athletes in the age group of 11-13 
years so that some clubs can use this exercise model to increase their butterfly stroke swimming skills. 
Model Inhibiting Factors 
The ability of researchers has been optimal in carrying out this research. However, the researcher found many 
obstacles in the research process as material for consideration in generalizing the determination of research 
findings. The inhibiting factors in the research process are as follows: 
a. 
Field testing waas carried out in 2 areas consisting of 4 clubs including: Bina Taruna, Tirtamerta

b. 
The time for giving the treatment is very limited in order not to disrupt the club’s exercise program. 
c. 
The treatment was not optimal because Tirta Bayu swimming pool was used for training the soldiers. 
d. 
The budget for conducting the research is very limited. 
e. 
Some psychological factors also affect the research findings. 
Factors that cannot be controlled by the researchers include: athletes’ interest, athletes’ trust, and   other

Conclusions 
The drill-based exercise model of butterfly stroke swimming skill for athletes in the age group of      11-13 years 
can be developed and applied in swimming exercise to improve butterfly stroke swimming skill. The exercise 
model is based on the principle of butterfly stroke swimming skills and is very useful as a reference for 
swimming coaches. The swimming model that has been developed contains effective data results. The drill-
based exercise model of butterfly stroke swimming skill for athletes in the age group of 11-13 years is very 
simple, easy to understand and can be applied based on very attractive aspects, variations, and packaging. It can 
be seen from the book product that is equipped with exercise media that make it easier for coaches and athletes 
to understand exercise material and increase effectiveness in the exercise process.

5. Conclusion 
Of the three factors that are most influential and very important consider in the placement of employees in 
structural positions is the performance of work, because this factor has the greatest Eigenvalues value among 
other factors that is equal to 3.900. The results of this is the placement of employees should consider the factors: 
(a) Academic achievement; (b) Experience; (c) Employee's ability; (d) Physical and mental health; (e) Marital 
status; (f) Age.  
The results of this study also in accordance with the opinion of Nawawi (1992) which states that seniority 
consideration alone is not enough, because it will be bad for work organization, especially if the employee is not 
achieving because of low ability. For that seniority must be aligned with job performance. The results of this 
study are also in accordance with the regulations made by the Government on the placement of employees in the 
structural positions set forth in article 6 of Government Regulation No. 100 of 2000 as follows: (a) Seniority in 
rank; (b) Age; (c) Education; (d) Job Training; (e) Experience owned.  
Policymakers need to update data on employee development in their work environment. This is to facilitate 
policy makers in making decisions about the placement of employees in structural positions. For the Regional 
Personnel Officers or the Center in the placement of structural employees should consider the factors contained 
in Government Regulation No. 100 of 2000 article 6, namely 1. Seniority in rank, 2. Age, 3. Education, 4. 
Training positions, 5 Experience owned.

1. Introduction
The Tourism Industry is a sector that the Indonesian government hopes to become a source of foreign exchange 
to continue to increase. A number of strategic breakthroughs issued by the government in the tourism sector in 
the past few months have succeeded in boosting business optimism for the performance of the sector in 2016. 
However, along with the arrival of the opportunity, there are challenges that lurk, including a number of 
homeworks which are of course urgently resolved. . The development of tourism business in Batam in general is 
currently experiencing a growing trend and continues to experience an increase in the number of tourists coming 
so that supporting infrastructure is needed to accommodate and accommodate the increasing number of tourists. 
The hotel is one of the supporting infrastructure that must be there, this is because it is a supporting facility that 
causes tourists to be comfortable in visiting Batam and Batam City in particular. Based on this background, the 
writer is interested in conducting research by taking the title: The Effect of Competence, and Organizational 
Citizenhip Behavior (OCB) on the Performance of Hotel Employees in Batam City with Organizational 
Commitment as Intervening Variables 
These changes will inevitably impact the behavior of the hotel's employees so that it will change the behavior 
and culture of the organization as a whole so that it can be said of individual behavior and is a major factor that 
must be taken into account by the organization in the activities of private organizations or government 
organizations, human resource functions become very important in running and setting organizational goals. 
Behavioral manipulation of individuals is a key resource for every organization and is an indicator for 
measuring success in achieving organizational goals (Mujanah, 2014) 
2. Literature Review

the results of the assessment. Employee training is carried out with the aim that employees have the knowledge, 
abilities and skills in accordance with the demands of the work they do.  An employee who has been given the 
right training will have better skills, the characteristics of employees who have good skills are knowing and 
understanding what to do, having a fast and precise work movement, rarely making mistakes and mistakes in 
work , already have certain tips in carrying out work, and work productivity increases than usual. For 
companies, employee training provides benefits, including companies will be able to adjust to current needs, the 
company will have HR who always appear convincing in carrying out the work, the company will be able to 
answer the challenges of the development of the future, the company can improve employee performance 
individually or in groups , the company's mechanism is more flexible and not rigid in using new technology, and 
companies can prepare employees to occupy higher positions. 
The results of research and testing using SEM with the AMOS v.20 Software also show the influence of 
competence on employee organizational commitment at Four Star Hotels in Batam City. The parameter 
estimation result of the influence of competence on organizational commitment shows significant results with 
CR value greater than 1.96, and the significance value (p-value) is smaller than 5%, so the third hypothesis 
states that competence has a significant effect on employee organizational commitment on Four Star Hotels in 
Batam City, can also be accepted. 
The results of research and testing using SEM with AMOS v.20 Software also showed the influence of OCB on 
employee organizational commitment at Four Star Hotels in Batam City. The parameter estimation results of the 
influence of OCB on organizational commitment show significant results with CR value greater than 1.96, and 
the significance value (p-value) is smaller than 5%, so the fourth hypothesis stating that OCB has a significant 
effect on employee organizational commitment on Four Star Hotels in Batam City, can also be accepted. 
The results of this study are consistent with Yasir's (2012) statement in his research that employees who already 
have excellent competence will certainly have high value so that the company will provide commitment by 
giving employees the necessary rights. Competence is proven to have a positive and significant effect on job 
satisfaction and organizational commitment. 
The results of research and testing using SEM with AMOS v.20 Software also showed the influence of 
organizational commitment on employee performance at Four Star Hotels in Batam City. Parameter estimation

CR value greater than 1.96, and significance value (p-value) is smaller than 5%, so the thirteenth hypothesis 
which states that organizational commitment has a significant effect on performance employees at Four Star 
Hotels in Batam City, can also be accepted. 
The level of commitment both the company's commitment to employees, and between employees and the 
company is very necessary because through these commitments will create a professional work climate. 
Individuals who are satisfied with their work tend to fulfill commitments to the organization, so that the 
emergence of employee commitment to the organization, which ultimately causes the employee to have a sense 
of dependence and responsibility on the organization. Individuals who have low organizational commitment 
tend to do ways that can interfere with organizational performance such as high turnover, lags in work, 
complaints and even strikes.

1. Introduction
Regional development as an integral part of national development indivisible from the principle of local 
autonomy. In implementing local autonomy there is a shift of authority and accountability in allocating resources 
from the central government to the local government. Local autonomy offers a large portion of authority to local 
governments to be able to manage their local finances. Law Number 22 of 1999 concerning Local Government 
stipulate that development of autonomy in the regencies and cities is run by observing the principles of democracy, 
community participation, equity and justice and taking into account the potential and diversity of the regions. One 
aspect of local government that must be regulated thoroughly is the issues of local financial management and local 
income and expenditure budgets [12]. 
Local financial management will have an impact on the economic fate of a region, because regions can progress 
and prosper or vice versa, becoming poor and not prosperous will depend on how an area manages its finances. 
Local management that is run efficiently and effectively will encourage better economic growth which then leads

5. Result And Discussion 
Data analysis result shows that the Local Revenue had a significant effect on Economic Growth in East Java which 
was evident from the t value of 3.109 which means greater than 1.96, so that it can be explained that an increase 
in economic growth in East Java can be formed through the existence of local revenue tall one. The effect of local 
financial performance on public welfare is positive, which shows that the increasing local revenue will increase 
economic growth in East Java. Thus the first hypothesis in this study which reads ""Local Revenue has a significant 
effect on Economic Growth"", can be declared acceptable. 
The results of the data analysis showed that the Local Revenue had a significant effect on the Public welfare in 
East Java which was evident from the t value of 2,337 which means greater than 1.96, so that it can be explained 
that the welfare of the people in East Java can be formed through high local revenue . The effect of local revenue 
on people's welfare is positive which shows that the higher the original regional income, it will be able to improve 
the welfare of the people in East Java. Thus the second hypothesis in this study which reads ""Local Revenue has 
a significant effect on Public Welfare"", can be declared acceptable. 
The findings in this study prove that local income plays an important role in improving public welfare. In other 
words, the public in East Java can be formed through high local revenue. Therefore, if the East Java Government 
wants to improve the welfare of the community, it is necessary to pay attention to the level of local revenue. This 
result is not in line with the findings of research conducted by [22] which prove that Blood Original Income has 
no significant effect on the welfare of society and has a negative direction. 
The results of the data analysis showed that the Public Allocation Fund did not have a significant effect on 
Economic Growth in East Java as evidenced by the t value of 1,385 which means smaller than 1.96, so it can be 
explained that economic growth in East Java may not be increased through allocation funds adequate general. The 
effect of Public Allocation funds on economic growth is positive. Thus the third hypothesis in this study which 
reads ""Public Allocation Funds have a significant effect on Economic Growth"", can be declared not accepted. 
This result is in line with the findings of [22] which prove that DAU has no significant effect on economic growth. 
However, this result is not in line with the findings of research conducted by [20] which prove that the Public 
Allocation Fund has a positive and significant effect on economic growth. 
The results of the data analysis showed that the Public Allocation Fund had a significant effect on Public welfare 
in East Java which was evident from the t value of 2,686 which means greater than 1.96, so that it can be explained 
that the welfare of the people in East Java can be established through adequate Public Allocation funds . The effect 
of the Public Allocation fund on public welfare is positive which indicates that the higher the Public Allocation 
fund that is budgeted, it will improve the welfare of the people in East Java. Thus the fourth hypothesis in this 
study which reads ""Public Allocation Funds have a significant effect on Public Welfare"", can be declared 
acceptable. 
The findings in this study prove that Public Allocation funds have an important role in improving public welfare. 
In other words, public welfare in East Java can be created through high Public Allocation funds. Therefore, if the 
East Java Government wants to improve the welfare of the community it is necessary to pay attention to the level 
of Public Allocation funds. This result is not in line with the findings of research conducted by [22] who found 
that the Public Allocation Fund did not have a significant effect on people's welfare. 
 
6. Conclusion 
Local Revenue has a significant effect on Economic Growth and Public welfare in East Java, Public Allocation 
Fund has no significant effect on Economic Growth but have a significant effect on Public welfare in East Java, 
Profit Sharing Funds have a significant effect on Economic Growth and Public welfare in East Java, and Economic 
growth has a significant effect on Public welfare in East Java.
